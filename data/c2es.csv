The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

'People want the gasoline car'

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats' efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,'' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. ""We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

""Trump is taking a wrecking ball to the biggest single step any nation has ever taken to combat oil use, global warming pollution, and helping save consumers money at the gas pump,"" Dan Becker, an activist with the Center for Biological Diversity, told AFP.

At stake are the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, created in 1975 in response to the Arab oil embargo, which require vehicles to achieve the ""maximum feasible"" mileage per gallon.

Under the proposed rule, the administration would roll back past and planned efficiency increases, targeting a fleetwide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031 -- ""no better than what American cars are getting today,"" said Becker, noting CAFE figures overstate real-world mileage by roughly 25 percent.

Trump's Department of Transport argues that Biden officials improperly factored in electric and hybrid vehicles, saying the standards would be unattainable for gasoline-powered cars and would effectively force a shift in the market.

Gina McCarthy, a former senior official under Biden and Barack Obama, countered the move would not only worsen climate change but harm the auto industry by slowing its shift to electric vehicles.

""The rest of the world will continue to innovate and create cleaner cars that people want to buy and drive, while we're forced to sit in our clunkers, paying more for gas, and pumping out more tailpipe emissions.""

Trump EV fight

Trump has railed against what he calls an EV ""mandate"" -- a stance that puts him at odds with his on-again, off-again billionaire ally Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO whose company still dominates the US EV market.

Republicans in Congress have repealed clean-energy tax credits in a major tax and spending bill, and targeted California's ability to set its own vehicle-emission limits.

Throughout 2025, GM and other US automakers have curtailed or pushed back new EV plant capacity.

But whether savings from reduced EV investment will filter through to consumers remains unclear.

While the shift away from EVs does allow automakers to delay or forego billions of dollars in new investments, some funds are being steered into new initiatives to add US carbuilding capacity in light of Trump's tariffs.

""Meeting high fuel economy standards has been challenging for the auto industry and has added to vehicle cost,"" Charlie Chesbrough, an analyst with Cox Automotive, told AFP.

""However, consumers like fuel-efficient vehicles. This year traditional hybrids are up double digits from last year while gas vehicles are basically flat,"" he added.

""Since most consumers don't have transportation alternatives available, people fear high gas prices. And good MPG is a way to mitigate that risk.""

By state law (7 Del. Code §6042), DNREC withholds a portion of the money collected through fines and penalties for environmental violations and returns it to communities where the violations occurred. The funding is awarded as competitive grants to organizations to support community environmental projects. The CEPF supports projects that mitigate pollution, enhance the environment or create recreational opportunities for affected communities.

House Bill 210, the Pollution Accountability Act, passed in the 2025 legislative session and signed by Gov. Matt Meyer, increased the percentage of penalty funds that are returned to communities from 25% to 40%. The new law also gives preference to projects located within two miles of where an environmental violation occurred.

Since 2004, this program has invested about $4.41 million in 119 community projects across Delaware. Of CEPF grants awarded over that time, 37% focused on environmental enhancement, 33.6% created new recreational opportunities and 29.4% addressed pollution mitigation.

“This program has invested millions of dollars in communities environmental projects, with a focus on those impacted by nearby environmental violations,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “Over the next few years, we can expect to see even more investment of penalty funds in areas that have experienced potential environmental harm – areas that also have traditionally been underserved and underrepresented.”

The DNREC Office of Environmental Justice, which manages the CEPF grant program, received 48 applications for 2026 funding.

“The number of applications is indicative of the level of interest community groups and individuals have in taking action to ensure clean air and water, to improve their quality of life and to protect the environment now and for future generations,” said Dr. Katera Moore, DNREC’s environmental justice coordinator.

The 10 projects receiving CEPF grants for 2026 are listed on the de.gov/cepf webpage.

Maria Payan, executive director of the Sussex Health and Environmental Network (SHEN), said the funding her organization received in 2025 for the CLEAR (Clean Living with Effective Access to Reverse Osmosis) Project shows that great things can be accomplished when communities, organizations and state agencies work together.

“For well over a decade, these residents have lived without the ability to pour a clean glass of water from their tap,” Ms. Payan said. “For those of us who have access to clean drinking water, it’s difficult to understand the toll this takes on a family.

“Families have told us they are now showering without rashes and able to safely give their children and pets clean drinking water without the burden of lugging 40-pound water jugs around. We’d like to give a very special thank you from SHEN and the communities we serve to DNREC and its professionals, Dr. Katera Moore and Antonio Bivins, who made this project possible and helped to transform the lives of families in need in Sussex County.”

Matt Meyer, increased the percentage of penalty funds that are returned to communities from 25% to 40%. The new law also gives preference to projects located within two miles of where an environmental violation occurred.

Since 2004, this program has invested about $4.41 million in 119 community projects across Delaware. Of CEPF grants awarded over that time, 37% focused on environmental enhancement, 33.6% created new recreational opportunities and 29.4% addressed pollution mitigation.

“This program has invested millions of dollars in communities environmental projects, with a focus on those impacted by nearby environmental violations,” said DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson. “Over the next few years, we can expect to see even more investment of penalty funds in areas that have experienced potential environmental harm – areas that also have traditionally been underserved and underrepresented.”

The DNREC Office of Environmental Justice, which manages the CEPF grant program, received 48 applications for 2026 funding.

“The number of applications is indicative of the level of interest community groups and individuals have in taking action to ensure clean air and water, to improve their quality of life and to protect the environment now and for future generations,” said Dr. Katera Moore, DNREC’s environmental justice coordinator.

The 10 projects receiving CEPF grants for 2026 are listed on the de.gov/cepf webpage.

Maria Payan, executive director of the Sussex Health and Environmental Network (SHEN), said the funding her organization received in 2025 for the CLEAR (Clean Living with Effective Access to Reverse Osmosis) Project shows that great things can be accomplished when communities, organizations and state agencies work together.

“For well over a decade, these residents have lived without the ability to pour a clean glass of water from their tap,” Ms. Payan said. “For those of us who have access to clean drinking water, it’s difficult to understand the toll this takes on a family.

“Families have told us they are now showering without rashes and able to safely give their children and pets clean drinking water without the burden of lugging 40-pound water jugs around. We’d like to give a very special thank you from SHEN and the communities we serve to DNREC and its professionals, Dr. Katera Moore and Antonio Bivins, who made this project possible and helped to transform the lives of families in need in Sussex County.”

Information about past projects can be found on the de.gov/cepf webpage.

The European Union has reached a deal to phase out Russian gas faster than originally planned, a move that aims to finally sever ties between the bloc and its once-primary energy supplier.

In the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, traders and energy companies have closely monitored the EU’s shift away from Russia toward alternative suppliers such as the US and the Middle East. But while Europe halved purchases after the war began in 2022, Russian gas has continued to account for roughly a fifth of imports.

Negotiators representing member states, the European Parliament and the European Commission cut that remaining link in the early hours of Wednesday, agreeing to gradually prohibit liquefied natural gas imports from Moscow by the end of 2026. That’s a year earlier than originally proposed by the Commission and in line with a ban on seaborne deliveries already approved by the EU under its latest sanctions package on Russia.

Gas Ties

Pipeline gas imports under long-term deals will have to halt by Sept. 30, 2027, with a possibility of an extension to Nov. 1, 2027, depending on fulfillment of gas storage targets set by the EU. That compares with an end-2027 ban on those contracts originally put forward by the commission.

“Finally, and for good, we are turning off the tap on Russian gas,” EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen said on X. “Europe has chosen energy security and independence. We will never go back to volatile supplies and market manipulation.”

The EU had proposed the measure in June to address risks to its energy security after the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent curbs on gas flows to the bloc.

The US has sought to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and speculation that a potential agreement could eventually ease sanctions on Russian energy has contributed to benchmark European gas futures recording their longest downward streak in almost four years.

But the EU has continued to push its plan, known as RePowerEU, to cut reliance on Moscow for good.

Going back to Russian supplies would be “a mistake” for the region, Fatih Birol, executive director for the International Energy Agency, told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “Russia being the major energy supplier in Europe — that saga is gone, that chapter is closed.”

“This is a big win for us and for all of Europe,” said Lars Aagaard, energy minister for Denmark, which is holding the EU’s rotating presidency and was representing member states in the talks. “We have to put an end to the EU’s dependence on Russian gas, and banning it in the EU permanently is a major step in the right direction.”

The EU receives about 15% of its LNG supplies from Moscow, making Russia the second-largest provider of the fuel to Europe after the US. The monthly bill for those imports ranges between €500 million and €700 million.

The shift away from that trade comes at a time of plentiful supply. The global gas market is expected to start shifting into a surplus in the second half of next year, reducing the risk that an EU phaseout of Russian shipments would put pressure on supplies and drive up prices. That’s helped secure broad political support in the region for a comprehensive and lasting break with Russia.

Europe has also been under pressure from the US to speed up moves to sever its energy ties with Moscow, and buy more American LNG. A trade deal between Europe and the US agreed earlier this year included a commitment to purchase $750 billion in US energy by 2028.

Under the deal on RePowerEU, the phaseout of Russian gas would start with a ban on new purchases from the beginning of next year, with exemptions for existing deals.

For LNG, short-term contracts concluded before June 17, 2025 will be prohibited as of April 25, 2026, the date on which EU sanctions on seaborne deliveries kick in. Pipeline gas brought into the region under short-term deals will be banned as of June 17, 2026.

To avoid circumvention, the measure introduces a prior authorization regime, the EU Council representing member states said in a statement.

For Russian gas and imports in the transition period, information required for authorization will have to be submitted at least one month before entry. For non-Russian gas, it will have to be provided at least five days before and seven days for volumes brought in via the Strandzha 1 interconnection point.

That requirement will not apply to major gas-producing countries that exported more than 5 billion cubic meters to the EU in 2024, and either have restrictions on Russian gas or no infrastructure to import.

To put an end to Russian oil imports, the measure obliges member states to prepare plans to diversify their supplies. The commission also plans to put forward a legislative proposal on phasing out Russian oil imports no later than the end of 2027.

The deal reached in the so-called trilogue format will need to be formally approved by member states and the European Parliament and published in the bloc’s bulletin to become a law.

The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has allowed a large part of the American population to get access to healthcare who didn’t have access before. Former President Obama’s initial draft of the healthcare bill was far superior to what actually passed. Insurance companies got involved and weakened the legislation. At least it was a start.

The Affordable Care Act was never meant to be the end-all solution. Its purpose was always the first step to eventual universal healthcare. In the U.S., we spend more than other nations on our healthcare and get subpar quality care compared to other industrialized countries.

We need universal healthcare now.

The Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) five year offshore leasing plan is more than a procedural update; it is a path forward that can bring back predictability to one America’s most critical energy engines.

The five-year offshore oil and gas program, required under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), should have been in place since July 1, 2022 when the previous plan expired. However, it was more than a year later (September 29, 2023) before the Biden administration published its draft final 2024-2029 plan, which included the lowest number of auctions in the program’s history.

DOI announced a Secretary’s Order titled “Unleashing American Offshore Energy that terminates the 2023-2029 plan, and published the first draft of a revised 2026-2031 plan which includes 34 proposed sales across the Gulf of America and coasts of Alaska and California.

When offshore exploration projects stall, it creates a cascade effect, freezing multi-year investments, and halting thousands of jobs and economic benefits. As Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) President and CEO Edith Naegele underscored in a statement:

“A robust Five-Year Plan is essential to U.S. national security needs as it reduces our dependence on foreign oil, ensures a stable domestic energy supply, and supports hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Independent oil and natural gas producers commend the Trump Administration on its thoughtful first iteration of the national OCS oil and gas leasing program, commonly referred to as the Five-Year Plan. As designed by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), Five-Year Plans have a vigorous multi-iteration development process with several steps for analysis and extensive public comment. IPAA strongly supports broad inclusion of all OCS areas to ensure areas of high interest make it into the final plan. This will ensure a competitive bidding process among producers which ensures a good return to the American people via billions of dollars paid annually to the U.S. Treasury.”

The Latest Plan – Expanding Offshore Energy Potential.

The draft OCS leasing program spans the years 2026-2031, and will include as many as 34 potential offshore lease sales. Notably, the proposed lease sales includes federal waters off the coasts of California and Florida, which haven’t seen new offshore oil and gas development in decades.

Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, lauded the DOI and BOEM’s move to expand the areas where lease sales are available. Milito told POLITICO:

“We need to make sure we’re not missing out on potential strategic opportunities 10, 15, 20 years down the road, because the production we have now is because of decisions we made 10, 15 years ago.”

The complete breakdown of proposed leases includes 21 areas off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Gulf of America, and six along the Pacific coast. Alaska’s lease sales are proposed to start in 2026, with the remaining sales in the Gulf and Pacific to commence in 2027. In addition to the leasing program, the DOI has confirmed it will hold four lease sales in the next twelve months: one in December 2025, two in March 2026, and one in August 2026.

This is especially exciting on the heels of recent BOEM analysis that estimated the Gulf of America has an additional 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent since the Bureau’s 2021 report, bringing the total reserve estimate over seven billion barrels of oil equivalent.

Offshore Oil Product Is a Cornerstone to US Energy Security

The Gulf of America produced roughly 1.8 million barrels per day of crude oil in 2024, nearly 15 percent of total U.S. crude output. Without consistent offshore leasing, those volumes inevitably decline, lowering America’s production capacity. That decline does not make global energy demand disappear; it simply shifts demand to other producing countries to fill the gap.

Recent years have been marked by global energy uncertainty. Supply disruptions from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions have strained markets and driven price volatility. In 2024, the International Energy Forum reported that while upstream investment has recovered since the pandemic, it remains below the level needed to meet demand through 2030, with about $740 billion per year required to ensure energy security. These challenges show what policymakers already know: energy security begins at home.

As Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum noted earlier this year:

“The Gulf of America is a powerhouse, and by streamlining permitting and expanding access, we’re not just powering our economy—we’re strengthening our national security and putting thousands of Americans back to work.”

Jobs, Revenues and Economic Benefits

The economic ripple effects of offshore activity extend far beyond the platforms themselves. Over the past two decades, offshore energy production in the Gulf of America has produced nearly $150 billion in total revenue for the United States, coastal states, and their parishes and counties.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. offshore sector supported 270,000 jobs in 2024 and average around 354,000 jobs each year through 2040. Most of these jobs are across the gulf states of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, creating thousands of local jobs for welders, engineers, crane operators and small-business suppliers all supporting the offshore industry.

This is in part because the Gulf of America is an essential supply-chain hub. Many rigs, fabrication yards, shipyards and service companies are clustered in the Gulf region, which means lease sales help maintain not just production, but the industry that supports it.

Every lease sale brings in billions of dollars in federal revenue, part of which flows directly back to states and local governments through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA). Those dollars fund coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure upgrades helping the same communities that make American energy possible. The state of Louisiana has used offshore dollars to restore barrier islands and rebuild natural storm buffers.

Every postponed lease sale and delayed approval chips away at America’s competitiveness. Offshore projects require 10 to 15 years from exploration to first production, so uncertainty today means reduced output in the 2030s. A predictable five-year plan signals to investors that the U.S. is open for business and willing to compete globally for market share, offshore technology and thousands of jobs.

Bottom Line: A Predictable Offshore Future Helps Power American Energy

The five-year offshore leasing plan is not just about drilling, it’s about direction. For years, the absence of a clear plan has undermined America’s commitment to energy leadership. By publishing a strong, balanced program, the administration can secure domestic supply, protect consumers from volatility, fund coastal resilience and keep American workers leading the world in what we do best safe and responsible offshore production.

When the United States invests in its own energy future, Americans not only win at the pump, but also ensure a reliable and secure energy supply to meet the nation’s growing energy needs.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2025-12-03 22:01:36.993658

By Jake Schwartz

As we confront the aftermath of a disastrous COP30, we not only face a warming planet, but we also find ourselves approaching a crisis of hope. With new projections showing that our planet will warm to 2.5C over pre-industrial levels – a full degree over the Paris Agreement goal – and the United States nowhere to be seen, it is now clear: there is no one coming to save us.

I am a lifelong climate activist working for Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a national progressive advocacy group that was intimately involved in passing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For the cynics among us, the afternoon the IRA was signed into law was a sad one. As much as it did, anyone who could do the math knew it didn’t do enough, quickly enough, to avoid the worst of the coming climate disasters.

But not everything is doom and gloom. Clean energy technology is becoming more efficient, despite the Trump administration eviscerating tax credits and crippling projects. Carbon capture technologies, too, have developed at a startling rate, and climate scientists largely agree that they need to be part of the solution. However, those same scientists admit that these technologies will not be scaled up in time to help us avert the climate tipping points that we are rapidly approaching. We are already hitting tipping points that we thought were decades away. Many of them, such as melting permafrost in the Arctic, release more carbon and perpetuate the climate crisis, further lowering the odds of preventing the worst-case scenario.

So what other tools are at our disposal when – not if – temperatures continue to rise? Hundreds of climate scientists from around the world, including one of America’s most influential climate scientists, James Hansen, believe that solar geoengineering may be the only tool that could allow us to avoid these tipping points.

Simply put, geoengineering, or sunlight reflective methods (SRM), is the concept of using a light-reflecting aerosol, such as those found in volcanic eruptions, to reflect 1-2% of sunlight in the stratosphere back into space. This could temporarily cool the Earth while we are still phasing out fossil fuels. The concept isn’t new: American scientists have been thinking about it since Benjamin Franklin speculated that a volcanic eruption in Iceland was the reason Paris was so brisk in 1784.

Critics often warn that SRM poses a moral hazard, arguing it could reduce the incentive to cut emissions. But the global energy market is already decarbonizing: clean energy is now cheaper and will soon outcompete fossil fuels entirely. However, around the world, climate policy is stalling. We may be winning the long-term battle, but we are losing on the timescale that matters most for people already facing extreme heat, droughts, and displacement. So, what progress are we really risking by considering SRM?

As climate justice advocates, our moral priority should be protecting those communities today. If SRM can help prevent dangerous tipping points while we continue to decarbonize, it deserves serious consideration.

There are many other questions that SRM researchers need to answer – and it is time we devote public resources to determine what they are. At the same time, climate justice organizations must lead the way in creating a governance framework that puts the most vulnerable countries in the driver’s seat for conversations around SRM.

Bill Gates made some misleading statements in his recent treatise on why the climate needs to be deprioritized, but he was right about one thing: the top priority for the climate movement should be the human impacts of climate change. We activists cannot succumb to groupthink or complacency – all ideas should be on the table.

If scientists find that SRM can save more lives than breaching climate tipping points would take, and governance experts create a system where vulnerable countries can lead this conversation, then it is time for the climate movement to challenge our own orthodoxy. Especially as scientists discuss SRM methods that could be deployed specifically to prevent tipping points, SRM begins to look more plausible than many in the climate movement realize.

The recent COP summit in Brazil reminded us that another crisis we face is one of imagination. Let us not shy away from bold measures that could save us from a failure we have spent our entire lives fighting against. The stakes are simply too high.

Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand.","Electricity markets used to be predictable. In 2025, they’re anything but.

Coal is enjoying a revival, natural gas generation is down, and renewables are forging ahead despite political headwinds. Some of that is driven by annual idiosyncrasies like weather, which increased electricity demand this year, and President Donald Trump’s dismantling of environmental regulations and the Inflation Reduction Act.

But most of the market’s upheaval is due to wider economic trends that burst into full view this year. Namely: the growth in U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas and rising electricity demand from data centers.

“I feel like we’re at the edge of the storm,” Ric O’Connell, the executive director of the consulting firm GridLab, told me. “The storm is the load growth that is showing up in the next couple of years. The IRA is going away, and gas prices are potentially going to spike. The next couple of years could be messy.”

The trends mark a fundamental shift from the previous decade, which was defined by stagnant power demand, low natural gas prices, coal plant retirements and a wave of renewable installations.

Firing up coal

Coal generation was up 13 percent through the end of September compared with the same time last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Part of the increase is due to a cold winter and hot summer, said Andy Blumenfeld, an analyst who tracks coal markets at the consulting company McCloskey by OPIS.

But high natural gas prices and growing demand for electricity are playing a bigger role in stoking demand for coal. Last year, natural gas prices averaged $2.20 per million British thermal units. This year, gas prices are on track to average $3.50 per million BTU.

When utilities see gas prices like that, they tend to fire up coal.

Coal has enjoyed mini-revivals before, most recently in 2022. What makes this year different is that coal’s rebound is playing out at a time when the U.S. is shipping more gas abroad while demand for power grows at home.

American LNG shipments are expected to increase 25 percent this year, putting upward pressure on domestic natural gas prices.

Power-hungry AI

At the same time, technology companies and data center developers are hoovering up all the megawatts they can find.

Analysts predict the artificial intelligence boom will need 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, drastically driving up U.S. energy demand. Electricity demand nationwide was up 2 percent through the first nine months of the year, according to EIA data.

All that is a recipe for generating electricity from coal plants that once sat idle. In 2023 and 2024, coal plants ran at 42 percent of their capacity. This year, they are running at almost half-capacity.

But even as coal has enjoyed a rebound, it still lags behind renewables. Wind and solar generated 646 terawatt-hours of electricity in the U.S. through September, eclipsing the 561 TWh produced by coal. Gas, meanwhile, was down 4 percent to almost 1,384 TWh.

The strong renewable numbers stem in large part from another strong year for solar installations. But O’Connell expects those numbers to fall starting in 2027 because of Trump’s moves to end clean energy tax credits and make it more difficult to build wind and solar projects.

“Those are going to be felt in five years when projects that should have come online don’t come online,” O’Connell said.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Brian Dabbs breaks down how the Trump administration is releasing federal energy assistance as it proposes to dismantle the program.

Power Centers

Fuel economy rollback

Trump announced today that he plans to scrap Biden-era fuel economy rules for cars and trucks, in his latest move to wind back policies that benefit electric cars and cut planet-warming emissions.

The administration is proposing to scrap rules that require cars to get 50.4 mpg by model year 2031 — and replace them with standards that only require a fleetwide average fuel economy of 34.5 mpg by that year, Jean Chemnick writes. Cars now get an average of 24.4 mpg, according to the Department of Energy.

Trump aides are promoting the changes as a way to make cars more affordable, as rising consumer costs plague Republicans in the polls, writes Chris Marquette. But environmentalists say the move will mean Americans pay more for gasoline, and industry analysts say easing fuel economy requirements is unlikely to decrease new vehicle prices. Factors like tariffs, supply chain issues and the increasing size of vehicles play more of a role in sticker shock, they say.

Alaskan pushback on Trump’s offshore drilling plan

Alaska’s Republican senators have reached out to the Interior Department about plans to lease parcels of the state’s waters for oil drilling, Amelia Davidson writes.

Interior’s five-year plan, released last month, included plans for expanded drilling in the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as Alaskan waters including the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in the Arctic region. But Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan said they’d prefer the department expanded drilling in the Cook Inlet in southern Alaska.

Sullivan told Amelia he had already brought his concerns to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

“He was listening,” Sullivan said of Burgum. “I mean, what they wanted to do was put out an expansive plan and then they’re going to listen. I told him it was very important to listen to the communities.”

Democrats embrace natural gas

Leaders in New England are opening up to new gas projects after spending a decade trying to curb their reliance on it — even as three major clean energy projects near completion, your host writes.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) has talked about building pipelines, while lawmakers in Massachusetts flirted with weighing down their climate goals. It’s a response to rising electricity prices — and the long and complicated slog of building two offshore wind projects and a transmission line for Canadian hydropower in an increasingly difficult political climate.

“Time is already a nonrenewable resource, but then you recognize that the more time it takes to build any of this stuff, the more uncertainty you’re exposed to,” said Ben Downing, a former Democratic Massachusetts state senator who authored a landmark clean energy bill in 2016. “I think that if there’s one consistent theme throughout the last decade, it’s that.”

In Other News

Still bad, though: The journal Nature retracted a study today that predicted climate change would cause far more economic damage than previous estimates had suggested. When data flaws were corrected, the study’s prediction of a 62 percent decline in economic output by 2100 decreased to a 23 percent decline.

Corn’s climate cost: Corn comes with a heavy climate impact because its growth relies on the use of fertilizer that releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, when it breaks down in the soil.

Burgum blamed state policies for high electricity bills — and called California and New England a “national security risk” — while speaking at the North American Gas Forum in Washington.

CleanChoice Energy customers in Massachusetts sued the company, accusing it of overcharging for electricity and claiming to use wind and solar when it was instead buying renewable energy credits.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright wants to use backup generators to add power to the electricity grid, in a bid to lower Americans’ utility bills.

About Oklahoma State University Oklahoma State University is a modern land-grant university that prepares students for success.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma--(Newsfile Corp. - December 3, 2025) - The Hamm Institute for American Energy announced Wednesday that energy and technology analyst Mark P. Mills has been appointed Distinguished Fellow and will join the institute's Advisory Board, where he will contribute research for the American Energy + AI Initiative on the real-world power required to support AI and data center growth.

Mills is executive director of the National Center for Energy Analytics and a contributing editor at City Journal. He also serves as a faculty fellow at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. Over the course of his career, Mills has testified before Congress numerous times and briefed state public-service commissions and legislators. Most recently, he testified about AI and data centers before the House Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs in April 2025.

His first project for the Hamm Institute, a new joint study titled ""The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts,"" provides one of the most detailed looks to date at how surging AI deployment will shape electricity demand, fuel use and the broader economy.

""AI will be one of the most power-hungry technologies in history, and Mark's work gives utilities, policymakers and investors a clear forecast of what that means in practice,"" said Dr. Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute. ""His analysis grounds the American Energy + AI Initiative in facts about generation, infrastructure and timing, not slogans. We are honored to have him as both a distinguished scholar and advisor as we map out a path to reliable, affordable power for the AI era.""

Mills' report, released at the institute's recent American Energy + AI Summit in Washington, D.C., quantifies the scale and pace of new generation and infrastructure needed if the United States wants to meet AI-driven demand without sacrificing reliability or economic competitiveness.

""Artificial intelligence is driving the most significant structural shift in the U.S. economy in decades. Spending on data center construction now outpaces the spending in the entire commercial office building sector,"" Mills said. ""And, with power demands for individual data centers reaching city-scale levels, the nation faces an urgent need for far more energy, and supplying it quickly and reliably.

""If AI delivers on the key promise of boosting productivity, over the coming decade the nation will see GDP expand by some $10 trillion more than current, anemic, forecasts — but only if we allow the building of the power infrastructure required. Enabling AI's promises means expanding, not constraining, our energy systems.""

As a Distinguished Fellow and Advisory Board member, Mills will:

Provide the energy demand and power capacity portfolio of the American Energy + AI Initiative, including follow-on studies and briefings for utilities, regulators and investors.

Advise the Hamm Institute on research priorities and metrics that reflect real-world power system constraints.

Support the institute's workforce efforts by turning demand forecasts into clear guidance for universities, training programs and employers on the skills and roles needed to build and operate AI-era power systems.

The American Energy + AI Initiative, led by the Hamm Institute, is focused on near-term solutions to deliver the power required for AI-scale data centers and advanced manufacturing, while strengthening U.S. and allied energy security. Mills' research will serve as the initiative's baseline forecast of AI-driven electricity demand and the generation, fuel and infrastructure needed to meet it.

The full study, produced in partnership with the National Center for Energy Analytics, ""The Rise of AI: A Reality Check on Energy and Economic Impacts,"" is available on the Hamm Institute's website.

The group is calling on DTE for a more transparent contract process between developers of a major data center project and the utility company.

Protesters noted concerns over pollution, higher electrical costs and the impact on the environment.

""I'm so angry about the way this is being thrust upon us, especially with the size of it; it's being the biggest one in the U.S.,"" said Sarah Brabbs, who lives near the proposed data center site. ""It's not like we don't know the impact of these; we have enough data that it's ridiculous, incompetent and irresponsible to steward our land and our resources this way.""

A 1.4 gigawatt center is still being discussed, even after it was initially denied by the township. Developer, Related Digital, and property owners launched a lawsuit, which the municipality settled, with some allocations of money for the community in exchange for allowing the project to move forward.

""The most profitable avenue for companies like DTE involves giving these data centers cut-rate rates on electricity and charging everybody else more to pay for that infrastructure, with the only possible result is that every rate payer in Michigan is just worse off,"" said Chris Gilmer-Hill, who attended the protest.

On Tuesday, CBS News Detroit talked with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who said she is encouraging residents to put pressure on the Michigan Public Service Commission to scrutinize deals between DTE and the developers and call for a more transparent process ahead of the agency's next scheduled meeting.

""The thing that I think most upsets me is the way they just ran over residents, you know, all these data centers, just it's like whack-a-mole in Michigan,"" said Brabbs.

Our toll system is a bit odd -- there are only one or two toll booths in the state that aren't in the Chicago area, and, in theory, our toll roads were only supposed to be toll roads until they were paid off -- and yet they continue to exist as toll roads and not freeways.
So I may be a bit biased based on experience here, but I don't love the Illinois toll system.
And the toll roads and turnpikes in neighboring Indiana and Ohio haven't always treated me well.
Should we keep toll roads, even if we get incidents like the one I reported yesterday?","Regular readers/podcast listeners will know I lean left politically, but one area I've found common cause with the libertarian set is on toll roads. The logic -- only those who use this road should pay for its maintenance -- makes sense to me, though I also understand that logistics mean that that logic can only apply to limited-access highways.

On the other hand, I've lived 99 percent of my life in Northeast Illinois. Our toll system is a bit odd -- there are only one or two toll booths in the state that aren't in the Chicago area, and, in theory, our toll roads were only supposed to be toll roads until they were paid off -- and yet they continue to exist as toll roads and not freeways.

Let's not even talk about my brief rebellion against this system in my 20s -- let's just say it didn't work.

So I may be a bit biased based on experience here, but I don't love the Illinois toll system. And the toll roads and turnpikes in neighboring Indiana and Ohio haven't always treated me well. Not to mention the cost can pile up when you are driving all the way across a state.

On the other hand, the logic of charging only those drivers who use the road, should, in theory, make sense.

So, what do you say? Should we keep toll roads, even if we get incidents like the one I reported yesterday? Should we get rid of toll roads under the assumption that just about all drivers will use the freeways once in a while, so it's still fair to tax those folks or charge them via whatever means roads are funded near you? Should we only toll tunnels and bridges?

This may get political, so you've been warned -- play nice or get banned. We do read the comments.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May.
Company officials say having dedicated, efficient generation will help ensure the data center — and other customers — receive reliable power.
Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center.
“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May.","Entergy Louisiana has broken ground on two new natural gas power plants in Richland Parish, part of a wider plan to support Meta’s upcoming data center and modernize the utility’s generation fleet.

Company officials said Monday that the combined-cycle combustion turbine (CCCT) facilities — together expected to produce about 1,500 megawatts of natural gas generation capacity — will improve reliability, lower emissions, and help integrate more renewable energy over time.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

The larger project, known as the Franklin Farms Power Station, was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission (PSC) in August and is billed as a major economic catalyst for north Louisiana.

Entergy estimates the initiative will generate billions in capital investment and support thousands of construction and technology jobs in the region. PSC Commissioner Foster Campbell, who represents the area, called the groundbreaking “a bright day for northeast Louisiana.”

The plants are also central to Entergy’s agreement to serve Meta’s roughly $800-million data center, one of the largest economic development projects in the region’s history.

Meta expects its facility to support more than 5,000 construction jobs and about 500 permanent operational jobs once completed.

Company officials say having dedicated, efficient generation will help ensure the data center — and other customers — receive reliable power.

Additionally, Entergy said all customers will directly benefit from the arrangement.

Under the 15-year agreement, Meta will pay the full cost of the energy infrastructure needed to serve the site and contribute to systemwide costs, including storm recovery.

Entergy estimates these contributions will save its customers about $650 million and reduce storm-related charges by roughly 10 percent.

The new CCCT facilities’ next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service, the company said.

“I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project,” said May during the groundbreaking.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers.

In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers across the state.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future — one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, he added, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2696887997.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 20:01:04.459240

The major U.S. car companies have already invested billions of dollars to produce electric vehicles and batteries.
The plans could raise more questions about a second strike on a boat on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors of a first strike.

The president said he would significantly scale back the Biden administration’s effort to spur the sale of battery-powered vehicles and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The move would effectively gut one of the country’s most significant efforts to address climate change.

Trump said that his proposal, which is set to be finalized next year, would save Americans $109 billion over five years and shave $1,000 off the average cost of a new car. The new policy frees automakers to sell more pickups and sport utility vehicles, which are usually much more profitable than smaller cars.

Environmentalists criticized Trump’s decision. Carmakers publicly praised the announcement, though some have privately fretted that they are being shuffled around by conflicting policies. The major U.S. car companies have already invested billions of dollars to produce electric vehicles and batteries.

The C.E.O. of General Motors told my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin today that the company would continue to develop motors that are fuel-efficient and cleaner, even if federal standards no longer required them to do so. She was one of roughly a dozen guests at this year’s DealBook Summit. See what Scott Bessent, Gavin Newsom, Erika Kirk and others said in their interviews.

In other climate news: A prestigious science journal retracted a study that predicted that climate change would cause catastrophic economic damage by the end of the century.

Under the plans, the military would attempt to rescue helpless survivors — whom it would be a war crime to target — but it would try to kill them if they took what the U.S. deemed to be a hostile action, like communicating with suspected cartel members.

The plans could raise more questions about a second strike on a boat on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors of a first strike. One survivor radioed for help, the U.S. officials said. Adm. Frank Bradley, the operation’s commander, interpreted the purported communications as meaning that the survivors were still in the fight, and ordered the second strike.

In other Trump administration news:

A Pentagon investigator’s report concluded that Hegseth’s use of Signal risked endangering U.S. troops.

Trump said that he would pardon Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democratic lawmaker from Texas who was awaiting trial on charges that he and his wife had taken roughly $600,000 worth of bribes.

People are giving their medical records to A.I. bots

Millions of people around the world are using chatbots to better understand their health. Some — including more than a dozen who spoke to The Times — are uploading their personal health information and asking the A.I. bots to help them make medical decisions. One woman told us it seemed like the only way she could get answers.

My colleague Kyle Buchanan is always plugged into the whispers around Oscar voting. This year, he sees just five sure bets to earn nominations for best picture: “One Battle After Another,” “Sinners,” “Hamnet,” “Sentimental Value” and the still-to-come “Marty Supreme.”

As for the other five slots? It’s anyone’s guess, Kyle explained, so he’s got a lot of guesses.

The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.
New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

Preparations

Emergency Notifications — Register or update your information in OC Alerts to be notified about water, sewer and other emergencies in your area. Select “Hillsborough water and sewer” under the Community Alerts section of the registration. The alerts system uses the Everbridge platform.

Service Providers — Know who provides services to your home. Contact your providers if you experience power or communications outages. Phone numbers for several providers are listed on the town’s Ready Hillsborough page.

Emergency Kit — In an emergency, your household may be without water or access to stores. Build a family emergency kit with supplies for at least 72 hours. See the Build a Kit section on the Ready Hillsborough page for details.

Protect Your Pipes

Pipes in unheated areas have the greatest chance of freezing. For information on insulating or heating pipes, see the Cold Weather Resources page.

If you have a backflow prevention assembly, protect it with pipe insulation, an insulated cover, or a heat lamp and heat trace tape. See the Backflow Prevention page for more information on protecting these devices in winter.

Report water line breaks and other water-related emergencies immediately by calling the Hillsborough Water Treatment Plant at 919-732-3621 any time. Call a plumber for pipes that break inside or under your house.

Fire Safety

If your heat is not working, go to a friend or family member’s home if possible.

Do not use generators, grills, camp stoves or other gasoline- or charcoal-burning devices inside a home, basement or garage or near a window. These devices create carbon monoxide gas, which is poisonous.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""
That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""","The Trump administration has started the process of dramatically easing fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, part of the administration's broader pivot away from cleaner cars.

At the White House on Wednesday, surrounded by the executives from several major car companies, President Trump said the move would save consumers money by making cars cheaper.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards. ""And all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems for automakers.""

Previous research from Consumer Reports has challenged the argument that regulations make cars more expensive. Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.

CAFE standards require that the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a given automaker, on average, get more fuel-efficient over time. Automakers who fall short have previously needed to either pay hefty fines, or buy credits from a company that over-performs on efficiency, like Tesla and other all-electric automakers.

The Trump administration has already defanged the existing CAFE standards by eliminating the fines associated with them, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under Former President Joe Biden, the rules called for vehicles to get 2% more efficient every year; the Trump administration is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline and increase by .5% annually.

The proposed change now enters a period of public comment; the Department of Transportation will collect input from companies and citizens before finalizing the rule.

The administration has already been working to roll back tailpipe standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which are designed to cut pollution from vehicles. The two sets of rules have overlapping effects, with both of them pushing automakers toward cleaner vehicles.

Meanwhile, during the second Trump presidency Congress has also eliminated the consumer tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, decided to end a tax credit for installing an EV charger in June 2026, earlier than planned, and voted to strike down federal waivers that let California require automakers to build zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration also temporarily delayed a program to use federal money to build a high-speed EV charger network.

The policy shift was no surprise. Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.

Trump has framed the policy rollback as a gift to the auto industry. And that's partially true: Large trucks and SUVs may be inefficient, but they're popular and profitable, and selling more of them without any penalty is a financial boon to automakers. In earnings calls this fall, multiple executives noted that the regulatory rollback will boost earnings and help offset the cost of tariffs.

Electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. has moved slower than automakers had expected. Some automakers have said made some of the Biden-era policies not just challenging but unworkable.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""

But automakers are also navigating a changing global market, with many countries continuing to prioritize climate action. The popularity of high-quality, affordable Chinese EVs has raised questions about whether legacy automakers can compete. So Farley's statement also promised that ""We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability.""

For companies, which need to plan their future vehicle line-ups years in advance, it's challenging when rules whipsaw back and forth with each change in administration. That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5920x3330+0+172/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F41%2F41e21b9a4746b037eb9bea98f959%2Fgettyimages-2249777843.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 19:03:58.385467

A statement available on the laboratory’s website says that the change, announced this week and effective immediately, reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation.

Audrey Robertson, Assistant Secretary of Energy at the DoE, added that the “energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL.”

“We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” Robertson explained. “Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

The laboratory first opened in 1977 under the name Solar Energy Research Institute following an oil crisis earlier in the decade. Its name was changed to NREL in 1991 by President George H.W Bush, at which time it was designated a national laboratory of the DOE. There are currently seventeen such laboratories across the U.S. spanning science, nuclear energy and security, environmental management, fossil energy and carbon management, and energy efficiency and renewable energy.

Writing on LinkedIn, senior scientist at the Colorado laboratory, Craig Perkins, said it was “a sad day to see renewable energy officially de-emphasized at our lab.”

“I feel bad for all the people who came here with renewable energy as a passion and who now have to make some hard choices about their futures,” Perkins wrote. “On the bright side, solar power and other renewable energies will eventually prevail over the current political winds, guaranteed. It just might be elsewhere.”

In November, the DoE released a new organizational chart removing groups focused on energy efficiency, renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions.

A fact sheet put out by the White House was light on specifics, but said Trump was “returning CAFE standards to levels that can actually be met with conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.”

They said this stands in contrast to the “unrealistic fuel economy targets” that the Biden Administration had approved, which would have “effectively resulted in an electric vehicle mandate.”

More: 50.4 MPG Is The Magic Number As New Fuel Economy Standards Announced

The White House went on to claim the previous standards were impossible to meet with available technologies for gas cars and would have “compelled widespread shifts to EVs that American consumers did not ask for, accompanied by significant cost-of-living increases.”

They went on to say the average cost of a new car would have risen by nearly $1,000 when compared to the standards announced today.

Speaking of savings, the government said the move will save Americans $109 billion over the next five years. The White House also suggested that by enabling more people to buy newer and safer vehicles, the “reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.”

Big Changes, Less Efficiency

The Department of Transportation was more forthcoming as they revealed the Freedom Means Affordable Cars proposal. It calls for resetting CAFE standards for model years 2022-2031.

The new standards would be “developed without consideration of electric vehicles and credit trading,” and would call for a modest fuel economy increase.

For passenger vehicles, the proposal calls for an increase of 0.5% annually for model years 2023 through 2026. It would then dip to a 0.35% increase for the 2027 model year and a 0.25% increase for the 2029 to 2031 model years.

For light trucks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is proposing a 0.5% increase for the 2023-2026 model years. It would be followed by a 0.7% increase for 2027, and then a lower 0.25% improvement for the 2029 to 2031 model years.

What the New Math Means

While it’s hard to wrap fuel economy figures around percentages, the Department of Transportation said the proposal would result in a fleet average fuel economy rating of 34.5 mpg by the 2031 model year. CAFE credit trading would also be eliminated in the 2028 model year, significantly hurting EV companies such as Tesla.

Furthermore, the proposal would “reclassify crossovers and small SUVs as passenger automobiles instead of light trucks.” In essence, it’ll be like making vehicles on ‘easy mode.’

(Dec. 3, 2025) — The American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Formaldehyde Panel today issued the following statement in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to revisit its Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluation for formaldehyde:

“We welcome EPA’s updated draft risk calculations and its decision to reevaluate key scientific inputs in the TSCA formaldehyde risk evaluation. EPA’s revised approach reflects meaningful consideration of the recommendations from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC), the Human Studies Review Board (HSRB), and other authoritative bodies, and strengthens alignment with TSCA’s requirements to use the best available science and the weight of scientific evidence.

“Any assessment of formaldehyde must begin with the best available science. Formaldehyde is a natural part of our world and, through decades of responsible innovation and regulation, is essential to critical applications for housing, agriculture, transportation, healthcare, and national security. Formaldehyde technologies have broad roles in the economy, supporting over 1.5 million jobs and $1.6 trillion in manufacturing shipments and other economic output in 2023 in the United States.

“The final risk evaluation for formaldehyde did not fully align with statutory requirements for scientific quality, peer review, or engagement with public and interagency comments. It relied heavily on an assessment from EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program, which has faced questions about its transparency, authorization, and scientific methods. As a result, a flawed evaluation may lead to regulations that are more restrictive than necessary for this important chemistry, with potential implications for the U.S. economy and domestic production.

“EPA’s updated draft analysis incorporates important scientific principles long supported by the Panel and other scientific bodies, including the recognition of a portal-of-entry threshold mode of action, the finding that sensory irritation is the most sensitive endpoint and protective of effects for all durations, that formaldehyde does not follow Haber’s Law because effects are driven by concentration rather than duration, and that controlled human exposure studies provide stronger scientific rigor than observational epidemiology. These updates help align the TSCA process with the best available science and improve the scientific foundation of EPA’s evaluation.

“The Panel has consistently supported a transparent and scientifically sound approach to chemical risk assessment. In prior comments, we noted concerns with the earlier evaluation, including the importance of using the best available science and better accounting for real-world exposure scenarios.

“Formaldehyde is integral to modern life, and businesses and families rely on the important products it enables. Without robust formaldehyde manufacturing in the United States, we could face increased product prices, reduced economic output, and a loss of the U.S.’s competitive edge.

“We remain committed to working constructively with the EPA and all stakeholders throughout this process. Our goal is to support a balanced and credible risk evaluation that protects public health while recognizing the important contributions of this building block chemistry.”",https://www.americanchemistry.com/var/site/storage/images/3/9/9/2/2993-2-eng-US/Government-EPA-Building.png,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:11.344288

Gov. Josh Stein, who created the task force in August, also opposed Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike in a statement Tuesday. Duke is seeking a 15% increase over the next two years, which could add $20 to $30 a month to household bills by 2028. Stein praised Attorney General Jeff Jackson for intervening in the case, calling the increase “simply too high” when “families are struggling to make ends meet.”

Other WRAL Top Stories

Jackson said his office stepped in to make sure customers aren’t paying more than necessary.

""It’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”

Tuesday’s task force meeting, chaired by Environmental Secretary Reid Wilson and Rep. Kyle Hall, focused on how other states are responding to the data center boom now sweeping across North Carolina. Experts from neighboring states warned that fast-growing electricity demand is already reshaping grids nationwide and forcing regulators to rethink who should pay for costly new power plants and transmission lines.

Luke Wilson, executive director of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, told members his state expects peak demand to climb as much as 60% by the 2030s, driven largely by data centers. “You have to make sure growth pays for growth,” Wilson said. He described Indiana’s new rules that require large users to cover most of the cost of new generation built specifically to serve them.

Virginia State Corporation Commission member Kelsey Baggett said her state has seen hundreds of data center projects line up for grid access, especially in Northern Virginia. The surge prompted regulators there to create a separate electric rate class to ensure big tech users pay their share. “We have to make sure costs are allocated fairly,” Baggett said.

North Carolina faces similar pressures. Duke has warned that electricity demand from data centers, manufacturing and electrification could grow much faster than previously forecast. Under the state’s current structure, changed this summer by Senate Bill 266, residential customers could shoulder a greater share of the cost of fuel and purchased power, while large commercial customers pay less. Some task force members raised concerns that rapid growth could leave households covering more of the long-term costs of new infrastructure unless the state updates its rules.

In a statement, Duke Energy said:

“We do not take any request to increase rates lightly, knowing that our investments to meet North Carolina’s growing energy needs will be carefully evaluated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Staff, and intervenors such as customer advocates and the Attorney General. We look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with all parties as the review moves forward next year.”

The task force is expected to deliver recommendations in February on how North Carolina can meet rising demand while keeping electricity reliable, clean and affordable.

Saline Twp. data center proposal sparks fears over energy costs and transparency

Well, one of the largest in the country is now planned for Saline Township.

I got a chance to talk to residents, a power systems expert, and Michigan’s attorney general about how they’re viewing this potentially historic project.

“Well, already, instead of starlight, construction light streams through my bedroom window,"" said Kathryn Haushalter, who lives in Saline Township.

That’s because OpenAI, Oracle, and developer Related Digital are in the early stages of building a 1.4 gigawatt data center in Saline Township, right on Kathryn Haushalter’s doorstep.

“It’s just all going to change. We’re afraid for our well water, our electric bill. It’s just not going to be the house we were hoping for,"" she said.

DTE would supply the needed electricity.

We’ve heard from DTE that they say it won’t raise the cost of utilities, but Kathryn is skeptical.

“We only have to look at other states and how it’s happened, and definitely the customers get saddled with the bill,"" she said.

Saline Township residents raise concerns, anger against incoming data center

DTE wants the Michigan Public Services Commission to grant expedited ex parte approval of its special contracts with the AI data center. If granted, this would bypass any investigation or challenge of the terms of the contract by the public or the attorney general.

DTE has said the customer could terminate the deal if it’s not approved by December 5.

“It shouldn’t be rushed. If this is rushed, people are going to get hurt. Real families are going to get hurt by this,"" said Josh Lebaron.

Lebaron lives just 500 yards from the planned AI data center.

“I’d rather have a nuclear power plant than a data center. Cause at least that would add to the grid,"" he said.

He, too, feels like everything has happened quickly.

“I heard about it vaguely in August. I kind of assumed that the appropriate authorities were taking care of it. And then about two weeks ago, I realized that was not happening,"" he said. “I wanted to live out in the country in peace. I’ve spent the last 10 years remodeling my farmhouse. I’m almost done with it, and now they’re building a giant data center next to me.”

And he has an opinion on why Saline Township was chosen.

“Well, it’s a really small rural township with 2,000 people. So legally it’s going to be much easier to roll them over,"" said Lebaron.

Rabab Haider is an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan. She tells me the electricity infrastructure in Michigan is around 100 years old, and changing weather patterns and new load growth mean it needs upgrading.

“It’s a really large cost. And when we think about the price increases that we’ve seen over the past couple of years in electricity prices, and residential electricity prices, for example, the vast majority of that actually comes from the upgrades that we’re running on our system today,"" said Haider.

Not AI, up to now.

""A big concern for these people, where these data centers are supposed to go in, is that their utility rates will increase, but they’ve been told that that’s not going to happen. Is it possible that an AI data center could go in and their utility rates do not increase?"" I asked.

“I think it is possible,"" she said.

Haider said it depends on the contracts being signed.

“If a data center says that we’re going to build a megawatt facility and we’re going to make sure that we will be paying a certain minimum amount or we will consume a minimum amount of power, you have a steady revenue stream that you could basically offset costs of any potential infrastructure upgrades,"" she said. “You could also imagine that a data center company could choose to foot the bill for certain upgrades that would otherwise then get allocated to different rates payers. So then it really comes down to the way these contracts are designed and how rate approvals go through our utility and public service commissions.”

DTE issued a statement reaffirming the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, also saying in part: ""Recently passed legislation by the state of Michigan ensures our customers will NOT subsidize data center rates. Furthermore, Michigan’s regulatory process allows a company to file for ex parte (or uncontested) approval of contracts if there is no cost-of-service increase to customers.""

At the request of Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, the Michigan Public Service Commission agreed to hold a two-hour virtual public hearing on DTE’s ex parte application for approval of its special contracts to provide electricity to the 1.4 gigawatt data center in Saline Township on December 3.

She says right now, the public isn’t even able to read an unredacted copy of the contract.

I brought the concerns of Saline residents to Nessel directly.

""What should Michiganders expect and insist, when it comes to next steps?"" I asked.

“Those feelings are absolutely legitimate. This does appear to be a rush job. It does appear as though the intention of the public service commission is to rubber-stamp whatever DTE wants… because I have no other explanation why they would not have a contested hearing unless they want to make sure that nobody knows exactly what it is that DTE is asking for,"" said Dana Nessel, Michigan's attorney general.

It’s a sentiment echoed by Kathryn Haushalter.

“I feel like it’s just a checklist of things that they have to do before they can just go ahead anyway and get what they want and put this data center here,"" she said.

I asked about where the public can make their voices heard, and was told the best place right now is on the MPSC’s link for public comment, also to attend that virtual hearing, which is taking place at 6:30 p.m.

We’ll see if they end up granting a contested hearing, but according to the attorney general, approval of those contracts without public scrutiny would be unprecedented.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3421f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F55%2F68e7ab624a158e838aff32c6a8f1%2Fphoto-collage-png.png,N,,2025-12-03 19:04:10.359124

JOHN,,,,,https://abc7chicago.com/post/trump-plans-weaken-vehicle-mileage-rules-limit-air-pollution/18245873/,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.
The rules will increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said.
The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles' average efficiency.","WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans' access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

""From day one I've been taking action to make buying a car more affordable."" Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,"" Trump said.

Rule change will save money, Trump says

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October. according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes. They had complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was ""a win for customers and common sense.""

""As America's largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,"" Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration's actions to ""realign"" the standards ""with real world market conditions.""

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback in mileage standards.

""In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation's most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

""Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,'' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program.

Polluting cars to stay on road

""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,"" she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV ""mandate,"" referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden's target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles' average efficiency.

Answer: I am the CEO of a rapidly growing, innovative company that produces electrical generators with zero emissions. As our team brainstormed about our growth and future plans, I realized that the decisions I would need to make are far outside my comfort zone and educational background. I needed to become smarter, or at least less stupid, on the topics of business organization, energy policies and federal contracts to be able to perform to the level I wanted and my company needed.

Q: What’s something you learned while at ASU — in the classroom or otherwise — that surprised you or changed your perspective?

A: I am extremely pleased with the real-world experience of the ASU instructors. Their experience brings perspective, examples and analogies, and insight that exceeds my expectations.

Q: Why did you choose ASU?

A: First of all, ASU has a stellar reputation, and I have a tremendous respect for the faculty, staff, students and graduates I have met from ASU. The program was perfect for my intentions and gave me an opportunity to succeed.

Q: Which professor taught you the most important lesson while at ASU?

A: That’s a difficult question. Professor Troy Rule was incredible in Energy Law and Policies, and Professor Catherine Barnard has been amazing in Contracts and in Business Relationships. However, I believe that the most influential professor was Professor Larry Bridgesmith in my Negotiations class. His approach combining engineering, neuroscience and psychology disciplines was extremely influential and impactful. The material in this course assists me daily, professionally and personally.

Q: What’s the best piece of advice you’d give to those still in school?

A: Be humble, be curious and be ready to find nuggets of wisdom at any point of your journey.

Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.
Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.
In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""","The Trump administration has started the process of dramatically easing fuel economy requirements for new vehicles, part of the administration's broader pivot away from cleaner cars.

At the White House on Wednesday, surrounded by the executives from several major car companies, President Trump said the move would save consumers money by making cars cheaper.

""We're officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions,"" Trump said, referring to the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules, often called CAFE standards. ""And all sorts of problems, all sorts of problems for automakers.""

Previous research from Consumer Reports has challenged the argument that regulations make cars more expensive. Stringent fuel economy standards also carry an economic benefit in the form of lower fuel costs over time.

CAFE standards require that the entire fleet of vehicles sold by a given automaker, on average, get more fuel-efficient over time. Automakers who fall short have previously needed to either pay hefty fines, or buy credits from a company that over-performs on efficiency, like Tesla and other all-electric automakers.

The Trump administration has already defanged the existing CAFE standards by eliminating the fines associated with them, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Under Former President Joe Biden, the rules called for vehicles to get 2% more efficient every year; the Trump administration is now proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline and increase by .5% annually.

The proposed change now enters a period of public comment; the Department of Transportation will collect input from companies and citizens before finalizing the rule.

The administration has already been working to roll back tailpipe standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which are designed to cut pollution from vehicles. The two sets of rules have overlapping effects, with both of them pushing automakers toward cleaner vehicles.

Meanwhile, during the second Trump presidency Congress has also eliminated the consumer tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, decided to end a tax credit for installing an EV charger in June 2026, earlier than planned, and voted to strike down federal waivers that let California require automakers to build zero-emission vehicles. The Trump administration also temporarily delayed a program to use federal money to build a high-speed EV charger network.

The policy shift was no surprise. Trump campaigned against what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" and promised to rescind policies — including fuel economy standards — that encouraged or incentivized EVs.

Trump has framed the policy rollback as a gift to the auto industry. And that's partially true: Large trucks and SUVs may be inefficient, but they're popular and profitable, and selling more of them without any penalty is a financial boon to automakers. In earnings calls this fall, multiple executives noted that the regulatory rollback will boost earnings and help offset the cost of tariffs.

Electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. has moved slower than automakers had expected. Some automakers have said made some of the Biden-era policies not just challenging but unworkable.

In a statement provided by the White House, Ford CEO Jim Farley praised ""President Trump's leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.""

But automakers are also navigating a changing global market, with many countries continuing to prioritize climate action. The popularity of high-quality, affordable Chinese EVs has raised questions about whether legacy automakers can compete. So Farley's statement also promised that ""We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability.""

For companies, which need to plan their future vehicle line-ups years in advance, it's challenging when rules whipsaw back and forth with each change in administration. That's been the reality for years now: The Obama administration set ambitious fuel economy rules, which Trump 1.0 reversed, Biden reinstated, and now Trump 2.0 is seeking to ""reset.""

Farley obliquely noted that risk in a conversation with investors in October. He explained why Ford was continuing to move ahead with plans for an affordable electric pickup, despite regulations shifting to no longer support EVs. ""We expect adoption will increase over time and the market continue to evolve,"" Farley said. ""And maybe the regulations evolve.""

Sue-and-settle cases are where plaintiffs go to court, negotiate consent decrees setting new policies, then are awarded payment for their attorneys’ time.

Cases are particularly prolific in environmental policy, where the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act are prominent battlegrounds for sue-and-settle.

Critics say it sets up a perverse incentive for administrations to work with environmentalists to force the government into policies that couldn’t make it through Congress. Because they are legal settlements, they are binding on future administrations, just as if they were written into law.

Open the Books, a spending watchdog, said the government reached hundreds of settlements and paid out $20.3 million in lawyers’ fees associated with those settlements from 2013 to 2024.

President Obama racked up $5.7 million of those fee awards, President Trump cut that to $3.6 million in his first four years, then President Biden oversaw a surge, to $10.9 million.

The Sierra Club made out the best, according to Open the Books, collecting more than $4 million in lawyers’ fees over that time.

Northwest Environmental Advocates, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Environmental Law & Policy Center and the Natural Resources Defense Council rounded out the top five, with each collecting at least $1 million.

Open the Books said the Trump administration made a concerted effort to limit the practice, with the Environmental Protection Agency in 2017 ordering an end to using consent decrees to circumvent the usual policymaking process.

The Biden EPA ditched those restrictions in 2022.

Weakened Fuel Economy Standards Will Harm People, the Environment While Raising Prices at the Pump

Statement by Steven Higashide, Union of Concerned Scientists

WASHINGTON (December 3, 2025)—The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced a proposal to weaken fuel economy (CAFE) standards for model year 2022 to 2031 passenger cars and trucks.

Below is a statement by Steven Higashide, director of the Clean Transportation Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“This Trump administration handout to fossil fuel industry and automakers will harm consumers and the environment. Because of CAFE standards, U.S. vehicle pollution and reliance on oil have dropped and drivers can save money by choosing more efficient vehicles. Tearing down this pillar of clean transportation will cost us all dearly.

“This year marks a half-century since Congress created the CAFE standard, which over the past 50 years has improved U.S. energy security, helped clean up the air, and saved consumers more than $5 trillion.

“The Trump administration is moving us backwards, with CAFE targets that are less stringent than what today’s fleet already achieves. Decreasing vehicle efficiency will harm public health and well-being, make the United States more vulnerable to global oil price shocks, and cost consumers more each time they fill up at the pump. This move should be seen for what it is—more short-term profit for oil and car companies and a diminished future for all of us.

“This is not the first time the CAFE standards have come under attack by the Trump administration and their allies in Congress. Earlier this year, DOT finalized an interpretive rule without public input that gave automakers a free pass to ignore the CAFE standards on the books. And Republicans’ reconciliation bill stripped NHTSA’s ability to enforce CAFE standards by zeroing out penalties for noncompliance. These standards are complementary but separate from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks, which are also being targeted for repeal by the Trump administration.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:01.045985

However, Duke Energy, the largest energy company in North Carolina, offers tips to help its customers reduce their utility usage and minimize the impact on their monthly bills.

Duke offers a holiday lights calculator that helps customers plan ahead and estimate the additional cost of their holiday light displays on their utility bill. By identifying the type of lights, number of bulbs per strand, and the number of hours used during the day, customers can estimate the additional cost that will be added to their monthly bill.

Large incandescent bulbs will add much more than LED bulbs. Six strings of 100 incandescent bulbs, each turned on for six hours, would add approximately $80 to a monthly bill. While six strands of 100 LED bulbs would add only about $7, and for an even more cost-effective option, the same amount of mini-LED bulbs would increase the monthly bill by only $1.

With the holidays come more cooking and baking, which, like holiday lights, will also add to the electric bill. Duke also offers a holiday cooking calculator to help customers estimate the cost of holiday cooking based on the appliance, wattage, cooking time, and average kWH per hour.

Duke also offers other money-saving tips for these cold holiday months. Thermostats can be one of the largest contributors to monthly power bills. Set the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature and lower it a degree or two when leaving. Change air filters regularly and keep up with maintenance and regular service on the heating and cooling system. On sunny days, let the sunlight in by opening drapes or blinds. And of course, wear warm clothing.

In 2022, Duke Energy implemented rolling blackouts to stabilize the energy grid during the bitter cold temperatures of the holiday season. Experts say a repeat of the 2022 blackouts is unlikely.

“Fortunately, the risk of another holiday blackout is quite low,” Jon Sanders, director of the Center for Food Power and Life, at the John Locke Foundation, told the Carolina Journal. “What happened in 2022 was a perfect storm of equipment failures, loss of expected power purchases, and the fact that the cold snap affected so much of the East Coast. Furthermore, North Carolinians were able to avoid a blackout during a heat wave last summer when the US Energy Secretary Chris Wright granted Duke Energy an emergency order to exceed emissions levels if needed to keep the power on. Thanks to that order, Duke was able to keep the power on with 30% more coal generation than the previous day.”

The agreements — reached after months of proceedings and public input — would reduce the size of the proposed increases while maintaining commitments to reliable service and customer assistance.

For many South Carolinians, understanding what these settlements mean can help them prepare for potential changes in their utility bills in the coming year.

Why This Matters

South Carolina households already pay some of the highest electricity bills in the country. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South Carolina residents spend about 20% more on electricity than the national average.

Because of these high costs, even modest rate increases can affect family budgets, especially for older adults and those living on fixed incomes. AARP South Carolina continues to monitor developments in the energy sector to help residents understand how rate changes impact affordability and everyday living costs.

Overview of the Settlements

Both Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) filed requests with the PSC in 2025 to raise residential electric rates. After negotiations among the utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates, both companies reached separate settlement agreements that are now before the PSC for review.

These settlements include several key provisions:

Return on Equity (ROE): Duke agreed to a 9.99% ROE, down from the requested 10.85%. The ROE helps determine how much profit the company can earn while recovering its costs to operate and invest in infrastructure.

Basic Facilities Charge: The monthly Residential Basic Facilities Charge — the fixed fee customers pay before using electricity — will remain at $11.78, rather than increasing to $13.00 as initially requested.

Customer Assistance Programs: Both companies have committed shareholder funds to assist customers facing financial hardship through the Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) programs.

DEP: $750,000 per year for two years.

DEC: $1.5 million per year for two years.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Savings: Duke will apply temporary bill credits, or “decrement riders,” to return federal tax savings from the Inflation Reduction Act to customers.

DEP: $10 million over two years.

DEC: $100 million over 22 months.

How This Affects Residential Customers

If the PSC approves the settlements, most residential customers will see smaller increases than originally proposed.

Duke Energy Progress (DEP) customers would see an average 7.3% increase, rather than the proposed 15%. A typical residential bill would rise about $11.23 per month instead of $21.66.

Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) customers would see an average 0.6% increase, rather than 7.6%. A typical residential bill would rise about $0.84 per month instead of $10.38.

The new rates are expected to take effect February 1, 2026, pending PSC approval.

These changes reflect efforts to balance the company’s need to maintain infrastructure with the financial realities faced by consumers across South Carolina.

Additional Settlement Provisions

In addition to rate changes, the settlements include several agreements that will shape how energy rates and programs are managed in the coming years:

Large Load Customers: By June 1, 2026, Duke and other stakeholders will jointly petition the PSC to review rate-making structures for very large customers (50 megawatts and above), such as data centers and manufacturing operations.

Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management (EE/DSM): Within six months of Duke’s planned merger approval, the company will file a petition to review its EE/DSM portfolios. These programs help reduce energy consumption, promote efficiency, and potentially lower long-term costs for customers.

Merger-Related Commitments: Both settlements outline conditions tied to the proposed combination of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, including how future rate filings will be handled and how customer benefits from federal tax credits will continue to be applied.

What Consumers Should Know

Even with smaller increases than initially proposed, electricity costs remain a growing concern for many households. AARP South Carolina encourages residents to:

Review their utility bills carefully once new rates take effect to understand how the changes apply to their usage.

Explore available assistance programs, including Duke’s Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) program and other community-based utility assistance initiatives.

Take advantage of energy efficiency programs that may help reduce monthly costs, such as weatherization and appliance upgrade rebates.

Stay informed about PSC proceedings, especially as the merger between Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas advances and new rate cases are filed.

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina

The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable. As South Carolina continues to grow, the demand for energy — especially from industries, data centers, and new developments — is expected to increase.

At the same time, extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the transition to cleaner energy sources are putting additional pressure on utilities and regulators.

Balancing these priorities will remain a central issue for state policymakers, consumer advocates, and residents alike.

AARP South Carolina will continue to follow these developments and share information to help consumers make informed decisions about energy use, assistance programs, and rate changes that affect their household budgets.

She said people should buy electric cars based on their merits, not because of government incentives.","President Trump on Wednesday threw the weight of the federal government behind vehicles that burn gasoline rather than electric cars, gutting one of the country’s most significant efforts to address climate change and thrusting the automobile industry into greater uncertainty.

Flanked by executives from major automakers in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the Transportation Department would significantly weaken fuel efficiency requirements for tens of millions of new cars and light trucks. The administration claimed the changes would save Americans $109 billion over five years and shave $1,000 off the average cost of a new car.

The Biden administration’s stricter efficiency standards were designed to get more Americans to go electric. But Mr. Trump said they “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices, and made the car much worse. This is a green new scam, and people were paying too much for a car that didn’t work as well.”

For the past half-century, the efficiency standards have compelled automakers to increase the distance their vehicles can travel on a gallon of gas, reducing fuel consumption and leading to innovations like electric and hybrid cars.

The announcement on Wednesday was the second part of a one-two punch against policies promoting electric cars, a central pillar of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s strategy for fighting climate change.

Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, and Mr. Biden had adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to reducing these emissions. He offered tax credits to encourage motorists to buy electric cars while requiring that automakers meet stringent fuel efficiency standards to pressure them to sell more nonpolluting models.

Mr. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress got rid of the tax credits earlier this year. They also eliminated fines for automakers who violate the fuel efficiency standards. And now the standards themselves will be watered down.

While auto executives publicly praised the announcement, they have privately fretted that they are being buffeted by conflicting federal policies. During the Biden administration, they invested billions of dollars and reoriented their manufacturing to produce electric vehicles and batteries.

Now the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and imported car parts have lopped billions of dollars from carmakers’ bottom lines while disrupting supply chains. Inflation has also made it difficult for many people to afford new cars.

The Biden administration rule, finalized in June 2024, assumed that manufacturers would comply by increasing their sales of electric vehicles, which use no gasoline and would help boost the average fuel efficiency across their product lines. Biden administration officials estimated that the rule would lower fuel costs by $23 billion while preventing more than 710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2050, the equivalent of taking 165 million cars off the roads for one year.

Mr. Trump, who refers to climate change as a “hoax,” initially promised to repeal the rules to end what he falsely called an “E.V. mandate.” But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he was motivated to weaken the rules in order to lower the price of new cars. The cost of living has emerged as major concern for voters and a political vulnerability for the president and his party.

“Perhaps grudgingly, the president is increasingly realizing that inflation, affordability, the economy are real concerns across the partisan spectrum,” said Barry Rabe, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan.

Left unsaid on Wednesday was the fact that analysts expect the president’s tariffs on cars and car parts to increase the price of automobiles built abroad. The average price of a new car in the United States has now exceeded $50,000 for the first time, according to Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. It attributed the increase to tariffs as well as low loan rates and new electric vehicle sales.

Mr. Trump has aggressively repealed dozens of federal climate protections. The rollback of automobile standards comes as the administration is also lifting restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and oil and gas wells while making it easier for fossil fuel companies to extract and burn more coal, oil and gas, the main drivers of climate change.

Several Republican officials applauded the move. “President Trump won the argument over E.V. mandates on Election Day,” said Russell Coleman, the attorney general of Kentucky who led a lawsuit against the Biden administration. “As a result, Kentuckians can continue relying on our gas-powered trucks, cars and vans.”

Automakers were more circumspect. John Bozzella, the chief executive of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a lobbying group for most major carmakers, said the organization was still reviewing the Trump plan. But, he said, the Biden-era standards were “extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for E.V.s.”

Mary Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said on Wednesday that her company would continue to seek “significant improvement from a fuel economy perspective,” regardless of the federal rules. She said people should buy electric cars based on their merits, not because of government incentives. “People choose an E.V. because it’s a better performance vehicle and it fits their life,” Ms. Barra said at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit before the White House announcement.

The new policy frees automakers to sell more pickups and sport utility vehicles, which are usually much more profitable than smaller cars. It will be difficult for carmakers to resist pressure to sell these gas guzzlers, despite Ms. Barra’s pledge to keep making fuel-efficient vehicles.

Car sales in the United States are stagnant, and the difficult environment is prompting automakers to “really take a hard look at their portfolio and where they make profit,” said Lenny LaRocca, who leads the automotive practice at consulting firm KPMG. “I would anticipate that more focus would be on the larger S.U.V.’s and pickup trucks.”

But carmakers who neglect smaller cars and electric vehicles could be vulnerable if there is an oil price shock that drives up gasoline prices. They could have trouble competing if people become more concerned about fuel economy.

“There is a market for those vehicles,” Mr. LaRocca said, referring to smaller cars. “The question is going to be, do they want to compete long term in that market?”

The changes also push the United States further out of sync with the rest of the world, where the electric vehicle market is growing, making it harder for companies to design vehicles that they can sell anywhere, said Stuart Taylor, a former Ford executive who is chief product officer at Envorso, a consulting firm that helps companies with digital technology. “The migration to E.V.s, which most of us in the industry believe is inevitable, is now running on two different timelines,” Mr. Taylor said.

Vehicles on average got only about 13 miles to the gallon, so Congress passed what became the fuel economy standards as an energy security measure. “It was really to reduce oil dependence. That’s the heart of why it started,” said Rebecca Ciez, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University.

The standards remained somewhat stagnant for many years, and popular, until President Barack Obama sought to dramatically tighten them. Linking mileage standards to the effort to fight climate change also politicized and “drew fire” to the policy, Ms. Ciez said.

Economists said repealing Biden-era mileage standards may indeed lower production costs, but only marginally, and at a price to public health and the environment. And in the long run, many noted, Americans will pay more in gasoline prices than they would have otherwise.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/03cli-fuel-efficiency-01-fhlw/03cli-fuel-efficiency-01-fhlw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:03:39.337391

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the U.S.-China energy announcement is a meaningful but not necessarily transformative development for American LNG.
“For the broader U.S. LNG industry this is a clear positive,” Longanecker said from Austin.
“None of this points to materially higher exports of U.S. LNG to China.
“New projects continue to add to the ability to get Permian gas to market, though this game of catch-up continues to keep prices for Permian gas muted relative to Henry Hub and other benchmarks,” he said.","Energy experts say the full value of China’s Oct. 29 agreement with President Trump to start the process of buying American oil and gas, possibly including a large-scale transaction from Alaska, is not yet known, but it is nonetheless a positive for the American energy industry.

The Permian Basin Petroleum Association, the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association and Amarillo economist Karr Ingham are encouraged.

“From our vantage point any deal that enhances U.S. liquefied natural gas export markets is a signal that global demand for American natural gas remains robust,” PBPA President Ben Shepperd said. “Combined with existing demand in Europe and Asia, additional LNG export partners help reinforce the strategic importance of the Permian Basin as both an oil and natural gas producing region.

“There are a number of infrastructure projects in the queue that will be helping abate the takeaway constraints that have been impacting production in the Basin, but as pipeline takeaway capacity improves and Gulf Coast LNG export and domestic markets grow, we believe the Basin will play a critical role in supplying those markets while relieving regional oversupply pressures.”

He said success as always ultimately depends on matching production growth with adequate midstream and export infrastructure and staying alert to shifts in global demand and regulatory dynamics.

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the U.S.-China energy announcement is a meaningful but not necessarily transformative development for American LNG.

“China’s commitment to resume and expand purchases removes the 15% retaliatory tariff that effectively shut U.S. molecules out of the world’s largest LNG import market for most of 2025 and it re-opens a key demand center at a time when Europe is already saturated,” he said. “While the exact volumes remain to be negotiated, even a return to pre-trade war levels plus modest growth would add several billion dollars in annual export revenue and more importantly provide diversification away from an increasingly price-sensitive European spot market.

“For the broader U.S. LNG industry this is a clear positive,” Longanecker said from Austin. “It improves the bankability of the next wave of projects, the CP2 export terminal in Louisiana, Golden Pass, Port Arthur, etc., and lifts the outlook for Henry Hub prices in 2026–2028.

“The bigger story, however, remains with domestic infrastructure. The Permian gas glut that drove Waha Hub into negative territory repeatedly in 2024–2025 is finally being addressed by the largest pipeline buildout in Texas since the shale boom began.”

Longanecker said Matterhorn Express Pipeline with 2.5 billion cubic feet per day online this month plus expansions on the Permian Highway, Gulf Coast Express, Whistler and several other pipelines will add roughly 12 Bcf/d of takeaway capacity out of West Texas by 2027.

“That is more than enough to clear the current bottleneck, stabilize Basin pricing and fully supply the seven operating Gulf Coast LNG export terminals plus the four under construction.”

He said Texas, which already produces 45% of U.S. natural gas and hosts about 40% of current U.S. LNG export capacity, will be the primary beneficiary.

“Higher associated gas volumes from the Permian can now move efficiently to waterborne markets instead of being flared or shut in, supporting both producer economics and the state’s midstream and export complex,” Longanecker said. “In short the China deal is a welcome tailwind, but the heavy lifting for the American LNG boom and the relief of the West Texas glut is being done by steel in the ground across the Lone Star State.”

Ingham, president of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, said the jury is still out on the U.S.-China deal.

“Obviously every molecule of American LNG sold is a win for American and Texas producers and exporters, but China purchased no LNG in 2025 until a paltry 546 million cubic feet in September with no numbers yet being available October or November,” Ingham said.

“Perhaps they are on the path to restoring some meaningful volume of imported U.S. LNG, but even that wouldn’t suggest a huge market mover at least at the moment.

“China accounted for less than 5% of all U.S. LNG exported in 2024 and less than 3% of all U.S. natural gas exports including LNG and pipelines and they are not poised to return even to those levels in 2026.”

Ingham said American tariffs and then Chinese retaliatory and reciprocal tariffs accounted for the loss of LNG exports to China in 2025 and LNG import demand has softened across the board in China as well.

“In addition China has been replacing some LNG imports with pipeline gas from Russia via Siberia,” he said. “None of this points to materially higher exports of U.S. LNG to China.

“We may gradually replace some of the lost volumes this year as they might not be zero in the coming month and in 2026, but there is nothing that points to a significant demand increase from China alone in the near term.”

Ingham noted that pipeline development and construction continue for the purpose of getting gas out of the Permian Basin and to Gulf Coast markets.

“New projects continue to add to the ability to get Permian gas to market, though this game of catch-up continues to keep prices for Permian gas muted relative to Henry Hub and other benchmarks,” he said. At the Henry Hub today the price is $4.59, but at the Waha Hub it’s 13 cents.

“I’m sure we all look forward to the day when Permian-produced natural gas finally gets its due in the marketplace because that has not been the case for a long time and it is not the case at present,” Ingham said. “This is a fantastic resource and though its production is tied to crude oil to a huge extent, it has much greater value to Texas, the U.S. and the world than is being reflected in its price.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/091421__oil_art_12-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:26.885918

President Donald Trump unveiled his administration’s plan to relax stringent Biden-era fuel efficiency standards, casting the change as a way to lower consumer costs.

“Today my administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families — and also safer,” Trump said in an Oval Office event Dec. 3 with representatives from Detroit’s major automakers.

Trump was joined in the Oval by Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa, Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley and John Urbanic, plant manager at General Motors Co.’s Orion, Mich., facility.

The Transportation Department proposal, which still must go through a formal rulemaking process and could be finalized next year, represents the administration’s latest bid to unwind a suite of policies spurring electric vehicle production that Trump has derided as an “EV mandate.”

At issue are corporate average fuel economy requirements for cars and light trucks that were tightened under former President Joe Biden. Under those Biden-era standards, automakers must achieve an average of about 50 miles per gallon across their 2031 model-year vehicles.

But the new Trump administration proposal would lower that requirement to about 34.5 mpg for the 2031 model year. The measure also would eliminate a credit-trading program used by automakers to comply with the requirements, starting with the 2028 model year.

Trump’s proposal represents a major win for the auto and oil industries that complained the requirements pushed the bounds of available technology for getting more miles out of each gallon of gasoline, effectively discouraging the sale of traditional gas-fueled combustion engines in favor of emission-free electric models. Automakers had been expected to sell more electric vehicles to help hit the fuel-efficiency targets charted under Biden, as well as related federal limits on tailpipe pollution.

Critics said the proposal will encourage U.S. automakers to produce less-efficient gas guzzlers, narrowing consumer choice.

Trump already signed legislation lifting penalties on automakers that fail to fulfill the fuel economy standards and ending a consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. His Environmental Protection Agency also has proposed repealing limits on the greenhouse gas emissions from cars, pickups and heavy-duty trucks.

Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa said the Jeep-maker welcomed the change that would realign U.S. fuel economy standards “with real-world market conditions.”

“We look forward to working further with NHTSA on environmentally responsible policies that also allow us to offer our customers the freedom to choose the vehicles they want at prices they can afford,” he said in an emailed statement, referring to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Affordability Push

Trump’s announcement comes as the administration looks to counter cost-of-living fears, with higher prices for consumer goods, electricity and some imports stoking concern about the president’s stewardship of the economy and raising political risks for Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

New car prices topped $50,000 on average for the first time in September, climbing as domestic automakers prioritize profitable high-end, feature-laden models over lower-margin, entry-level cars.

The Trump administration said its proposal would save Americans $109 billion over the next five years. Families could see savings of $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle, according to the administration’s projections.

The Biden-era plan “twisted mileage standards to create an electric vehicle mandate — jacking up car prices for American families and forcing manufacturers to produce vehicles no one wanted,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement.

Although the Trump administration is casting the fuel economy change as an economic windfall, environmentalists say it will translate into added gasoline costs for American families. A retreat from the Biden-era standards that effectively lowered average fuel needs, they say, puts Americans on the hook to buy more gasoline.

“This isn’t about saving money for drivers or automakers — it’s about boosting oil companies’ profits,” said Kathy Harris, a director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Turning back the clock on even just three years of fuel economy progress means that drivers pay thousands more at the gas pump over the lifetime of their vehicles.”

The standards being targeted by Trump were predicted to have cut gasoline consumption by almost 70 billion gallons through 2050 and, according to the Biden administration, would save U.S. consumers more than $23 billion in fuel costs. That would translate to about $600 in savings over an individual vehicle’s lifetime.

Still, gasoline prices have fallen during Trump’s second term, down to $2.99 per gallon of unleaded on Tuesday, according to AAA, from $3.13 Jan. 20, when he took office. Trump has touted those falling fuel costs as an economic victory.

Trump ordered the elimination of subsidies and other measures boosting electric vehicles hours after taking office. Duffy also swiftly directed the NHTSA to rewrite the existing fuel economy standards, arguing they are “artificially high” and inconsistent with Trump’s policy to promote the production, distribution and use of domestic oil, natural gas and biofuels.

To justify the change, NHTSA has argued the Biden-era standards improperly included battery-electric cars and other alternative fuel vehicles when dictating future fleet requirements.

Environmentalists say the proposal flouts a requirement under federal law for corporate average fuel efficiency standards to be set at the “maximum feasible” level.

“The cure for pollution and high gas costs is strong fuel economy standards, not killing them as a favor to the president’s Big Oil, Big Auto and OPEC golf buddies,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-12/Mileage-1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:14.869306

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.","General Motors CEO Mary Barra said in a new interview on Wednesday that she told President Joe Biden to credit Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, for the widespread electric vehicle transition.

She said she told Biden this after the former President credited her and GM for leading EV efforts in the United States.

During an interview at the New York Times Dealbook Summit with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Barra said she told Biden that crediting her was essentially a mistake, and that Musk and Tesla should have been explicitly mentioned (via Business Insider):

“He was crediting me, and I said, ‘Actually, I think a lot of that credit goes to Elon and Tesla…You know me, Andrew. I don’t want to take credit for things.”

Back in 2021, President Biden visited GM’s “Factory Zero” plant in Detroit, which was the centerpiece of the company’s massive transition to EVs. The former President went on to discuss the EV industry, and claimed that GM and Barra were the true leaders who caused the change:

“In the auto industry, Detroit is leading the world in electric vehicles. You know how critical it is? Mary, I remember talking to you way back in January about the need for America to lead in electric vehicles. I can remember your dramatic announcement that by 2035, GM would be 100% electric. You changed the whole story, Mary. You did, Mary. You electrified the entire automotive industry. I’m serious. You led, and it matters.”

People were baffled by the President’s decision to highlight GM and Barra, and not Tesla and Musk, who truly started the transition to EVs. GM, Ford, and many other companies only followed in the footsteps of Tesla after it started to take market share from them.

Musk would eventually go on to talk about Biden’s words later on:

“They have so much power over the White House that they can exclude Tesla from an EV Summit. And, in case the first thing, in case that wasn’t enough, then you have President Biden with Mary Barra at a subsequent event, congratulating Mary for having led the EV revolution.”

In Q4 2021, which was shortly after Biden’s comments, Tesla delivered 300,000 EVs. GM delivered just 26.

Tesla Optimus showed off its newest capability as progress on the project continues to accelerate toward an ultimate goal of mass production in the coming years.

Tesla is still developing Optimus and preparing for the first stages of mass production, where units would be sold and shipped to customers. CEO Elon Musk has always marketed the humanoid robot as the biggest product in history, even outside of Tesla, but of all time.

He believes it will eliminate the need to manually perform monotonous tasks, like cleaning, mowing the lawn, and folding laundry.

However, lately, Musk has revealed even bigger plans for Optimus, including the ability to relieve humans of work entirely within the next 20 years.

Development at Tesla’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics teams has progressed, and a new video was shown of the robot taking a light jog with what appeared to be some pretty natural form:

Optimus has also made several public appearances lately, including one at the Neural Information Processing Systems, or NeurIPS Conference. Some spectators shared videos of Optimus’s charging rig, as well as its movements and capabilities, most interestingly, the hand:

The hand, forearm, and fingers have been one of the most evident challenges for Tesla in recent times, especially as it continues to work on its 3rd Generation iteration of Optimus.

Musk said during the Q3 Earnings Call:

“I don’t want to downplay the difficulty, but it’s an incredibly difficult thing, especially to create a hand that is as dexterous and capable as the human hand, which is incredible. The human hand is an incredible thing. The more you study the human hand, the more incredible you realize it is, and why you need four fingers and a thumb, why the fingers have certain degrees of freedom, why the various muscles are of different strengths, and fingers are of different lengths. It turns out that those are all there for a reason.”

The interesting part of the Optimus program so far is the fact that Tesla has made a lot of progress with other portions of the project, like movement, for example, which appears to have come a long way.

However, without a functional hand and fingers, Optimus could be rendered relatively useless, so it is evident that it has to figure this crucial part out first.

Elon Musk said in late November that he’s “tried to warn” legacy automakers and “even offered to license Tesla Full Self-Driving, but they don’t want it,” expressing frustration with companies that refuse to adopt the company’s suite, which will eventually be autonomous.

Tesla has long established itself as the leader in self-driving technology, especially in the United States. Although there are formidable competitors, Tesla’s FSD suite is the most robust and is not limited to certain areas or roadways. It operates anywhere and everywhere.

The company’s current position as the leader in self-driving tech is being ignored by legacy automakers, a parallel to what Tesla’s position was with EV development over a decade ago, which was also ignored by competitors.

The reluctance mirrors how legacy automakers initially dismissed EVs, only to scramble in catch-up mode years later–a pattern that highlights their historical underestimation of disruptive innovations from Tesla.

Elon Musk’s Self-Driving Licensing Attempts

Musk and Tesla have tried to push Full Self-Driving to other car companies, with no true suitors, despite ongoing conversations for years. Tesla’s FSD is aiming to become more robust through comprehensive data collection and a larger fleet, something the company has tried to establish through a subscription program, free trials, and other strategies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sends rivals dire warning about Full Self-Driving

However, competing companies have not wanted to license FSD for a handful of speculative reasons: competitive pride, regulatory concerns, high costs, or preference for in-house development.

Déjà vu All Over Again

Tesla tried to portray the importance of EVs long ago, as in the 2010s, executives from companies like Ford and GM downplayed the importance of sustainable powertrains as niche or unprofitable.

Musk once said in a 2014 interview that rivals woke up to electric powertrains when the Model S started to disrupt things and gained some market share. Things got really serious upon the launch of the Model 3 in 2017, as a mass-market vehicle was what Tesla was missing from its lineup.

This caused legacy companies to truly wake up; they were losing market share to Tesla’s new and exciting tech that offered less maintenance, a fresh take on passenger auto, and other advantages. They were late to the party, and although they have all launched vehicles of their own, they still lag in two major areas: sales and infrastructure, leaning on Tesla for the latter.

Musk’s past warnings have been plentiful. In 2017, he responded to critics who stated Tesla was chasing subsidies. He responded, “Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 and then crushed them in a junkyard,” adding that “they would be doing nothing” on EVs without Tesla’s efforts.

Companies laughed off Tesla’s prowess with EVs, only to realize they had made a grave mistake later on.

It looks to be happening once again.

A Pattern of Underestimation

Both EVs and self-driving tech represent major paradigm shifts that legacy players view as threats to their established business models; it’s hard to change. However, these early push-aways from new tech only result in reactive strategies later on, usually resulting in what pains they are facing now.

Ford is scaling back its EV efforts, and GM’s projects are hurting. Although they both have in-house self-driving projects, they are falling well behind the progress of Tesla and even other competitors.

It is getting to a point where short-term risk will become a long-term setback, and they may have to rely on a company to pull them out of a tough situation later on, just as it did with Tesla and EV charging infrastructure.

Tesla has continued to innovate, while legacy automakers have lagged behind, and it has cost them dearly.

Implications and Future Outlook

Moving forward, Tesla’s progress will continue to accelerate, while a dismissive attitude by other companies will continue to penalize them, especially as time goes on. Falling further behind in self-driving could eventually lead to market share erosion, as autonomy could be a crucial part of vehicle marketing within the next few years.

Eventually, companies could be forced into joint partnerships as economic pressures mount. Some companies did this with EVs, but it has not resulted in very much.

Self-driving efforts are not only a strength for companies themselves, but they also contribute to other things, like affordability and safety.

Tesla has exhibited data that specifically shows its self-driving tech is safer than human drivers, most recently by a considerable margin. This would help with eliminating accidents and making roads safer.

Additionally, competition in the market is a good thing, as it drives costs down and helps innovation continue on an upward trend.

Conclusion

The parallels are unmistakable: a decade ago, legacy automakers laughed off electric vehicles as toys for tree-huggers, crushed their own EV programs, and bet everything on the internal-combustion status quo–only to watch Tesla redefine the industry while they scrambled for billions in catch-up capital.

Today, the same companies are turning down repeated offers to license Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology, insisting they can build better autonomy in-house, even as their own programs stumble through recalls, layoffs, and missed milestones. History is not merely rhyming; it is repeating almost note-for-note.

Elon Musk has spent twenty years warning that the auto industry’s bureaucratic inertia and short-term thinking will leave it stranded on the wrong side of technological revolutions. The question is no longer whether Tesla is ahead–it is whether the giants of Detroit, Stuttgart, and Toyota will finally listen before the next wave leaves them watching another leader pull away in the rear-view mirror.

This time, the stakes are not just market share; they are the very definition of what a car will be in the decades ahead.

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.

Speaking on entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath’s podcast, Musk predicted that machines will soon handle most forms of labor, leaving humans to work only if they choose to.

Work as a “hobby”

During the discussion, Musk said the accelerating capability of AI systems and general-purpose robots will eventually cover all essential tasks, making human labor a choice rather than an economic requirement. “In less than 20 years, working will be optional. Working at all will be optional. Like a hobby,” Musk said.

When Kamath asked whether this future is driven by massive productivity growth, Musk agreed, noting that people will still be free to work if they enjoy the routine or the challenge. He compared future employment to home gardening, as it is something people can still do for personal satisfaction even if buying food from a store is far easier.

“Optional” work in the future

Elon Musk acknowledged the boldness of his claim and joked that people might look back in 20 years and say he was wrong. That being said, the CEO noted that such a scenario could even happen sooner than his prediction, at least if one were to consider the pace of the advancements in AI and robotics.

“Obviously people can play this back in 20 years and say, ‘Look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction and it’s not true,’ but I think it will turn out to be true, that in less than 20 years, maybe even as little as ten or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional,” Musk said.

Elon Musk’s comments echo his previous sentiments at Tesla’s 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting, where he noted that Optimus could ultimately eliminate poverty. He also noted that robots like Optimus could eventually provide people worldwide with the best medical care.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mary-barra-elon-musk-tesla-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:18.651456

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

“From day one I’ve been taking action to make buying a car more affordable.” Trump said at a White House event that included top executives from two of the largest U.S. automakers.

The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,” Trump said.

Automakers applaud and environmentalists decry rule change

The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” he said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the mileage standards “with real world market conditions.”

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Environmentalists decried the rollback.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,’' said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program. “This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.”

‘People want the gasoline car’

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

Trump called Democrats’ efforts to promote EVs “insane,” adding, “People want the gasoline car.”

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety administration was empowered to update the requirements.

The new rules “are going to allow the automakers to make vehicles that Americans want to purchase, not vehicles that Joe Biden and (former Transportation Secretary Pete) Buttigieg want to build,” Duffy said Wednesday.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the traffic safety administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and 4,870 additional tons a year of smog components such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

“Weakening fuel economy standards won’t do much to make cars more affordable but is certain to make Americans buy a lot more gasoline,’' said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association.

The action also harms domestic manufacturers that have invested heavily in EV technologies and hired thousands of employees to build them, Gore said.

GM CEO skips White House event

Notably absent Wednesday was General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who was attending a previously scheduled event in New York City, a company spokesperson said. A GM plant manager represented the automaker at the White House instead.

Like Ford and Stellantis, GM has poured billions of dollars into electrification of its fleet. In a statement, the company said it “supports the goals” of the proposed rule. “We remain committed to offering the best and broadest portfolio of electric and gas-powered vehicles on the market,” GM said.

Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.

The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.

The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,"" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.

Rules would sharply lower mileage standard

If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.

On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were ""completely unattainable"" for automakers. He initially directed NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.

The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.

NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. ""Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,"" he said in a statement.

Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives. In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards ""with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.""

General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.

""GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,"" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.

The fuel economy proposal would roll back a rule finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.

At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.

The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.

Would new MPG rules ease car prices?

CarEdge CEO Zach Shefka described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.

If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, ""It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.""

The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.

""Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/03/1d0f2fc1-693c-4769-8b78-4c32e0856ef7/thumbnail/1200x630/2067cfd9e31e4bc990e1801cbd48d047/gettyimages-2248020840.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 18:03:38.589687

The Plumbing and Heating Federation (SNIPEF) has welcomed the UK Government’s announcement of a UK-wide clean energy jobs plan (19 October), describing it as an important and positive move that finally recognises the essential role of plumbing and heating engineers in delivering clean energy systems.

SNIPEF said the announcement rightly celebrates the professional trades who will install, maintain and decommission the low-carbon systems that make clean energy possible in homes and businesses.

However, the Federation cautioned that affordability must remain central to the green transition. The call comes after the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change urged the Government to reconsider its target to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030, warning that the rush to build new renewable capacity could push up energy costs and strain supply chains. The Institute argued that clean power must be affordable power if it is to deliver both economic growth and public support.

Fiona Hodgson, Chief Executive of SNIPEF, said: “We fully support the Government’s ambition to build a cleaner, more secure energy future and we are pleased that this announcement recognises the vital contribution of plumbers and heating engineers.

“Too often, the focus is on infrastructure and large projects, when in fact it is our skilled tradespeople who bring these technologies to life in people’s homes and communities.

“Our recent letter to the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, raised the same concern now being discussed by the Tony Blair Institute. Electricity prices remain disproportionately high compared with gas, which discourages households from switching to low-carbon heating. The green transition is essential, but it must not add to cost-of-living pressures or undermine consumer confidence.”

SNIPEF said it stands ready to work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero to create a clear pathway that addresses price imbalances, supports skills and training, and ensures that the transition to clean energy remains both affordable and achievable for households across the UK.

“This is a moment to bring policy ambition and practical delivery together,” Hodgson added. “Our members are the professionals who will make clean heating work on the ground.

The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The rules will increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford, officials said. The administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

Trump announced the plan at a White House event that included top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers, who have praised the planned changes. The auto industry has complained that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards “with real world market conditions.”

Environmentalists decried the decision.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Gutting the (gas-mileage) program will make cars burn more gas and American families burn more cash,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly,” she said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today. The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The 2024 standards would have saved 14 billion gallons of gasoline from being burned by 2050, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s 2024 calculations. Abandoning them means that in 2035, cars could produce 22,111 more tons of carbon dioxide per year than under the Biden-era rules. It also means an extra 90 tons a year of deadly soot particles and more 4,870 tons a year of smog components nitrogen oxide volatile organic carbons going into the air in coming years.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas.
We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.","Dear Ms. Wantlin:

On behalf of our millions of members and supporters nationwide, we write to share comments on the open regulatory docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-1477, Visibility Protection: Regional Haze State Plan Requirements Rule Revision. We strongly urge the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that any revisions or changes to the Regional Haze Rule safeguard: 1) the Rule’s primary goal to reduce visibility impairing pollution in Class I areas and 2) the requirement for states to make continued, reasonable progress toward natural visibility in Class I areas. We are concerned the EPA is headed in a direction that will run contrary to the visibility goals of the Clean Air Act, weaken the Regional Haze Rule and undermine years of consistent agency interpretation and progress toward cleaner air in parks and wilderness areas.

From coast to coast, national parks and wilderness areas protect and conserve the country’s most unique and diverse landscapes, wildlife habitats, cultural resources and ecosystems. From the soaring peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park to the swamp of Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, to the high desert of Joshua Tree National Park to the stunning vistas at Dolly Sods Wilderness Area, Class I areas around the country attract visitors from all over the world to enjoy their splendor. These areas also safeguard our country’s stories and cultural resources, educating visitors on our shared history. But apart from their value to our national story, these landscapes preserve an invaluable asset to the thriving tourism and outdoor recreation public lands economy. The future of these places depends on healthy ecosystems and positive visitor experiences. In 2023 alone, outdoor recreation added over $639 billion to the national economy and supported nearly 5 million jobs.

While most air pollution doesn’t originate in our beloved national parks or wilderness areas, it can travel hundreds of miles from its original source, affecting parks and communities near and far. Air pollution from coal plants, oil and gas development, chemical and plastics manufacturers, pulp and paper mills, vehicles, and other industrial facilities, is one of the most serious threats facing national parks, threatening the health of park visitors, wildlife, and neighboring communities, compromising our views with hazy skies and driving the climate crisis.

The Regional Haze Rule is a time-tested, effective program that requires federal and state agencies, federal land managers and stakeholders to work together to restore clear skies in 156 national parks and wilderness areas (Class I areas). The Haze Rule has delivered significant cost-effective clean air benefits to national parks, wilderness areas and communities across the nation in the past 15 years—over 1.4 million tons of visibility impairing pollution has been reduced, improving scenic views and making air healthier to breathe across the nation. In places like Great Smoky Mountains National Park, visibility has increased by nearly 40 miles from haze pollution reductions. But there is still a lot of work to do as visitors regularly miss out on over 50 miles of scenic views and experience unhealthy air when visiting these treasured places.

According to National Parks Conservation Association’s Polluted Parks 2024 analysis, 97% of national parks continue to suffer from unsatisfactory levels of hazy skies, indicating they are far from achieving naturally clean air. And since air pollution knows no boundaries, communities across the country are negatively affected by the same air pollution that harms Class I areas. Air pollution causes illnesses, drives up healthcare costs, and has harmful and disproportionate consequences on communities of color and low-income communities that often live closest to the polluting sources and already face chronic environmental injustices.

While EPA’s Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) outlines three broad topic areas, our comments are overarching in nature. Overall, we urge EPA to abandon many of the noted “alternative approaches” as they run contrary to the text and purpose of the Clean Air Act and EPA’s prior interpretations of the Act’s regional haze requirements. Additionally, the “alternative approaches” could drastically modify the essential elements of the Regional Haze Rule. We reject any efforts by EPA that would weaken the effectiveness of the program by:

Allowing states to evade installing cost effective controls to clean up controllable park-harming pollution and to claim that no pollution reductions are necessary.

Eliminating requirements for states to develop regular and much-needed regional haze plans to identify how they will advance their state toward air quality improvements to benefit parks and wilderness areas with the goal of restoring natural visibility.

Allowing states to avoid identifying necessary emission reduction measures based on the four reasonable progress factors set forth by Congress.

Allowing states to claim that past achievements in visibility impairment or emissions reductions are sufficient for satisfying current obligations.

If EPA pursues revisions to the Regional Haze Rule, we offer the following recommendations to ensure that states, decisionmakers and industrial facilities that emit haze pollutants are held accountable to the national, bipartisan goal of achieving natural visibility in Class I areas:

Requiring all dominant pollutants (NOx, SO2 and PM) that contribute to haze and visibility impairment are assessed in haze plans. Previously, states have been allowed to focus only on one dominant pollutant and have skipped analysis of others, even when controlling other pollutants could be cost effective and demonstrably improve visibility in parks and wilderness areas.

Clarifying that a Class I area’s Uniform Rate of Progress (URP) glidepath is not a safe harbor against further reasonable progress, meaning that states cannot declare victory before the end goal of natural visibility is achieved. Amidst additional easing of other air pollution regulations by this administration, we believe states must still analyze available control measures to reduce emissions from in-state facilities; they cannot reject controls that are reasonable just because Class I areas impacted by that state’s pollution were previously projected to be at or below their URP glidepaths.

Clarifying and providing clear direction on source selection and evaluation by states. In previous planning periods, states have failed to evaluate all haze pollution sources, including mobile and area sources, which allows for some sectors and facilities to be left off the hook for cleaning up their emissions.

Improve and strengthen state-to-state consultation requirements and Federal Land Manager consultation requirements to ensure feedback is meaningfully addressed.

Protect and maintain comprehensive air monitoring and scientifically sound, best practices for measuring haze impairment that are the essential foundations for tracking visibility improvement. Ensure that consistent, short- and long-term air pollution data gathering is maintained to safeguard park visitors and staff.

Although progress has been made in many Class I areas around the country, no Class I area has achieved the goal of natural visibility and we cannot allow good momentum to be halted. Furthermore, many sources of air pollution that were expected to retire, clean up or otherwise reduce emissions can no longer be assumed to be on that same course given dramatic changes in the last year to clean air policies, facility or pollution control operations and pollution exemptions granted by presidential decree.

Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas. We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.

Thank you for considering our comments.

Yet, Hyundai maintains its electrification strategy, which already spans HEV, PHEV, and BEV models, and will soon include Extended-Range Electric Vehicles (EREV), was never dependent on government whims.

As Olabisi Boyle, Senior VP of Product Planning for Hyundai Motor North America, candidly stated: “Our EV strategy was never based on current politics… We were building an EV plant and had the E-GMP platform before the IRA”.

While Boyle confirms that EV sales did slump in November 2025 compared to the frenzy of 2024, she urges critical thinking. She argues that massive October sales, like the Ioniq 5‘s best-ever month of 8,408 units, were driven artificially high by customers rushing to grab the credit before it expired. Year-To-Date figures tell a different story. The Ioniq 5 is up 12% over 2024. EV sales aren’t cratering; they are simply stabilizing after the government’s free-money hangover.

Hyundai was prepared for this pivot, immediately announcing deep price cuts on the Ioniq 5, in some trims, exceeding the former $7,500 federal handout, sometimes reaching $9,800. This aggressive move was intentional, designed to appeal to the “middle of the adoption curve”, the consumers who prioritize affordability and ease of use over bleeding-edge status. Boyle explained that Hyundai works backward with R&D, setting a target price point for years out, and adjusts material costs and options to meet it.

Beyond affordability, the infrastructure gap remains the next great hurdle. Hyundai’s solution? EREVs. This tech, where a gasoline engine acts purely as a generator, solves the consumer’s chief complaint: range anxiety. “People like to hear ‘I can get 600 miles of range.’ With the EREV, you can get that”, Boyle explained. This is especially relevant for large vehicles like the newly announced mid-size pickup truck, where an all-electric solution is harder to sell for customers who need maximum towing and distance.",https://www.clubalfa.it/en/assets/media/2025/12/result_2025-ioniq-5.webp,N,,2025-12-03 17:04:22.461715

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult.
As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course.
The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss – or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.
If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith – and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.","Few political alliances in recent American history have seemed as solid as the one between Donald Trump and the country’s farmers. Through three elections, farmers stood by Trump even as tariffs, trade wars and labor shortages squeezed profits.

But Trump’s second term may be different.

A new round of administration policies now cuts deeper into farmers’ livelihoods – not just squeezing profits but reshaping how farms survive – through renewed tariffs on agricultural products, visa restrictions on farmworkers, reduced farm subsidies and open favoritism toward South American agricultural competitors.

In the past, farmers’ loyalty to Trump has overridden economics. In our study of the 2018–19 trade war between the U.S. and China, we found that farmers in Trump-voting counties kept planting soybeans even though the trade war’s effects were clear: Their costs would rise and their profits would fall. Farmers in Democratic-leaning counties, by contrast, shifted acreage toward alternatives such as corn or wheat that were likely to be more profitable. For many pro-Trump farmers, political belief outweighed market logic – at least in the short term.

Today, the economic effects of policies affecting farmers are broader and deeper – and the resolve that carried farmers’ support for Trump through the first trade war may no longer be enough.

Tariffs: The familiar pain returns

The revived U.S.-China trade conflict has again placed soybeans at its center. In March 2025, Beijing suspended import licenses for several major U.S. soybean exporters following new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump countered with a new round of reciprocal tariffs, broadening the list of Chinese imports hit and raising rates on already targeted goods.

An October 2025 deal promised China would buy 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans a year, but relief has proved mostly symbolic.

Before the 2018-19 trade war, China regularly imported 30 million to 36 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans annually — more than one-third of all American soybean exports. Now, Beijing has signed long-term contracts with Brazil and Argentina, leaving U.S. producers with shrinking overseas demand for their crops.

Prices remain roughly 40% to 50% below pre-2018 levels, and farmers are storing record volumes of unsold soybeans.

In 2019, the federal government cushioned those losses with over $23 billion in bailout payments to farmers. This time, Republican leaders show little appetite for another bailout. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s funds for farm relief are running low, leaving farmers with lower prices and less support.

Labor: Fewer hands, higher costs

Farms are also short of workers. Roughly 42% of U.S. crop workers lack legal status, according to the National Agricultural Workers Survey. Tougher immigration enforcement and slower visa processing have thinned the labor pool just as production costs are surging. Hired-labor expenses rose 14.4% from 2021 to 2022 and another 15.2% the following year, and costs such as fertilizer, equipment and parts climbed sharply.

Many growers are turning to the H-2A guest worker program – a legal pipeline for seasonal foreign labor that has quadrupled in size over the past decade. But it is expensive: Farms must pay the adverse effect wage rate, a federally set pay rate that is more than twice the regular federal minimum wage. And farms must provide every H-2A worker with free housing and free transportation to and from the U.S., as well as from their housing to the worksite. Large agribusinesses can absorb those costs; small family farms often cannot.

As exports collapsed in late September, the head of the American Soybean Association wrote a public letter to the White House begging for help, saying, “We’ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.” The hard-line immigration policy approach that rallies rural voters is also pushing smaller farms to the brink – forcing them to ask what their loyalty still buys.

Subsidies and symbolism: The Argentina shock

The question of the value of farmers’ loyalty sharpened in the fall of 2025 when the U.S. Treasury approved a $20 billion currency-swap deal with Argentina – supporting the country’s president, Javier Milei, a political ally of Trump, while the country remains a direct agricultural competitor.

U.S. farmers, already frustrated by low prices and visa delays, took it as an insult. Argentina is among the world’s largest soybean exporters, and U.S. farm groups asked why the federal government would underwrite a competitor while trimming support for American producers at home.

The tension deepened when Trump floated the idea of buying Argentinian beef for U.S. markets – a remark one Kansas rancher called “an absolute betrayal.” The plan may be economically minor, but symbolically it pierced the “America First” narrative that had helped hold the farm vote together.

Clean energy: The new rural subsidy under threat

For decades, the farm vote relied on federally funded support programs – crop insurance, price guarantees and disaster assistance – which account for a significant share of net farm income. Over the past five years, a quieter lifeline has emerged: renewable energy.

Wind and solar projects have brought jobs, tax revenue and steady lease payments to rural counties that have been losing both population and farm income for decades. Iowa now gets about 63% of its electricity from wind, while Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas have seen significant growth.

That momentum has stalled. In August 2025, a U.S. Treasury Department policy change froze billions in rural investment in renewable energy projects. Industry trackers report that prolonged uncertainty has pushed many Midwestern renewable projects into limbo.

For farmers, this isn’t an abstract climate debate — it’s a lost income stream. Leasing land for turbines or solar panels brought in tens of thousands of dollars a year and kept many family farms afloat.

The freeze wipes out one of the few growth engines in rural America and highlights an irony at the heart of Trump’s message: The administration that promises to protect the heartland is dismantling the clean energy investments that were finally helping it diversify.

Politics: How deep does loyalty run?

As our research found, during the first trade war, Trump-voting counties absorbed heavy financial losses without changing course. That loyalty was propped up by subsidies – and by hope. This time, neither cushion is secure.

Many farmers still share Trump’s skepticism of Washington and global elites. But shrinking federal backing, tighter labor and a competitor’s bailout cut close to home. The question now is whether cultural identity can keep outweighing material loss – or whether the second trade war will signal a deeper political shift.

No sudden collapse of rural support for Trump is likely; cultural loyalty doesn’t fade overnight. But strain is visible. Farm groups are quietly pressing for pragmatic trade policy and visa reform, and several Republican governors now lobby for labor flexibility rather than tougher enforcement.

If the first Trump trade war tested farmers’ wallets, this one tests their faith – and faith, once shaken, is far harder to restore.

We look forward to welcoming additional partners and helping communities across Illinois recover and recycle hundreds of thousands of gallons of leftover paint.""","A program operated by PaintCare Inc. in Illinois that started early this month has been designed to recover and recycle or repurpose leftover paint generated by homeowners and small businesses.

According to PaintCare, the new recycling program enables households and businesses to recycle leftover paint, stain and varnish through an expected collection network of more than 250 drop-off sites in the state.

PaintCare, a Washington-based nonprofit organization created by paint companies that comprise the membership of the American Coatings Association (ACA), says the program relies on partnerships with paint and hardware retail stores and local government facilities.

""We're excited to bring PaintCare to Illinois, giving families and businesses, easy, year-round options for recycling leftover paint,"" says Michael W. Johnson, CEO of the ACA. ""Our goal is to make it easy and convenient to 'recycle the rest,' creating a responsible solution for our industry that benefits everyone who uses paint and the environment.""

The paint recycling program is a response to a paint stewardship law that was passed unopposed by the Illinois Legislature and signed into law by Gov. JB Pritzker in 2023.

Under this law, paint manufacturers are required to develop and implement a cost-effective paint stewardship program that will reduce the generation of leftover paint, promote paint reuse and recycling, and manage the postconsumer paint waste stream using environmentally sound management practices. Oversight for the program will be provided by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

""The launch of the PaintCare program represents an important step forward in expanding crucial recycling options for Illinois households and businesses,"" Illinois EPA Director James Jennings says.

PaintCare's Illinois program follows similar paint stewardship laws and programs in California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Rhode Island, Oregon, Vermont and the state of Washington, plus a program that is being developed for Maryland.

Its sites accept both latex and oil-based paint products, including interior and exterior paints, primers, stains, sealers and varnishes. Paint must be dropped off in its original container with its original manufacturer's label.

""Illinois paint and hardware retailers, along with local government facilities, are essential partners in this effort,"" says Ross Dudzik, Illinois Program Manager for PaintCare. “Their willingness to volunteer space and serve as convenient drop-off locations is truly the backbone of this program.

Dive Brief:

U.S. data center power demand could reach 106 GW in 2035, BloombergNEF said Monday in one of the more aggressive load growth estimates to date. The U.S. had about 25 GW of operating data centers in 2024, Bloom Energy said earlier this year.

BloombergNEF’s latest forecast is 36% higher than its previous prediction, released in April. The jump is due in part to the higher average size of the 150 significant U.S. data center projects announced in the past year, over a quarter of which are larger than 500 MW, BNEF said.

The Energy Information Administration, which tracks demand for the federal government, generally only publishes detailed projections out two or three years, and few other analyses have attempted firm forecasts as far out as 2035.

Dive Insight:

BNEF’s report comes as some energy industry analysts and executives warn that an artificial intelligence bubble or speculative data center proposals could be fueling excessive load growth projections.

A report from Grid Strategies released last month said utility forecasts of 90 GW additional data center load by 2030 were likely overstated; market analysis indicates load growth in that time frame is likely closer to 65 GW, it said.

A July report from the Department of Energy estimated an additional 100 GW of new peak capacity is needed by 2030, of which 50 GW is attributable to data centers. Those facilities could account for as much as 12% of peak demand by 2028, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

BNEF’s data center project tracker shows the industry diversifying beyond traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia, metro Atlanta and central Ohio into exurban and rural regions served by existing fiber-optic trunk lines for data traffic.

A map of under-construction, committed and early-stage projects shows gigawatts of planned data center capacity spreading south through Virginia and the Carolinas, up through eastern Pennsylvania and outward from Chicago along the Lake Michigan shore. More data centers are also planned for Texas and the Gulf Coast states.

Much of the capacity is poised to materialize on grids overseen by the PJM Interconnection, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. BNEF predicts PJM alone could add 31 GW of data center load over the next five years, about 3 GW more than expected capacity additions from new generation.

With the expected surge, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned late last year of “elevated risk” of summer electricity shortfalls this year, in 2026 and onward in all three regions.

Some experts disputed NERC’s methodology, however. MISO’s independent market monitor said in June that the group’s analysis was flawed and that MISO was in a better position than grid regions not expected to see exponential data center growth, like ISO New England and the New York Independent System Operator.

Other technology and energy system analysts expect a significant amount of proposed data center capacity to dissipate in the coming years due to chip shortages, duplicative permit requests and other factors.

In July, London Economics International said in a report prepared for the Southern Environmental Law Center that meeting projections for U.S. data center load in 2030 would require 90% of global chip supply — a scenario it called “unrealistic.”

Patricia Taylor, director of policy and research at the American Public Power Association, told Utility Dive earlier this year that it’s common for data center developers to “shop around” the same project across neighboring jurisdictions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/eW89R5lJ_TOSx3sYtZr6_9z-aPypZ1yRLRlfHQtuWyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9kYXRhX2NlbnRlcl9WZXJub25fQ2FsaWZvcm5pYS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:20.839997

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable.","The South Carolina Public Service Commission (PSC) is reviewing settlements reached between Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) regarding their separate proposals to increase electric rates across the state.

The agreements — reached after months of proceedings and public input — would reduce the size of the proposed increases while maintaining commitments to reliable service and customer assistance.

For many South Carolinians, understanding what these settlements mean can help them prepare for potential changes in their utility bills in the coming year.

Why This Matters

South Carolina households already pay some of the highest electricity bills in the country. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, South Carolina residents spend about 20% more on electricity than the national average.

Because of these high costs, even modest rate increases can affect family budgets, especially for older adults and those living on fixed incomes. AARP South Carolina continues to monitor developments in the energy sector to help residents understand how rate changes impact affordability and everyday living costs.

Overview of the Settlements

Both Duke Energy Progress (DEP) and Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) filed requests with the PSC in 2025 to raise residential electric rates. After negotiations among the utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates, both companies reached separate settlement agreements that are now before the PSC for review.

These settlements include several key provisions:

Return on Equity (ROE): Duke agreed to a 9.99% ROE, down from the requested 10.85%. The ROE helps determine how much profit the company can earn while recovering its costs to operate and invest in infrastructure.

Basic Facilities Charge: The monthly Residential Basic Facilities Charge — the fixed fee customers pay before using electricity — will remain at $11.78, rather than increasing to $13.00 as initially requested.

Customer Assistance Programs: Both companies have committed shareholder funds to assist customers facing financial hardship through the Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) programs.

DEP: $750,000 per year for two years.

DEC: $1.5 million per year for two years.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Savings: Duke will apply temporary bill credits, or “decrement riders,” to return federal tax savings from the Inflation Reduction Act to customers.

DEP: $10 million over two years.

DEC: $100 million over 22 months.

How This Affects Residential Customers

If the PSC approves the settlements, most residential customers will see smaller increases than originally proposed.

Duke Energy Progress (DEP) customers would see an average 7.3% increase, rather than the proposed 15%. A typical residential bill would rise about $11.23 per month instead of $21.66.

Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) customers would see an average 0.6% increase, rather than 7.6%. A typical residential bill would rise about $0.84 per month instead of $10.38.

The new rates are expected to take effect February 1, 2026, pending PSC approval.

These changes reflect efforts to balance the company’s need to maintain infrastructure with the financial realities faced by consumers across South Carolina.

Additional Settlement Provisions

In addition to rate changes, the settlements include several agreements that will shape how energy rates and programs are managed in the coming years:

Large Load Customers: By June 1, 2026, Duke and other stakeholders will jointly petition the PSC to review rate-making structures for very large customers (50 megawatts and above), such as data centers and manufacturing operations.

Energy Efficiency and Demand-Side Management (EE/DSM): Within six months of Duke’s planned merger approval, the company will file a petition to review its EE/DSM portfolios. These programs help reduce energy consumption, promote efficiency, and potentially lower long-term costs for customers.

Merger-Related Commitments: Both settlements outline conditions tied to the proposed combination of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, including how future rate filings will be handled and how customer benefits from federal tax credits will continue to be applied.

What Consumers Should Know

Even with smaller increases than initially proposed, electricity costs remain a growing concern for many households. AARP South Carolina encourages residents to:

Review their utility bills carefully once new rates take effect to understand how the changes apply to their usage.

Explore available assistance programs, including Duke’s Customer Assistance and Relief Effort (CARE) program and other community-based utility assistance initiatives.

Take advantage of energy efficiency programs that may help reduce monthly costs, such as weatherization and appliance upgrade rebates.

Stay informed about PSC proceedings, especially as the merger between Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas advances and new rate cases are filed.

The Bigger Picture: Energy Costs in South Carolina

The settlements highlight the ongoing challenge of maintaining reliable energy infrastructure while keeping rates affordable. As South Carolina continues to grow, the demand for energy — especially from industries, data centers, and new developments — is expected to increase.

At the same time, extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the transition to cleaner energy sources are putting additional pressure on utilities and regulators.

Balancing these priorities will remain a central issue for state policymakers, consumer advocates, and residents alike.

AARP South Carolina will continue to follow these developments and share information to help consumers make informed decisions about energy use, assistance programs, and rate changes that affect their household budgets.

Holtec Ends New Mexico Waste Site Plans and Secures Major Federal Deal

After deciding it would abandon plans to build another nuclear waste storage site in southeastern New Mexico, Holtec Government Services landed a major federal contract regarding the building of small modular reactors in the U.S.

DOE Announces Major Federal Funding for SMR Projects

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the selection of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Holtec Government Services to support early deployments of advanced light-water small modular reactors (SMRs) in the United States.

The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the Nation’s capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains.

The selections announced will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains, and advance President Trump’s Executive Orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda.

Federal Leaders Emphasize Need for Rapid Nuclear Deployment

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

Project Teams and Funding Breakdown

With the announcement, DOE is supporting the following first-mover teams to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States:

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) — $400,000,000

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, demonstrating viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad.

Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) — $400,000,000

TVA plans to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl.

Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

DOE Pushes for Rapid Nuclear Growth to Meet Demand

As the nation prepares for continued growth in electricity demand, President Trump has charged DOE with adding new, affordable and reliable energy to keep America energy secure. Small modular reactors offer flexible deployment, proven technology, and the ability to leverage existing supply chains, making them one of the fastest and most scalable pathways to new nuclear capacity.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.",,N,,2025-12-03 18:04:00.844156

CoE Strategy on the Environment","Opening remarks for Mr Gianluca Esposito

Acknowledge the President of the Deputies, Ambassador Cujba; the GME Chair, Ambassador Diamantopoulou; the Chair of the PC-ENV, Mr Pepřík; Council of Europe authorities; ambassadors; members of the GME; and Permanent Representatives present.

Warmly welcome participants to this important occasion on behalf of the Secretary General.

Thank the Moldovan Presidency of the Committee of Ministers for its strong support for the Council of Europe’s environment-related activities.

Recall that at the Ministerial Session in May, Ministers adopted two landmark texts:

the Council of Europe Strategy on the Environment, a forward-looking and holistic vision reaffirming the inseparable link between a healthy environment, human rights, the rule of law and democracy; and

the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law, a global, legally binding instrument designed to help States prevent, prosecute and sanction the most serious environmental crimes.

Refer back to the 4th Summit of Heads of State and Government in Reykjavík (2023), where European leaders committed to intensifying efforts against climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss — commitments that this Strategy and Convention help to realise.

Highlight the Organisation’s determination to put the Strategy into action and to strengthen international cooperation. In this respect, welcome the recent CM decision to establish the Steering Committee on Environment (CDENV), which will play a pivotal role in ensuring effective implementation of the Strategy and its Action Plan.

Underline that the Strategy stresses building stronger partnerships. Announce, in this context:

the process of finalising a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Environment Programme, to advance our shared objective of addressing the impact of the triple planetary crisis on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law; and

the Council of Europe’s participation in COP30 in Belém, with a series of side events exploring the intersection of human rights, climate action and democratic governance.

Recall that, under Objective 2 of the Strategy, the GME will tomorrow hold a thematic debate on environment, disinformation and misinformation, with UN rapporteurs, experts, Parties to relevant international treaties and civil society representatives.

Recall that, under Objective 3, the Council of Europe will host the First European Forum of Environmental Human Rights Defenders on 3–4 June 2026 at Headquarters — a joint initiative with the UN and EU to foster multi-stakeholder dialogue and support a safe and enabling environment for environmental defenders.

Highlight that, under Objective 4, the opening for signature of the new Convention sends a powerful message: protecting the environment is a shared responsibility, requiring determination, legal certainty and collective will.

Congratulate the States that will sign today and encourage all others to do so as soon as possible, to help ensure this important Convention enters into force swiftly.

Recall that, under Objective 5, the Organisation recently held a Ministerial Conference marking the 25th anniversary of the Landscape Convention, resulting in the adoption of the Florence Declaration.

Underline that the Florence Declaration encapsulates the unique contribution the Council of Europe can make to international, national and societal efforts to secure a clean, healthy and sustainable environment for all — now and for future generations — in line with Objective 1 of the Strategy.

Highlight the strong link between social development, social rights and environmental protection, as recognised in the Doha Political Declaration adopted at the recent World Summit for Social Development.

Recall the Secretary General’s New Democratic Pact for Europe, which places social justice, public health, and environmental protection at the heart of democratic governance, reflecting the ambitions of the Strategy, notably Objective 2.

Conclude by stressing that, ultimately, our work on the environment is about human and social rights; about resilience, justice and the strength of our democracies — the very essence of what the Council of Europe stands for.

Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R.
Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.
Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.
The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA.","On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (90 Fed. Reg. 82320, Nov. 20, 2025). The agencies’ proposal responds directly to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), and aims to align federal jurisdiction with the Court’s limitations while reducing ambiguity for regulators and regulated entities.

If finalized, this rule could significantly reduce the number of CWA Section 404 and Section 401 permits required for greenfield and infrastructure development, especially in areas with ephemeral or isolated water features. However, stakeholders should be aware that state-level regulatory responses are likely, particularly in jurisdictions that traditionally exercised broader water protections.

Summary of Key Changes to WOTUS Rule

1. Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(a))

The proposed rule narrows the WOTUS definition by specifying only two jurisdictional categories:

Traditional Navigable Waters (TNWs)

Relatively Permanent Waters and Their Adjacent Wetlands

This excludes several previously jurisdictional features and emphasizes Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” test.

2. “Relatively Permanent” Standard Clarified (§ 120.2(c)(7))

The rule defines “relatively permanent” as surface waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or during the “wet season.” The “wet season” is defined as periods when monthly precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, based on long-term climatic data. Ephemeral streams, by contrast, are excluded under § 120.2(d)(4).

Additionally, such waters must:

Possess a bed and bank

Connect to a downstream jurisdictional water via a relatively permanent flow path (§ 120.2(c)(7)(ii))

Tributaries that flow only in response to precipitation events—i.e., ephemeral streams—are no longer jurisdictional.

3. Adjacent Wetlands Must Be Physically and Hydrologically Connected (§ 120.2(c)(8))

Jurisdictional wetlands must:

Physically abut a jurisdictional water (e.g., TNW or relatively permanent water)

Have surface water continuously present during the wet season

Critically, the rule clarifies that a wetland separated from jurisdictional waters by discrete features (e.g., levees, berms, or culverts) is not “adjacent” unless surface water is continuously present on both sides during the wet season (§ 120.2(c)(8)(ii)).

4. Elimination of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

Interstate waters are no longer jurisdictional based solely on their interstate nature. They must independently qualify under the revised categories (§ 120.2(b)(1)).

Expanded and Clarified Exclusions (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(d))

The rule proposes new clarity around exclusions:

Groundwater is expressly excluded, including tile-drained and subsurface flows (§ 120.2(d)(1))

Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely in dry land are excluded, even if they eventually convey relatively permanent flow (§ 120.2(d)(3))

Prior Converted Cropland retains its exemption unless abandoned for >5 years and reverted to a WOTUS-qualifying wetland (§ 120.2(d)(2))

Waste Treatment Systems are excluded under an expanded definition that includes treatment ponds, lagoons, and infiltration systems (§ 120.2(d)(5))

Section 404(f) Farming Exemptions remain unchanged, continuing to protect routine agricultural discharges (§ 120.2(f))

Implications for CWA Permitting Programs

CWA Section 404: Fewer Permits, Fewer Delays

By narrowing the scope of WOTUS, the agencies expect a marked reduction in Section 404 permit obligations, particularly for projects involving ephemeral streams and non-abutting wetlands. This is likely to reduce costs, project delays, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) triggers tied to Section 404 actions.

Notably, in arid or semi-arid regions, where ephemeral waters dominate, the proposal could eliminate permitting requirements for many previously regulated features.

CWA Section 401: Reduced Certification Burden

Because Section 401 certifications are contingent on federal permits, the expected decline in Section 404 permits will lead to fewer 401 certification requests. This may reduce administrative workload for state and tribal agencies.

CWA Section 402: Nuanced Impact

Discharges from point sources to waters no longer deemed jurisdictional may no longer require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, permit obligations may persist if pollutants ultimately reach a WOTUS via hydrological or artificial conveyance systems.

State Response and Potential Regulatory Gaps

While the proposed rule reduces federal oversight, it acknowledges that states and tribes may respond by expanding state-level jurisdiction (90 Fed. Reg. at 82325). Currently, at least 24 states regulate waters more broadly than the federal standard, including Washington, Oregon, and California. These states may develop or expand dredge-and-fill programs to fill potential regulatory gaps.

For instance, Washington State has already initiated steps to establish a Section 404 analog at the state level, ensuring continuity in environmental protection despite federal contraction.

What Should Stakeholders Do Now?

Below are key considerations and timely moves that stakeholders may want to discuss with counsel:

Map and Assess: Identify and reassess project site water features under the revised definitions.

Engage in the Rulemaking: Public comments are due by January 5, 2026, and may be submitted through regulations.gov under Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OW–2025–0322.

Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.

Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA. While it is expected to ease permitting burdens and regulatory costs for developers, energy firms, and agricultural stakeholders, it also introduces complexities at the state level that merit close attention.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16024_4443.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 17:03:56.756443

The report found that a failure to plan and build sufficient transmission capacity has led certain grid operators to institute interconnection queue-rationing frameworks. While certain rationing mechanisms may accelerate generation projects, some sacrifice fairness, transparency, and adherence to open-access principles.

Further, prioritizing specific generation projects over others undermines fair competition and introduces regulatory uncertainty. It would also likely raising costs for consumers.

“Using interconnection rationing frameworks can undermine fair competition principles and hurt American consumers,” ACORE President and CEO Ray Long said. “It’s important that the discriminatory processes are truly one-time solutions as grid operators continue to implement FERC-mandated transmission planning and interconnection reforms.”

The report evaluates recent proposals from the grid operators in California, the Great Plains, the region covering the Midwest to the Gulf States, and Mid-Atlantic. It proposes a two-path framework for ensuring access and competition.

The first steps are ensuring any “fast-lane” approaches are last-resort use only when certain conditions are met and integrating interconnection with proactive transmission planning to prioritize commercially ready and policy-aligned resources.

“Between retiring capacity and rising demand, grid operators across the country face resource adequacy challenges exacerbated by the interconnection queue backlog,” said Houtan Moaveni, vice president at Grid Strategies and lead author on the report. “Our report offers a framework for grid operators to strategically manage the interconnection queue and bring critical generation online quickly without sacrificing transparency and competitiveness.”

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/President-Bush-with-corn-2048x1437.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:24.361020

Duffy also said Trump's reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.

During Biden's term, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

Trump said the auto industry complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

Wednesday 03 December 2025 18:50 GMT

The Trump administration is set to announce a significant rollback of federal fuel standards, which were originally designed to encourage the sale of electric vehicles.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal will reduce fuel economy requirements for vehicles from model years 2022 to 2031.

This decision contrasts with the Biden administration's earlier plans to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements to around 50 miles per gallon by 2031.

The heads of major US automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, and GM, will join Trump for the announcement, hailing the move as ""a win for common sense.""

Duffy also said Trump's reset is projected to save more than 1,500 lives and prevent nearly a quarter-million serious injuries through 2050.

During Biden's term, automakers were required to average about 50 miles per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

Trump said the auto industry complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

What Happened

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, VR Advisory Services increased its stake in ProPetro (PUMP +7.43%) during the third quarter. The fund bought 2.5 million additional shares, raising its position value to $19.3 million at quarter-end. ProPetro accounted for 4.7% of the fund’s $412.4 million in reportable equity assets.

NYSE: IRS: $31.4 million (7.6% of AUM)

NYSE: AL: $23.9 million (5.8% of AUM)

As of Wednesday, shares of ProPetro were priced at $10.38, up 22% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 13% in the same period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

ProPetro offers hydraulic fracturing, cementing, acidizing, and coiled tubing services primarily to oil and gas exploration and production companies.

The company generates revenue by providing pressure pumping and related oilfield services to North American energy producers.

It serves upstream oil and gas operators focused on developing North American oil and natural gas resources.

ProPetro is a leading oilfield services provider specializing in hydraulic fracturing and complementary well completion solutions. The company leverages a modern fleet and technical expertise to support efficient resource development for North American energy producers. With a strong regional presence and a focus on operational reliability, ProPetro aims to deliver cost-effective, high-performance services in a competitive market.

Foolish Take

ProPetro is in the middle of a strategic pivot, expanding beyond traditional completions into a long-duration power business (PROPWR) that’s starting to show real commercial traction. For long-term investors, a fund adding to this name now suggests conviction that the company’s cash-generating core and its emerging power platform can coexist—even in a choppy oilfield services cycle. And with shares still down sharply from multi-year peaks, the bet hinges on durability rather than momentum.

VR Advisory’s increased position comes just as ProPetro posted a resilient third quarter: Revenue fell 10% to $294 million and adjusted EBITDA declined to $35 million, but the completions business still produced $25 million in free cash flow, and the company ended the quarter with $158 million in liquidity. PROPWR was the standout. Management locked in more than 150 megawatts of contracted capacity and expects to exceed 220 MW by year-end, with ambitions to reach 1 gigawatt by 2030. That expansion is capital-intensive, but a new $350 million lease facility is designed to fund it without stretching the balance sheet. If PROPWR scales as planned and completions stay cash-positive through the cycle, ProPetro’s risk-reward profile could look meaningfully different than in past downturns.

New data and analysis show that while production increased in both states, decreasing loss rates in New Mexico reflects that progress is possible with strong methane standards.

Findings show that methane intensity on the New Mexico side of the Delaware sub-basin is half that of Texas, despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020, with the vast majority (83 percent) of basin-wide emissions coming from Texas.

If you’ve been following the oil and gas industry’s commentary on its methane performance, you might think that the Texas Permian is cleaner than ever. But new measurement data and analysis from the Permian’s Delaware sub-basin show that New Mexico is improving efficiency by capturing more methane while production soars, whereas Texas is maintaining the status quo.

Texas left in the dust as New Mexico slashes methane intensity on its side of the Permian Share on X

Drawing on nine satellite overpasses between May 2024 and March 2025, MethaneSAT provides the first robust, measurement-based comparison of methane emissions intensity across the Permian’s Delaware Sub-Basin in New Mexico and Texas — two states that share a resource but allow operations under very different regulatory frameworks.

Texas industry groups hoping to claim credit for their neighbor’s progress should take a closer look. MethaneSAT finds that methane intensity on the New Mexico side of the Delaware sub-basin is half that of Texas, despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020. While New Mexico’s production has surged, the vast majority of the Permian’s methane pollution still comes from the Texas side. MethaneSAT data show that 83 percent of basin-wide emissions — over three million metric tons annually — originate in Texas. In Texas, production has increased modestly — around 20 percent — yet absolute emissions also remained flat, producing no meaningful improvement in intensity.

Portraying Incomplete Data as Mission Accomplished

In recent years, trade groups have used analyses like this recent S&P report (July 2025) in communications about upstream methane intensity — the amount of methane that is released relative to total energy production. That report found positive progress in upstream methane intensity but uses a methodology that omits important emissions data and should be used as an important, but incomplete indicator of methane performance.

Another S&P data analysis, released in October 2025, also reports a decline in absolute emissions. However, these reports both employ measurements from remote sensing technologies that can only detect higher emitting point sources, therefore missing many smaller, dispersed sources that our research shows account for a substantial share of total emissions. Nor do these S&P analyses identify the specific regions that were surveyed. They appear to present oil and gas emissions in New Mexico and Texas together, despite clear regulatory and operational differences across the state line. We need direct measurement-based data for total methane emissions from entire oil and gas basins and sub-basins to be able to make the kinds of claims that industry is touting.

Other papers have corroborated MethaneSAT’s latest findings and illustrate that absolute emissions remain stubbornly high. Varon et al.’s 2025 paper studied the region using weekly satellite observations, finding that total emissions in the Permian region remained flat, and “the decline in methane intensity continues to reflect increasing production, not decreasing emissions.” Despite regional intensity improvements, climate and air pollution from the oil and gas industry remains staggeringly high. Industry should not claim success while continuing to release millions of metric tons of climate super pollutants every year. To remain globally competitive — and to safeguard their employees and neighbors — oil and gas producers and regulators need to better address the industry’s persistent emissions.

Data transparency and scientific rigor matter. Although these S&P reports demonstrate growing remote sensing capabilities in providing methane emissions data, it’s misleading for the Texas industry to claim credit for broad emissions reductions — on either an intensity or on an absolute emissions basis — from data sets that present only a subset of a region’s emissions.

One Producing Basin, Two Vastly Different State Landscapes

New Mexico has adopted a prohibition on routine flaring, a robust leak detection and repair program and nation-leading policies to phase out intentionally polluting equipment. Texas, meanwhile, remains stuck in the past. It routinely allows the wasteful practice of associated gas flaring and functionally exempts smaller wells from basic best management practices like leak detection and repair. Lax and outdated standards for equipment like process controllers fail to address the industry’s second largest source of emissions.

Industry continues to fall short of its own methane-reduction targets. In New Mexico’s Delaware Sub-Basin, methane intensity is still 5 times higher than industry’s own commitments under the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter. Texas will need to reduce emissions even more drastically. And the costs of the state’s inaction are only compounding. Texans are already feeling the impacts of our changing climate, including worsening droughts, extreme heat, and catastrophic storms and flooding. Science shows that reducing methane pollution now is the fastest way to slow warming.

The path forward isn’t mysterious. Texas can cut waste, create jobs, and protect communities by following the playbook already working in New Mexico — curb routine flaring, require regular leak inspections and deploy cleaner equipment. New Mexicans are reaping the benefits of regulations requiring more responsible production: an additional $125 million in natural gas captured annually, adding $27 million in royalties and revenue for taxpayers.

Texas policymakers can’t keep allowing industry to point at progress across the border while refusing to clean up their own backyard. The tools, technology and talent are already here — what’s missing is action.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Tx-blog-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 14:05:18.775710

The award highlights standout attorneys who “have distinguished themselves from their peers by securing hard-earned success in high-stakes litigation, complex global matters, and record-breaking deals.”

Among other accomplishments, Broome earned her spot as one of Law360’s Environmental MVPs by helping clients obtain the first pathway approval for synthetic e-fuel under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program and prevail in a key dispute over industrial boiler emission regulations. This was a significant victory that set a precedent for future Clean Air Act litigation and had a landmark impact for Broome’s clients. She also marked a significant victory in challenging an EPA regulation that would have imposed unreasonable air emission standards on industry boiler operations across the country, in one of the first environmental decisions out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit after the Supreme Court overturned the Chevron doctrine and adopted the approach set forth in the Loper-Bright case.

Broome started her career as a chemical engineer and worked on environmental projects for an oil and gas company in California before attending law school. She graduated just as major Clean Air Act amendments were enacted. Today, Broome is the managing partner of the firm’s San Francisco office. She leads the California environmental practice and co-leads the nationwide environmental, social, and governance practice. She focuses her work on permitting, enforcement, litigation, climate change, ESG compliance and climate disclosures, and regulatory advocacy for clients in a variety of manufacturing and energy sectors, including oil and gas, renewable energy, chemical, paper, and automotive. Broome is often sought by Fortune 50 oil, gas, and manufacturing companies for her litigation and negotiation skills and has 35 years of experience challenging and defending EPA and California regulations, defending enforcement actions before federal, state, and appellate courts and agencies, and obtaining complex permits from federal and state agencies.

In the wake of tariffs, immigration crackdowns, geopolitical disruptions, and heightened uncertainty, the pace of US job growth has slowed significantly in recent months and has been trending at a pace well below historical patterns. In addition, performance across industries has recently been notably uneven. While current challenges are clearly affecting near-term expansion, looking out over a few decades, we are still seeing signs of solid potential.

One factor influencing US growth at present is the performance of other countries. Leading global economic analysts are generally projecting moderate growth over the next few years, which is a welcomed signal. However, significant downside risks could affect not only the immediate situation, but also the long-term outlook. One factor which could reduce future gains is the potential for decreased supply chain efficiencies, whether from trade tensions due to policy decisions or ongoing international conflicts.

Another concern is the high cost of energy, which is curtailing growth (as well as quality of life) in numerous countries. Prices are negatively affecting expansion in Europe and other areas, and overall inflation remains an issue. While comparatively low energy prices in the US are making manufactured goods more competitive abroad, there are offsetting downside risks arising from stagnant conditions in other major economies. Fiscal challenges are also increasingly problematic, with many countries facing difficult decisions related to rising debt service, growing entitlements (such as pensions for aging populations), and pressing infrastructure requirements.

Simultaneously, there is potential for technology (especially AI) to reshape international patterns by reducing costs, opening markets, and enabling smaller players. However, optimizing these benefits depends on, among other things, efforts to assure access for emerging countries and stable and predictable trade rules.

Over the long-term horizon, the effects of underlying demographic patterns will further affect overall prospects. As with many nations, US birthrates are falling significantly, and virtually all population gains stem from in-migration. AI is potentially a major factor in dealing with the lack of growth in the numbers of people in prime working age ranges (at least temporarily), but for many essential occupations, hands-on work is essential. The need for sensible immigration policies is clear, as is the need for efforts to encourage labor force participation and productivity.

Even with the current challenges, our analysis of the outlook for the US economy indicates moderate growth, with real gross domestic product expanding at a 2.48% annual rate and a gain of some 79.6 million jobs over the next 30 years. The pace will depend in part on how effectively current issues are dealt with, but the fundamental structure of the national economy remains sound. Business cycles are inevitable, but the US economy has a structural framework conducive to long-term expansion. Stay safe!

In this country, some people spend their retirement playing golf. Other people travel. WHYY's Sophia Schmidt reports on how some retirees in Philadelphia spend their time.

SOPHIA SCHMIDT, BYLINE: Bob Meyer is 71 years old. He retired from a career as a biology professor, but he still likes to keep busy.

BOB MEYER: The horrible lure of retirement is to do nothing, and, you know, that's no good because you just end up vegetating at home watching, you know, daytime TV, and I don't want to do that.

SCHMIDT: Instead, Meyer volunteers with the Senior Environment Corps in northwest Philadelphia. The group of more than a dozen retirees take on projects like sampling the soil and testing the area's waterways for pollution. Today, Meyer is in a lab at a local college. He's looking through a microscope, counting tiny pieces of plastic - or microplastics - from a sample of creek water.

MEYER: OK. I got a pretty sharp view now.

SCHMIDT: He finds tiny pieces with jagged edges and thin, plastic fibers.

MEYER: Ah. Got a thread, and it's pink, so I know it's plastic.

SCHMIDT: Altogether, Meyer finds dozens of pieces of microplastics in this one small sample of creek water.

MEYER: I don't know how you get it out. I know how you stop it. You stop using plastic. But that's - I'll - we'll be pushing up the daisies before that stops.

SCHMIDT: It's not all counting plastics in the lab. Some volunteers wade into streams to collect water samples. Others teach kids how to identify aquatic critters. Meyer and fellow volunteer David Schogel say the group is always looking for new members to join.

Anything you're particularly looking for in people who join?

MEYER: Youth (laughter).

DAVID SCHOGEL: If they're breathing...

(LAUGHTER)

MEYER: Yeah.

SCHOGEL: ...We want them.

SCHMIDT: Schogel is 85 and a retired social worker. He sees the nearly three decades he's volunteered with the Senior Environment Corps as part of his legacy.

SCHOGEL: I'm not a wealthy fellow, and I don't have any money to leave behind to any groups or even my family, but I can leave a better world.

SCHMIDT: The group meets monthly at a senior center. That's where 74-year-old Eleanor Lundy-Wade found out about it. She's a former health inspector and public health educator.

ELEANOR LUNDY-WADE: I said, they're seniors that love and do the environment? I said, I want to be one of them.

SCHMIDT: Fred Lewis helped found the group more than 30 years ago. At 98, he's the oldest member. He says the corps has been testing water quality for years, but looking for microplastics is new. Lewis is old enough to remember back when plastic first became widely used.

FRED LEWIS: I mean, it was just something that was so new that people were just trying to get suggestions as how we can take advantage of it. And now it's how we can end it.

SCHMIDT: Lewis says some people might assume that the older you get, the less involved with society you become, but he hopes this group changes some minds.

UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEER: At the count of three.

SCHMIDT: At the end of every meeting, the volunteers close by singing the Senior Environment Corps song.

UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEERS: (Singing) Wissahickon to the banks of Darby Creek.

SCHMIDT: For NPR News, I'm Sophia Schmidt in Philadelphia.

UNIDENTIFIED VOLUNTEERS: (Singing) Water and the testing faithfully.

Judge Sean Cole, in his ruling, sided with the coalition after years of the group's advocacy efforts to prevent Wake Stone, now Vulcan Materials, from expanding mining operations near Umstead State Park.

In his ruling, Judge Cole ordered the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to halt mining operations by 2031, in alignment with the original sunset clause agreement that was originally agreed to in 1981.

At the time, Wake Stone asked for permission to mine the land near Umstead State Park for a total of 50 years. However, years ago, NCDEQ and Wake Stone partnered to further expand mining operations through a continuation of mining activity and broadening its footprint.

A move the Umstead Coalition was not in favor of, as if successful, work on the quarry would have exceeded beyond its original 2031 agreement.

In his ruling, Judge Cole concluded, ""The Coalition, as the sole 'friends' group for the Park and as a membership-based nonprofit representing Park users, necessarily is substantially prejudiced by the indefinite delay for the State, on behalf of the Division of State Parks, to exercise its option to acquire the original quarry property.""

As part of the ruling, Judge Cole said Wake Stone and NCDEQ must abide by its original agreement by ordering the donation of the quarry land back to the State of North Carolina for inclusion in its State Parks, effectively donating the land back to Umstead State Park.

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Trump administration has renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, now calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, marking an identity shift for the Colorado institution that has been a global leader in wind, solar, and other renewable energy research.

“The new name reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director, in a statement.

He did not specify what this “broader vision” would mean for the lab’s programs or its staff of about 4,000.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.

Asked for details, the Department of Energy said in an email that the renaming “reflects the Department’s renewed focus on ‘energy addition,’ rather than the prioritization of specific energy resources.”

A lab spokesman had no additional information about whether there will be changes to programs or headcount at the lab.

Bill Ritter, a Democrat who was governor of Colorado from 2007 to 2011, said it’s reasonable to worry that the name change signals that the federal government is abandoning the lab’s status as a world leader in renewable energy research. “It’s an iconic research facility,” he said.

Underscoring this point, he recalled a trip to Israel while he was governor. “The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.

After leaving office, Ritter founded the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, which specializes in energy policy research, and is now a consultant on energy business and policy.

Based on this experience, he thinks that anything the Trump administration does to divert from the lab’s mission is harmful to the United States’ ability to remain a major player in the energy economy of the near future.

“We’ll no longer be competitive in renewables research with China or India or other countries that are still heading toward the renewable energy transition at a very fast pace,” he said.

People with close ties to the lab were not surprised by the name change, given the administration’s broader goals.

“In the early days of DOGE people there were whispering about a name change to avoid the ire of MAGAs,” said Matt Henry, a Montana-based social scientist who worked at the lab from February 2024 to August 2025, in a post on Bluesky. “It pissed me off—prioritizing the preservation of the institution at the expense of its [stated] mission? So disappointing.”

He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration. The term MAGA refers to President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and movement.

Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor, said if the name change is a sign of a significant change in the lab’s work, it would be “like losing several major land grant research universities all at once.”

Mulvaney has done projects in partnership with people at the lab. An important part of the institution’s work, he said, is that its research is free and accessible to the public, helping businesses and universities that may not be able to afford the work of private research firms.

The lab’s mission has included consulting to help communities benefit from new energy technologies, and ensure smooth transitions away from fossil fuels.

This work meant that the lab was out of step with an administration that has said it disagrees with the idea of a transition away from fossil fuels and has sought to impede funding and development of renewable energy.

The lab was established in 1974 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, part of a law signed by President Gerald Ford to facilitate alternatives to importing oil from the Middle East, according to a history on the lab’s website. The US was suffering through high gasoline prices amid tensions with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of energy, in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

In 1977, the federal government selected Golden, Colorado, as the location for the lab. In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.

But the lab’s history has also included budget cuts and periods when its work fell out of favor with presidential administrations, including layoffs and funding cuts under President Ronald Reagan. Trump proposed substantial cuts during his first term, but Congress retained much of the funding.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2208379459.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-03 15:02:39.864472

Jared Polis lamented Wednesday as a costly disappointment.

Polis asked the federal government to reconsider the decision — disclosed to states last month — in a letter sent Wednesday to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The program, known as IRS Direct File, allowed users to file their taxes with pre-filled tax forms, such as W-2s, free of cost.

It’s had a limited rollout since 2024, with Colorado slated to join the program this coming year.

In his letter, Polis highlighted a report that found 94% of users said the experience with the federal tool was “above average” or “excellent.” In Colorado, it was expected to save taxpayers $140 million per year while helping them to secure $80 million in federal tax credits, according to a report by the progressive nonprofit the Economic Security Project, while saving individuals hours of work.

“Direct File offered a free, efficient alternative that saved taxpayers both time and money, making government more efficient and reducing taxpayer errors,” Polis wrote in his letter to Bessent. “… There is no substitute for Direct File and we urge Treasury to look again at the results and reconsider their decision, given how successful direct file was.”

The Direct File program was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022. The program immediately faced intense blowback from Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies, who complained that it wasted taxpayer money by replicating existing private-sector services.

Several companies offer free filing services, though they make billions from complicated tax-filing services.

The program has been put on hold in the first year of President Donald Trump’s return to office.

In 2024, the program’s first year, about 141,000 taxpayers across eight states filed their taxes through the program, out of about 423,000 who logged in. This year, the number of filers increased to about 297,000 taxpayers in 25 states, out of 751,000 who logged into the services, though Polis noted that that happened despite uncertainty over the program and no marketing budget for it.

One of the incentives to install one in recent years has been a federal tax credit under the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. This allowed homeowners who installed a heat pump to claim a credit on their owed taxes that equaled 30% of qualified expenses up to $2,000.

As of Dec. 31, 2025, this credit will no longer be available, but there are still a lot of reasons to upgrade to a heat pump even if you don’t qualify for the tax credit. GOBankingRates spoke with D.R. Richardson, CEO and co-founder of Elephant Energy, to discuss the benefits of installing a heat pump for heating and cooling your home.

More Comfortable Heating and Cooling

The number one reason to upgrade to a heat pump according to Richardson? A more comfortable heating and cooling experience. A traditional furnace will heat up the air in the room and then stop running, but the heat will then dissipate into the furniture and the walls. Then the furnace will kick on again to heat the air and the cycle continues.

When a heat pump heats your home, “the heat goes into the couches and the walls and the other pieces of furniture in your home at a much more even pace, which means that it stays that temperature,” Richardson said. This means that it takes a little longer to get your home to the right temperature, but it heats and cools the home evenly. “[It] provides a much more comfortable environment for your home,” he added.

Improved Air Quality

Traditional furnaces create heat by burning methane and converting it to heat. But not all of it converts to heat and it emits CO2 which can affect the indoor air quality in your home as well as the outdoor air quality.

Heat pumps don’t actually create heat, they move it. “You’re not burning anything. Instead, you’re moving heat around using electricity. This works even in very cold temperatures because there is still ambient heat in the air even if it feels very cold,” Richardson explained. “The reverse is true when it’s cooling-it pulls heat out of the home and directs it outdoors, cooling the interior.”

All of this means that the indoor air quality in your home will be better with a heat pump over a furnace.

Savings Even Without Incentives

Even without the tax credit incentive, purchasing and installing a heat pump can be more affordable than installing a furnace and an air conditioner. For homeowners who have been heating with expensive fossil fuels, for example “electric baseboard heating or delivered fuel oil or propane,” Richardson said you’ll notice the difference pretty quickly and he estimated that “customers are saving hundreds, if not thousands, off dollars per year, depending on the price of electricity in their market. If you’re coming from natural gas, you’ll be paying about the same to run your heat pump.”

State Rebates May Be Available

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Home Efficient Rebates (HOMES or HER) and Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) programs allow states to reimburse homeowners directly when they purchase a heat pump. You can check your state’s eligibility requirements to see if your heat pump will qualify for a rebate and for how much.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.
Hochul’s decision to direct NYPA towards advanced nuclear development marks a pivotal moment for New York’s industrial future.","New York has taken a significant step toward reintroducing nuclear energy as a core component of its long-term industrial and economic strategy. In June 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear facility, signaling that the state is preparing to meet rapid load growth driven by advanced manufacturing, data centers and electronification. This shift positions New York to compete for the next generation of power-intensive industries, including semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and advanced materials production.

For companies evaluating expansion or site selection in New York, this moment presents a rare opportunity to engage early as the state defines its approach to its advanced nuclear deployment.

New York’s Policy Shift Toward Advanced Nuclear

Gov. Hochul’s directive reflects a broader national and global trend: advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular rectors (SMRs) are moving from concept to commercial readiness. Her public statements frame nuclear power as a tool to:

Attract large, energy-intensive manufacturers to upstate New York;

Strengthen grid reliability as AI, cloud services and electronification accelerate demand;

Provide stable, zero-emission baseload that complements intermittent renewables; and

Position the state as a leader in next-generation clean-energy deployment.

The combination of strong public support from the governor and the NYPA mandate creates a strategic opening for companies with significant future energy needs.

Technology Landscape: Advanced Reactors Move Toward Deployment

Advanced reactors represent a fundamental shift in how nuclear energy can be deployed and financed.

Modular manufacturing: SMRs can be factory-built, shipped and deployed quickly, reducing construction duration and cost risk.

Scalable output: Units can be sized to support industrial campuses, fabrication facilities or data-center clusters.

Enhanced safety: Passive safety systems decrease overheating or meltdown risk.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.

These attributes directly align with sectors that require high-reliability and predictable long-term energy costs.

Remaining Barriers: Financing and Regulatory Certainty

Despite technological progress, deployment still faces:

Regulatory complexity, even as NRC modernizes its review process;

High capital costs in early phases; and

Financing gaps for first-of-a-kind projects.

Discussions in Congress regarding a potential national infrastructure financing authority could materially change the landscape. Federal credit support, long-term financing tools and project development incentives would reduce risk and enable deployment in markets like New York.

Strategic Considerations for Manufacturers and Large Load Users

Companies considering New York should evaluate opportunities to engage early in state planning processes. Early action can secure:

Preferential access to nuclear-enabled industrial hubs;

Priority positioning in procurement and interconnection discussions;

Eligibility for state and federal incentive programs;

Opportunities to partner with reactor developers, utilities and public agencies; and

Influence over emerging regulatory, siting and permitting frameworks.

This early engagement can materially affect cost structure, siting certainty and long-term operational competitiveness.

FREMONT, CA, UNITED STATES, December 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Electric scooters have moved quietly into the American holiday mainstream. What started as a commuter niche is becoming one of the season’s most quick moving retail trends, as shoppers look beyond TV, sound systems, gaming consoles, and move toward products with real, everyday utility. Families in dense cities, students moving around sprawling campuses, and workers searching for alternatives to cars or rideshares are embracing small electric vehicles as practical gifts - a shift retailers didn’t predict, but one that’s accelerating fast.

This Christmas, U.S. micro-mobility sales are tracking upward across key channels. Web searches for personal electric transport, and scooter brands are climbing into gift-guide territory. A mix of rising fuel prices, expanding bike-lane networks in major cities, and the appeal of an eco-friendly, low-maintenance ride is pulling e-mobility closer to the center of American transport culture. E-Scooters now signal independence, flexibility, and a cut in the monthly cost of getting around.

Kaabo Moves Quickly to Claim the Moment

While many brands are fighting for visibility, Kaabo has stepped into the holiday season with striking timing. The company is pushing deep, clearly communicated discounts across its U.S. store - deals that put high-performance models within reach for shoppers who might normally hesitate at premium pricing. On the brand’s sales page, flagship scooters drop by hundreds of dollars, anchoring a strategy built around momentum rather than slow, incremental growth.

Kaabo already has a strong reputation among riders who value range, torque, and sturdy build quality. By pairing those strengths with aggressive holiday offers, it’s positioning itself not just as another option in the crowd, but as a genuine upgrade path for anyone considering their first e-scooter. The result: a widening gap between Kaabo and slower-moving competitors that haven’t matched the scale or clarity of its holiday push.

The Market Conditions Favor a Fast Climber

The U.S. e-mobility landscape is still young, but the demand curve is steep. More cities are designing infrastructure that supports small electric vehicles. More schools and workplaces encourage alternative commuting. And more consumers are choosing practical tech over disposable trends. Kaabo’s current surge reflects this reality - it isn’t riding hype; it’s riding conditions that now favor brands with performance credibility.

What’s striking is how Kaabo seems to understand the psychology of holiday buying. A scooter isn’t just a gift. It’s a transport upgrade. It’s a new way to move through a city. It’s a shift in lifestyle that arrives fully assembled in the living room. By offering significant savings during the season when Americans are most ready to invest in “big gifts,” Kaabo is converting curiosity into committed ridership.

Disruption in Real Time

Kaabo’s rise has the feel of a brand catching the right wave at the right moment. Its models serve both ends of the spectrum: compact commuters for everyday riders, and high-powered machines for enthusiasts who want something closer to a sport vehicle. That dual appeal gives it reach across multiple buyer segments at once - a rare advantage in a crowded market.

And because Kaabo’s pricing strategy is tied directly to performance value rather than cut-rate positioning, the company isn’t racing to the bottom. It’s pulling the market upward. That’s disruption: not breaking the category, but bending it toward higher expectations of what a scooter should deliver in range, power, and design.

A Holiday Season That Could Reshape the Year Ahead

If the current momentum continues, Kaabo will emerge from the holidays not just with boosted sales, but with deeper U.S. market penetration and stronger long-term loyalty. Each scooter bought in December becomes a rolling advertisement in January. Word-of-mouth spreads quickly in micro-mobility communities, and performance experiences tend to speak louder than marketing.

This Christmas may mark the moment Americans stop viewing electric scooters as optional tech and start seeing them as an everyday tool. Kaabo seems intent on making sure its name is the one most associated with that shift.

The mood, however, is muted by a sharp downturn in the company’s electric vehicle fortunes. Since the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, demand has plunged, leaving Hyundai’s battery-powered lineup scrambling to regain its footing

How Low Can It Go?

The Ioniq 5 remains Hyundai’s best-selling EV in the US, though November brought little reason to celebrate. Only 2,027 units found buyers across the country, a steep 59 percent drop from the 4,989 sold in November last year.

There was some consolation in the fact that this figure edged up slightly from October’s 1,642 sales, but the wider picture is still uneven. Year-to-date results show a modest 12 percent improvement over 2024, totaling 44,760 cars sold.

Things have been equally as bad for the Ioniq 6, with just 489 being sold this November, a decline of 56 percent. Cumulative sales have also slipped, from 11,055 cars in 2024 to 10,019 so far this year, marking a 9 percent decline.

The seven-seat, three-row Ioniq 9 wasn’t available last year, but it remains a relatively slow seller. A total of 315 found new homes last month, down slightly from the 317 sold in October. Year-to-date, 4,809 have been sold.

Hyundai Sales November 2025

Hyundai’s total November sales have fallen 2 percent from November last year to 74,289 units. So for this year, it still remains in the green, shifting 822,756 vehicles, an 8 percent rise from the 758,304 sold during the first 11 months of 2024.

Hybrids to the Rescue

The big story, though, is hybrids. Sales of electrified models jumped 42 percent, making November Hyundai’s strongest hybrid month on record. That surge has been critical in offsetting the EV slump and maintaining overall growth through the final quarter.

Among individual models, several performed particularly well. In November, The Palisade rose 10 percent to 9,906 units, Santa Fe gained 13 percent to 14,004, and Tucson continued its strong run with an 18 percent increase to 23,762. Even the pint-sized Venue grew 35 percent to 2,059 units.

The Sonata, meanwhile, took a noticeable hit in November, dropping 42 percent year-over-year to 4,018 sales, bringing its year-to-date total to 54,238, down 12 percent from the same period in 2024.

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.abc4.com/news/national/ap-trump-plans-to-weaken-vehicle-mileage-rules-that-limit-air-pollution/amp/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal Wednesday to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks, according to several people familiar with the White House plans.
The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles.
The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office.
Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is expected to announce a proposal Wednesday to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks, according to several people familiar with the White House plans.

The proposal would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year, according to a White House official and several people familiar with the plan. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly because the proposal has not been announced and spoke on condition of anonymity. Further details were not immediately available.

The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Trump is set to announce the plan at a White House event that is expected to include top executives from the three largest U.S. automakers, who have praised the planned changes. Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement Wednesday that the planned rollback was “a win for customers and common sense.”

“As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Farley said.

Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration’s actions to “realign” the standards.

Environmentalists decried the decision.

“In one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation’s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,” said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.

“Trump’s action will feed America’s destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,” Becker said.

Trump has repeatedly pledged to end what he falsely calls an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to Democratic President Joe Biden’s target that half of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2030. EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicle sales in the United States in 2024, according to Cox Automotive.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission by 2035. Trump and congressional Republicans blocked the California law earlier this year.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged his agency to reverse existing fuel economy requirements, known as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, soon after taking office. In June, he said that standards set under Biden were illegal because they included use of electric vehicles in their calculation. EVs do not run on gasoline. After the June rule revision, the traffic safety agency was empowered to update the requirements.

Under Biden, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas for passenger cars by 2031, compared with about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon today.

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.

The auto industry has complained that both Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.

Mileage rules have been implemented since the 1970s energy crisis, and over time, automakers have gradually increased their vehicles’ average efficiency.

And the gas plants may be on the way.
These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.
In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.
That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.
Hindered Federal Climate Risk Regulation Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.","Property insurance rates have spiked since 2021 due to the increasing frequency of climate-related natural disasters, inflation in the cost of building materials and supply chain issues. The typical homeowner saw an average increase of $648 in their annual premium from 2021 to 2024. And those rates are expected to increase by an average of 8% nationwide this year — with homeowners in some states facing much higher increases, such as a projected 27% hike in Louisiana.

An increasing number of American homeowners are linking those increases to climate change. A majority of them (72%) say that natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires exacerbated by climate change are somewhat or very responsible for the rise in homeowner insurance costs, according to a poll by Data For Progress.

There is a bipartisan consensus that prices are rising too fast — nearly 80% of homeowners in Texas, for instance, want to see rates reduced, and one-third of Florida homeowners say that rate increases are the most important issue for them (even ahead of inflation and housing costs) — though Americans are torn on the role of climate change.

Insurance companies are regulated on the state level, and there have been heated debates in states as diverse as Idaho, Minnesota, Louisiana and Colorado about policies and regulations to slow the increase in rates. In Iowa, which was expected to see a 19% increase in home insurance rates this year, nearly 180 researchers and educators signed a statement calling attention to the role of climate change in driving up insurance costs — and calling for better building standards and a faster transition to more renewable energy sources in the state, such as solar and wind.

The federal government plays a role in all this through its funding of programs to share the risk of losses such as the National Flood Insurance Program and disaster relief efforts. It also provides access to climate data used by insurers to foresee potential risks and formulate rates.

The Trump administration’s policies on climate, cutting funding to key programs, reducing access to and limiting the collection of climate data, and slashing the ranks of federal regulators are contributing to an increase in property insurance rates for homeowners, said insurance industry analysts and experts.

“At a time when homeowners are struggling to afford home insurance premiums, the Trump administration has a bunch of policies that are all driving up insurance costs,” said Michael DeLong, the Consumer Federation of America’s research and advocacy associate.

Asked about the Trump administration’s plans to help reduce property insurance rates, a White House spokesperson declined to speak on the record, but provided Capital & Main with a statement from an unnamed official:

“More people are living in Florida than ever before, which naturally causes an increase in rates,” the statement said. “It’s inaccurate and silly to pin this on climate change. The Administration is working to lower costs across all industries for Americans.”

Tariffs

The steep tariffs on materials like lumber, steel and aluminum are raising construction and repair costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers through higher home insurance premiums. First, insurance coverage limits “may no longer provide enough protection as the cost of materials and labor needed to rebuild your home increases,” noted Wawanesa Insurance in a blogpost. “Second, repair costs following claims will be higher, potentially influencing future premium rates.”

The main insurance industry trade group, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, has been actively lobbying against tariffs because of their impact on home insurance.

Cuts to Disaster Relief Funding and Resiliency Programs

The administration has cut disaster relief funds at the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are given to local governments and states following natural disasters. The money is used to repair or reconstruct homes and finance housing. Without those resources, communities devastated by such catastrophes won’t be able to rebuild homes and infrastructure in more resilient ways, “and these communities will pay higher insurance premiums as a result,” writes DeLong, the Consumer Federation advocacy associate, and Ethan Weiland, another CFA research associate.

In April the Federal Emergency Management Agency terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities Program, which provided grants to states and communities to fund projects that reduce the risk of damage from flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. Ending the program “means terminating mitigation projects that would have saved lives, lowered the risk of property loss, and reduced homeowner, farm, and business property insurance premiums,” DeLong and Weiland noted.

Reduced Access to Critical Climate Data

In May, the administration stopped updating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration database for weather and climate disasters that cause more than $1 billion in damage. The database has historically been used by insurance and reinsurance companies to assess risks and project future losses. The loss of that data is likely to lead to less accurate pricing, and cause insurers to hike rates in response to unquantified risk.

In addition, the administration has deleted reports on rising homeowners insurance from the Federal Insurance Office’s website — making it more difficult for insurance regulators, insurers and consumers to get data.

One of the reports, which was uploaded by the Consumer Federation of America, on rising homeowners insurance costs from 2018 to 2022, showed how this increase outpaced the rate of inflation and that policy nonrenewal rates were higher in areas with higher-than-expected losses from climate-related disasters.

“We need reliable, long datasets,” said Kieran Bhatia, head of climate and sustainability for North America at the global reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter. “Without them, you basically are kind of putting your finger up to the wind a little bit about what is a realistic [extreme weather] event.”

Bhatia and other climate risk specialists expressed their concerns during a panel discussion during New York Climate Week in September.

“If you want to promote economic growth, the best way to do that is to have good information,” said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of financial regulation at the Center for American Progress. “Capitalism relies on good information to make an efficient economy and insurers are subject to that rule as well. But now no one has this essential climate information.”

Rollback of Renewable Energy Initiatives

The administration’s rollback of renewable energy initiatives — such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s $7 billion Solar for All initiative — has directly impacted the underwriting market for clean energy projects. That has increased insurance costs as insurers become more cautious about underwriting such projects, citing increased risks.

And President Donald Trump’s executive orders to block state and local climate change measures — such as those that seek to limit carbon emissions or require oil and gas companies to pay for climate damage — could escalate future litigation risk for insurers as climate change worsens.

“We’re going backwards because we’re not doing the things at the federal level to tackle climate change and lower insurance costs for consumers,” Thornton said.

Hindered Federal Climate Risk Regulation

Federal financial regulators have withdrawn policies that required climate risk disclosures from financial firms, including insurers, in response to the administration’s anti-environmental, social and governance stance.

By reducing federal oversight, the administration is downplaying climate-related financial risks. This leaves property and financial markets more exposed and increases the instability that can be caused by higher costs and limited insurance availability.

Approval of New Fossil Fuel Projects

The administration’s strong push to increase oil and gas production, such as approving six new liquefied natural gas terminals along the Gulf Coast, will likely accelerate the pace of climate change and lead to higher insurance premiums, said Ethan Nuss, senior campaigner with the Rainforest Action Network.

“The Trump administration’s fast-tracking of dirty energy mega-projects — like the Calcasieu Pass 2 LNG (CP2) methane export terminal — increases the risk exposure of both insurers and neighboring communities that will be stuck paying out larger claims and skyrocketing premiums or be forced out of their ‘uninsurable’ homes.”

Affordable—EVs save drivers over $1,000 per year on avoided gas and hundreds more on avoided maintenance.

Better—EVs are high performing and fun to drive and reduce greenhouse gas emissions upwards of 80% compared to gas cars.

Convenient—For most EV owners, 80% of EV charging happens at home while they sleep, while the average range of EVs has tripled over the past decade to approximately 300 miles.

Has your interest in an EV piqued? If so, there has never been a better time to get a good deal on a used EV, with 243,000 EVs coming off lease and heading to the secondary market, where two-thirds of car buyers shop, and where EVs already compete on price with used gas vehicles and outcompete on value. And rest assured, public charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly; fast chargers that support long-distance trips are on pace to surpass 100,000 chargers in 2027, nearly four times the number in 2022.

Gas Cars Have Peaked

Gas cars sales are running out of…gas. Data show that in 2017, global sales of gas cars peaked at 79.9 million. By 2024, that number had sputtered to 54.8 million, a 31% fall. So where did all those car sales go? Well, in 2024, consumers bought 11 million EVs and 6.5 million plug-in hybrids, up from a combined 1.2 million in 2017. Meanwhile, 1 in 4 of all cars sold this year will have a plug. And these number will continue to grow. J.D. Power’s October consumer survey found that nearly 1 in 4 of America’s active new-car shoppers are “very likely” to buy an EV in the next 12 months. Read more.

Used EVs are the Fastest-Selling Cars in the U.S.

New not in your budget? The used EV inventory is expanding rapidly as millions of EVs come off lease. Many of these used EVs have less than 40,000 miles on them and are still covered by their manufacturer’s warranties. Whereas a gas car has about 2,000 moving parts, an EV only has about 20. That means that because EVs cost the same or less than their gas equivalents, you make money when you buy one by significantly decreasing your vehicle maintenance and fueling costs — typically over $1,000/year. Companies like Recurrent now exist to run remote battery checks so you can buy with confidence. Read more.

A Trip to Washington

Despite these encouraging signs, it certainly helps when federal policy is designed to boost the EV transition, not stall it. That’s why I recently joined roughly 30 of my fellow EV advocates in D.C. to meet with over 50 Congressional offices to advocate for transportation electrification. Congress has begun the Surface Transportation Reauthorization (STR) process, which results in an every-5-year bipartisan bill that funds the nation’s transportation system. The last STR resulted in programs designed to build a fast-charging backbone along the nation’s highways and rural areas, put electric schools buses in school districts nationwide, and expand the manufacturing and recycling of advanced batteries.

Global power demand is rising dramatically, driven by rapid growth in advanced manufacturing, data centers, and other energy-intensive industries. In regions like Louisiana and the broader Gulf Coast, this surge underscores a critical need for firm, low-carbon power that can reliably serve industrial loads while aligning with global emissions reduction targets.

Carbon capture represents a critical pathway to meet this demand. However, traditional CO₂ capture systems face significant challenges when dealing with the relatively low CO₂ concentrations found in the flue gas from combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), resulting in high energy penalties and solvent degradation. Addressing these constraints is essential to decarbonizing existing and future CCGT assets. JERA and Newlab seek to advance next-generation capture technologies, including advanced solvents, solid sorbents, membranes, and hybrid configurations, that can materially improve energy efficiency, process durability, and cost performance. By connecting promising startups to industrial environments, the collaboration is structured to accelerate the path from validated pilot performance to commercial deployment.

""JERA Ventures was created to identify, test, and scale breakthrough technologies that can transform the future of global energy systems,"" said Takeshi Kodama, Head of JERA Ventures. ""Through our partnership with Newlab New Orleans, we can validate promising solutions in industrial environments, paving the way for pilot projects and the eventual deployment of commercial-scale technologies capable of supporting power systems across our global markets.""

This initiative is anchored by Newlab's public–private partnership in Louisiana, which leverages the state's long-standing industrial base to attract and commercialize critical technologies across carbon management, advanced fuels, shipping and maritime, and related industrial decarbonization pathways. The platform brings together infrastructure, industry and government partners, and capital to help startups test, iterate, and scale solutions while driving new economic growth in the region. Newlab is working with regional partners to assess existing power generation facilities that could host a demonstration-scale project, in partnership with a selected startup and JERA.

""Louisiana sits at the center of one of the world's most energy-intensive industrial corridors, and the solutions we validate here have global relevance,"" said Sahil Jain, VP of Strategy at Newlab. ""Through our partnership with JERA, we are creating a platform to directly evaluate next-generation carbon capture technologies on real-world flue gas profiles. Our goal is to de-risk technologies that meet the power sector's most urgent decarbonization needs and move faster toward first-of-a-kind deployment.""

This partnership builds on JERA's continued engagement in Louisiana's dynamic energy economy, including its development of the world's largest low-carbon ammonia facility, its ownership stake in the state's largest solar installation — the 300-megawatt Oxbow Solar Farm — and investment in upstream shale gas assets in the Haynesville basin. Together, these initiatives reflect JERA's mission to provide cutting-edge solutions to the world's energy issues.

Looking ahead, Newlab and JERA intend to leverage the applied learnings from this initiative to scale carbon capture and power decarbonization efforts in Louisiana and across other key global markets.",https://www.ajot.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:58.444907

Power generation and transition infrastructure are under unprecedented strain. The artificial intelligence data center boom, combined with a legacy shortfall in proactive investment in the grid, has pushed electricity prices to punitive levels for commercial real estate owners.

As a result, a growing number of building owners are turning to an engineering solution with a technical name that belies its simplicity: ice.

Thermal storage systems store energy not in lithium or another hard-to-extract mineral, but in frozen water, said Brendan Dowd, vice president at Boland, a commercial HVAC systems, services and energy solutions provider in the Washington, D.C., metro area

The systems act like batteries to more intelligently generate or distribute stored energy to meet cooling or heating needs while lowering the impact on the grid and the environment. The thermal battery charges when grid demand and energy costs are low or excess renewable energy is available.

“Most thermal energy storage systems have a large tank or tanks, storing water or ice, which is then used as needed by the building,” Dowd said. “Typically, they make ice at night, when energy is cheap, and then melt it for cooling during on-peak times.”

Flexibility = Savings

In most markets, power utilities apply a higher rate to electricity consumed during peak times, like summer afternoons, when it is more expensive for the utility to generate it, or when renewable energy sources aren’t available and utilities are burning fossil fuels.

That’s a problem for buildings that cannot easily adjust operations, such as offices, schools, museums and government facilities.

“If you dig into your electric bill, you'll see that you're paying more for electricity during peak times of the day,” Dowd said. “This ‘demand charge’ could end up being up to 60% of an overall bill.”

Thermal energy storage systems flatten those peak consumption time spikes. And they allow building owners to capitalize on the times of day when cleaner, cheaper, renewable energy is abundant, Dowd said.

The technology is simple and old-fashioned, albeit with a sophisticated, modern analytics component.

“They melt the ice made during on-peak hours,” Dowd said. “A good portion of the cost, typically 20%, of energy supply is dependent on five peak demand events that take place each summer. With a thermal battery system, building owners can lower their demand on those days.”

Doing Well By Doing Good

While the technology generates savings calculated in dollars and cents, its ancillary benefit is that it reduces a given building’s carbon emissions.

“These systems are extremely green,” Dowd said. “Asset managers love them because they save money, but sustainability managers love them because they reduce the carbon footprint of the facility.”

Incentives: Available and Stackable

With many state and municipal governments ratcheting up their climate goals, there is a patchwork of rebates, grants, programs and other financial incentives building owners can leverage to reduce the cost of installing thermal energy storage systems.

“Rebates and incentives are available and they are stackable,” Dowd said.

The Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, expanded the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, to include thermal energy storage. As a result, the technology has a lower “first cost” compared to conventional chilled water plants, Dowd said.

The IRA also expanded the Section 179D tax deduction for commercial buildings to include a new direct payment option for many tax-exempt entities, he said.

With current incentives in place, building owners who invest in thermal battery systems can recoup their initial investment in three years. For perspective, the typical life cycle of these systems is 30 years, Dowd said.

During a recent office building renovation project, which leveraged both Section 48 investment tax credits and local utility incentives, Boland installed a thermal battery system that shifted one megawatt of peak electricity demand and reduced on-peak energy usage by 2.15M kilowatt-hours per year.

Boland offers several variations of thermal energy storage, Dowd said. Full storage systems can cool an entire facility for the entirety of its working hours using just ice. Partial storage systems make less ice and simply trim energy consumption during the day when it is most expensive. Finally, thermal storage systems can be combined with heat pump systems for even greater efficiency.

A Universe of Data Points

With over 4,000 projects completed in 60 countries, Boland, in partnership with Trane, has the institutional knowledge to advise building owners, designers and contractors on how to customize system implementation to maximize benefits for any given facility, Dowd said.

“By combining what we know with a bigger universe of data points and the owners’ own knowledge of their assets, we can unlock energy usage savings and comfort with a great degree of precision,” he said.

The company’s connected mechanical service agreements, or CMSAs, integrate continuous data collection and remote monitoring with traditional on-site HVAC maintenance, offering enhanced transparency into asset performance.

“This approach provides 24/7 operational insights that support Boland Trane technicians in troubleshooting and maintaining equipment,” Dowd said. “Benefits of our CMSAs include lower total cost of ownership, improved equipment uptime and support for sustainability goals.”

A growing headache along the Outer Banks The string of collapses has recently raised the issue to greater national attention.
North Carolina filed more claims than any other state through that program, according to the state’s recent workgroup report.
In 2023, the National Park Service used grant funding to buy and tear down two at-risk homes in Rodanthe.","In recent months, news of Outer Banks homes falling into the ocean seemed nonstop.

Five fell in Buxton within just one hour in late September. Three more came down in the following days. Another five shortly before Halloween.

Since 2020, 27 homes have collapsed along the Outer Banks, all of them unoccupied, as strong waves from storms and rising waters eat away at the shoreline.

The homes leave behind lots of mess: literally, with huge amounts of debris, and financially, for homeowners and taxpayers.

But the property owners have little incentive to take them down proactively, even when disaster appears likely.

The National Flood Insurance Program helps cover only damage after the fact. It does not pay for people to demolish properties before a storm does.

North Carolina leaders are calling on Congress to change that.

“When these houses collapse, they are not just a tragedy for the homeowner,” Gov. Josh Stein and state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey wrote in a joint letter to House leaders last month.

“The destroyed houses also spread pollution and debris for miles and repeatedly result in the closure of once pristine National Seashores and other beaches for public safety. Federal and state taxpayer dollars are then used to clean up the aftermath.”

As structured, the NFIP “provides a perverse incentive,” where it can be in homeowners’ financial interest to avoid taking proactive action, they wrote.

The letter urges federal lawmakers to advance legislation that would allow federal flood insurance to cover relocating or demolishing condemned coastal structures nationwide before they fall, capped at $250,000.

The proposed Preventing Environmental Hazards Act of 2025 is cosponsored by members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation from both sides of the aisle, as well as Virginia Republican Rep. Rob Wittman.

A growing headache along the Outer Banks

The string of collapses has recently raised the issue to greater national attention. But it’s long been on the minds of state and local officials, such as Bobby Outten, manager and attorney for Dare County.

The county includes roughly 100 miles of beachfront, including Rodanthe and Buxton. And “like beaches everywhere on the East Coast, they erode,” Outten said.

County officials have stemmed the issue in many places through beach nourishment, or building up sand to buffer erosion.

But that’s growing increasingly costly. Outten said the county hasn't been able to afford beach nourishment in Rodanthe recently, and a project in Buxton three years ago didn’t last the five years officials expected.

The erosion rate of that mile of beach has increased, and waves have grown closer, now reaching underneath many beachfront houses on stilts.

There are currently about 15 houses “that could go anytime,” Outten said.

When a house falls, debris quickly moves in many directions, stretching far beyond property lines. That makes it tricky to neatly divide responsibility for the cleanup.

“From the county's perspective, when we have storms, there is commingled debris, and you don't know whose it is, you don't know where it came from,” he said. “It piles up everywhere.”

The county treats the mess as it would any other storm, removing debris from roadways and beaches. This year’s messes have cost the local government roughly $200,000.

The National Park Service handles what’s in its jurisdiction, which includes the water. Since September, the Cape Hatteras National Seashore has hauled more than 400 truckloads of debris from fallen houses.

The Park Service reaches out to homeowners to try and recover associated costs, not always successfully.

Homeowners are responsible for cleaning up their private property, moving debris out to the right-of-way. Dare County hauls it to a landfill.

“Needless to say, it's a big mess. It's not what anybody wants,” Outten said. “Nobody believes that you're getting 100% of everything that comes out. You don't know what's floating, you don't know what's sinking, you don't know what's farther out there.”

Debris can threaten people’s health and safety and pollute the environment, including from inundated septic systems releasing sewage into the water. The situation also harms the local economy by giving the county a bad image, despite many miles of beaches still in good shape, he said.

A potential ""budget-neutral"" solution

The renewed push to authorize pre-disaster insurance payments grew out of a collaboration last year by the National Park Service and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

The workgroup laid out short- and long-term ideas for managing threatened oceanfront structures.

Based on aerial imagery from 2020, about 8% of more than 8,000 oceanfront structures across the state were considered at high risk from oceanfront erosion.

The proposed change to the NFIP could provide a “budget-neutral” solution for the most vulnerable structures that are already covered by federal flood insurance, Outten said.

Take a hypothetical homeowner on Hatteras Island whose house is already unlivable and unrentable.

The homeowner has no incentive to remove it, because when it falls, they can get up to $350,000 in pocket from the federal government – $250,000 maximum for damage coverage, plus another $100,000 for the home’s contents, Outten said.

“The question becomes, if NFIP is going to pay that out when it falls a month from now, why not pay it out now, and let's get that house off of the beach before it creates that problem,” he said. “Paying for it today or paying for it next month, really shouldn't make a difference.”

The concept has a precedent.

In the 1980s, after high water levels caused houses in Michigan’s Great Lakes to succumb to bluff erosion, Congress authorized a program that made some structures eligible for NFIP claims to prevent imminent collapse.

North Carolina filed more claims than any other state through that program, according to the state’s recent workgroup report.

But it was discontinued in 1994, replaced by the Flood Mitigation Assistance program, which offers grants instead of insurance. (The Trump administration this year canceled many grants awarded through the program.)

The NFIP initiative offered a quicker fix than the competitive grant process, which can take years to get the money, the North Carolina workgroup noted.

Another way officials could remove structures is through buyout programs. In 2023, the National Park Service used grant funding to buy and tear down two at-risk homes in Rodanthe. The agency has stated it would like to continue the program, but needs a lot more funding.

Meanwhile, local leaders are asking state lawmakers for help to protect Highway 12, the only way in or out of the Outer Banks.

“As the beaches erode and take these houses, the ocean gets closer to Highway 12,” Outten said. “And if we lose Highway 12, and we don't have access for anybody to do anything.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac9f2ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+39/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F53%2F413e1b9842e6b078f57a057c4863%2F556128390-1120339943620905-9039823228889499414-n.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:24.581346

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a co-recipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding.

Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.

The federal funding was first announced in December 2024 under the Biden administration. However, the contract between HEET and the Department of Energy was not finalized until Sept. 30 and was just announced Wednesday. The agreement, which allows construction to move forward, comes as the Trump administration is clawing back billions of dollars in clean energy funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in Massachusetts.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” Zeyneb Magavi, HEET’s executive director, said in a written statement.

The existing system provides heating and cooling to approximately 140 residential and commercial customers in the western suburb of Boston. The network taps low-temperature thermal energy from dozens of boreholes drilled several hundred feet below ground, where temperatures remain steady at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. A network of pipes circulates water through the boreholes to each building, enabling electric heat pumps to provide additional heating or cooling as needed.

“By harnessing the natural heat from the earth, we are taking a significant step towards increasing our energy independence and promoting abundant local energy sources,” Charlie Sisitsky, Framingham’s mayor, said in a written statement.

Progress on the project is a further indicator that, despite opposition to wind and solar, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress appear to back geothermal energy.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office declaring an energy emergency that expressed support for a limited mix of energy resources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, biofuels, hydropower, and geothermal energy.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump in July, quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles. However, the bill left geothermal heating and cooling tax credits approved under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 largely intact.

A reorganization of the U.S. Department of Energy announced last month eliminated the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy but kept the office for geothermal energy as part of the newly created Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

“The fact that geothermal is on this administration’s agenda is pretty impactful,” said Nikki Bruno, vice president for thermal solutions and operational services at Eversource Energy. “It means they believe in it. It’s a bipartisan technology.”

Plans for the expansion project call for roughly doubling Framingham’s geothermal network capacity at approximately half the cost of the initial buildout. Part of the estimated cost savings will come from using existing equipment rather than duplicating it.

“You’ve already got all the pumping and control infrastructure installed, so you don’t need to build a new pump house,” said Eric Bosworth, a geothermal expert who runs the consultancy Thermal Energy Insights. Bosworth oversaw the construction of the initial geothermal network in Framingham while working for Eversource.

The network’s efficiency is anticipated to increase as it grows, requiring fewer boreholes to expand. That improvement is due to the different heating and cooling needs of individual buildings, ​​which increasingly balance each other out as the network grows, Magavi said.

The project still awaits approval from state regulators, with Eversource aiming to start construction by the end of 2026, Bruno said.

“What we’re witnessing is the birth of a new utility,” Magavi said. Geothermal networks “can help us address energy security, affordability and so many other challenges.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_Wiggs-_Geothermal_4-1024x606.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:02:00.271820

Nextpower’s expansion in Tennessee helps us do so while enabling us to support additional investments in domestic manufacturing; this is what ‘unleashing American energy’ looks like.”

“The Southeast has entered a new era of energy infrastructure,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextpower. “This new U.S. manufacturing line with our partner MSS not only doubles our Memphis factory production capacity for solar trackers, but it also helps our customers scale projects faster, brings new American jobs, and strengthens our supply chain. Silicon Ranch pioneered utility-scale solar in the Southeast and continues to lead the way in delivering high quality projects that serve the region’s increasing demand for electricity. Nextpower has been proud to support them for more than a decade, and together, we’re powering what’s next.”

According to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Southeast added 5 GW of solar in 2024 alone, pushing total capacity to nearly 28 GW, and is on track to nearly double that total to 54 GW by 2030. Nextpower’s fabrication capacity will support utility-scale solar power plants across Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Virginia—many of which are developed, owned, and operated by Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch Corporation, one of the largest independent power producers in the country.

“We’re proud to have built a lasting and trusted partnership with Nextpower—one grounded in shared values of quality and innovation,” said António Pedro Antunes, CEO of Metalogalva Group, parent company of MSS. “Together, we’ve firmly established production capacity here in Tennessee to serve the growing demand for solar power infrastructure across the Southeastern United States. This expansion reflects our long-term commitment to American manufacturing and to powering the clean energy transition with steel that’s locally made.”

The Michigan Public Service Commission is planning on addressing the increasing amount of data centers in the state in a public hearing this week.

Open AI, the company behind ChatGPT, is opening a data center in Saline Township. Bridge Michigan recently reported there are nine other communities where companies have proposed building these large-scale data centers.

This surge is a result of a 2024 law that expanded the exemption from the state’s 6% sales tax purchases for the equipment inside these data centers. But despite economic opportunity, there is concern among residents. Questions about environmental impact came up when the legislature passed those bills.

The hearing is set for Dec. 3.

Detroit Mayor and gubernatorial candidate Mike Duggan is going to lose a huge asset in having the mayoral megaphone to command attention once Mayor-Elect Mary Sheffield takes office.

When random individual homeowners decide to electrify, a shrinking number of remaining gas customers have to pay to maintain the entire pipeline system.

The company doesn’t sell the program to customers by talking about climate change or emissions.","If all goes well, after just a week or so of focused, frenzied work, the show arrives at the grand finale: the capping of the gas line.

Liu has staged this performance more than 25 times since 2023 as the implementation contractor for Electric Advantage, an incentive program in New York offered by the gas and electric utility Con Edison. The program covers 100% of the cost of replacing a building owner’s gas-powered appliances with electric versions, plus installing insulation and air sealing. Although it sounds too good to be true, there’s no catch — except that you have to be lucky enough to own a building that’s eligible for the program and agree to cut your gas connection.

ConEd, as it’s known, delivers natural gas to just over a million customers in the Bronx, Manhattan, Northern Queens, and Westchester County, and qualifies buildings for the program by first identifying sections of pipeline on the peripheries of its network that are due for replacement. Then it runs a cost-benefit analysis. If it would be cheaper to electrify all of the buildings served by a given stretch of gas main than to dig up the street and replace the pipe, the company starts going out to the homeowners and businesses along the line to gauge their interest. If the owners agree to go electric, that’s when Liu steps in.

There’s no established name for what Liu does. “It’s not a home improvement business, it’s not an energy efficiency business, it’s not an HVAC business,” she told me. “It’s about putting together a tight live production.” An apt title would be “electrification contractor” — one of the few, if not the only one of her kind operating in the New York area.

Anyone who has tried to electrify even just one appliance in their home has probably wished they could hire someone like Liu. Between finding an available and trustworthy contractor, navigating quotes and equipment choices, and managing ballooning costs, the process is often frustrating and confusing. It’s a major time commitment, not to mention a big capital investment — not a winning formula for mass adoption.

Liu doesn’t offer her services to just any homeowner, though. She only takes on jobs that come through contracts with utilities and government agencies like the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA. Having ConEd’s backing is actually one of the major benefits Liu brings to the work. It means she’s held to stringent standards of performance. Her business fronts the full cost of every Electric Advantage project, putting up tens of thousands of dollars for parts and labor, and only gets paid back by the utility after she demonstrates she’s met every requirement. Engineers check her design choices on the front end and the installations on the back end. A missing anti-tip bracket on a stove once almost cost her an entire $100,000 job, she told me.

Liu is the first to admit that all of this is a huge headache and a tough business model. She also fundamentally believes in this being utility-backed work. When a homeowner pursues a project on their own, the oversight is only as strong as their own ability to vet contractors and manage the job — which, with limited time, information, and leverage in the market, is likely not nearly as strong as Liu’s.

“My conviction is, for the middle class to thrive, we need to have a lot of things that are expensive to do and complex to do to become utilities,” Liu said. “That’s my hypothesis since I was 22.”

In the climate world, a lot of advocates and experts also believe that a utility-run program like Electric Advantage is the key to unlocking an all-electric future, although for slightly different reasons. When random individual homeowners decide to electrify, a shrinking number of remaining gas customers have to pay to maintain the entire pipeline system. If utilities instead strategically prune the gas system while helping customers go electric, the theory goes, it can reduce costs for remaining gas customers while also creating sustained demand for heat pump retrofits. This would help build the workforce necessary to perform them and create economies of scale.

The problem is, ConEd has 4,400 miles of gas mains. In just over two years of running Electric Advantage, the utility has retired about half of one mile. If the program, or similar ones at other New York utilities, were ever to scale from converting about a dozen buildings a year to taking on the whole state, it would need a lot more Julie Lius. ConEd has a small network of contractors who take on projects with more limited scopes, but Liu is the only one doing whole-home decarbonization.

“It’s high capex deployment of complex work in the field, and you have to have people who go into people’s homes and not piss them off,” said Liu. “That’s a very unique business.”

Liu is not exactly a known figure in the world of building electrification. She’s not on social media or otherwise broadcasting her accomplishments or policy views. You won’t find her headlining clean energy panels or on the boards of nonprofits. But Liu has been quietly leading building electrification in the New York area for nearly a decade. Her early belief in heat pumps and determination to bring them to the New York market helped lay the foundation for future programs in the state.

Long before all of this, Liu was a Taiwanese immigrant growing up in Hacienda Heights, Los Angeles. Her family moved to California from Taipei in 1983, just before she entered seventh grade. Liu told me she “did all the good, dutiful-daughter things.” Her family owned a small furniture manufacturing business, and she went to college at Carnegie Mellon for business and industrial design with the intention of helping her dad produce “more inspiring furniture than colonial reproductions.”

Then her education at Carnegie Mellon took her in a different direction. The programs were built around “productivity, process orientation, efficiency, build it cheaper, faster — it’s all about, can you get things done?” She developed an appreciation for utilities, in a broad sense — for how much of the economy was built around “serving more and more people at scale, and serving them better things.”

When she graduated in the mid-1990s, Liu broke the news to her parents that she wanted to get into telecommunications — the hot field at the time. She initially thought she wanted to work at the Federal Communications Commission, but some early mentors warned her that she wasn’t suited for government work and connected her with a job at DirectTV. “You’re too eager to get things done, you’ll be banging your head against the wall,” she recalled being told at the time. “Go to the private sector.”

She went on to spend the next 15-odd years working in satellite television in New York, with a brief interlude starting a software-as-a-service company with an ex-boyfriend that was a little too ahead of its time, according to Liu. She was successful in the industry, but she wasn’t very happy, she told me. She felt like she was “growing couch potatoes.”

By 2014, after a few zigs and zags — business school, a stint at an online real estate startup in Luxembourg — Liu found herself back in New York, unemployed, and spending a lot of her time trying to fix up the rat-infested Brooklyn brownstone she owned. The building had an oil-burning heating system that was draining her bank account. She wanted to install minisplit heat pumps, which were everywhere back in Taiwan, but at the time nobody was really doing that in New York.

In early 2016, still unemployed and living off savings and tenant rent, Liu reached out to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, to ask about incentives for minisplits, and got connected to a consulting firm called the Levy Partnership that was putting together a proposal for the agency’s first-ever heat pump pilot project. The company told her that brownstones were too difficult and expensive, though, and that it was planning to propose doing the pilot in just a couple of mobile homes on Long Island.

Liu was peeved. Statistically that wouldn’t have even constituted a demonstration, she told me. “That’s not even an alpha in the world of where I came from, satellite communications.” She made a bet with the firm. It was a Thursday. If she could get a bunch of her neighbors to sign letters of interest in the pilot by Monday, she told the company, then “you’re gonna copy and paste that trailer park proposal and say there’s gonna be one for brownstones.”

Needless to say, she got the letters. But Liu didn’t just get the Levy Partnership to expand its proposal or to include her brownstone in the pilot. She convinced it to hire her to help implement the projects. She had looked up the census data on home heating and saw that about half the boilers in the New York City area used expensive heating oil. “I was like, there’s the money,” she told me. She saw that people could lower their bills by switching to heat pumps, while also getting access to better cooling in the summertime. “The business opportunity was just like when I got into satellite, right? It was a transition,” she said.

A week after she and the firm co-submitted their proposal to NYSERDA, Liu incorporated her new company under the name Centsible House. (Her business now goes by the name Carta Electric Homes.) NYSERDA awarded the team the funding a few months later, and by March 2017 they were executing agreements with homeowners to participate. The pilot ran for two years and installed heat pumps in 20 homes throughout Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Long Island, including Liu’s brownstone. Learnings from those projects informed the development of New York’s statewide Clean Heat program, a partnership between utilities and the state that launched in 2020, offering rebates for heat pumps. Liu was “patient zero,” she told me.

After that, NYSERDA as well as ConEd and another local utility, National Grid, hired Liu for other demonstration projects and heat pump programs. She racked up more than a dozen trainings and certifications from the Building Performance Institute, the Environmental Protection Agency, and various equipment manufacturers, developing expertise in building envelopes, heat pumps, refrigerant systems, and health and safety.

In this piecemeal way, Liu created the job of the electrification contractor from the ground up. By the time ConEd was preparing to launch the Electric Advantage program, Liu had the only contracting business in the area that was essentially purpose-built to take it on.

On a recent Thursday morning in Croton, New York, a suburb of New York City, the show was behind schedule. Liu and I pulled up to a two-family house at the top of a hill to oversee what was supposed to be the “grand finale” day of an Electric Advantage-funded retrofit.

In this case, workers had already put in a new electrical panel, minisplit heat pumps, and a heat pump clothes dryer. Now, electricians would rewire the kitchens with 220-volt outlets for new induction stoves, while a father and son duo of plumbers would put heat pump water heaters in the basement, and a weatherization team would spray insulation around the perimeter of the basement roof and attic floor.

While still sitting in the driveway, Liu called PC Richard, the appliance store, to check on the stove delivery, but the sales rep on the other end was confused — she didn’t have anything scheduled. Liu kept her cool and worked it out, setting a new delivery date for the following day. She turned to me, with sympathy, to let me know this meant I wouldn’t get the denouement she had promised — the cutting and capping of the gas line. She made sure the plumbers could come back on Friday to finish the job.

The planning for this project began many months before, with a knock on the door from a man named Mark Brescia, who manages Electric Advantage for ConEd. Brescia does all the initial outreach, making house calls, phone calls, and sending emails, trying to sell homeowners on the idea. Part of the challenge is that in most cases, unless 100% of the buildings served by a given gas main agree to participate, the company can’t move forward because it won’t be able to retire the pipe. The majority of successful Electric Advantage projects to date have replaced gas mains that were serving a single building.

The company doesn’t sell the program to customers by talking about climate change or emissions. Instead, Brescia explains that the money that would have been spent digging up a gas pipeline could instead be used to buy them brand new appliances. “Customers are excited about the opportunity to make their everyday living more comfortable,” Brescia told me when I asked what the biggest selling point tended to be. They also “no longer worry about having to spend money to replace equipment when it fails.” If the building owner is interested, the next step is for them to schedule a visit from Liu, who does a site evaluation and budgets the job.

Survey data collected by ConEd shows that the most common reason customers decline to participate is a preference for gas cooking. The second is fear of higher electric bills. ConEd makes no guarantees to customers that their overall bills will go down if they participate, but by pairing the new appliances with air sealing and insulation, it tries to ensure the homes will run as efficiently as possible. Liu does her best to provide customer education, walking them through how to operate their heat pumps correctly — running the devices consistently, rather than turning them up and down or on and off, which uses more energy. Customers can also opt in to a special ConEd electricity rate that can save heat pump customers money if they run their systems this way.

“Many customers are still learning about the superior performance and convenience these technologies offer,” Brescia said. But there are also other bottlenecks to expanding the Electric Advantage program. Under New York law, if customers want to keep their gas service, ConEd must oblige them. So unless and until legislators change this “duty to serve,” the program will be hamstrung by customers who turn it down.

The program also currently only targets replacement of leak-prone “radial” mains — pipes that connect to the wider gas distribution system on just one end — as these can be removed without affecting system safety or reliability. The path to expanding it beyond these is uncertain because, as currently structured, that would start to put an untenable burden on customers.

Whether the money goes to a new gas main or a home electrification project, it comes from ConEd’s gas ratepayers through their bills. Whenever ConEd identifies a new batch of mains that meet the program’s specifications, it must submit a benefit-cost analysis to state regulators for approval to pursue the projects before it can begin reaching out to homeowners. In the most recent batch submitted to regulators, for example, replacing the 26 mains identified would have cost nearly $8 million, while the estimated cost of electrifying the buildings served was around $6 million, plus another $1 million in electric system upgrades. The latter is obviously a better deal for customers, even if, as an incentive, ConEd earns back part of the difference as a bonus — also paid for by customers.

Since gas customers pay for the program, it doesn’t totally solve the problem of a shrinking number of customers covering these major investments, even if they are spending less than they otherwise would. And once the most cost-effective projects get taken care of, the expense of electrification will be harder to justify.

Growing the program also depends on having more contractors like Liu to implement it, Brescia told me. Liu has a proven track record of coordinating multiple trades, upholding standards, and educating customers. “Delivering an exceptional customer experience is essential to building trust and driving widespread adoption of electric appliances,” he said.

Throughout the day that I spent with her, Liu vacillated over the question of whether she should or even could expand her business. Working alone enables her to keep costs down, she told me. “I cannot afford to hire additional people,” she said, “because every extra bit of cash flow I end up generating as a profit gets fed to more jobs” — that is, more electrification projects. She also doesn’t want to take on a bunch of high interest debt in order to front more capital to take on more projects.

At other points, she talked about scaling as both important and inevitable. She believes in whole-home electrification — both as a climate solution and as a way to change people’s lives for the better — and wants to see other entrepreneurs like her, especially women, be able to pursue this as a career. She already gets more job leads than she’s able to pursue. She’s starting to think about other fundraising options, such as finding private investors.

Liu also recently started working with a Columbia University masters student to develop software that would help manage and automate all of the “mind-numbing, insane amounts of reporting, submissions, and invoicing” she has to do. Although she already does all of the administrative work digitally, the process has only gotten more arduous as the various programs and companies she works with frequently change what and how she has to report back, whether due to shifting policies or just a round of McKinsey-ification. This is part of what prevents her from being able to take on more work, since all the bureaucratic overhead makes it harder for her to fully close a job and get paid.

Although it’s still very early in the process, her hope is that this kind of software solution could also make it easier for others to get into the field.

“I actually really think this is a very suitable career for every eight-year-old little girl who wants a Barbie’s dream house,” she told me. “If every woman can run a $10 million electrification business, it’d be great. I think we’ll get a lot more done.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjI2NTc3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NTEzMDQ3M30.5x3wcdP-gq0UzfJoEfxfh4Uo_XXV7hbR2XRxVL35Yq8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-03 12:00:51.032502

While there don’t appear to be any specific, imminent cyber or physical threats to the U.S. power grid, China has been seeking vulnerabilities in network systems to be used in future attacks, panelists said during a U.S. House of Representatives hearing Tuesday on threats to the U.S. energy system.

Volt Typhoon — a group believed to be run by the People’s Republic of China’s state security service — is focused on maintaining ongoing access to U.S. network systems for future potential disruptions, according to Michael Ball, CEO of the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center and senior vice president at the North American Electric Reliability Corp.

China is preparing for conflict over Taiwan, potentially in the “very near term,” and its strategy depends on preventing the United States from mounting a successful rescue mission, Harry Krejsa, director of Studies for the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology, said during the hearing held by the Energy and Commerce Committee’s energy subcommittee.

Part of China’s plan is to target U.S. civilian infrastructure to create panic and chaos, Krejsa said.

“Our aging infrastructure makes these threats easier, including in our energy ecosystem,” he said. “Today’s electricity grid is too often a hodgepodge of digital tools sitting atop an analog foundation, creating seams where adversaries can slip in.”

China is the most persistent cyber threat to the U.S., according to Zach Tudor, associate laboratory director for national and homeland security at the Idaho National Laboratory.

“Through Volt Typhoon, Salt Typhoon [and] Flax Typhoon, the Chinese Communist Party has embedded itself in our energy communications and water systems to set conditions for destructive attacks during the Pacific conflict over Taiwan,” he said. “They’re winning without fighting, attempting to undermine our infrastructure.”

Although no U.S. blackouts have been attributed to a cyberattack, “the threat landscape is dynamic and requires continuous vigilance,” Ball said.

Panelists called on Congress to expand programs and funding for cyber defense.

Congress should continue to fund information sharing collaboration initiatives, like the Energy Threat Analysis Center, a pilot initiative led by the Department of Energy that brings together power sector and federal officials, according to Sharla Artz, vice president for security and resilience policy at Xcel Energy.

“Expanding programs like [the Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program] enhances industry and government understanding of the threat landscape and thus needs additional government funding to accomplish that expansion,” said Artz, who represented the Edison Electric Institute at the hearing.

Tim Lindahl, president and CEO of Kenergy, a cooperative utility based in Henderson, Kentucky, urged Congress to reauthorize the $250 million Rural and Municipal Utility Cybersecurity Program, which runs through fiscal year 2026.

Lindahl called on DOE to disburse $80 million in RMUC awards that were announced last fall.

“With continued partnership and targeted federal investment, we can strengthen our defenses and ensure the security of the energy infrastructure that powers our nation,” said Lindahl, who spoke on behalf of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

NERC’s Ball urged Congress to reauthorize the expired Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 to support information sharing between the private sector and government.

During the hearing, Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said the Trump administration was undermining U.S. infrastructure protection efforts by cutting $5.6 billion in funding for state and local grid hardening and resiliency programs.

“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said.","With a new governor poised to take the reins in January, a public policy group has issued a roadmap for New Jersey’s future, warning that runaway housing costs, public health and educational inequities, and public transportation gaps undermine the potential of many residents.

The Fund for New Jersey convened policy experts, community leaders, and residents for a series of conversations earlier this year to come up with the policy priorities released Wednesday.

Brandon McKoy, the nonprofit’s president, hopes policymakers at all levels, from Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill “down to the dog catcher,” regard the report’s recommendations as marching orders from New Jersey’s 9.5 million residents.

“We listened closely to what New Jerseyans told us,” McKoy said. “These recommendations reflect the priorities that surfaced repeatedly and the areas where leadership is needed most.”

McKoy’s group, which has provided two grants to the New Jersey Monitor, listed seven policy priorities they deemed most urgent:

Public health, climate, and the environment

Officials should step up ongoing efforts to eliminate lead exposure, which can cause developmental delays, behavioral changes, and other health harms, especially in children. As climate risks escalate and the clean-energy workforce expands, policymakers should create a statewide hub to train people for green jobs such as stormwater management and urban forestry.

Officials should revive a ban on trucks older than 2007 from ports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to reduce diesel emissions in Newark, Elizabeth, and surrounding areas already disproportionately impacted by pollution.

Officials should do a cost-benefit analysis of beach replenishment projects, including climate change considerations. Such work has cost more than $3 billion in federal, state, and local tax funds, according to NJ.com. The feds typically foot the bulk of the bill, but the Trump administration has cut hundreds of millions in beach renewal funds this year.

“It is a losing proposition to keep spending taxpayer dollars to replace sand that washes away in extreme weather,” the report says.

Criminal justice reform

Officials can make the criminal justice system fairer by shortening the state’s speedy-trial timeline, in which defendants can languish for up to two years in prison waiting for their case to go to trial.

Rather than cracking down on low-level crimes like disorderly conduct, officials should divert such offenders to social services, sparing them convictions that later can block access to jobs, housing, and education, the report says.

They should also reduce barriers that threaten the successful reentry of people who leave prison. That could involve providing transitional housing, eliminating employment restrictions and driver’s license suspensions, and funding health care, educational, and vocational programs.

Allowing people with felony convictions to serve on juries also should be a priority, the report says. Excluding them separates them from a civic duty and keeps their lived experience out of jury deliberations.

Schools

The state should shift away from a census-based funding model to cover the cost of special education services. That model uses a statewide average to fund special education, leaving districts with more special-education students than average scrambling to close budget gaps.

The state also should spend more on higher education, with the broader goal of increasing the number of residents who earn college degrees. Gov. Phil Murphy cut more than $100 million from New Jersey’s colleges and universities in the current budget. That means New Jersey’s already expensive institutions could hike tuition to make up the loss, leaving degrees out of reach for low- and middle-income students, according to the report.

Already, fewer than half — about 43% — of New Jersey residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, the report says. And thousands of college students take longer than four years to complete a degree, adding to their debt burden.

Affordable housing

McKoy’s group recommends reestablishing the state public advocate’s office, a watchdog former Gov. Chris Christie abolished in 2010, and making fair housing one of its key mandates.

Christie also dissolved the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission in 2015 by merging it with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. The commission had used regional tax-base sharing, which enabled 14 towns to share the costs and benefits of development. McKoy’s group recommends restoring the commission as an independent agency, as well as its tax-base-sharing, to ensure stronger enforcement of environmental standards.

Enacting statewide rent controls and growing the Affordable Housing Trust Fund also should be priorities for policymakers.

Jobs and the economy

The state should repeal the New Jersey Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, which enables officials to suspend the driver’s license or vehicle registration of people who don’t pay parking fines. That disproportionately impacts lower-income residents, who may be unable to afford parking fines. Losing their license or registration could threaten their jobs, so New Jersey should follow the lead of states including Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Illinois, where lawmakers ended license suspensions over most non-moving violations.

New Jersey’s unemployment rate is higher than the national average. And 9% of residents age 25 to 64 don’t have a high school diploma or general-equivalency degree — the minimum requirement for many jobs, according to the Kids Count Data Center. Those trends show that the state should provide more and better education and vocational training.

Making child care more affordable would help, the report says. While the state has expanded free preschool, universal child care is “vital for helping families succeed,” McKoy said.

“It’s really becoming a major, major crisis that’s preventing families from being able to be economically stable, let alone successful,” he said.

The report also recommends that New Jersey establish a guaranteed basic income, in which low-income families could count on state support for their essential needs.

“It is a crucial safety net addition for today’s economy, where full-time work does not guarantee financial stability,” the report says.

Baby bonds also would help erase disparities by giving low-income infants a savings endowment they can access at age 18.

The state’s fiscal responsibility

The record $58.8 billion budget state lawmakers approved in June contained controversial cuts, diversions, and funding freezes on affordable housing, child care, and opioid settlement funds, among other things, that left angry advocates demanding reversals. At the same time, lawmakers tacked on more than $700 million in last-minute pet projects critics have condemned as pork.

“Budgets are statements of decisions, and every budget has things in it that I would say are driving towards community benefit, and unfortunately, some things that are not,” McKoy said.

To ensure better fiscal responsibility, the fund recommended that officials review and reduce the tax breaks the state has increasingly given out to lure businesses to New Jersey.

“The effectiveness of this strategy is being questioned. At present, New Jersey does not monitor tax expenditures closely to control their growth and to determine whether they deliver their intended economic benefits,” the report notes.

New Jersey also must restore its “rainy day” reserves, which are meant to cover state operations during emergencies. The state now ranks last in the nation, with just enough money in its rainy day fund to cover two days of operations; Wyoming, in comparison, leads the nation, with enough in its reserves to run the state for 302 days, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

Public transit

Public transit agencies in other states can rely on regular operating funds from the state. NJ Transit’s funding, though, is marked by “constant scarcity and instability,” the report says.

The agency consequently diverts $400 million annually in federal transit dollars meant for capital improvements to cover budget shortfalls, which contributes to chronic service disruptions, according to the report. Establishing a stable and permanent state funding allocation would improve service.

The group also called on NJ Transit, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, and the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization to work together to conduct long-range planning.

“A lack of public transportation options in South Jersey in particular was a major sore spot for folks,” McKoy said. “Not only will that help folks have different ways of getting around, but also alleviate traffic on the road.”

Other emerging issues

The report listed several other “emerging” priorities, including expanding government oversight and accountability.

Eliminating or weakening government watchdogs leaves public programs and systems vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse, the report says.

McKoy pointed to lawmakers’ current effort to strip the state comptroller’s office of its investigative powers. Such an effort goes against what his group heard during their community conversations, he said.

“Folks want to know that the government is properly spending public money and also cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse,” McKoy said. “They talk about the state being expensive and needing to do a better job of officially using funds. So we need to actually invest more in these offices that are providing oversight of government processes.”

The report recommends making the state comptroller an independent position, rather than one appointed by the governor and subject to state Senate approval; reestablishing the state Office of the Public Advocate to give residents a stronger voice in holding government accountable; and expanding the Open Public Records Act to reduce exemptions that allow officials to keep records secret. Lawmakers last year instead added new restrictions to public records.

Policymakers also should embrace policies that support immigrants, who comprise 29% of New Jersey’s working population, the report says. Strategies could include boosting funding to the state Office of New Americans and creating pathways for immigrants to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.

The report urges policymakers to expand access to voting by passing same-day voter registration and a Voting Rights Act.

McKoy’s group also implored officials to get an early start on ensuring the state’s population is correctly counted in the 2030 Census. Federal officials use census data to determine federal funding, so an accurate count is especially important as states endure unprecedented cuts made by the Trump administration, McKoy added.

“The census is the biggest non-wartime effort in the history of the nation, so it requires a lot of forethought,” he said. “Making sure we do a good job on the Census is actually really crucial over these next couple of years to make sure that we are getting all of our federal funds possible.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0199_1-2048x1394.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:00:53.786931

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Approximately $3.6 billion in delayed funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, was released Friday to states and tribes, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

The federal funding for LIHEAP, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes, has been held up during the beginning of the cold-weather season because of the federal government shutdown, which ended Nov. 12.

“This release of LIHEAP funding is essential and long overdue,” Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, said in a statement. “Families can finally begin receiving the support they need to keep the heat on as winter begins.”

States typically receive their allocations at the beginning of November.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, has not yet issued a formal public announcement about resumption of the funding. After the federal shutdown ended, HHS said one of its agencies would “work swiftly to administer annual awards,” blaming the delay on congressional Democrats.

Wolfe said state agencies told his organization they’ve received award letters from HHS, enabling them to begin distributing assistance to households.

A message was left seeking comment with HHS.

On Monday, a bipartisan group of U.S. House members sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging him to release the LIHEAP funds by Nov. 30. Given the heating season has already started in many parts of the U.S., they said “there is no time to waste,” especially for households that use home heating oil or propane. Those fuels typically aren’t affected by state moratoriums on utility shutoffs during the winter months.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25325014112956.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:01:18.287447

The researchers at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn't involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute's work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Similar concerns could well arise in energy regulation.
He goes on to cite Scotland’s water sector as a place where this is done well.
Either way, could similar changes help the energy sector?
The Independent Water Commission’s report is more than a ‘blueprint’ for the water sector: it’s a signal to all UK infrastructure regulators that significant reform could occur if public policy issues are not adequately addressed.","In July 2025 the Independent Water Commission delivered its final report calling for a single, integrated water regulator for England – merging Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and water-environment functions from the Environment Agency and Natural England, with tailored arrangements for Wales. The aim: restore public trust, enable long-term investment, and deliver environmental outcomes through a clearer, less fragmented regime.

This shake-up in the water sector, with what some would see as quite radical reforms – followed by Ofwat Chief Executive David Black stepping down in August 2025 – is about more than clean rivers and efficient investment in critical infrastructure. It’s a warning bell to what reform might bring if a sector like water fails to deliver what is expected by society and the media.

Just as the Commission proposes breaking down silos in water regulation, achieving net zero will require integrated oversight, adaptive price controls, and regulators with the commitment, skills, resourcing, and mandate to manage cross-sector, system-wide transitions.

Infrastructure is the circulatory system that keeps society functioning – access to affordable, reliable, and resilient water, energy, transport, communication, and waste services is essential for health, productivity, and growth, for individuals and the UK’s economy. But these systems face mounting pressures, evidence by:

Environmental performance gaps: in 2023, UK water companies discharged sewage into rivers and seas over 300,000 times, and pollution incidents are on an upward trend.

Infrastructure bottlenecks: new grid connections for renewable energy projects have faced delays of up to a decade.

These are not abstract issues: the UK’s legally binding target requires national greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to net zero by 2050, and 2030 is the decisive decade. By 2035 the UK must deliver a fully decarbonised power sector, achieve the Sixth Carbon Budget emissions pathway, and meet statutory water sector resilience and leakage targets.

This is not simply a technical delivery challenge – it is also cultural and attitudinal, taking place in contested spaces where privately operated entities exist to serve public needs.

When regulatory culture fosters trust, clarity, and partnership, investment and innovation follow. When it lapses into mistrust or overly rigid control, it can stifle initiative and delay essential investment.

This means infrastructure companies, and their owners, must act to decarbonise, adapt, and expand within tight timeframes, and regulators must enable, not hinder this transformation.

Yet achieving this will require more than better regulation – it will demand breakthrough thinking from all actors. As Paul Hawken and the UN Global Compact’s Project Breakthrough note, genuine breakthroughs occur when institutions shift from incremental efficiency to transformative outcomes – aligning governance, investment, and innovation toward shared goals.

Regulators influence company behaviour through the application of regulatory frameworks: the combination of price controls, performance targets, and incentives that set the commercial conditions for investment.

UK infrastructure regulation was shaped by the privatisations of the 1980s and 1990s, anchored in the so-called RPI-X model: prices could only rise by the Retail Price Index minus an efficiency factor (X), incentivising productivity without compromising service quality.

This model, first applied in the privatisation of British Telecom, was built for stable, low-risk sectors, not for infrastructure undergoing climate-driven transformation. The early emphasis was on driving out inefficiency and lowering costs to consumers, with regulators acting as arm’s-length economic ‘referees’ rather than strategic partners in system change.

While this approach delivered cost efficiency, it was premised on utilities as stable, low-risk businesses.

The RIIO model, introduced in the mid-2010s by Ofgem, linked revenue to incentives, innovation, and specified outputs. In water, periodic price reviews set investment allowances and service targets over five years based on a RIIO type approach.

Regulation through RPI-X and RIIO approaches have had a short-term focus (in the context of very long-lived assets) and the design of UK regulatory cycles – typically five years – can entrench short-term decision-making. Companies naturally plan around these windows, leading to bursts of investment just before the review ends, or risk-averse deferral of innovative projects.

In energy, grid connection delays and backlog costs are a clear symptom of long-term needs being stifled and subordinated to annual or five-year planning cycle logic.

While these frameworks were designed to continue to deliver improved efficiency and the delivery of customer centric outcomes, they were not designed for a world with climate change, technological disruption, and the investment levels required by the net zero transition.

The National Audit Office commented on gaps in the conduct of regulation – such as Ofwat’s limited insight into the condition of water and wastewater assets – which constrain its ability to ensure adequate investment. Similar concerns could well arise in energy regulation.

Capability is not about capacity. It’s about having the skills, data, and decision-making agility to manage “radical uncertainty”: the reality that future demand, technology costs, and climate impacts cannot be predicted with precision.

In this environment, rigid rulebooks can create perverse outcomes, while adaptive frameworks can keep the system on track.

Regulatory offices have expanded significantly in size – with Ofgem staff numbers increasing from 300 in 2001-02 to 1,800 and Ofwat’s staff numbers increasing from 219 to 322 over the same time period. This has led to a bureaucratization of regulation, and a pursuit of illusory precision to get the ‘right, objective’ answer based on an outdated economic model.

The key to capability is about understanding how companies respond to incentives put in place and building trust that ensures that private companies deliver public outcomes.

Oxford emeritus professor Colin Mayer is critical of regulatory systems which create a “…conflict between private companies with a primary interest in profit and regulators concerned about the public interest of customers and communities.”

What is required, he states, is the need for ‘purposeful regulation’ that would endeavor to tackle some of the behavioral weaknesses and lack of trust that are clear to see in current regulatory frameworks. He goes on to cite Scotland’s water sector as a place where this is done well.

The Independent Water Commission’s proposal for an integrated regulator is, in effect, a sector-specific ‘uber regulator'. The logic seems to be one of seeking control to cope with the current model of fragmented oversight, which makes it harder to manage systemic risks and optimise investment.

The Cunliffe review cannot be faulted for its comprehensive nature with its 88 extensive recommendations covering a wide range of issues from strategic direction, planning and the legislative framework to detailed regulatory reform, but the nature of the changes is a huge departure from the model of an independent regulator.

There is a real question as to whether changes of this scale can be made to work. It remains to be seen whether merging two underperforming regulators (Ofwat and the Environment Agency) with the Drinking Water Inspectorate can deliver meaningful change, given the risks of added bureaucracy and challenges in securing sufficient expertise.

One also needs to consider the transfer of risk from private companies to the regulator that the review is in essence proposing through its supervisory model. Whether this proves to be an approach that stifles necessary innovation only time will tell.

There are a significant number of recommendations on the legal and policy framework in the Cunliffe review, where parallels with energy can be drawn.

This begs two questions:

Is there a systematic problem with the RIIO type framework itself (that the Cunliffe review seems to be pointing to) or is it simply that Ofwat has not operated it well?

Either way, could similar changes help the energy sector?

One of the most notable suggestions in the review is for a comprehensive planning framework with the establishment of regional catchment-based system planners and a “light national water systems planning coordination function”.

There is a clear read across here to the establishment of the National Energy System Operator (NESO) in energy who have responsibility for developing Regional Energy System Plans as well as national plans. This model of course is still in its infancy in energy, but at least proactively seeks to tackle coordination issues.

There are also several recommendations relating to regulatory methodology – an area where the water and network element of energy regulation share very similar RIIO-based regulatory frameworks.

The review is critical of and provides recommendations in a number of these areas including:

ceasing the use of totex as a concept

removing incentives for good business plans

placing less reliance on technical econometric modelling for determining costs

rationalizing the overall number of performance commitments and associated incentives

These changes would be quite a big departure for Ofgem if applied in energy too.

To deliver net zero we have a number of the right systems and tools - such as the NESO - but there is a need to more fully consider whether we have the right regulatory framework in place.

In a welcome move, Ofgem developed a set of regulatory 'archetypes’ which it consulted on before its RIIO-3 price reviews for gas and energy sectors, including traditional ex ante type approaches based on RIIO five yearly price reviews.

They are nevertheless reluctant to move away from this regulatory approach to a more ‘rate of return’ type approach (its so-called ‘freedom and accountability’ archetype) – and are more inclined towards moving to the ‘plan and deliver’ archetype at least for electricity transmission and distribution.

Perhaps the time is now right to make a bolder shift to better align the motives and interests of regulators and companies.

RIIO was introduced following Ofgem’s RIIO@20 review launched in March 2008 – after twenty years of RPI-X regulation – and has now been in place for well over 15 years. So, arguably the time is right for a comprehensive review and reset.

There is much for the Government to consider from the Cunliffe review in relation to the water sector, but we should not fail to read across to what this could mean for the energy sector too. The real challenge is to develop regulatory institutions, methodologies and a culture that creates ‘purposeful regulation’, and a stable consistent framework for investment.

The Independent Water Commission’s report is more than a ‘blueprint’ for the water sector: it’s a signal to all UK infrastructure regulators that significant reform could occur if public policy issues are not adequately addressed.

For investors, stable and climate-aligned regulatory frameworks are the foundation for unlocking the billions needed to upgrade and decarbonise the UK’s infrastructure.

For society, they are the guarantee that services remain affordable, resilient, and equitable.

And for the global economy, the UK’s position as a financial and regulatory leader means its example can shape how capital flows to climate-critical infrastructure worldwide.

But capability now means more than technical competence: it demands broader ability to mobilise rapid, system-wide progress toward net zero while maintaining legitimacy and trust.

The decisive years to 2030 will determine whether the UK can deliver affordable, enduring, investable infrastructure fit for a low-carbon economy. Investing in regulatory capability is investing in this delivery.",https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-12/Water_pipe_pollution_AdobeStock_180516796.jpeg,N,,2025-12-03 16:02:15.401632

Still, the Trump administration is moving forward with the RIFs at State.
Impacted employees received a message this week stating that they would be separated on Dec. 5.
In August, as the FSOs awaited their official terminations, many of those impacted by RIFs received promotions.
The following day, SBA sent a new message to the roughly 75 impacted employees saying the RIFs were back on and they should ignore the previous communication.","Updated Dec. 3 at 10:50 a.m.

The State Department will finalize its layoffs of 250 foreign service officers on Friday, according to a new notice sent to impacted staff, despite a congressionally mandated moratorium on the cuts through January.

State announced sent reduction-in-force notices to 1,350 employees in July. Most of those workers were civil servants who were terminated in September. Those in the foreign service, however, were required to receive 120 days notice, meaning they were due for dismissal in November. Due to the government shutdown and a court order pausing federal layoffs, those cuts did not move forward at that time.

The shutdown ended when President Trump signed into law a measure extending funding through January for most agencies, which also banned the administration from taking any action to execute a RIF.

“No federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the federal government” for the duration of the spending law, the continuing resolution ordered.

Still, the Trump administration is moving forward with the RIFs at State. Impacted employees received a message this week stating that they would be separated on Dec. 5. State said its Office of Legal Adviser made the decision after receiving “formal written guidance from both the Office of Management and Budget and Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.”

The layoffs, State said, do not violate the language of the recently passed spending bill because the RIF notices were sent prior to the shutdown. Federal News Network first reported the new layoff date.

The Trump administration has rescinded RIF notices sent to nearly 4,000 employees during the shutdown, but is moving forward with those that initially preceded the funding lapse.

One soon-to-be former foreign service officer, a former attorney, called the administration’s legal argument “absolute BS.”

“They are moving quickly and basically saying, ‘Sue us,’” the employee said, adding that impacted staff are speaking to legal counsel and talking to lawmakers’ offices.

A State spokesperson said the RIFs will ""proceed as planned.

“Since the State Department’s lawful RIF process was commenced and initiated well before the lapse in appropriations, the eliminated positions are not impacted by the language in the recent Continuing Resolution,"" the spokesperson said.

The American Foreign Service Association said on Tuesday the administration’s legal interpretations cannot change what is plainly written in law and vowed to pursue legal action.

“This action flies in the face of the current funding law, which clearly prohibits using any federal resources to carry out layoffs during this period,” AFSA said. “That includes sending notices, processing paperwork, or taking any step to advance these separations.”

The legally dubious layoff date marks the latest in the whirlwind of State’s RIF process. After sending the notices, citing bureaucratic bloat, it began onboarding new officers in September. In August, as the FSOs awaited their official terminations, many of those impacted by RIFs received promotions.

Other agencies have also proceeded with layoffs despite the spending law’s prohibition. The Small Business Administration originally sent RIF notices to around 75 employees in April and after a series of delays was set to separate them in October. After further delay due to the shutdown, SBA last month sent the employees an updated message saying the layoffs were canceled due to the CR. The following day, SBA sent a new message to the roughly 75 impacted employees saying the RIFs were back on and they should ignore the previous communication. Both notices were obtained by Government Executive.

OMB and Justice originally told SBA it had to rescind the RIFs, according to an employee briefed on the matter, but the following day the Office of Personnel Management intervened and said the CR was not intended to interfere with SBA’s layoffs and the agency should move forward. The employees were officially separated from the agency, retroactive to Oct. 29.

The General Services Administration is also proceeding with RIFs it first noticed prior to the shutdown but which took effect after it ended, as first reported by The New York Times.

Nextpower is growing its presence in Tennessee. The company just unveiled an expanded Southeast regional hub with a new remote monitoring center in Nashville, alongside a major expansion of its U.S. steel fabrication capacity in the region.

“The Southeast has entered a new era of energy infrastructure,” said Dan Shugar, founder and CEO of Nextpower, formerly Nextracker. “This new U.S. manufacturing line with our partner MSS not only doubles our Memphis factory production capacity for solar trackers, but it also helps our customers scale projects faster, brings new American jobs, and strengthens our supply chain.”

The addition of a new fabrication line, operated by MSS Steel Tubes USA based in Memphis, Tennessee, will double Nextpower’s manufacturing capacity with MSS for solar tracker systems used in utility-scale power plants across the Southeast. The existing steel fabrication line at the facility currently supports 120 skilled U.S. jobs, with 150 expected as the new line ramps up.

“We’re proud to have built a lasting and trusted partnership with Nextpower, one grounded in shared values of quality and innovation,” said António Pedro Antunes, CEO of Metalogalva Group, parent company of MSS. “Together, we’ve firmly established production capacity here in Tennessee to serve the growing demand for solar power infrastructure across the Southeastern United States.”

Supporting solar growth in the Southeast

According to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Southeast added 5 GW of solar in 2024 alone, pushing total capacity to nearly 28 GW, and is on track to nearly double that total to 54 GW by 2030. Nextpower’s fabrication capacity will support utility-scale solar power plants across Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Virginia — many of which are developed, owned, and operated by Tennessee-based Silicon Ranch Corp., one of the largest independent power producers in the country.

“In our first 15 years, Silicon Ranch installed more than 4 GW of solar energy capacity, one of the largest operating fleets in the United States, and we will double that figure over the next three years,” said Reagan Farr, Silicon Ranch co-founder and CEO. “Nextpower’s expansion in Tennessee helps us do so while enabling us to support additional investments in domestic manufacturing; this is what ‘unleashing American energy’ looks like.”

Shugar added, “Silicon Ranch pioneered utility-scale solar in the Southeast and continues to lead the way in delivering high quality projects that serve the region’s increasing demand for electricity.”

To celebrate economic growth in the Southeast and its expansion, Nextpower will host a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its new Nashville office, featuring Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell, executives from Silicon Ranch and MSS Steel Tubes, representatives from major U.S. steel suppliers, and officials from the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The event includes guided tours of Nextpower’s new Remote Monitoring Center, which connects Nashville-based engineers to Nextpower solar tracker projects around the world.

“Nextpower’s expansion is a powerful example of the innovation and economic momentum taking place across Tennessee,” said Josh Brown, president and CEO of the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “This investment supports new jobs, deepens our state’s manufacturing capabilities, and positions Tennessee to remain a national leader as demand for clean energy and advanced infrastructure accelerates.”

News Release

EIR forecasts modest impact on U.S. natural gas demand from data center expansion

Report highlights grid-connected data centers limit natural gas consumption due to grids having mixed generation sources, while behind-the-meter projects offer a more certain path to higher gas demand

CALGARY, Alberta (Dec. 3, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the most trusted energy SaaS company that leverages generative AI across its solutions, is releasing a new analysis forecasting U.S. data center load growth and its implications for natural gas demand through 2030.

EIR projects 30 gigawatts (GW) of new U.S. data center capacity over the next five years—significantly below the 50 GW forecasted by major grid operators. This more conservative outlook reflects the impact of stricter utility requirements, which have already reduced speculative project proposals by more than 50% in states such as Ohio.

“Our research shows that while data center expansion will drive substantial energy demand, it will have a marginal impact on natural gas in the immediate years,” said Jimmy McNamara, CFA, principal analyst at EIR. “By focusing on confirmed projects and real-world constraints, we provide a more accurate outlook for both the power and natural gas sectors.”

Key takeaways:

EIR forecasts 30 GW of new U.S. data center capacity by 2030, compared to 50 GW projected by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and PJM Interconnection (PJM).

Recent policy changes in states like Ohio, including higher power costs and stricter credit requirements, led to a 15 GW (over 50%) drop in proposed data center projects.

If all new capacity were gas-fired, it could add up to 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of incremental Lower 48 natural gas demand by 2030; however, gas growth will be lower as grid-connected data centers use mixed generation sources. EIR is more confident in 2.1 Bcf/d of growth from behind-the-meter projects with dedicated gas generation.

For example, a 1 GW data center uses approximately 140 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of natural gas, less than 1% of Appalachia’s daily production.

EIR’s analysis pulls from a variety of products including Enverus PRISM®, Enverus FOUNDATIONS® and Enverus Mosaic.

The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years.
Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.
The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.
They would also work well with solar power, Santee Cooper spokeswoman Mollie Gore said, because they can be turned on on days when the sun isn’t shining.","COLUMBIA — A legislative panel gave South Carolina’s state-owned utility the initial nod to begin purchasing equipment for a planned new natural gas plant in the Lowcountry.

Santee Cooper received unanimous approval Tuesday to borrow up to $700 million total for three separate projects, with $120 million of that for the new build in Colleton County.

But first, legislators on the Joint Bond Review Committee had questions about its growing price tag and what that might mean for power customers.

State-owned Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion have agreed to partner on a 2,200-megawatt power plant on the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.

The power companies now estimate the cost of that plant at $5 billion — up from a $2.5 billion told to senators last August.

That early estimate was based on historical costs to build similar units. But prices have increased dramatically since then as utility companies globally rush to build similar plants, said Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton.

Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

The sticker shock had some legislators questioning whether a gas plant was still the best choice for meeting the state’s growing power needs.

Rep. Leon Stavrinakis raised concerns over whether the same demand driving up the cost of the plant’s turbines would also make the gas needed to run them more expensive.

“If everybody is going to be drawing on that same power source, it seems logical to me that that power source is going to get more expensive,” the Charleston Democrat said.

Stavrinakis went on to say the rising cost of electricity is becoming too much for residents who need it to keep the lights on in their homes and small businesses.

“My constituents, I’m going to be honest with you, can’t afford any more rate increases,” he said. “People are hurting.”

Staton acknowledged the price of natural gas has gone up in the past year and a half as the United States has started to export more to other countries.

The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years. By 2030, it will double again, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy published in December 2024.

Meanwhile, use of natural gas in the U.S. is expected to hit a new record this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

However, Staton said, the cost of other fuels has been on the rise as well. He said coal prices, for example, are two to three times higher than they were four years ago.

Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.

“And in every case, what we find, is this: These are still the best dispatchable resources for us to invest in,” he said of the gas-fired power plants.

Santee Cooper will start by spending $120 million for its share of equipment costs at Canadys.

How much customers ultimately will pay on their monthly power bills for the new gas plant remains to be seen. But Staton told legislators he expects any price increases to match the general rate of inflation.

The power companies still need the permission of state regulators before it can begin construction. Staton said Santee Cooper and Dominion plans to file that application on Dec. 15.

Legislators also signed off on spending related to two other natural gas-related projects: nearly $300 million for a pair of natural gas turbines on the site of an existing coal plant near Georgetown and more than $270 million for the expansion of an existing natural gas plant.

The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.

But first, they had questions about the project’s growing price tag and what that might mean for power customers.

State-owned Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion have agreed to partner on a 2,200-megawatt power plant on the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.

The power companies now estimate the cost of that plant at $5 billion — up from a $2.5 billion told to senators last August.

That early estimate was based on historical costs to build similar units. But prices have increased dramatically since then as utility companies globally rush to build similar plants, said Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton.

Here’s what SC landowners should expect from a proposed 71-mile natural gas pipeline

The sticker shock had some legislators questioning whether a gas plant was still the best choice for meeting the state’s growing power needs.

Rep. Leon Stavrinakis raised concerns over whether the same demand driving up the cost of the plant’s turbines would also make the gas needed to run them more expensive.

“If everybody is going to be drawing on that same power source, it seems logical to me that that power source is going to get more expensive,” the Charleston Democrat said.

Stavrinakis went on to say the rising cost of electricity is becoming too much for residents who need it to keep the lights on in their homes and small businesses.

“My constituents, I’m going to be honest with you, can’t afford any more rate increases,” he said. “People are hurting.”

Staton acknowledged the price of natural gas has gone up in the past year and a half as the United States has started to export more to other countries.

The U.S. is the world’s largest producer and exporter of natural gas, and gas exports have tripled in the past five years. By 2030, it will double again, according to a study by the U.S. Department of Energy published in December 2024.

Meanwhile, use of natural gas in the U.S. is expected to hit a new record this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

However, Staton said, the cost of other fuels has been on the rise as well. He said coal prices, for example, are two to three times higher than they were four years ago.

Staton said Santee Cooper has accounted for a potential increase in natural gas prices as part of its long-term plans.

“And in every case, what we find, is this: These are still the best dispatchable resources for us to invest in,” he said of the gas-fired power plants.

Santee Cooper will start by spending $120 million for its share of equipment costs at Canadys.

How much customers ultimately will pay on their monthly power bills for the new gas plant remains to be seen. But Staton told legislators he expects any price increases to match the general rate of inflation.

The power companies still need the permission of state regulators before it can begin construction. Staton said Santee Cooper and Dominion plans to file that application on Dec. 15.

Legislators also signed off on spending related to two other natural gas-related projects: nearly $300 million for a pair of natural gas turbines on the site of an existing coal plant near Georgetown and more than $270 million for the expansion of an existing natural gas plant.

The coal plant, Winyah, came online in 1975 and Santee Cooper plans to close it down within the next decade.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.
Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources.
One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.
Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.","Reading Time: 11 minutes

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-canceled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/President-Bush-with-corn.jpg?fit=1200%2C842&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-03 11:07:28.157260

The researchers at Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet’s warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn’t involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute’s work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Rising production from OPEC and its allies around the globe has helped to drive down crude oil prices, which in turn provide relief for Americans at the pump. AAA reported Tuesday that the average price for regular U.S. gasoline was $2.998 per gallon.

“U.S. oil producers do continue to slowly increase oil production,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis with the GasBuddy fuel-price-tracking service. “But the bigger story here really has to do with OPEC.”

Members of the cartel have been squabbling, he said. Yet the group known as OPEC+ has agreed to increase production for December, following other increases this year.

AAA said Monday that the U.S. gasoline average was just over $3 a gallon before reporting Tuesday that it had dropped below that threshold. The average hadn’t been that low since May 2021, said AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz.

While details of gasoline price reports vary, the Trump administration is eager to point to lower fuel costs as it remains under pressure to address higher prices in other areas of the economy, from beef to electricity.

President Donald Trump sought to claim credit for the drop as he spoke to reporters during his Cabinet meeting Tuesday. He predicted that pump prices will keep dropping.

“We’re down at about $2.50 a gallon,” Trump said. “I think we’re going to get down to $2. We could crack that at some point.”

The president has also frequently touted the administration’s pro-drilling policies.

Prices vary widely by state because of different levies and gasoline infrastructure. Oklahoma’s average was just over $2.40 a gallon, AAA said Tuesday, while California was at $4.54 per gallon.

AAA’s highest recorded average price of $5.016 per gallon for regular U.S. gasoline came on June 14, 2022, during the administration of former President Joe Biden. It came the same year that Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

But the average U.S. price a year ago was just $3.047, AAA said Tuesday, or about a nickel more than the new $2.998 average. GasBuddy reported recently that “a few dozen stations” in the country have been selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told Trump during Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting that prices were down because of Trump himself.

“The biggest determinant of the price of energy is politicians, political leaders and policies — that’s what drives energy prices,” Wright said. “There are a number of stations in the heartland of America with $1.99 signs flying today.”

But De Haan said geopolitics are driving the market, not U.S. politics.

“OPEC is sick of ceding market share to U.S. and Canadian producers,” he said. “It’s all pretty much additional supply, right? It’s not additional supply from the United States. It’s additional supply being added to the world by OPEC.”

‘Downward pressure’

Trump has pushed for aggressive oil and gas development, clearing away regulations that crimp petroleum profits while going out of his way to block the wind and solar projects favored by Biden.

The United States became known as the largest oil producer in the world during Trump’s first term in office, and the increase continued for Biden’s four years. The latest U.S. Energy Information Administration production number, 13.84 million barrels per day in September, once again set a new record.

Parents watching the price of toys rise as Christmas approaches may be taking comfort in lower gasoline prices, though some people in the oil industry have been growing unhappy with the direction of oil prices.

They’ve watched the price of oil drop as Trump’s tariffs drive up the cost of steel and other supplies. West Texas Intermediate oil, a U.S. benchmark, settled Tuesday for less than $59 a barrel. That is below break-even prices in the range of $62 to $64 per barrel for parts of the prolific Permian Basin, as noted by EIA and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

EIA has said global Brent oil prices could average well below that range in 2026.

While production has been increasing for years, oil companies say continued low prices are causing them to start cutting back.

“The downward pressure on oil prices coupled with continued tightness in finding qualified labor in remote locations continues to pressure profitability and dividends,” an unnamed oil industry executive wrote in response to third-quarter energy questions from the Dallas Fed.

“Right now we are bleeding,” said another executive.

Beyond OPEC+ decisions, other factors have contributed to the drop in gasoline prices, such as refineries coming back online after maintenance. EIA has noted that prices often drop in winter as people drive less and environmental regulations no longer require the use of more expensive summer-grade gasoline in some areas.

Oil inventories have been growing globally and in the United States, and EIA expects them to keep rising through 2026, which puts more downward pressure on prices. OPEC+ countries may not continue production increases next year.

More broadly, De Haan said, the oil market is starting to balance out from the twin shocks of the Covid-19 pandemic that sent prices plunging and Russia’s ground war against Ukraine that sent prices surging.

“The Federal Reserve has been doing its job, trying to rein in inflation by making borrowing more expensive,” he said.

“U.S. consumers have slowed down their consumption. And various central banks worldwide have been fighting inflation, too,” De Haan added. “So, everyone’s been doing their part to slow down not only the U.S. economy, but the global economy, so that today’s supply is better matching demand.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/5c/b1/c5b0d5c2490699d8972b8ad82cad/us-extreme-weather-illinois-47592.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:09:01.405814

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90m acres – about the size of Montana – and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that the US’s obsession with corn has a steep price: the fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when the nitrogen in the fertilizer breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol – which now consumes 40% of the US corn crop – is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Industry is also pushing for ethanol-based jet fuel and higher-ethanol gasoline blends as growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of US greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide – making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

Since 2000, US corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

The environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy – and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), passed in the mid-2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn”, demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50bn in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps – such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in cornfields – could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: if the US’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it in a different way?

How corn took over the US

In the late 1990s, the US’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom”.

Corn production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of the US’s corn crop into ethanol.

In 2001, the US Department of Agriculture launched the bioenergy program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 farm bill created programs supporting ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon mounted an all-out campaign to persuade Congress to require that gasoline be blended with ethanol, arguing it cut greenhouse gasses, reduced oil dependence and revived rural economies.

“I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying: ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you,’” Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, said in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

In 2005, Congress created the RFS, which requires adding ethanol to gasoline, and expanded it two years later. The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, was more land cleared to grow corn. The Global Carbon Project found that nitrous oxide emissions from human activity rose 40% from 1980 to 2020.

In the United States, “king corn” became a political force. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55m on lobbying and millions more on political donations to Democrats and Republicans alike, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Now the sectors are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups did not respond to requests for interviews. But they have long promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40%-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong – and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement to Floodlight that US farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial”, using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint. “Biofuel producers are making investments today that will make their products net-zero or even net negative in the next two decades,” the statement said.

Some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the midwest – with the same fields planted in corn year after year – carries a heavy climate cost.

And research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to worsening water pollution and increased emissions, concluding the climate impact is “no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher”.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at the Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling – a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Nitrogen polluting rural drinking water

The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution, experts say.

According to a new report by Clean Wisconsin and the Alliance for the Great Lakes, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources – mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

In 2022, Tyler Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles (32km) east of Green Bay. Testing found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” Frye said.

He installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible – but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

Recent moves by the Trump administration have stripped out Biden-era incentives for climate-friendly farming practices, which the agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, dismissed as part of the “green new scam”.

Research, however, shows that proven conservation practices – including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields – could make a measurable difference.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson is planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer on 130 of the 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of corn and soybeans she farms with her father. Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They have also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” – bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

They were counting on $20,000 a year from the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, but it never came.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps.”

In south-east Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres. He uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller crimping: flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” Lyle said.

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel.

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based aviation fuel could prompt another 114m acres to be converted to corn, or 20% more corn acres than the US plants for all purposes.

“The result,” said University of Iowa professor and natural resources economist Silvia Secchi, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57ef13a588f12fdc935bbdd49c83b1a71dc0926d/349_0_3331_2666/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c3f5041c33fd6866d30d9a350ba545f6",N,,2025-12-03 11:08:18.811490

Together these resolutions and the IUCN program ensure that CAE and environmental whistleblowers are a high priority for IUCN.
Upcoming conventions and congresses, including the UN Convention Against Corruption, will continue to address environmental whistleblower protections and work towards strengthening enforcement of CAE.","2025 has proven to be a turning point in the establishment of strong oversight for environmental whistleblowers. After the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress (WCC) in Emirati capital Abu Dhabi—and thanks in large part to the ongoing efforts of the National Whistleblower Center’s Scott Hajost—whistleblower protections have been incorporated into five WCC resolutions, the IUCN 20 year vision, the IUCN four year program, and in the mandates of the World Commission on Environmental Law and Commission on Education and Communication (CEC). The Abu Dhabi Call to Action also addresses the urgent need for protection of environmental defenders—a category in which whistleblowers decisively fall. Combating crimes that affect the environment (CAE) is now firmly anchored in the IUCN mission after this year’s WCC. The stage is well set for environmental governance to play a role in the upcoming Doha UN Convention Against Corruption Conference of State Parties in early December and the Abu Dhabi UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in April 2026.

Scott Hajost, Senior Environmental Policy Advisor to the National Whistleblower Center (NWC), worked tirelessly to embed whistleblowers into international accords. Hajost (who is also IUCN US National Committee Vice-Chair) representing the NWC, collaborated with the Nature Crime Alliance World Resources (Alliance) based secretariat and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). The NWC and WCS are members of the Alliance.

Hajost worked closely with Elodie Parrat (senior government Engagement Manager at the Nature Crime Alliance secretariat), Charles “Chip” Barber (Director of the Alliance), and Susan Lieberman (Vice President of International Policy at the WCS), to draft a motion on CAE, and offer input on the 20 and four year programs.

As the group drafted a motion on CAE, the French government and the International Council of Environmental Law (ICEL) were drafting a similar proposal. These two motions were merged and, after a near-unanimous vote by the IUCN Members’ Assembly, became resolution 48/52 on Crimes that Affect the Environment.

In a statement on the resolution, Dr. Lieberman said, “Governments and civil society must recognize that nature crime is not a peripheral issue. It strikes at the heart of conservation, governance, and human rights. This motion is an essential step toward building a global response equal to the scale of the threat.”

Hajost views the collaboration between the Alliance, WCS, and NWC as vital to the promotion of environmental whistleblower protections. Fighting environmental crime requires multi-sectoral participation. Everyone, from governments to civil society to whistleblowers, are key to detecting, deterring, and prosecuting CAE. Hajost emphasized that the Alliance was the “glue” that held together such a large variety of actors. It was these partnerships, he continued, that “allowed the NWC to operate and really expand its reach.”

To continue working towards strong environmental whistleblower protections, Hajost said, “We started reaching out to a larger membership, including partners in the Nature Crime Alliance, members of the IUCN, to provide a larger critical mass to promote and support this motion.”

Whistleblowers, as discussed in past WNN reporting, are recognized in two other NWC supported resolutions. These include #49 on Strengthening Civic Spaces to Fulfill the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and #126 on Advancing Citizen Science to Support and Democratize Conservation. Two other resolutions, not NWC affiliated, included support for whistleblowers, demonstrating the increasing global awareness of their status as crucial to conservation. One of them, #104 on Safeguarding Biodiversity and Human Rights in Energy Transition Mineral Governance demands that state governments not tolerate attacks on human rights defenders and whistleblowers. The other resolution, #33 on Port State Measures Regarding Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, recognizes the role of whistleblowers in protecting global fisheries.

The resolutions are not yet published on the IUCN Congress resolutions platform, but all have been adopted and are in effect. Once officially published, the enumerations will change.

Together these resolutions and the IUCN program ensure that CAE and environmental whistleblowers are a high priority for IUCN. Reports from insiders allow authorities to crack down on the crimes that have the greatest impact on the ecosystem, including illegal logging, illegal fishing, wildlife trafficking, illegal mining, and even illegal dumping and polluting.

A particularly important aim of the three NWC resolutions has been to reiterate and emphasize Resolution 115 on Protecting Human and Peoples’ Rights Defenders and Whistleblowers. This motion was passed during the 2021WCC that took place in Marseille, France.

To further this goal, Resolutions 49 on Civic Spaces included a specific request to the Director General that Resolution 115 be upheld. According to Hajost, this resolution was the result of collaboration among members of the IUCN Civic Spaces Task Force. This group, chaired by Ernesto Herrera, Executive Director of Reforestamos México, worked to ensure the resolution highlighted the role of whistleblowers and environmental defenders within civic spaces ecosystem. Herrera is also the newly elected Chair of the IUCN Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy, which plays an important role in protecting whistleblowers.

It is evident that the fight to embed whistleblower protections into international environmental governance has widespread support and hearty legal foundations. The future of environmental defense must rely on these resolutions as supports for future efforts.

The IUCN has a clear plan for what these future efforts will be. The 20 year vision, four year plan, and Call to Action all sketch a clear picture of continued conservation, human rights defense, and, most notably, whistleblower protections. Further still, the new mandates of the WCEL and CEC outline similar aims. As before, much of the language on environmental crime and whistleblowers is the result of tireless effort by Hajost, the Alliance, and the WCS.

The 20 year vision, entitled Unite for Nature on the path to 2045, lays out the IUCN’s plan to align short term goals with sustainable, long term ambitions. It highlights a “rights- and equity-based approach to conservation action,” meaning whistleblowers and environmental defenders—the people most at risk of losing their right to speak and protest—must be uplifted. Unite for Nature clearly recognizes this: “Environmental justice mandates the right to ethical and responsible access to and use of land, territories, species and renewable resources, and embeds the right to life, the right to speak, and to be heard by environmental defenders and whistleblowers.”

Nature 2030: One nature, one future, the blueprint for the next four years, is even more insistent on safeguarding whistleblowers. Measures “to ensure the full protection of environmental human rights defenders and whistleblowers must be taken. There needs to be a response to the long-standing call for effective human rights due diligence, associated grievance mechanisms and for dealing with illegal and criminal activities through enhanced regulation and enhancement in criminal justice and application of the rule of law.” It is evident that CAE is well-recognized as an urgent problem for conservationists and nature defenders.

Crucially, Nature 2030 calls for the incentivization for informants: states must work “to strengthen legal and policy frameworks, including whistleblowers protection and reward laws, to more effectively prevent and combat crimes that affect the environment at national and international levels.” Reward laws are highly effective in encouraging potential informants to report on illicit activities, especially in states where whistleblowers face social, financial, and physical retaliation for their bravery.

All these documents—the resolutions, program, and vision—further anchor whistleblowers into the work of the IUCN and will help in promoting the role of whistleblower s in other international organizations and agreements. There is hope for the future.

The results of the IUCN offer concrete steps towards a brighter, healthier world. Upcoming conventions and congresses, including the UN Convention Against Corruption, will continue to address environmental whistleblower protections and work towards strengthening enforcement of CAE.

“I choose to be optimistic,” said Hajost, “and I tell people that all the time: no matter what it is, there’s something positive you can do.”",https://whistleblowersblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-02-at-11.35.44-AM.png,N,,2025-12-03 13:01:45.480691

For decades, corn has reigned over American agriculture. It sprawls across 90 million acres — about the size of Montana — and goes into everything from livestock feed and processed foods to the ethanol blended into most of the nation’s gasoline.

But a growing body of research reveals that America’s obsession with corn has a steep price: The fertilizer used to grow it is warming the planet and contaminating water.

Corn is essential to the rural economy and to the world’s food supply, and researchers say the problem isn’t the corn itself. It’s how we grow it.

Corn farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain today’s high yields. And when that nitrogen breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Producing nitrogen fertilizer also emits large amounts of carbon dioxide, adding to its climate footprint.

Agriculture accounts for more than 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and corn uses more than two-thirds of all nitrogen fertilizer nationwide — making it the leading driver of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, studies show.

The corn and ethanol industries insist that rapid growth in ethanol — which now consumes more than 40% of the U.S. corn crop — is a net environmental benefit, and they strongly dispute research suggesting otherwise.

Since 2000, U.S. corn production has surged almost 50%, further adding to the crop’s climate impact.

Yet the environmental costs of corn rarely make headlines or factor into political debates. Much of the dynamic traces back to federal policy — and to the powerful corn and ethanol lobby that helped shape it.

The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in the mid 2000s, required that gasoline be blended with ethanol, a biofuel that in the United States comes almost entirely from corn. That mandate drove up demand and prices for corn, spurring farmers to plant more of it.

Many plant corn year after year on the same land. The practice, called “continuous corn,” demands massive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and drives especially high nitrous oxide emissions.

At the same time, federal subsidies make it more lucrative to grow corn than to diversify. Taxpayers have covered more than $50 billion in corn insurance premiums over the past 30 years, according to federal data compiled by the Environmental Working Group.

Researchers say proven conservation steps — such as planting rows of trees, shrubs and grasses in corn fields — could sharply reduce these emissions. But the Trump administration has eliminated many of the incentives that helped farmers try such practices.

Experts say it all raises a larger question: If America’s most widely planted crop is worsening climate change, shouldn’t we begin growing it a different way?

How corn took over America

Corn has been a staple of U.S. agriculture for centuries, first domesticated by Native Americans and later used by European immigrants as a versatile crop for food and animal feed. Its production really took off in the 2000s after federal mandates and incentives helped turn much of America’s corn crop into ethanol.

Corn’s dominance — and the emissions that come with it — didn’t happen by accident. It was built through a high-dollar lobbying campaign that continues today.

In the late 1990s, America’s corn farmers were in trouble. Prices had cratered amid a global grain glut and the Asian financial crisis. A 1999 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said crop prices had hit “rock bottom.”

In 2001 and 2002, the federal government gave corn farmers and ethanol producers a boost — first through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Bioenergy Program, which paid ethanol producers to increase their use of farm commodities for fuel. Then the 2002 Farm Bill created programs that continue to support ethanol and other renewable energy.

Corn growers soon after mounted an all-out campaign in Washington. Their goal: persuade Congress to require gasoline to be blended with ethanol. State and national grower groups lobbied relentlessly, pitching ethanol as a way to cut greenhouse gasses, reduce oil dependence and revive rural economies.

“We got down to a couple of votes in Congress, and the corn growers were united like never before,” recalled Jon Doggett, then the industry’s chief lobbyist, in an article published by the National Corn Growers Association. “I started receiving calls from Capitol Hill saying, ‘Would you have your growers stop calling us? We are with you.’ I had not seen anything like it before and haven’t seen anything like it since.”

Their persistence paid off. In 2005, Congress created the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires that a certain amount of ethanol be blended into U.S. gasoline each year. Two years later, lawmakers expanded it further. The policy transformed the market: The amount of corn used for ethanol domestically has more than tripled in the past 20 years.

When demand for corn spiked as a result of the RFS, it pushed up prices worldwide, said Tim Searchinger, a researcher at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. The result, Searchinger said, is that more land around the world got cleared to grow corn. That, in turn, resulted in more emissions.

That lobbying brought clout. “King Corn” became a political force, courted by presidential hopefuls and protected by both parties. Since 2010, national corn and ethanol trade groups have spent more than $55 million on lobbying and millions more on political donations, according to campaign finance records analyzed by Floodlight.

In 2024 alone, those trade groups spent twice as much on lobbying as the National Rifle Association. Major industry players — Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill and ethanol giant POET among them — have poured even more into Washington, ensuring the sector’s voice remains one of the loudest in U.S. agriculture.

Now those same groups are pushing for the next big prize: expanding higher-ethanol gasoline blends and positioning ethanol-based jet fuel as aviation’s “low-carbon” future.

Research undercuts ethanol’s clean-fuel claims

Corn and ethanol trade groups didn’t make their officials available for interviews.

But on their websites and in their literature, they have promoted corn ethanol as a climate-friendly fuel.

The Renewable Fuels Association cites government and university research that finds burning ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 40-50% compared with gasoline. The ethanol industry says the climate critics have it wrong — and that most of the corn used for fuel comes from better yields and smarter farming, not from plowing up new land. The amount of fertilizer required to produce a bushel of corn has dropped sharply in recent decades, they say.

“Ethanol reduces carbon emissions, removing the carbon equivalent of 12 million cars from the road each year,” according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

Growth Energy, a major ethanol trade group, said in a written statement that U.S. farmers and biofuel producers are “constantly finding new ways to make their operations more efficient and more environmentally beneficial,” using things like cover crops to reduce their carbon footprint.

But some research tells a different story.

A recent Environmental Working Group report finds that the way corn is grown in much of the Midwest — with the same fields planted in corn year after year — carries a heavy climate cost.

Research in 2022 by agricultural land use expert Tyler Lark and colleagues links the Renewable Fuel Standard to expanded corn cultivation, heavier fertilizer use, worsening water pollution and increased emissions. Scientists typically convert greenhouse gasses like nitrous oxide and methane into their carbon-dioxide equivalents — or carbon intensity — so their warming impacts can be compared on the same scale.

“The carbon intensity of corn ethanol produced under the RFS is no less than gasoline and likely at least 24% higher,” the authors concluded.

Lark’s research has been disputed by scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, Purdue University and the University of Illinois, who published a formal rebuttal arguing the study relied on “questionable assumptions” and faulty modeling — a charge Lark’s team has rejected.

A 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the RFS was unlikely to meet its greenhouse gas goals because the U.S. relies predominantly on corn ethanol and produces relatively little of the cleaner, advanced biofuels made from waste.

The problem isn’t just emissions, researchers say. Corn ethanol requires millions of acres that could instead be used for food crops or more efficient energy sources. One recent study found that solar panels can generate as much energy as corn ethanol on roughly 3% of the land.

“It’s just a terrible use of land,” Searchinger, the Princeton researcher, said of ethanol. “And you can’t solve climate change if you’re going to make such terrible use of land.”

Most of the country’s top crop isn’t feeding people. More than 40% of U.S. corn goes to ethanol. A similar amount is used to feed livestock, and just 12% ends up as food or in other uses.

As corn production rises, so have emissions

Globally, corn production doubled from 2000 to 2021.

That growth has been fueled by fertilizer, which emits nitrous oxide that can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century. That eats away at the ozone layer, which blocks most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation.

Global emissions have soared alongside corn production. Between 1980 and 2020, nitrous oxide emissions from human activity climbed 40%, the Global Carbon project found.

In the United States, nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture in 2022 were equal to roughly 262 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to the EPA’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. That’s equivalent to putting almost 56 million passenger cars on the road.

The biggest increases are coming straight from the Corn Belt.

Ethanol’s climate footprint isn’t the only concern. The nitrogen used to grow corn and other crops is also a key source of drinking water pollution.

According to a new report by the Alliance for the Great Lakes and Clean Wisconsin, more than 90% of nitrate contamination in Wisconsin’s groundwater is linked to agricultural sources — mostly synthetic fertilizer and manure.

The same analysis estimates that in 2022, farmers applied more than 16 million pounds of nitrogen beyond what crops needed, sending runoff into wells, streams and other water systems.

For families like Tyler Frye’s, that hits close to home. In 2022, Frye and his wife moved into a new home in the rural village of Casco, Wisconsin, about 20 miles east of Green Bay. A free test soon afterward found their well water had nitrate levels more than twice the EPA’s safe limit. “We were pretty shocked,” he said.

Frye installed a reverse-osmosis system in the basement and still buys bottled water for his wife, who is breastfeeding their daughter, born in July.

One likely culprit, he suspects, are the cornfields less than 200 yards from his home.

“Crops like corn require a lot of nitrogen,” he said. “A lot of that stuff, I assume, is getting into the well water and surface water.”

When he watches manure or fertilizer being spread on nearby fields, he said, one question nags him: “Where does that go?”

What cleaner corn could look like

Reducing corn’s climate footprint is possible — but the farmers trying to do it are swimming against the policy tide.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, strips out the provisions of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that had rewarded farmers for climate-friendly practices.

And in April, Trump’s USDA canceled the $3 billion Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative, a grant program designed to promote farming and forestry practices to improve soil and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agency said that the program’s administrative costs meant too little money was reaching farmers, while Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins dismissed it as part of the “green new scam.”

University of Iowa professor Silvia Secchi said the rollback of the Climate-Smart program has already given farmers “cold feet” about adopting conservation practices. “The impact of this has been devastating,” said Secchi, a natural resources economist who teaches at the university’s School of Earth, Environment and Sustainability.

Research shows what’s possible if farmers had support. In its recent report, the Environmental Working Group found that four proven conservation practices — including planting trees, shrubs and hedgerows in corn fields — could make a measurable difference.

Implementing those practices on just 4% of continuous corn acres across Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin would cut total greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of taking more than 850,000 gasoline cars off the road, EWG found.

Despite setbacks at the federal level, some farmers are already showing what a more climate-friendly Corn Belt could look like.

In northern Iowa, Wendy Johnson farms 1,200 acres of corn and soybeans with her father. On 130 of those acres, she’s trying something different: She’s planting fruit and nut trees, organic grains, shrubs and other plants that need little or no nitrogen fertilizer.

“The more perennials we can have on the ground, the better it is for the climate,” she said.

Across the rest of the farm, they enrich the soil by rotating crops and planting cover crops. They’ve also converted less productive parts of the fields into “prairie strips” — bands of prairie grass that store carbon and require no fertilizer.

Under the now-cancelled Climate-Smart grant program, they were supposed to receive technical assistance and about $20,000 a year to expand those practices. The grant program was terminated before they got any of the money.

“It’s hard to take risks on your own,” Johnson said. “That’s where federal support really helps. Because agriculture is a high-risk occupation.”

The economics still favor business as usual. Johnson knows that many Midwestern corn growers feel pressure to maximize yields, keeping them hooked on corn — and nitrogen fertilizer.

“I think a lot of farmers around here are very allergic to trees,” she joked.

In southeast Iowa, sixth-generation farmer Levi Lyle, who mixes organic and conventional methods across 290 acres, uses a three-year rotation, extensive cover crops and a technique called roller-crimping — flattening rye each spring to create a mulch that suppresses weeds, feeds the soil and reduces fertilizer needs.

“The roller crimping of cover crops is a huge, huge opportunity to sequester more carbon, improve soil health, save money on chemicals and still get a similar yield,” he said.

But farmers get few government incentives to take such climate-friendly steps, Lyle said. “There is a lack of seriousness about supporting farmers to implement these new practices,” he said.

And without federal programs to offset the risk, the innovations that Lyle and Johnson are trying remain exceptions — not the norm.

Many farmers still see prairie strips or patches of trees as a waste, said Luke Gran, whose company helps Iowa farmers establish perennials.

“My eyes do not lie,” Gran said. “I have not seen extensive change to cover cropping or tillage across the broad acreage of this state that I love.”

The next corn boom?

Despite mounting research about corn’s climate costs, industry groups are pushing for policies to boost ethanol demand.

One big priority: Pushing a bill to require that new cars are able to run on gas with more ethanol than what’s commonly sold today.

Corn and biofuel trade groups have also been pressing Democrats and Republicans in Congress for legislation to pave the way for ethanol-based jet fuel. While use of such “sustainable” aviation fuel is still in its early stages domestically, corn and biofuel associations have made developing a market for it a top policy priority.

Secchi, the Iowa professor, says it’s easy to see why ethanol producers are trying to expand their market: The growth in electric vehicles threatens long-term gasoline sales.

Related: As Minnesota curbs climate emissions, what’s the future of natural gas?

Researchers warn that producing enough ethanol-based jet fuel could trigger major land-use shifts. A 2024 World Resources Institute analysis found that meeting the federal goal of 35 billion gallons of ethanol jet fuel would require about 114 million acres of corn — roughly 20% more corn acreage than the U.S. already plants for all purposes. That surge in demand, the authors concluded, would push up food prices and worsen hunger.

Secchi calls that scenario a climate and land-use “disaster.” Large-scale use of ethanol-based aviation fuel, she said, would mean clearing even more land and pouring on even more nitrogen fertilizer, driving up greenhouse gas emissions.

“The result,” she said, “would be essentially to enshrine this dysfunctional system that we created.”

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a new rule that aligns the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act with the U.S. Supreme Court’s unanimous 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision. Simultaneously, the Department of the Interior announced common-sense updates to Endangered Species Act (ESA) regulations that focus on species recovery rather than divisive litigation and illegal federal land management.

Tom Pyle, President of the American Energy Alliance, issued the following statement:

“The Trump administration’s WOTUS reform finally reins in decades of federal overreach and respects the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision. At the same time, the proposed Endangered Species Act updates will end the abuse of a 50-year-old law that has been wielded as a sledgehammer against landowners and has not provided sufficient incentives to recover endangered species. These are pro-environment, pro-economy, pro-America reforms that prove we can conserve our natural heritage and unleash American innovation at the same time. This is exactly the balanced, reasonable regulation the American people voted for.”

Waters of the United States

The WOTUS rule will focus federal regulation within the bounds set by the Constitution, empower states and local communities, and ensure that federal resources are focused on protecting America’s navigable waters.

The proposed rule, announced by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, will end the regulatory ping-pong between administrations and instead establish a rule that builds lasting credibility. Over the years, federal regulators have used the Clean Water Act to regulate wetlands, regardless of the restrictions the Constitution places on the federal government’s power. By focusing on the proper limits of the federal government, this new rule protects landowners from overzealous federal regulators and allows the state to exercise its regulatory prerogatives under the Constitution.

Endangered Species

The Endangered Species Act, like the Clean Water Act, has been improperly used as a tool of federal land use management for too long. Instead of properly focusing on protecting species, federal regulators have frequently wielded the ESA to punish landowners. This suite of regulatory changes focuses the listing process on the best scientific and commercial data, improves the consultation between federal agencies, requires species-specific rules for threatened (as opposed to endangered species), and clarifies how economic and national security impacts are taken into consideration in the designation of critical habitat.

Overall, these rules will create better incentives for federal regulators to partner with landowners to recover endangered and threatened species.

Environmental Advocacy Groups Some environmental groups have argued that narrowing federal jurisdiction exposes wetlands and headwater features to significant risk.
The proposed WOTUS definition introduces a wet-season standard that has potential to conflict with the decision.","On November 20, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a long-anticipated proposal to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). The proposed rule seeks to align federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA) with the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Sackett v. EPA (2023), while addressing years of regulatory uncertainty following Rapanos, the 2015 Clean Water Rule, the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and the 2023 amendments.

For regulated industries and public agencies, the proposal is significant for two reasons:

It reflects the clearest effort in a decade to adopt a durable, administrable definition of WOTUS; and

It introduces multiple alternative regulatory approaches within the proposal itself, signaling the agencies’ desire for robust public input before finalizing any new rule.

Public comments are due January 5, 2026, under Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

I. The Supreme Court’s Direction in Sackett: Clarity, Predictability, and the Limits of Federal Power

Any serious discussion of WOTUS must begin with Sackett. The Court’s 2023 decision clarified the test for federal jurisdiction over wetlands and emphasized that regulated parties must have reasonably clear notice of the law’s reach. The majority held that jurisdiction must be grounded in clear, administrable criteria consistent with Congress’s limitation to “navigable waters.”

The Court underscored this in unusually direct language. In criticizing the “significant nexus” test, Justice Alito, writing for the majority, stated that a regulatory scheme that leaves citizens dependent on “the discretion of government officials” or the judgment of experts who “cannot say whether or not the Act applies to a particular parcel” raises serious constitutional concerns. The majority held that jurisdiction must be grounded in clear, objective criteria – criteria consistent with Congress’s textual limitation to “navigable waters.”

In short: the Court demanded a simpler, more predictable line.

EPA and the Corps were therefore compelled to revisit their 2023 rule and bring it in line with the Court’s standard:

Wetlands must have a continuous surface connection making them “indistinguishable” from a jurisdictional water.

Tributaries must have relatively permanent flow.

Groundwater cannot be used as a jurisdictional connector.

The significant nexus test cannot be used to establish jurisdiction under Sackett.

This new proposal explicitly embraces those holdings.

II. Overview of the Proposed Rule

1. Wet-Season Framework for “Relatively Permanent Waters”

The agencies propose to identify “relatively permanent” tributaries using regionally defined wet-season flow, rather than year-round hydrology alone. This is apparently intended to give field staff and applicants clearer, more predictable standards for determining whether a tributary qualifies as a WOTUS. The proposal invites comment on how “wet-season” should be determined and applied in the field.

2. New Definition of “Tributary”

Under the proposal, a tributary must:

have relatively permanent flow, and

connect to a downstream traditional navigable water.

Tributaries may pass through natural or artificial (e.g., culverts, pipes, ditches) features – so long as they convey relatively permanent flow.

A break in relatively permanent surface flow would sever jurisdiction upstream under the proposal. Unlike prior WOTUS definitions, jurisdiction cannot “skip” or otherwise be extended over non-jurisdictional segments.

3. Updated “Continuous Surface Connection” for Wetlands

EPA and the Corps propose clarifications consistent with Sackett:

Wetlands must abut a navigable water or a relatively permanent tributary.

Seasonal wet-season surface water may satisfy the test if the wetland remains physically connected.

Discrete artificial features (culverts, pipes, swales) cannot extend jurisdiction unless there is continuous flow.

This approach aligns with Sackett’s requirement that wetlands have a continuous surface connection making them ‘indistinguishable’ from jurisdictional waters. This is a departure from the 2023 rule, which treated artificial connections as sufficient. The agencies rescinded that interpretation earlier this year.

4. Lakes and Ponds

The proposed rule removes “intrastate” as a jurisdictional qualifier for lakes and ponds and revises how adjacency and surface connection are evaluated. The agencies expressly seek comment on multiple alternative models for assessing these waterbodies.

5. Exclusions – Including Several Alternatives

The agencies revise and request comment on:

Waste treatment system exclusion (including multiple definitional alternatives)

Prior converted cropland (one option would vest determination authority solely in USDA)

Ditches (alternative definitions distinguishing upland-excavated features from potentially jurisdictional ones)

The presence of these alternatives indicates the agencies’ apparent willingness to reshape portions of the rule based on stakeholder input.

III. Why the Agencies Included Multiple Alternative Approaches

This proposal contains more built-in alternatives than any prior WOTUS proposal. EPA and the Corps explicitly acknowledge the difficult balance they must strike:

Sackett constrains federal authority more sharply than any prior case.

States vary widely in their wetland protection frameworks.

Regulated parties need clarity, but hydrological systems are inherently variable and can be complex.

Courts have repeatedly rejected prior rules as either overbroad or insufficiently justified.

By embedding alternatives – such as differing definitions for tributaries, wetlands, lakes, and exclusions – the agencies are effectively asking:

“Tell us what works. Show us what is implementable. Show us what is legally durable.”

This means the comment period is unusually important. The agencies are signaling they intend to consider revisions.

IV. Reactions from Stakeholders – and Additional Context

Stakeholder reactions have been mixed, as reflected in national media coverage and industry commentary.

1. Environmental Advocacy Groups

Some environmental groups have argued that narrowing federal jurisdiction exposes wetlands and headwater features to significant risk. These concerns reflect genuine policy preferences but ignore the legal constraints imposed by the Constitution and the CWA as discussed by the Supreme Court.

Congress has never authorized EPA or the Corps to regulate all wetlands – nor could it under the limitations imposed on it by the U.S. Constitution. The CWA’s definition of “navigable waters” limits federal authority, and the Court has repeatedly emphasized that states – not the federal government – retain primary authority over intrastate waters and wetlands.

2. State Primacy in Wetland Regulation

Congressman Brian Mast (R-FL) praised the proposed rule as a step toward returning responsibility to the states, noting that communities with the most at stake are often the most attentive stewards of local waters. His position reflects a federalism-based view: that the appropriate forum for expanding wetland protection is within state legislatures, not Congress or EPA.

As federal jurisdiction narrows, state authority becomes more important. Many states already administer robust wetland programs that exceed federal requirements and protect isolated and intrastate wetlands regardless of WOTUS status.

These examples demonstrate that federal narrowing does not necessarily mean diminished protection – rather, it shifts decisions to the level of government best suited for local environmental management and can best address the hydrological variables that make it difficult to craft a one size fits all approach.

3. Potential Conflicts with Maui?

Since the Supreme Court’s County of Maui decision, concerns have emerged about confusion between sections 402 and 404 of the CWA. The proposed WOTUS definition introduces a wet-season standard that has potential to conflict with the decision. While some commentators perceive potential tension, the decisions address different and functional-equivalent discharges; Sackett addresses the geographic scope of WOTUS and rejects groundwater as a connector for jurisdiction.

V. Next Steps for Regulated Entities

Given the breadth of the proposed rule and the number of alternatives offered, we recommend the following:

1. Consider Filing Comments

Regulated industries, utilities, agriculture, developers, and local governments may benefit from providing input on:

the wet-season definition,

the tributary standard,

the treatment of lakes and ponds, and

exclusion alternatives.

The rule is open for public comment for 45 days, with a deadline of January 5, 2026. Written comments must reference Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322 and may be submitted through Regulations.gov or orally during one of two hybrid public meetings (dates to be announced).

2. Review Projects in the Pipeline

Projects with pending jurisdictional determinations or permit strategies should review whether the proposed rule could affect their jurisdictional status or timelines.

3. Monitor State-Level Activity

In states without robust wetland programs, legislators may take action. Clients with multi-state operations should track emerging state initiatives.

Conclusion

The November 2025 WOTUS proposal represents a meaningful attempt to produce a durable, judicially defensible definition of federal jurisdiction – one that meets the Supreme Court’s demands for clarity while acknowledging the hydrological complexity of the nation’s waters. EPA and the Corps have signaled openness to stakeholder input and have included significant alternative approaches for consideration.

For businesses, public agencies, and landowners, the proposal presents both challenges and opportunities. Clarity may finally be in sight, but the next two months will be critical in shaping what the final rule looks like.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15413_3100.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:08:23.229759

Saronic Technologies is a leader in maritime innovation, advancing autonomous vessel technology for defense and commercial markets.

The company recently acquired the former Gulf Craft shipyard in Franklin, establishing its Louisiana operations and workforce.

FRANKLIN, La. – Saronic Technologies, Inc. is expanding operations in St. Mary Parish to increase production capacity at its autonomous surface vessels shipyard. The $300 million investment will strengthen Louisiana’s advanced manufacturing base and create new opportunities for skilled workers in one of the state’s most historic maritime communities.

The company is expected to create 1,500 direct new jobs with an average annual salary of $87,936 at full employment, which is 46% above the average St. Mary Parish wage. When Saronic acquired the shipyard in April, it retained the existing workforce of 35 employees and has since grown to more than 100. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 1,770 indirect new jobs, for a total of 3,270 potential new job opportunities in the Bayou Region.

“Saronic Technologies’ decision to invest in Louisiana speaks to the strength of our workforce and the state’s leadership in defense manufacturing,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “Louisiana has long built the ships and technology that keep America strong. This project shows that our people, our ports and our pro-growth policies are creating jobs and securing our state’s place at the forefront of America’s defense economy.”

The expansion will add more than 300,000 square feet to the company’s shipyard in Franklin, including construction of three new slips, a larger warehouse and a new production line dedicated to large-vessel assembly. These additions will expand Saronic’s shipbuilding capabilities and help meet rising demand for autonomous vessels in the defense and commercial sectors.

“Saronic’s shipyard expansion in Franklin represents a major step forward for American shipbuilding, and we’re proud to deepen our roots here in Louisiana,” Co-Founder and CEO of Saronic Dino Mavrookas said. “The strong support we have received from our state and local partners has enabled us to move quickly and confidently as we scale production of our autonomous vessels. Together, we’re creating high-quality jobs, growing the Gulf Coast’s maritime economy, and building the advanced maritime capabilities our nation needs.”

Saronic established its Louisiana operations with the acquisition of the former Gulf Craft shipyard in Franklin and has since advanced production of its autonomous vessels at the site. In August 2025, the company marked a major milestone with the keel-laying of its first 150-foot vessel, the Marauder, further demonstrating Saronic’s commitment to growth in Louisiana.

“Saronic’s expansion draws on Louisiana’s historic strengths — a world-class maritime workforce, generations of shipbuilders and unmatched technical expertise,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “This project builds on that proud legacy by integrating new technology and innovation to ensure our state continues leading in the maritime and defense sectors for decades to come.”

Saronic broke ground on the expansion in November 2025 and expects construction to be completed by the end of 2026, with expanded operations beginning in 2027.

“As a life-long resident of St. Mary Parish with over 40 years of public service, this announcement sends a powerful message that we are a place of thriving opportunity and economic momentum,” St. Mary Parish President Sam Jones said. “St. Mary Parish’s best days are ahead of her, and this project is the beginning of a new era of economic leadership in South Louisiana. I am proud to welcome Saronic to St. Mary Parish, and I look forward to working with our state and regional partners in supporting this project as it becomes a cornerstone of our parish’s economic future.”

To secure the project in Franklin, the state of Louisiana offered Saronic Technologies a competitive incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. It also included a $2 million performance-based grant and $3 million from the Economic Development Award Program (EDAP) to support facility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in Louisiana’s Quality Jobs Program.

“This project marks a significant step forward for St. Mary Parish and positions our community at the center of the Gulf Coast’s advanced manufacturing economy,” St. Mary Economic Development Director Evan Boudreaux said. “The scale of investment and the quality of jobs Saronic will create will have a generational impact: supporting our families, expanding career pathways for our residents, and reinforcing St. Mary’s position as a competitive destination for advanced industry. This opportunity is proof of Louisiana’s economic development comeback story, and I look forward to what’s next.”

“Saronic’s investment builds on the momentum we are seeing across St. Mary Parish and the wider Bayou Region,” COLAB President and CEO Christy Zeringue said. “This $300 million project brings together a skilled workforce and next-generation technology to support U.S. defense and drive meaningful economic growth. With 1,500 new jobs and hundreds more supported across the region, it reinforces our position as a place where innovative companies can succeed. We are proud to see continued growth that strengthens both our local economy and Louisiana’s role in the maritime and energy landscape.”

The point is not to single out data centers for extra scrutiny, Henry said.
“Data centers are coming,” Hensgens said.
I use Grok [X’s AI tool] five times a day.” The Public Service Commission also has a spot on the task force.
For example, while most data center projects will be looking to use some renewable energy, Louisiana has trouble permitting and siting wind and solar, he said.","A new task force created by President Cameron Henry last met a couple weeks ago with a single item on the agenda: a discussion of energy needs for data center projects.

The point is not to single out data centers for extra scrutiny, Henry said.

But data centers need massive amounts of energy, and as Louisiana residents deal with unexpected brownouts on random days, it’s time for a frank and open discussion about how to meet everyone’s needs, he said.

“We want to make sure that we have enough power to provide to everyone,” Henry said. “And if we don’t have it, once we calculate how much is needed, how are we going to get the power?”

The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved Entergy Louisiana’s plan to power Meta’s multibillion dollar data center planned for Richland Parish in August.

Entergy plans to build three new gas-fired power plants and new transmission infrastructure to provide the 2.3 GW of energy the center will need.

While there are measures in the agreement the PSC approved meant to mitigate the risks, some experts are concerned that the project could lead to higher bills for Entergy’s ratepayers.

Similar centers meant to support artificial intelligence applications are sprouting up across the country, and Entergy says more could be on the way to Louisiana.

If rates go up in Jefferson Parish, for example, constituents will call Henry’s office wanting to know why, and what the Legislature plans to do about it. If that call comes, he wants to have an intelligent answer.

And if there isn’t a good answer, that could threaten the economic development state officials are hoping to see over the next several years.

Henry stressed that he doesn’t have any preconceived notions about what the task force will come up with; maybe they’ll find out that Louisiana is doing everything right in this area.

“There’s no point in trying to hide the discussion or pretend like we don’t need to have it,” Henry said.

“It’s something that we need to do, and we’re going to push it through until we get some good, solid answers moving forward.”

Senate Natural Resources Chair Bob Hensgens, who is on the task force, said the fact that electricity rates in Louisiana remain low compared to the rest of the country, and that Meta chose Louisiana, could indicate that the state already has the right model.

But “our energy world is changing,” and it’s important to make sure the state is ready for what’s next, he said.

“Data centers are coming,” Hensgens said. “And we don’t reverse technology in this country. I use Grok [X’s AI tool] five times a day.”

The Public Service Commission also has a spot on the task force. PSC Chair Mike Francis tapped Executive Secretary Brandon Frey to fill that role.

Francis didn’t want to comment before today’s meeting. Commissioner Davante Lewis said the Louisiana PSC, in contrast to the approach in many other states, has independent constitutional authority to regulate power generation and infrastructure.

Lewis said he doesn’t think Senate President Henry is trying to encroach on that authority, though some legislators might not fully understand how the commission exercises its responsibilities.

But he does see room for collaboration.

For example, while most data center projects will be looking to use some renewable energy, Louisiana has trouble permitting and siting wind and solar, he said. Lawmakers could help to bridge that gap with the locals.

“If Meta says, ‘I want to build 2,000 megawatts worth of solar,’ and then we turn around and Richland Parish and Sabine Parish and Morehouse Parish all say ‘no solar here,’ that makes it hard to do,” Lewis said.

Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois was not available for comment, though LED provided the following statement: “This Task Force is an important initiative for Louisiana’s long-term economic competitiveness.

From LED’s perspective, it provides a coordinated forum for stakeholders to assess how Louisiana’s energy infrastructure can meet the needs of a rapidly growing and evolving economy.

A modern, reliable, and affordable electric grid is foundational not only for attracting new investment but also for supporting existing industries.”

Henry’s SR 195 created the Task Force on Energy Infrastructure and Modernization. The group’s report is due to the Senate by March 1.

GREENWOOD, S.C., Dec. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- ES Foundry, an American company advancing U.S. solar by onshoring crystalline solar cell production, is closing 2025 with significant milestones that mark a turning point for domestic solar manufacturing.

The company's Greenwood, South Carolina, facility has reached full-scale PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Contact) solar cell production, establishing a proven and Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)-compliant foundation for developers and asset owners seeking to meet the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) domestic-content requirements and reduce exposure to imported-supply-chain risk.

SEIA's most recent report underscores the strong national push to expand domestic solar manufacturing. ES Foundry reflects that ambition in action: we are one of the few manufacturers producing U.S. cells at commercial scale today, offering developers and asset owners a reliable, FEOC-compliant source as the broader domestic ecosystem builds out.

Built on field-proven PERC technology, ES Foundry's production enables developers and panel manufacturers to secure domestic-content and FEOC compliance today — while other next-generation cell technologies remain tied up in global intellectual property disputes.

""In 2025, ES Foundry demonstrated that American solar cell manufacturing is both achievable and essential,"" said Alex Zhu, CEO of ES Foundry. ""By focusing on proven, scalable PERC technology, we've given U.S. developers and asset owners the ability to build with confidence and certainty. Our next phase will take that momentum further — closing the import gap and strengthening America's energy independence.""

Throughout 2025, ES Foundry partnered directly with leading U.S. developers and asset owners to integrate its FEOC-free crystalline cells into commercial, community and utility-scale projects. By sourcing domestically produced cells, these companies strengthened their eligibility for the 10% IRA domestic-content bonus credit and reduced exposure to the supply-chain volatility and compliance risks associated with imported components.

Looking ahead, ES Foundry is advancing plans for a 2-GW Phase II expansion at its Greenwood facility in 2026. The next phase will further enhance efficiency, consistency and output. Once complete, ES Foundry will rank among the largest producers of crystalline solar cells in North America.

""Every new gigawatt of capacity we bring online reinforces America's clean-energy independence,"" Zhu added. ""ES Foundry's role is to manufacture, not wait. While others pause for patents and litigation, we're producing the cells and making the shipment.""

Dry Turkey: Another Precipitation Deviation

Rain didn’t have a regular place at the table again last month, which was drier than normal across North Carolina. Based on preliminary data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the statewide average precipitation was 1.18 inches, which was our 16th-driest November since 1895.

Much of the Mountains, Piedmont, and Sandhills had less than an inch of total precipitation all month. That included Asheville with 0.66 inches and its 13th-driest November on record, 0.52 inches in Greensboro in its 9th-driest November, Fayetteville’s 0.55 inches for its 8th-driest November on record, Charlotte’s 0.49 inches and 8th-driest November.

Coastal areas fared a bit better, largely due to the impact of an offshore low pressure system on November 3. On that date, Hatteras had 5.21 inches of rain – its wettest single day since August 31, 2023, during Tropical Storm Idalia. With a final monthly total of 7.33 inches, it was the 14th-wettest November for Hatteras, while Elizabeth City had 3.79 inches and its 27th-wettest November on record.

For inland areas, though, there were very few notable rain events throughout the month. Before it emerged offshore, the low pressure system crossing the state on November 2 brought around half an inch across most of eastern North Carolina, and a warm front moving through on November 21 brought widespread but light rain generally totaling a half-inch or less.

Our dry November wrapped up an overall dry and drought-plagued fall for most of the state. Near the epicenter of the current spot of Severe Drought (D2) in the northern Coastal Plain, Greenville had 6.01 inches of rain – just 42% of its normal amount – all season for its 10th-driest fall on record.

In the Piedmont, where Moderate Drought (D1) expanded in November, Raleigh had its 13th-driest fall dating back to 1887, and Monroe tied for its 10th-driest fall on record out of the past 125 years.

Among our recent drought impacts, streamflow levels continued to decline in November, Falls and Jordan lakes fell more than two feet below their targets, and on a few dry and windy days, wildfire activity flared up, including a 160-acre fire burning near Banner Elk and a 500-acre fire on the Roanoke River National Wildlife Refuge.

Lukewarm Leftovers: Another Weakly Warm Month

Continuing another trend from this fall, November saw mostly near-normal to slightly above-normal temperatures statewide. NCEI reports a preliminary average temperature of 52.2°F and our 28th-warmest November out of the past 131 years.

Many eastern sites finished within a degree of their normal monthly temperature, including Wilmington tying for its 58th-warmest November in the past 150 years and Lumberton tied for its 39th-warmest November on record.

Central and western areas were 2 to 4 degrees above normal, on average, including the 16th-warmest November on record for Charlotte, the 25th-warmest for Greensboro, and tied for the 29th-warmest in Raleigh.

In contrast to recent years when we saw multiple 80-degree days in November 2023 and 2024, that sort of warmth had waned by last month. Instead, with weaker high pressure across the Southeast, our warmest days topped out in the mid-70s, and a series of cold frontal passages meant even that warm weather was short-lived.

Those fronts also ushered in some downright cold air, especially in an Arctic blast on November 11 that brought widespread below-freezing temperatures, officially ending the growing season across most of the state.

That morning’s low of 31°F in Wilmington was the earliest sub-freezing day there since 1998, and Laurinburg’s low of 26°F was its coldest night that early in the season since 1991.

Another chill arrived just in time for Thanksgiving, including widespread lows in the upper 10s and low 20s on Saturday, November 29. Our Goldsboro ECONet station bottomed out at 20°F – one of only six November nights that cold there in the past 24 years.

Icing on the Cake: A Snowy Surprise

Clearly there was no tryptophan slowing winter’s arrival last month, and it showed with more than just a few chilly nights. Along the cold front that ushered in that frigid air on November 11, precipitation fell as snow, with flakes observed from the Mountains all the way to the coastline.

The highest totals naturally fell on our highest elevation areas, including parts of the Great Smoky Mountains that had more than six inches, plus 3 inches in both Hot Springs and Grandfather Mountain.

Banner Elk had 2.5 inches, which was its earliest snow of that size since 2014. In recent years, it took until mid-January in both 2023 and 2024 to see that much snow in a single day.

While November snow in the Mountains isn’t too rare, it was unusual to see accumulations much farther east. Isolated areas south of the Albemarle Sound had up to 2 inches, with a widespread dusting to half an inch of snow.

Edenton reported 0.2 inches on the ground in its earliest measurable snow on record dating back to 1895. Williamston and Plymouth each measured 0.3 inches, which was also their earliest snowfall in a season – and in Williamston, it happened almost two full weeks earlier than the previous record, which was set in 1935.

While it’s tempting to hope that this November snow is a sign of things to come throughout the winter, it’s important to keep expectations in check. Another recent early-season snow in December 2018 turned out to be essentially the only snow most areas saw in that entire winter.

And as our winter outlook noted, the La Niña pattern in place this winter is often warmer and drier than normal in North Carolina, and we expect below-normal snowfall overall. Our best chances of snow will likely look like that November event: narrow windows of time when cold air is in place and any passing weather systems bring enough moisture to fuel some flakes.

With climatological winter officially underway, we now await whatever the weather serves up next, whether it’s more dry dishes, something fire-roasted amid an extended drought, or perhaps a trip to the freezer for another cold and frozen surprise.",https://climate.ncsu.edu/wp-content/themes/hillsborough/assets/img/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-03 11:09:18.450359

“Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.” ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter.","The authors of a study that examined climate change’s potential effect on the global economy said Wednesday that data errors led them to slightly overstate an expected drop in income over the next 25 years.

The researchers at Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.

The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.

The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.

The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.

Max Kotz, one of the study’s authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet’s warming.

Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School who wasn’t involved with the research, said the thrust of the Potsdam Institute’s work remains the same “no matter which part of the range the true figure will be.”

“Climate change already hits home, quite literally. Home insurance premiums across the U.S. have already seen, in part, a doubling over the past decade alone,” Wagner said. “Rapidly accumulating climate risks will only make the numbers go up even more.”

Renewables account for 55.78% of energy on the South West Interconnected System in November

First time that renewable energy has provided a majority of energy used by households and industry

The Cook Government's drive to make Western Australia a renewable energy powerhouse is setting records, with more than half the power used in November coming from renewable energy.

The South West Interconnected System (SWIS) reached a record 55.78 per cent renewable energy contribution in November, eclipsing the previous record of 49 per cent, set in November 2024.

Energy prices in November fell significantly due to increased use of renewables, with average prices for major customers down by almost 30 per cent on the previous month.

The Cook Government's plan to exit State-owned coal by 2030 and deliver large-scale renewables will continue to increase renewable energy output and keep downward pressure on energy prices.

The Clean Energy Link program to expand and upgrade the SWIS transmission grid will unlock more renewable energy resources.

The Government's Residential Battery Scheme is enabling households to benefit further from the State's clean energy transition, through rebates and no-interest loans to install solar panels and batteries.

The scheme delivers important cost of living relief by enabling households to store and use more of their solar energy, driving down power bills.

The scheme will enable 100,000 households to gain the benefits of solar energy.

Comments attributed to Premier Roger Cook:

""Becoming a renewable energy powerhouse underpins our plans to diversify our economy, ensuring it continues to be the strongest in the nation.

""My government is delivering record investment in our transmission infrastructure to connect households and businesses to cheaper renewable energy.""

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""Renewable energy is the cheapest form of generation, and renewables and storage firmed by gas when needed is the least cost energy mix for households and businesses.

The Department of Energy has canceled or restructured billions in clean energy commitments, and federal priorities have clearly shifted. For companies that built their growth strategies around policy incentives, this may feel like a door is closing.

But it isn’t closing — it’s just opening somewhere new.

The Trump administration’s recent moves, including the “One Big Beautiful Bill” , signal a broader focus on strengthening the country’s industrial base and securing energy reliability. For climate tech firms, this creates a different kind of opportunity, one rooted in supporting the energy demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure and domestic supply chains, rather than in traditional subsidies.

A new kind of challenge

Artificial intelligence has become the economic centerpiece of 2025. As data centers multiply, so do their energy demands. Gartner projects that 40% of AI data centers will face power constraints by 2027, and the International Energy Agency expects U.S. data center electricity use to double by 2030.

That’s not an engineering footnote; it’s a national constraint, an infrastructure and competitiveness issue. The White House knows it and DOE knows it, which is why the latter is repositioning its mission around powering the digital economy; just two weeks ago, DOE reorganized under new priorities including fossil fuels, geothermal, and nuclear, formalizing its ongoing policy realignment. This consolidation aligns with early Trump administration interest in expanding domestic uranium production, critical minerals processing and geologic hydrogen exploration — areas now receiving elevated attention inside DOE.

This is where climate tech comes back into focus, not as a subsidy recipient, but as a strategic enabler.

In July, DOE designated four federal sites — Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and Savannah River Site — for co-located AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Two months later, it issued a request for applications from projects that combine clean energy, storage, and advanced materials development for those sites.

Meanwhile, OBBB has opened $7.5 billion for domestic critical minerals extraction and processing. The DOE followed that up with $1 billion in additional targeted funding for lithium, nickel, rare earths, gallium, and graphite. The intent is unmistakable: rebuild the industrial base that supports U.S. electrification and AI-scale energy demand.

Put simply, DOE funding has moved upstream, toward the technologies that make energy abundance and grid reliability possible; it’s these companies that deliver grid capacity and supply chain strength that are expected to lead the next chapter. The recent cancellations make that shift unmistakable —many of the programs cut or restructured were the kinds of deployment and grant-driven initiatives that defined federal clean energy support over the past two years.

Where climate tech fits in

This moment calls for climate tech companies to think about that strategic alignment. The technologies that stand to gain are those that enhance reliability, flexibility, and integration across the grid. The companies most likely to succeed will:

Solve for capacity as well as carbon: The winning pitch today is scale and reliability, not ideology. If your tech can enable 24/7 power for AI operations, industrial processing, or critical refining, that’s your ticket back onto DOE’s radar.

Focus on the middle of the value chain: America’s bottleneck in critical minerals isn’t only the mineral resources themselves, but rather refinement and processing. That’s also true for power. Between generation and delivery lie storage, transmission, and grid efficiency — the “refining” layer of energy. That’s where climate tech can deliver the most impact.

Link your innovation to national competitiveness: Framing matters. In our current political reality, a clean energy company that powers AI data centers or reduces the energy intensity of critical refining isn’t a climate company; it’s an infrastructure company. Speak that language and you’ll be heard.

Don’t wait for subsidies: DOE’s AI energy hubs will rely on direct public-private partnerships, not tax credits. Position your technology as shovel-ready for site deployment, not dependent on long-term grant cycles.

This approach demands agility. Climate tech firms that can frame their solutions as infrastructure enablers, supporting AI growth, manufacturing, and domestic energy resilience, will remain well-positioned for funding and partnerships, no matter the administration. And we’re already seeing examples across the market — from advanced materials companies aligning with data center procurement needs to storage developers repositioning projects around reliability services for high-capacity computing loads.

The opportunity to be seized

Even as federal programs consolidate, private capital is accelerating. U.S. climate tech investment reached $15.3 billion in the first half of 2025, up 35% year over year. The difference lies in focus: investors are prioritizing mature, infrastructure-ready technologies that can scale to meet industrial and digital energy needs.

The policy environment may look different, but the underlying goal — building a resilient, low-carbon energy system — hasn’t changed. It has simply broadened. Climate tech companies that can strengthen supply chains, stabilize the grid, or power the digital economy are still central to that mission. And those prepared to adapt will define the next chapter of the country’s energy story.

A modest investment on the scale of data center development can build enough storage to cover the demands of data centers and provide a clear path to zero-carbon operations.
Similarly, a little data center flexibility can make a big difference in grid reliability and costs for other consumers.
Our proposal embraces that, allowing any data center willing to be flexible in its operations to pull its own weight through PJM’s demand response programs.
States that wish to incentivize responsible data centers can continue to do so — all this approach adds is an insurance policy.","Tom Rutigliano is senior advocate and Claire Lang-Ree is advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This summer, the 67 million people served by the PJM Interconnection were hit with an extra $9.4 billion in electricity bills as proposed data centers drove up prices. Another $1.4 billion increase is already locked in for next summer, and there’s no end in sight.

Unless something changes, PJM consumers will pay an extra $100 billion through 2033 as new data centers continue to exceed available power supply. By 2028, families in the region will be paying around $70 a month extra on their electricity bills.

Future reliability is also at risk. The power grid in the region is full: Starting in summer 2026, PJM will have just enough power to keep the grid reliable.

Data centers are connecting to the grid faster than we can build new power supply. Right now, PJM has no authority to stop those connections, and data centers are allowed to connect even if there isn’t enough electricity to go around. If nothing changes, by June 2027, the region may fall below reliability standards. That means a greater risk of rolling blackouts, especially during winter storms and summer heat waves. PJM appears to agree: It recently published scenarios that show deep shortages in 2030.

The consequences of overestimating data center demand fall on the public. There are currently no guardrails to ensure that developers and utilities don’t speculate wildly about the demand that will exist in the future.

This overestimation directly impacts prices — it’s how PJM determines how much capacity to buy, three years in advance. NRDC estimates that the public will pay over 80% of increased capacity costs caused by data center demand forecasts. If these data centers don’t show up, the public is still left footing the bill. To add to the problem, most of the money goes to existing power plants, not new supply that we desperately need.

That is why, in collaboration with a bipartisan coalition of over 50 state legislators, led by Maryland Sen. Katie Fry Hester, we’ve proposed a simple solution. PJM must stop buying capacity for new data centers and instead only provide them with interruptible service until they bring their own capacity.

Data centers can still connect to the grid and get power 99.97% of the time. Not providing a guarantee of service for that remaining 0.03% of hours will save the public tens of billions of dollars.

Bring-your-own-capacity puts responsibility for new supply where it belongs: on the data centers that need the power. It’s only common sense. The biggest companies in the world can make their own capital investments. They certainly shouldn’t be allowed to force the public to make investments on their behalf or risk blackouts so that electricity can go to data centers instead.

This doesn’t mean developers need to rush to build traditional power plants. Given reports of multiyear delays in obtaining critical parts and completing necessary transmission upgrades, that might not even be possible. The electric industry just moves slower than Silicon Valley is used to.

Instead, data centers should be looking to rapidly obtain firm service by investing in energy storage and being as flexible as possible. Right now, in PJM, a 6-hour battery contributes more to reliability than a gas-fired combustion turbine, thanks to the battery’s better reliability in the winter. This storage also provides a crucial missing link PJM needs to become a low-carbon grid. A modest investment on the scale of data center development can build enough storage to cover the demands of data centers and provide a clear path to zero-carbon operations. Any tech company that’s serious about its climate commitments and speed to market should be looking very seriously at large-scale, grid-connected energy storage.

Similarly, a little data center flexibility can make a big difference in grid reliability and costs for other consumers. Our proposal embraces that, allowing any data center willing to be flexible in its operations to pull its own weight through PJM’s demand response programs. Similarly, our proposal lets power generation developers willing to connect to the grid quickly — without waiting years for transmission upgrades — to dedicate every watt of their output to support data center operations.

Many proposals include incentives for data centers to bring their own generation or capacity, but they don’t say what happens if they don’t. Without a solid backup plan, these proposals are not guaranteed to protect residents from higher electricity bills and risk of blackouts. States that wish to incentivize responsible data centers can continue to do so — all this approach adds is an insurance policy.

The vast majority of new cars in the U.S. are sold through dealerships.

And in many states, laws to protect dealerships prohibit car companies from selling their vehicles without that middleman.

Budds: “Some of them outright ban or prohibit direct sales of vehicles to consumers. Others offer limited access.”

Hannah Budds is with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, a group that’s advocating for more electric vehicles in the state.

In North Carolina, direct-to-consumer sales – for example, at a retail showroom or online – are mostly prohibited. Only Tesla has qualified for an exception.

Budds says these restrictions limit the growth of EVs in the state because they reduce consumer choice. In fact, some EV brands are simply unavailable in North Carolina.

Budds: “So in order to kind of enable access to EVs for all consumers, they really do need more options and price points to choose from.”

So her group is pushing for policies that allow more direct-to-consumer EV sales.

Budds says it’s a common-sense solution that will benefit consumers and accelerate the transition to a clean energy future.

Environmental concerns were raised by residents near the property as the developers sought city approval for the project. Cleanup costs were also cited by other developers for years as a major roadblock to redevelop the site, even as city of Chicago officials tried to encourage potential new uses.

The state signed off on the developers’ plan for the overall project, known as Quantum Shores, with a few conditions:

• Out of caution regarding potential vapor intrusion into buildings, the IEPA is requiring either the construction of venting systems under future building floor slabs or additional evaluation to verify venting is not needed, once planned building locations are finalized

• A limited area near one soil sample site that showed a high level of pH will require remediation.

The question now is whether the region’s green dreams can endure a pivot to natural gas by its political leaders.

Three of the largest clean energy projects in New England’s history are nearing completion after a decadelong push to curb its reliance on gas, bolster its electric grid and slash planet-warming pollution.

But even as the finish line comes into sight, some of the region’s leaders are considering plans that are antithetical to the climate goals that sprung those projects to life. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, has openly embraced the idea of building gas pipelines. Massachusetts lawmakers briefly considered, then rejected, a plan to water down the state’s climate targets. And the whole region has effectively pressed pause on offshore wind development.

New England leaders say they are as committed to clean energy as ever. But the political shift highlights how a region that spent almost 10 years building two massive offshore wind projects and a transmission line carrying hydropower from Canada is increasingly focused on cutting electricity prices — not carbon.

“Time is already a non-renewable resource, but then you recognize that the more time it takes to build any of this stuff, the more uncertainty you’re exposed to,” said Ben Downing, a former Democratic Massachusetts state senator who authored a landmark clean energy bill in 2016. “I think that if there’s one consistent theme throughout the last decade, it’s that.”

New England is a bellwether for national climate policy. Five of its six states have committed to achieving deep carbon reductions by midcentury. (New Hampshire, where Republicans have had a trifecta in state government for seven of the last 10 years, is the exception.)

Its efforts to remake its energy system began in earnest in 2016, with passage of a Massachusetts law that directed utilities to buy large amounts of Canadian hydropower and offshore wind. The law paved the way for what would become Vineyard Wind 1, an 800-megawatt offshore wind farm 15 miles from Martha’s Vineyard, and New England Clean Energy Connect, a 146-mile transmission line that will carry Canadian hydropower into the U.S. through Maine. Connecticut and Rhode Island followed with plans to buy power from Revolution Wind, a 715-MW wind project about 12 miles off the coast of Rhode Island.

All three projects are nearing completion, having navigated a series of major setbacks. Vineyard Wind’s permit was delayed during the first Trump administration. It was later approved by the Biden administration, but construction was slowed first by a dockworkers strike and then by an accident that saw a turbine blade detach and crash into the ocean. Half of the project’s 62 turbines were generating power at the end of September.

The hydropower line, known as NECEC, faced a series of lawsuits and a ballot referendum in which Maine residents voted to revoke a permit for the project. The state’s highest court later struck down the vote, ruling that it was unconstitutional for voters to retroactively cancel a project that had received a permit and started construction. NECEC, which is capable of serving 8 percent of New England’s electric load, is set to be energized by the end of the year.

Construction of Revolution Wind was first delayed when contamination was discovered at the project’s onshore substation, which is being built at the site of a former military dump. Then in August, it was dealt a near fatal blow when the Trump administration ordered construction to stop. That decision was reversed in court, and the administration has not appealed. Ørsted, one of two companies building the project, said in a recent earnings call that the project was 85 percent complete and is scheduled to come online during the second half of 2026.

“I think all three projects are coming none too soon in providing real benefits,” said Philip Bartlett, who chairs the Maine Public Utilities Commission.

The projects are expected to help alleviate the region’s reliance on gas, which accounts for roughly half of New England’s power generation and is the leading source of home heating. Yet the region has limited pipeline capacity to serve that demand, leaving the region exposed to spikes in gas prices and leading to fears that its pipelines could become overburdened in a cold snap.

The completion of NECEC, Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind could ease those concerns, said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She estimated that the three projects would increase New England’s electricity supply by 10-13 percent, depending on how much hydropower is delivered in a given year.

The results are becoming evident. Even at half capacity, Vineyard Wind is more than twice as big as the region’s largest onshore wind project. (Maine’s Bingham Wind development is 184 MW.) New England’stop 10 days for wind generation have all come since the beginning of October. ISO New England, the regional grid operator, said completing the power line and the wind project would make the region’s electric system well-prepared for winter.

“This is really, really good news for ratepayers in New England and for the reliability of our grid to have so much capacity being added in the near term,” Dykes said.

Yet she acknowledged that the world is different today than it was a decade ago. Lamont has signaled his openness to new pipelines as part of a push to address Connecticut’s sky-high energy costs. The state has also launched a program to assess potential sites for a new nuclear plant, Dykes said.

“If there’s a solution that can help bring costs down for ratepayers and improve affordability that can get developed, there’s nothing that’s off the table,” she said.

Whether other states follow suit remains to be seen. When the Trump administration halted Revolution Wind, Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee (D) indicated that he was open to permitting gas pipelines in exchange for keeping the wind project moving.

“We don’t have a gas line. But I’m with Gov. Lamont. It’s like, we’ll open up those conversations to make that happen for an all-in strategy,” McKee said at a September press conference. A spokesperson for McKee did not respond to a request for comment.

One of the biggest questions relates to Massachusetts. State lawmakers floated a plan to make the Massachusetts 2030 climate target an aspirational goal. Current law calls for halving emissions from 1990 levels. Lawmakers later walked back the proposal to water down that target, but it’s unclear how the state will meet its goals. Massachusetts officials have talked up plans for tapping into onshore wind in Maine and importing offshore wind from Canada.

At the same time, Gov. Maura Healey (D) has opened the door to new gas infrastructure. In September, she said she supported a plan to increase the capacity of an existing pipeline into the region.

“I’ve said we need energy from all sources. You know, wind, solar, gas,” Healey said at a press conference last month. She pledged to work with lawmakers to lower energy costs, saying “we know it’s a struggle for residents and our businesses, and that’s why I’ve continued to make energy affordability, lowering your bills, a priority.”

It’s unclear what that means for the state’s climate goals. Massachusetts already faced a steep climb toward meeting its targets. Its emissions were 28 percent below 1990 levels in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. That means it would have to cut its emissions an additional 22 percent this decade to meet the goal.

New England overall has hit a carbon wall in recent years. Climate pollution from the region’s power plants fell 57 percent between 2005 and 2019, according to EPA data. The decline was driven by the closure of aging coal- and oil-fired plants in favor of cleaner burning gas units.

But power sector emissions have climbed steadily in the years since, reaching 27 million tons last year — an increase of 5 million tons over 2019 levels. The region has struggled to replace the carbon-free generation that was lost with the retirement of Pilgrim Nuclear Station in 2019. There are also no more coal plants to close following the shutdown of Merrimack Station in New Hampshire earlier this year.

The road ahead is even more challenging, with electricity demand projected to rise 11 percent by 2035 due to electrification of heating and transportation. That marks a reversal for the region, where demand has declined since 2005, thanks to energy efficiency measures and rooftop solar installations.

New England leaders had traditionally looked to offshore wind and Canadian hydro for new infusions of power. But it’s not clear if those sources can offer future electrons.

Vineyard Wind and Revolution Wind were conceived as the first of many offshore wind projects in New England. They are now likely to be the only two that are built in the region this decade, and maybe the next. The Trump administration is seeking to revoke permits for two projects, New England Wind and SouthCoast Wind, which had received preliminary power contracts from Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Deadlines for finalizing those contracts have been repeatedly postponed.

Meanwhile, a historic drought in Quebec has stopped the flow of Canadian power into the U.S. — and even reversed it. In October, New England exported 30 gigawatt-hours of electricity to Quebec, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. That is the first time since at least 2019 that New England has been an exporter of electricity to Quebec on a monthly basis, according to a review of federal data by POLITICO’s E&E News.

“Hydro resources of Canada were considered inexhaustible in many state capitals in New England. And the reality is that for pretty much this entire fall, New England has been an electricity exporter to Canada for the first time I can ever remember,” said Dan Dolan, executive director of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group representing power plant owners in the region. “That is a fundamentally changed circumstance for resource additions and the overall energy mix in the region.”

Hydro-Québec, the provincial utility, said it has enough power to fulfill its contract obligations for NECEC. It is also building out the province’s onshore wind resources. The company hopes wind power can provide more domestic electricity, leaving hydropower available to be shipped south, said Serge Abergel, chief operating officer at Hydro-Québec Energy Services.

But he acknowledged that the drought has altered Hydro-Québec’s thinking. The utility has long sold large amounts of power in New England’s spot market, but going forward it could choose moments when New England power prices are high because of waning solar and wind generation. It may even import power from New England during periods with large amounts of wind and solar.

“I think that the future will be more dynamic as we see more price fluctuations because of the intermittency factor in the market,” Abergel said.

Much of the region’s hopes now rest on a plan to build new transmission lines into the rolling farm fields of northern Maine, which boasts New England’s best onshore wind and solar resources. ISO New England recently announced it had received six bids to build new transmission capacity linking Maine to the rest of the region.

The effort represents a significant shift in the region’s approach to clean energy. NECEC was a project spearheaded by Massachusetts and built in Maine. The opposition to that power line convinced the region’s leaders that more collaboration was needed to share the costs and benefits of major infrastructure projects, said Bartlett of Maine’s Public Utilities Commission.

“I think a big important lesson from that is if we’re going to build big energy infrastructure in the region, I think it’s important that all the states kind of be at the table,” he said.

The last decade showed that the greatest barriers to clean energy are bureaucratic and political, said Downing, the former Massachusetts senator who now works at the Engine, a nonprofit clean energy incubator supported by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Last summer, Downing went on a family vacation to Martha’s Vineyard. They drove out to the tip of the island, where they could see the towering turbines of Vineyard Wind on the horizon.

“It’s a beautiful thing, and that’s after everything that they’ve had to go through,” Downing said. “The fact that we’ve done it at all shows that we can do it. And, yeah, it’s nowhere near the straight line that we thought it was. Nowhere near that. But that isn’t a reason to say, ‘Well, take a right turn when we thought we were going straight. The thing’s over.’ No way, no way. We got to come up with a new plan to get back online.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d6/b0/fd195e494fcabeb4f221089a7ad9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/614802176,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:06.215523

A new report from the Climate Litigation Network explores how 10 years of court cases have helped establish ""binding legal duties” for leaders and big polluters to help protect citizens from climate harm.

Many of these legal battles were inspired by the groundbreaking Urgenda case, which marked the first time a court anywhere in the world ordered a government to take stronger climate action.

The ruling came after the non-profit Urgenda Foundation, along with almost 1,000 citizens, petitioned Dutch courts to hold the government to its own commitments to reduce emissions, protect the public and uphold human rights.

Climate cases are ‘restoring agency and trust’

The report, titled Laying the foundations for our shared future: how ten years of climate cases built a legal architecture for climate protection, argues that the rise of climate litigation is a direct response to governmental and corporate failure to address the “defining challenge of our time”.

Globally, almost nine in ten people (89 per cent) want their governments to do more to tackle climate change – yet only one in five people believe their government will keep its promises.

“In this context, climate litigation has become a means of restoring agency and trust,” the report reads.

“Litigation allows citizens to seek accountability through independent courts, which promise to assess their plight according to the law rather than short-term political pressures.”

Climate defences

Successfully suing a government or powerful company once seemed impossible, but long-standing defences are now being challenged. Since the 1990s, corporations have relied on a trio of key arguments to “resist accountability” in the courts.

These are the “leave it to politics defence” which argues that climate policy is too complex for the courts; the “drop in the ocean” defence, which claims that a single country or company is too globally insignificant to create enforceable legal duties; and the “choose any target” defence, which says that governments and companies are free to determine the level and timing of their emissions reductions.

Case by case, the power of these defences has dwindled, resulting in strengthened climate targets and amended laws in countries like Brazil, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea.

This has helped lay down legal foundations that also empower communities to challenge once untouchable fossil fuel giants like Shell and TotalEnergies.

Climate change in the courts

The report details a number of successful climate cases that have gone through the courts following the Urgenda case.

For example, in 2015, Asghar Leghair filed a case against the Pakistani Government demanding that it do more to protect the country from increasinglysevere climate impacts. The Lahore High Court ruled in favour of Leghair, ordering the establishment of a Climate Change Commission and tasked government agencies with implementing climate policies.

In Switzerland, members of KilmaSeniorinnen challenged the government’s climate inaction as a violation of their human rights.

The case led to a landmark decision of the European Court of Human Rights, which found that Switzerland was in fact breaking its human rights obligations by failing to adopt a sufficient reduction pathway for greenhouse gas emissions.

Even failed court cases, like Pabai v Commonwealth of Australia, have successfully drawn national attention to the existential threat climate change poses and underscored the need for stronger government action.

This case saw two elders from the Torres Strait Islands file a class action against the Australian Government in 2021 over rising sea levels that threatened their community.

In 2015, mountain guide and farmer Saúl Luciano Lliuya took RWE, Germany’s largest electricity producer, to court.

Lliyua argued that the company’s emissions were contributing to the melting of glaciers in Peru, and that RWE should help pay for flood defences for the city of Huaraz.

Despite the case failing, the court’s ruling now means that if a major carbon emitter refuses to take “protective measures”, then it could be held responsible for costs proportional to its share of emissions, even before damages occur.

Overall, the report says these kinds of cases have created legal building blocks defining how governments must reduce emissions to prevent dangerous climate change. This includes limiting temperature increase to 1.5℃, as outlined in the Paris Agreement, and ensuring that big polluters can be held accountable for climate damages.

A ‘legal imperative’

“What was a moral imperative ten years ago has become a legal imperative,” says Sarah Mead, co-director of the Climate Litigation Network.

“Big polluters – the governments and companies most responsible for climate change – have a duty to pull their weight in the global effort to stop dangerous climate change.”

Mead adds that the world’s highest-emitting companies shouldn’t be able to ""pollute with impunity” and profit “on the back of our future”, arguing the courts are now catching up.

Dennis van Berkle, Legal Counsel at Urgenda, says that over the past decade, people have used the courts to build an accountability framework from the ground up.

“We’ve never been in a better place to use the law to protect people and the planet from climate change,” he adds.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/56/90/81/1200x675_cmsv2_d2923704-a68a-55c2-9580-b4753ae5deaf-9569081.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 07:59:07.505458

Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger made the cost of living the focus of her campaign, frequently mentioning high energy bills. House Democrats, whose majority has been boosted by the addition of 13 new members of their party, are also expected to focus on these bread-and-butter issues.

In Virginia, the cause of these high bills is not hard to identify: Data centers are driving up demand well beyond the available supply, and high fossil fuel prices are pinching a state that relies on natural gas for most of its electricity. Spanberger has committed to making data centers “pay their fair share,” and both she and legislators will be looking for other opportunities to lower costs.

With Democrats in charge, Spanberger targets lower energy bills — and higher costs for data centers

The bad news is that adding ever more data centers across Virginia means the upward pressure on electricity prices will continue. If the governor and legislators don’t want to kick tech companies to states with spare capacity, and if the administration of President Donald Trump continues to throttle the energy supply with its war on wind and solar, lowering energy costs in the near term likely isn’t possible.

Even so, there is a lot that Spanberger and the General Assembly can do to protect residential consumers from these higher prices.

Making data centers pay their fair share means more than tweaking rate structures. Several Virginia utilities have created special rate classes for large load users like data centers. The utilities will require data center operators to sign long-term contracts committing them to paying for a large percentage of the electricity and transmission they say they need, even if they don’t end up using that much or leave the Virginia market prematurely.

These new tariffs can help protect other customers from some – though not all – of the risk involved in serving data centers, but they don’t address the “fair share” issue. The current allocation of transmission costs, with residential ratepayers picking up most of the tab for new lines that don’t benefit them, needs to change. If the SCC determines it doesn’t have authority to do that on its own, the General Assembly and Spanberger should pass legislation to make it happen.

The harder problem is how to make residents whole for rate increases that result from data centers gobbling up all available power. The supply and demand problem has been compounded by a lot of bad decisions, with plenty of blame to go around. The federal government has driven up fossil fuel prices by allowing the export of increasing amounts of natural gas, while hindering and even blocking solar and offshore wind projects that could make up the deficit.

Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin is to blame for illegally pulling Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), removing the market incentive for Virginia utilities to increase investments in low-cost renewable energy instead of burning expensive fossil fuels. (His promotion of the false narrative that gas is “cheap” doesn’t help.)

Virginia utilities share the blame for relying too much on natural gas and high-priced electricity imported from other PJM states. And grid operator PJM is to blame for failing to approve enough new generation, including wind and solar facilities that make up the vast majority of projects waiting for approval to interconnect.

This history leaves Spanberger with a fine mess. Keeping prices in check now requires two things that can actually be accomplished during the next four years: a greater buildout of solar generation and energy storage to get more capacity on the grid; and investments in energy efficiency and rooftop solar to take pressure off the demand side.

Solve utility solar siting with agrivoltaics. Virginia needs more energy, and solar is the only source that can be built quickly. Yet one of the knottiest problems confronting the General Assembly in the past few years has been the rise of anti-solar sentiment in rural counties.

Landowners who want to lease their property for solar, or even to install arrays for their own use, find themselves stymied by opposition from neighbors who don’t like the look and are able to persuade county boards to deny permits. As we’ve seen, sometimes denial of a solar permit even follows approval of an energy-sucking data center.

Data centers approved, solar farms rejected: What is going on in rural Virginia?

Last year the General Assembly came close to passing a bill that would require solar developers to implement industry best practices. Passing legislation like that this year will address the legitimate concerns of localities around controlling erosion and maintaining native plant buffers. But more can be done to make solar look and function like a normal part of Virginia’s agricultural economy.

Already, solar facilities have become integrated with agriculture, as sheep and sometimes cattle take over vegetation management and farmers learn which crops do well growing between rows of solar arrays. It’s a trend that offers benefits to the land and the community alike. Farmers are struggling; solar can provide a stable income while protecting land from permanent development and putting much-needed energy on the grid.

Businesses are ahead of public policy on this. Virginia-based Gray’s Lambscaping manages vegetation with over 800 sheep at solar farms across the state, and the company plans to grow to over 5,000 sheep by the end of this year. Meanwhile, solar panels have proven compatible with a wide range of food crops.

Virginia should take a leading role in expanding agrivoltaics. Virginia law already recognizes the right to farm as an exception to localities’ authority over land use decisions, and this should be extended to farmers who put solar on their land, as long as they are also using the same land for traditional agricultural practices like grazing and crops.

Install solar on new public buildings and schools. Heck, put it everywhere. In the past ten years or so, Virginia’s commercial solar sector has blossomed while saving taxpayers money. To date, an estimated 150 Virginia schools have installed solar panels, saving schools about 25% on their energy bills. Solar on every sunny school rooftop would add up to more than 1,000 MW of carbon-free generation. Extend the effort to the roofs of all suitable public buildings across the state, and that number can go much higher.

Dominion and APCo have long tried to squelch competition from rooftop solar, a war that looks increasingly foolish as Virginia finds itself short on energy for all customers. Earlier this year Congress drastically accelerated the phase-out of solar tax incentives, but the savings remain available for commercial and utility-scale projects for the next two years. There is no shortage of good ideas out there to be acted upon. Spanberger and legislators should take full advantage of that opportunity to install as much solar as possible.

Battery storage at data centers does triple duty. While solar is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to generate power, it needs batteries or other forms of energy storage to make it into a 24/7 resource, and storage remains relatively expensive. For tech companies, however, the calculus makes more sense.

Data centers need backup power anyway; they typically have three layers of redundancy so that they never risk losing power when the grid goes down. Today the backup power is mostly provided by massive diesel generators, sometimes three times as many as they might actually need. Most of these have no pollution controls and are therefore not supposed to run except in emergencies and for testing and maintenance.

Some tech companies are now installing generators with selective catalytic converters that produce fewer emissions. The catch is that these can legally be used in non-emergency situations, raising the possibility that they might be used for demand-response or peak shaving. In effect, data centers would be solving the peak demand problem with one of the dirtiest forms of energy. The cumulative effect on air quality could be worrisome, and Virginia’s carbon footprint would grow at a time when the law says it should be shrinking.

What if, instead of diesel generators, data centers installed storage as their first line of defense against power outages, leaving diesel generators to be used only in the rare case of extended grid outages? Air quality would benefit, carbon emissions would decrease, and the data centers would have the backup power they need. The tech companies would pay more upfront but could be compensated by utilities for using their storage capability for grid services and demand response, lowering their draw from the grid at peak demand times.

All the data centers in Virginia today use 6 gigawatts of power. That much storage would exceed the targets set in the VCEA for Dominion and APCo combined. Even limiting the requirement to two hours of storage at new data centers would bring enough storage online quickly to eliminate the expensive demand peaks that drive the high price of energy.

Require data center operators to source their own zero-carbon electricity. Most of the tech companies have sustainability commitments that they aren’t meeting, so it isn’t asking too much of them to put them in charge of this effort. Legislation to require this as a condition of accepting Virginia’s generous tax subsidies has been defeated for the past two years. The difference this year is that rising energy prices are now affecting everyone.

Under this proposal, the zero-carbon electricity doesn’t have to come from Virginia, as long as it is available to customers here. Maybe the tech companies could even tap into their considerable influence with the Trump administration to make electricity more plentiful and affordable by reversing its war on solar and wind energy.

Why, after all, should Virginia residents sacrifice for the richest corporations in the world? If “paying their fair share” means anything, it should mean that data centers, not residents, bear the costs of making enough energy available to Virginia, and complying with our clean energy mandate.

Lower demand with energy efficiency and distributed solar. The gap between energy supply and demand does not have to be filled entirely through supply-side solutions. Lowering demand should also be part of the solution. Virginia utilities, Dominion in particular, have done a poor job of running energy efficiency programs. Looking on the bright side, though, that means plenty of opportunities remain.

House Democrats have already started work on this issue, with a focus on lowering winter heating costs for lower-income households. As reported in the Mercury last week, HB 2, from Farifax Del. Mark Sickles, requires Dominion and APCo to make their “best, reasonable efforts” to provide energy efficiency and weatherization to 30% of income-qualified customers by the end of 2031. HB 3, from Del. Destiny Levere Bolling, D-Henrico, sets up a task force to study income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization.

These steps are okay for starters, and they would be juiced by the influx of money from RGGI carbon auctions (see next section), earmarked for low-income energy efficiency. But Dominion has repeatedly failed to meet the energy efficiency targets the legislature sets for it, and after all, why stop with 30% of low-income customers when all households could benefit from more comprehensive programs? Virginia can do much better.

My last column discussed Rewiring America’s proposal to have tech companies pay for heat pumps, solar and batteries in the residential sector, saving money for households and freeing up capacity for data centers to come online sooner. An independent provider could run the program and verify the energy savings.

(If the tech companies complain that an awful lot of the solutions I’m proposing come at their expense, it’s true. But the industry benefits from a state tax subsidy that has reached nearly a billion dollars per year, and will only grow further as the number of data centers doubles and triples. They can afford to give back.)

Use RGGI for long-term affordability. Gov.-elect Spanberger has committed to seeing Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the compact of northeastern states working to lower carbon emissions by 30% by 2030. RGGI works by requiring owners of carbon-emitting generating plants to buy carbon allowances at auction, penalizing carbon-intensive generation and rewarding investments in zero-carbon facilities like wind, solar and nuclear. States collect the auction proceeds, which in Virginia are dedicated to low-income energy efficiency and climate adaptation measures.

Republicans have already renewed their attacks on RGGI, calling it a tax on energy consumers. To the extent that’s true, it’s a tax mostly paid by the largest consumers (including data centers) for the benefit of low-income residents and people most vulnerable to storms and sea level rise. Moreover, all energy consumers benefit over the longer term as low-cost clean energy increasingly replaces expensive fossil fuels.

Beef up efficiency standards in the residential building code. Most people who buy a new home assume that modern building codes incorporate the latest standards for insulation and efficient technology. In Virginia, they do not. Buyers would be dismayed to learn that their homes are costing them more on their utility bills than they saved on a purchase price supposedly made more affordable by poorer-quality insulation and appliances. Buyers are rarely consulted on these trade-offs, and few have the expertise to question a builder’s choices. Building codes are supposed to do that job.

Unfortunately, Virginia’s Board of Housing and Community Development, which writes the code, is dominated by the homebuilding industry. The industry wants to build homes as cheaply as possible to ensure the highest profit possible on the homes it sells. Even as national model code standards have become more rigorous, homebuilders have protected their own interests by keeping weak energy efficiency requirements in Virginia’s residential building code.

In 2021, Virginia adopted legislation requiring the board to consider and adopt energy standards “at least as stringent as” the latest national model code standards when the benefits over time to residents and the public exceed the incremental costs of construction. But the board simply didn’t do it. Will this be the year legislators realize that a board dominated by the industry it regulates won’t act in the public interest without explicit directions?",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/53247147735_cacdab3c96_o-1024x7681764757152.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=y1ilRdic,N,,2025-12-03 06:57:51.548991

HOOSIER NEWS: The Midwest grid operator that serves Indiana is looking to fast-track more power plants through its interconnection process. MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the grid needs power for AI data centers, manufacturing plants and electric vehicles. None of the projects the operator approved so far are in Indiana, but at least six in the state are eligible this round. MISO fast-tracked 10 energy projects in September. About half of them were natural gas plants and half were energy sources like solar, wind and battery storage. But in terms of megawatts, it was no contest. Natural gas made up about 80% of the capacity that was able to quickly connect to the grid. The Indiana energy projects eligible to speed through the queue are similarly split: half are natural gas and half are battery storage. About 73% of the megawatts proposed by NIPSCO and Duke Energy would come from gas. Renewable energy companies are concerned the high energy demand from things like data centers will allow natural gas projects to jump the line, even though many more clean energy sources are waiting to get connected.

NATIONAL NEWS: Waymo has released nearly 100 million miles of autonomous driving data showing its self-driving cars were involved in 91% fewer serious-injury crashes and 80% fewer injury crashes than human drivers on the same roads. The company also recorded 96% fewer injury-causing intersection crashes, with large reductions in pedestrian, cyclist and motorcycle-related crashes. While three incidents involving Waymo cars resulted in two deaths and one serious injury, all were caused by human-driven vehicles. The findings come as the U.S. continues to face 39,000 annual traffic deaths, highlighting the potential public health impact of wider autonomous vehicle adoption. (Dr. Jonathan Slotkin/NYT)

This Day in Shelby County History

Local headlines reported on or around this date in Shelby County history. Selections are curated by The Addison Times from Shelby County Public Library Genealogy Department materials.

2005: Demolition of Shelbyville’s old Fire Station No. 1 and several neighboring buildings began to make way for the new fire department headquarters. Mayor Scott Furgeson said the work would last about four weeks and would not impede traffic.

1995: Shelbyville defeated Columbus North in boys basketball, pulling away after an early exchange of leads. The Golden Bears honored longtime coach Bill Stearman before the game, marking his first return to Shelbyville as an opponent in more than 25 years. Shelbyville controlled the boards, limited Columbus North’s offense and secured the win behind strong performances from Kyle Hobbs and Pat McNeely.

1985: Overhead Door announced a $1.5 million expansion that was expected to add 50 to 60 jobs in Shelbyville, centered on a 47,000-square-foot addition, new office space and expanded manufacturing areas. The project also included replacing and enlarging the company’s St. Joe Street facility.

1975: St. Paul’s town board discussed several potential improvement projects, including purchasing the Triple Lakes property for a water supply and recreation area and converting the former Jones Bar-B-Q restaurant into a senior center or recreation facility. The board planned to set priorities once funding decisions were finalized.

1965: Southwestern High School planned its Student Council–sponsored Sno-Ball Dance with a “Silver Wonderland” theme and selected Dan South as the event’s disc jockey. In other school news, the marching Spartans prepared for a Saturday performance in Shelbyville, led by drum major Bob Cortelyou, head majorette Nancy Main, and a seven-member majorette and flag corps that included Karen Sandefur, Pat Hamner, Della Scheffler, Barb Hamner, Debbie Kendall and Connie Martin. The Stagelighters club also gathered to celebrate Larry Coffey’s birthday.

1955: The Shelbyville News published an article on Mrs. Russell (Reba) McNeely of Third Street, who grew more than 75 African violets using a “sign method” taught by a national growers’ organization, earning honors for plants started from show-winning stock. Her collection included many varieties in colors from deep purple to pastel pink, and she tended them under fluorescent lights with careful watering and grooming to produce balanced blooms. McNeely frequently exhibited her flowers, and belonged to a statewide violet club.

1945: Foundation work was underway for the new Nu-Kraft manufacturing plant on Meridian Street, facing the Shelbyville High School athletic field. Company president Russ Gross said operations would continue at the Shelby Shops until the new facility was finished, with the plant expected to house all manufacturing by March. The one-story structure was planned at roughly 225 feet long and 80 feet wide, and Shelby Woodcrafters, a Hallcrafters subsidiary, would occupy the factory to build radio cabinets.

1935: Shelby County Commissioners discussed a proposal to require defendants in non-support cases to work on county roads instead of serving jail time, with wages deducted and directed to their dependents.

1925: Fourteen-year-old George Cuskaden of Noble Township was named the healthiest farm boy in the United States after earning a 97.7 percent score on national health exams in Chicago. Cuskaden, a student at Waldron High School, credited his routine, saying he drank a quart of milk a day, avoided tea, coffee and doughnuts, and ate eggs, ham, bread, mush and fruit for breakfast, meat twice daily, an onion every day and apples six times a week, reserving candy only for Saturdays. He also drank six quarts of water a day, kept an early bedtime, worked on his family’s 200-acre farm and was active in basketball, baseball and track.

The toys, which included drums, dolls, blackboards, crayons, tops, pop guns and a large supply of skates, were to be distributed Christmas morning using tickets given to local children. Committee members, led by Mrs. B.F. Swain, continued meeting to finalize arrangements and ensure every child in the city received a gift despite tight finances that year.

A new federal rule by the Trump administration is expected to reduce regulatory burdens on farmers by narrowing the scope of federal oversight on the nation’s wetlands and other waterways.

Released last month by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the proposed rule carries out directives from the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Sackett v. EPA, ending years of regulatory uncertainty about how the Clean Water Act applies to working farmland.

The rule is designed to cut red tape and prevent federal overreach, EPA said, which could save farmers time and money by reducing permitting requirements for activities on their land. It provides a new definition of “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, that aims to ensure that only relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes—and wetlands that are connected to and indistinguishable from such water bodies are federally regulated, EPA added.

Public comments on the proposed rule are due Jan. 5.

Farm groups, which have long called for clearer rules on WOTUS to simplify compliance for landowners, largely expressed support for the new definition, saying it brings much-needed clarity and ends years of shifting regulations that often led to confusion about what waters were under federal control and require a Clean Water Act permit.

Courtney Briggs, senior director of government affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation, called the proposed rule “a real positive step in the right direction,” as it provides a clear distinction between regulating major water bodies and farm-specific features such as ditches and ponds.

“The Supreme Court clearly ruled several years ago that the government overreached in its interpretation of what fell under federal guidelines,” AFBF President Zippy Duvall said, adding that the new rule “protects critical water sources while respecting the efforts of farmers to protect the natural resources they’ve been entrusted with.”

Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, defining WOTUS has been one of the most complex and contentious issues in federal water policy. Due to lack of statutory language in the law, multiple administrations and courts have grappled with how far federal jurisdiction should reach on wetlands and water features. This has led to decades of conflicting court decisions, shifting regulatory interpretations, intense political debate and implementation challenges.

The 2015 rule under the Obama administration expanded federal protections to ephemeral and intermittent streams, as well as wetlands not directly adjacent to larger waterways.

In 2020, under the first Trump administration, the rule narrowed protections significantly, excluding wetlands, streams and other water bodies that were previously covered.

The Biden administration issued a new rule in 2023 that returned to the pre-2015 regulatory regime. Without incorporating the Sackett decision into the regulatory text, the Biden rule defined WOTUS as relatively permanent waters, such as traditional navigable waters, along with those with a continuous surface connection to them.

“Some ill-defined areas from the Sackett ruling compounded with updated guidance from the Biden administration has led to continued challenges with interpreting the regulation,” said Erin Huston, federal policy consultant for the California Farm Bureau.

The updated rule is meant to establish a “clear, durable, common-sense” WOTUS definition, EPA said, and clarifies whether farmers, landowners and businesses must secure permits before they pursue projects that might impact surface water quality.

“No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a water of the United States is on their property,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said.

Under the proposal, certain ditches, prior converted cropland, waste treatment systems and groundwater are not considered WOTUS—revisions that EPA said would “accelerate economic prosperity.” Ephemeral waters, or those with surface water flowing or standing due to rainfall or snow, also are not federally protected, according to the proposal.

In addition, the new rule defines “relatively permanent” water, which is federally regulated, as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.”

EPA said the proposal protects water quality “by striking balance between federal and state authority, recognizing that states and tribes are best positioned to appropriately manage their local land and water resources.”

To that end, the federal rule does not change what California requires, as states retain authority to regulate waters within their borders and have their own protections for wetlands and water quality, said Kari Fisher, senior counsel for the California Farm Bureau.

She noted California’s Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act—which gives the California State Water Resources Control Board and the nine regional water quality control boards the authority to protect surface water, groundwater and wetlands—is more restrictive than the federal Clean Water Act and regulates more groundwater and surface water.

“The big question is if the state of California will in turn regulate even more if the new WOTUS rule is enacted,” Fisher said.

The state water board is expected to release a new report in the coming months that could provide more clarity on how it may change its water quality protection programs in light of the new WOTUS rule.

Last month, Ohio’s Mahoning Valley was hit once again with job cuts at the Ultium Cells battery plant; around 500 jobs lost, and 850 workers temporarily laid off.

The community spent years working to bring manufacturing jobs back to the area.

Workers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) spent additional years organizing the Ultium plant to ensure safety and living wages.

It is difficult to see the gains of these workers and this community lost again, and that basic ask from our community years ago, “invest in us” stays top of mind.

Since 1966, the Lordstown Complex employed thousands of Ohioans who showed up and worked hard, even as our jobs were threatened with offshoring and automation.

After I had the honor of being elected as President of Local UAW 1112, I did everything in my power to see a new vehicle brought to Lordstown.

We knew that plant had all the right stuff to be a herald of a revived American automotive industry, and our members were ready to get back to work.

We believed then, and continue to believe now, that our members are the backbone of our communities, our states, and our nation.

We have urged our representatives on both sides of the aisle to invest in workers and in communities like Lordstown across the country.

But for companies like Ultium, the passage of the Republican budget bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) this past summer makes it clear that Congressional Republicans are willing to lay waste to these goals.

Ohio U.S. Sen. Jon Husted lauded the significant tax cuts in the bill, but failed to mention that these historic tax breaks for the ultra-rich come at steep cost for working people.

More than 410,000 workers are currently employed in manufacturing facilities like Ultium that build the next generation of clean vehicles or their components.

This includes more than 240,000 manufacturing jobs in the domestic electric vehicle (EV) supply chain alone.

Many of these jobs are supported by federal policies and regulations, including the 30D EV tax credits and the 45X subsidies.

The UAW believes that incentives like these need stronger protections for workers attached, to make sure public dollars are only used to create good union jobs.

But instead of working with us to improve the credits, Republicans used their budget bill to eliminate them altogether, throwing companies that produce EVs and their parts into uncertainty.

The Ultium plant in Ohio is not an outlier.

Significant layoffs at GM’s Factory Zero and Rivian were also announced last month, as were temporary layoffs at Ultium’s Tennessee plant.

The loss of jobs at these facilities is not only a loss for the workers, but also a loss for all of us who live and work in these communities.

These plants uphold local economies, build innovative technologies that position the United States to compete in an advancing global marketplace, and ultimately, produce safe, reliable American cars.

In the plants we organized, the UAW worked to ensure these jobs were good jobs, safe jobs, where workers were able to achieve significant union-backed wage increases and benefits to support themselves and their families.

Facilities like Ultium proved that auto workers building parts and components for clean vehicles could receive the strong union protections and benefits they deserve.

In April, the Partnership for Public Service—a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the federal government—found DOGE’s actions had cost taxpayers around $135 billion in its first 100 days through the loss of federal worker productivity, repeated fire-and-rehire cycles and paid leave.

This figure does not account for the costs of defending the many lawsuits filed against DOGE, nor any potential decline in tax collections caused by cuts to IRS personnel.

This capability is operational across Canada with EVs and we're bringing the capability to data center applications.","Cloud-based SaaS Product Turns Data Centers and Software Applications from Grid Consumers to Grid Partners Helping to Decarbonize and Stabilize the Electricity Supply

BluWave-ai announced the expansion of the Smart Grid Optimizer product line with the launch of the BluWave-ai Data Center Autopilot™. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) product provides application owners, colocation, and hyperscale data center operators with a fast-to-deploy solution to manage their immense and volatile power demands in concert with the dynamics of the local grid load.

Goldman Sachs Research estimates that the electricity demand from data centers worldwide will increase 50% by 2027 and up to 165% by 2030 from 2023 levels. This rapid increase is straining power grids globally with a massive volume of new capacity being built and connected, notably in Northern Virginia where 20GW of data center capacity is being added along with other US markets. This is resulting in data centers and other large loads being forced to wait until utilities and grid operators can prepare and ensure sufficient generation and delivery capacity. BluWave-ai Data Center Autopilot will allow for operation with much lower grid connection build-out.

RMI reports in a recent paper: In Northern Virginia Dominion Energy is warning that new data center connections may have to wait up to 7 years for connection, and in Dallas-Fort Worth some data center delivery dates are delayed until 2027 or later. Grid operators are seeing similar issues in Canada and worldwide. Hydro-Quebec expects data center power to grow by 7 times <[2] > and connection applications are being delayed or rejected. In British Columbia, the government is restricting data center energy use until the system is able to provide the capacity.

To meet this challenge, there is an opportunity to mitigate demand by throttling applications that are not time-critical running in data centers. Using patent-pending technology from BluWave-ai, the Data Center Autopilot realizes this by moving tasks that can be scheduled to operate at times where grid congestion and energy costs are lower, smoothing out spiky AI workloads while maintaining quality of service and uptime.

""The data center industry is struggling to balance immense growth with the imperative for sustainability and grid reliability. Our experience and proven technology for optimizing the grid using electric vehicles and renewable energy storage has given us a unique position to solve this problem,"" said Thomas Triplet VP of Engineering at BluWave-ai. ""The BluWave-ai Data Center Autopilot leverages our patented approach to translate what's going on in the grid into an actionable signal for data center application workloads. This means data centers and their associated applications can finally act as a sophisticated, flexible partner to the grid, with up to 35% reduction of the peak electricity utilization. This effectively enables data center owners to achieve significant cost savings while lowering their carbon footprint.""

""The strain that hyperscale AI is putting on the grid is a major concern for all colocation providers, especially as we commit to meeting aggressive sustainability goals. BluWave-ai's approach is unique because it goes beyond facility-level controls to address the power demands at the rack and application level,"" said Mike Lalonde, Co-founder at Purecolo. ""Integrating Data Center Autopilot allows us to provide our customers with a truly granular demand response capability, ensuring we can optimize workloads to align with the grid's real-time cost and carbon intensity. This partnership is a key step for Purecolo to manage volatility, offer superior quality of service, and deliver on our promise of a more efficient, net-zero-ready data center.""

Applications Owner Benefits: Application owners who have not time sensitive applications can subscribe to the service and opt in to energy use reduction during grid constrained times and receive a direct revenue stream from BluWave-ai reducing their overall cost of operations. BluWave-ai aggregates multiple applications within a data center or across data centers in an electricity system operator service area

Data Center Operator Benefits: The platform provides joint optimization for all connected assets (on-site batteries, data center management system and applications) to perform peak demand reduction and energy arbitrage. This delivers a demonstrable ROI with net reduction in total electricity expenditure and measurable improvements in power usage efficiency using existing hardware assets.

ESG and Carbon Emissions Reduction: By preferentially scheduling workloads to run during periods of high renewable energy availability, the solution actively helps operators achieve aggressive carbon usage effectiveness targets and meet net-zero sustainability mandates which are quantified by the platform for ESG reporting purposes

The system uses a proprietary, predictive signal, BluScore™ which communicates the real-time cost, carbon intensity, and availability of grid power. This signal is consumed by the BluWave-ai AI optimizer to automatically throttle, pause, or shift non-critical workloads, containers, or individual applications. This precision ensures quality of service for mission-critical functions is maintained while enabling participation with highly granular demand response and other electricity market services.

The solution operates on the BluWave-ai Infrastructure Cube, already deployed across Canada to seamlessly connect with utilities, system operators and with BluWave-ai's other Smart Grid Optimizer solutions. The platform standardizes and handles ""dirty data"" from the grid providing more accurate grid predictions for optimal control in concert with other electricity consumers and producers, supporting the power grid. It also coordinates with other distributed energy resources on the grid such as any available on-site battery energy storage at data centers, providing further opportunities for participation in demand response and energy arbitrage further improving net operating costs.

""With the large volume in grid interconnection requested and ramp in loads from existing data center operators, distribution grids are constrained given the increasing electrification coming from general grid loads and EVs, "" said Devashish Paul, CEO and Founder of BluWave-ai, ""Our Data center Autopilot will allow non-time-sensitive data center loads to self throttle as much as 100 percent during grid constrained periods. This capability is operational across Canada with EVs and we're bringing the capability to data center applications. For a 100MW group of non-time-sensitive applications such as AI model training or other batch processing compute intensive applications, our simulations for a weekly load suggest the potential for a drop from 100MW peak loads to an average of less than 65MW peak""

Autumn Budget 2025: the Energy Profits Levy, renewables, nuclear, electric vehicles and energy infrastructure

On 26 November 2025, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered the Autumn 2025 Budget, introducing important changes affecting the Energy sector. Announcements include:

The Energy Profits Levy windfall tax will be replaced by an Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM). The levy, introduced in 2022, will remain in effect until the earlier of March 2030 or on the triggering of the Energy Security Investment Mechanism (ESIM), at which point the new OGPM will take effect, also triggering the tax rate to return to the flat 40% ""headline"" tax, which will continue as a permanent regime. (The ESIM was established as a trigger such that if the six-month average price of both oil and gas drops below $71.40/barrel for oil and £0.54/therm for gas, thereby returning to ""historically norma"" prices, the Energy Price Levy would cease to apply.) The OGPM imposes a 35% charge on revenues above ""unusually high"" price thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and £0.90/therm for gas. It is intended that the OGPM will be legislated in the next Finance Bill.

The government will publicly fund 75% of the domestic legacy costs of the Renewables Obligation from 2026-27 to 2028-29. As recently reported, there is an ongoing consultation in relation to the indexation of the Renewables Obligation. Paired with ending the Energy Company Obligation, this is projected to reduce average household energy bills by around £150 in 2026-27. These changes will take effect from 1 April 2026.

The British Industry Supercharger, providing energy bill relief for energy-intensive industries, received an uplift. The Network Charging Compensation Scheme relief, which compensates eligible businesses against the cost of using the Great British Electricity Grid, will rise from 60% to 90%.

Nuclear energy will be introduced as an eligible use of funds under the UK Green Financing Framework. However, proceeds from green gilts and Green Savings Bonds issued before 27 November 2025 will not be used for nuclear projects. See further on nuclear developments below.

Electricity used to produce electrolytic hydrogen will be exempt from the Climate Change Levy (CCL). See more on the CCL below.

The introduction of a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme from 2027, which the government states will reduce the electricity costs for over 7,000 businesses by up to £40/MWh. Support is intended for manufacturing ""frontier industries within the Industrial Strategy's growth sectors and foundational manufacturing industries that provide key inputs to the frontier's industries which meet a certain threshold of electricity intensity"". The consultation opened on 24 November and will close on 19 January 2026; responses should be submitted to: bics.correspondence@businessandtrade.gov.uk.

The Carbon Price Support rates (the minimum floor price for carbon) in Great Britain will be frozen in 2027-28 at a ""level equivalent to"" £18 per tonne of CO2.

Electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids will pay a per-mile levy from April 2028. The self-reported charge for EVs will be ""half the equivalent fuel duty rate for petrol and diesel cars, and plug-in hybrid cars will pay a reduced rate equivalent to half of the electric car rate"".

Government releases report on Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce review

On 26 November, the government published a report on the Nuclear Regulatory Review 2025. The review identifies regulation as central to the UK's relative decline in nuclear competitiveness, with the increasing complexity and risk aversion of the regulatory system contributing to a weakening of the UK's leadership position.

It diagnoses five primary regulatory problems: (i) fragmented oversight with multiple regulators and no designated lead; (ii) disproportionate decisions that are overly conservative and costly; (iii) flawed legislation prioritising process over outcomes; (iv) government indecision in policymaking and regulatory roles; and (v) weak industry incentives due to near-monopolistic market structures.

The review proposes reforms that include a new Commission on Nuclear Regulation as a one-stop decision-maker for major approvals, which has been proposed to address the issues in current oversight identified by the taskforce. Interim steps entail a formal lead regulator model (the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) as default) and merging the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR) into ONR. These structural recommendations complement earlier government initiatives analysed in this previous update, which covers parallel reforms in regulatory, planning and delivery frameworks.

Following the publication of the report, the prime minister's strategic steer endorses all recommendations, committing to full implementation within two years (subject to legislative timelines). It ties reforms to broader policies: a new National Policy Statement for Nuclear Energy Generation beyond 2025, Planning and Infrastructure Bill changes, and forthcoming SMR/advanced nuclear frameworks.

Government launches North Sea Future Plan

The government has published its response to the 'Building the North Sea's Energy Future' consultation, setting out a framework for managing the transition of the North Sea basin from traditional oil and gas production towards clean energy industries. The North Sea Plan seeks to implement the government's manifesto commitments to manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan and not to issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields.

To implement this framework, the government has outlined a few measures listed below:

Transitional Energy Certificates: A key part of the government’s response is the introduction of Transitional Energy Certificates, which allow limited oil and gas production on or near existing fields without new exploration. This mechanism supports an orderly transition by permitting development linked to existing infrastructure (""tiebacks""), consistent with the commitment to halt new exploration licences. Developers cannot explore new sites, and some uncertainty remains over how the framework will apply to larger projects extending into unlicensed seabed areas.

Regulatory and licensing reforms: Primary legislation will amend the North Sea Transition Authority’s (NSTA) statutory objectives to balance maximising economic value, supporting net zero delivery and assessing long-term transition impacts on workers, communities and supply chains. Decisions on field extensions, emissions and decommissioning will incorporate these factors, aligning with the Climate Change Act and the Paris Agreement. The ban extends to new onshore licences in England (effectively ending fracking), while stricter rules on flaring, venting and platform electrification accelerate decarbonisation of legacy assets.

Workforce transition support: A new North Sea Jobs Service, launching in 2026, will provide career transition support for oil and gas workers into clean energy, defence and manufacturing, building on the expanded Energy Skills Passport and £20 million UK/Scottish funding from the Aberdeen pilot. A minister-led North Sea Future Board, with industry and union representation, will oversee coordination, alongside a five-year basin-wide supply chain plan and a Fair Work Charter standardising employment rights across sectors.

Investment in clean energy infrastructure: The plan sits alongside substantial government investment commitments, specifically across offshore wind, CCUS and hydrogen. The government intends to develop a comprehensive guidance package for supply chain businesses and improve certainty for investors.

As next steps, the government will launch a new minister-led delivery board of experts from across the industry and trade unions, who will meet regularly to oversee the progress, coordination and long-term planning of the North Sea's industrial transition.

Government publishes response to consultation on Climate Change Levy costs for low-carbon electrolytic hydrogen

The government has published its response to the consultation on the proposal for CCL no longer to be charged on electricity used in the electrolytic process for the production of green hydrogen. The existing CCL application to hydrogen provides ""green"" hydrogen (that which is electrolysed using renewable energy) less favourable treatment than ""grey"" or ""blue"" hydrogen (which uses steam reformation from natural gas) which already benefited from an exemption from the CCL. As previously reported, the government had therefore committed in this year's Spring Statement to remove the costs from green hydrogen production and this consultation was to consider the most appropriate legislative route to doing so.

The consultation response confirms that the government will proceed with its proposal to add electricity used in electrolysis to produce hydrogen to CCL's ""non-fuel use"" exemption. As this exemption is designed to only exempt ""non-fuel"" uses, only electricity used in the electrolysis process itself will be eligible for relief.

Despite suggestion in the original consultation that the selection of this approach could see changes implemented by the end of 2025, the response paper confirms that the changes will be implemented by spring 2026.

Opportunity Scaling with Next-Generation Geothermal Technologies One of the most promising growth opportunities for geothermal power generation lies in next-generation technologies that could massively expand where geothermal plants can be built.","Report Overview

The Global Geothermal Power Generation Market size is expected to be worth around USD 20.4 Billion by 2034, from USD 9.2 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 8.3% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, Asia-Pacific held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 38.6% share, holding USD 3.5 Billion revenue.

Geothermal power generation refers to producing electricity from heat stored beneath the earth’s surface, typically via dry steam, flash steam or binary-cycle plants. It offers firm, low-carbon baseload power with a very small land footprint, so it plays a strategic role alongside variable renewables like wind and solar in long-term decarbonisation plans. However, it remains a niche technology in today’s power mix, concentrated in a limited number of countries with high-quality resources.

On the supply side, global geothermal power capacity is still modest. REN21 estimates that only about 14.8 GW of geothermal power capacity was operating worldwide in 2023, after just 0.1 GW of new additions that year. IRENA likewise reports that geothermal electricity capacity has grown at around 3.5% per year since 2000 to roughly 16 GW in 2021, yet this represents only about 0.5% of total installed renewable electricity capacity. In terms of output, the U.S. EIA notes that 24 countries generated about 92 billion kWh of geothermal electricity in 2022.

Despite its small scale, geothermal is important in several national systems. In 2022, Indonesia produced around 17 billion kWh of geothermal power, equal to roughly 5% of its total electricity, while Kenya generated about 5 billion kWh, meeting approximately 45% of its annual electricity demand from geothermal plants. Governments are pushing to expand this role: Indonesia’s power development plan targets roughly 5.2 GW of geothermal capacity by 2034, implying a near-doubling from current levels, alongside a specific goal to add 3.3 GW of new geothermal capacity by 2030.

Several structural drivers underpin the industry. Geothermal plants provide 24/7 low-emission power with very low direct CO₂ emissions, and global net-zero scenarios assume a much larger contribution from such firm clean sources. The IEA’s Net Zero pathway projects that clean energy investment overall must rise to about USD 4 trillion per year by 2030, more than triple today’s levels, with geothermal among the technologies expected to scale in suitable regions. In parallel, geothermal already accounts for less than 1% of global electricity, highlighting a large untapped technical resource.

Cost trends are becoming more favorable. IRENA’s latest cost assessment finds that the global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for geothermal fell by about 16% in 2024, from roughly USD 0.072/kWh to USD 0.060/kWh, narrowing the gap with other mature renewables and remaining within a relatively stable range over the last five years.

Asia-Pacific region accounted for 38.6% of the global geothermal power market, representing approximately USD 3.5 billion.

By Component Analysis

Turbine leads with 34.8% — driven by its central role in energy conversion and operational reliability.

In 2024, Turbine held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 34.8% share, as turbines continued to be recognised as the principal component converting geothermal steam and fluid enthalpy into usable electrical power. Investment and maintenance emphasis was placed on turbine efficiency and materials that withstand corrosive geothermal fluids, and incremental design improvements were implemented to raise thermal-to-electric conversion rates while lowering downtime.

Suppliers and plant operators prioritised turbomachinery upgrades and balance-of-plant integration to secure predictable output and extend operating life, which reinforced the turbine segment’s market lead. In 2025, the turbine component remained a focal point for capital expenditure and performance optimisation, with engineered upgrades and retrofits being pursued to improve reliability and reduce levelised cost of electricity — actions that are expected to sustain the turbine’s influential position within geothermal power systems.

By Type Analysis

Flash Steam leads with 47.6% — favoured for high-energy output from deep, high-temperature reservoirs.

In 2024, Flash Steam held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 47.6% share, as developers and utilities continued to select this type for reservoirs with high enthalpy and abundant steam supply. The technology’s ability to convert high-temperature, high-pressure fluid into steam for direct turbine driving delivers strong power density per well and predictable baseload output, which reduces the number of wells required for a given capacity and improves project economics.

Plant designers and operators have prioritised flash systems where reservoir conditions permit, because installation and commissioning timelines are well understood and retrofit paths exist for many legacy fields. Into 2025, flash steam is expected to retain its lead as new high-enthalpy projects and targeted retrofits proceed, supported by ongoing improvements in corrosion-resistant materials, turbine efficiency and balance-of-plant integration that together lower operational risk and enhance long-term asset value.

By Power Plant Size Analysis

Large-scale plants lead with 59.2% — driven by economies of scale and stronger grid integration.

In 2024, Large-scale Plants held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 59.2% share, as utility-grade geothermal installations continued to be preferred for bulk power delivery and long-term capacity planning. Project developers and system owners favoured large plants because they allow cost dilution across higher output, enable more attractive financing through predictable revenue streams, and simplify grid interconnection compared with many small, distributed units.

Investment was concentrated in steam-dominant and high-enthalpy fields where a single large plant can deliver baseload power with lower levelised cost of electricity; engineering effort was therefore directed toward optimized wellfield layouts, turbine selection and corrosion-resistant materials to secure long plant life and steady availability. Policy support and utility procurement practices that prioritise firm, dispatchable renewable capacity further reinforced large-plant economics in 2024. Into 2025, deployment activity was expected to remain skewed toward large-scale projects where resource quality and transmission access permit, while modular and small-scale solutions continued to be used selectively for remote or constrained sites.

By Site Analysis

Onshore dominates with 92.4% due to easier resource access and lower project risk.

In 2024, Onshore held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 92.4% share, as most geothermal power generation continued to rely on well-mapped, land-based reservoirs that offer predictable drilling conditions and lower development costs. Onshore sites were preferred because they provide stable geological profiles, faster permitting timelines, and easier integration with existing transmission networks, which collectively reduce overall project risk. Most global capacity additions in 2024 were directed toward high-potential volcanic belts and sedimentary basins where drilling depths remain manageable and well productivity supports long-term baseload output.

In 2025, the onshore segment is expected to maintain its lead as governments and utilities continue prioritising firm renewable power, and as ongoing investment focuses on resource expansion, wellfield optimization, and improved drilling efficiency. While offshore geothermal exploration is gradually advancing, its share remains minimal due to uncertainties related to seabed geology, high capital intensity, and complex environmental approvals. The overall market structure therefore remains firmly anchored in onshore development, which continues to provide the most reliable, economically feasible, and technically mature pathway for geothermal power generation.

By Deployment Type Analysis

New deployments dominate with 67.3% due to active project pipelines and policy backing.

In 2024, New Deployments held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 67.3% share, as capital was primarily allocated to greenfield geothermal projects and new wellfield development rather than to retrofits or expansions of existing plants. This preference was driven by pipeline economics, where fresh resource development offered clearer capacity additions per well and more attractive long-term returns for investors; permitting and financing frameworks in several markets were aligned to support new builds, and developers were incentivised to secure first-mover sites with high enthalpy potential.

Project delivery was focused on front-end engineering, drilling campaigns and turbine procurement, while risk-mitigation efforts such as detailed reservoir characterisation and staged drilling strategies were implemented to protect investment. In 2025, new-build activity was expected to remain the primary growth driver, with continued allocation of industry capex toward site development and early-stage project execution.

By Industry Verticals Analysis

Industrial leads with 49.1% — driven by steady on-site energy needs and process heat demand.

In 2024, Industrial held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 49.1% share, as geothermal power solutions were primarily adopted by industrial operators requiring reliable baseload power and low-cost heat for processes such as manufacturing, food processing, and mineral treatment. Large consumers favoured geothermal because it provided consistent output, reduced exposure to fuel price volatility, and delivered combined heat-and-power benefits that improved overall site economics; as a result, capital was directed toward integrated plant solutions and long-term offtake arrangements that lowered levelised energy costs and supported financing.

During 2024–2025, deployment activity for industrial applications was sustained by policy incentives for decarbonisation, increased corporate commitments to lower scope-2 emissions, and technology improvements that reduced drilling and balance-of-plant risk. Consequently, interest from heavy energy users and cluster developments was reinforced, with system designs increasingly tailored to deliver both electricity and process heat at required temperature ranges. Overall, the industrial vertical remained the principal demand centre for geothermal power, driven by operational stability, fuel-cost savings and the capacity to substitute fossil-fuel heat with low-emission geothermal energy.

Emerging Trends

Rising Capacity Additions and Broader Use

One of the most noteworthy recent trends in geothermal power generation is the uptick in global capacity additions and the growing ambition to use geothermal for both electricity and heat. According to the IEA’s “The Future of Geothermal Energy” report, by the end of 2024 global geothermal capacity reached roughly 15.1 GW, helped by a surge in new installations — at least 400 MW was added in 2024 alone.

This trend reflects a shift: geothermal is no longer just a niche source for a few active volcanic regions — it’s emerging as a cleaner, stable option for more countries. Because geothermal plants deliver steady, around-the-clock output, they offer what other renewables struggle with: firm, dispatchable power. The IEA notes that geothermal capacity utilization rates have exceeded 75% in 2023, much higher than typical wind or solar installations.

What makes this trend heartening is that improving technology and policy support are helping overcome past limitations. The IEA highlights advances in “next-generation geothermal” — for example, engineered deep systems that can tap heat from deep rock layers rather than naturally hot aquifers — opening geothermal’s reach to many areas previously considered unsuitable.

For countries thinking long-term about clean and reliable power, this renewed interest in geothermal means opportunities: not just in new build-outs, but also in integrating geothermal heat for industry and buildings, improving energy security, and reducing carbon emissions. If the momentum continues, geothermal may increasingly become part of the backbone of stable, renewable-heavy power systems worldwide — not just a small add-on.a

Drivers

Rising Need for 24/7 Clean Electricity Drives Geothermal Power Growth

One of the strongest driving factors for geothermal power generation is the global push for reliable, round-the-clock clean electricity. Unlike solar or wind, geothermal plants operate continuously, making them highly valuable for stabilizing power grids while cutting emissions. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), geothermal plants typically operate at capacity factors above 70%, compared with about 25% for solar and 35% for wind, highlighting their baseload advantage.

Governments are increasingly recognizing this value as electricity demand rises from electrification of transport, heating, and industry. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that global electricity demand grew by about 2.4% in 2023 and is expected to accelerate further as electric vehicles and heat pumps expand. This growth creates pressure on grids to add clean power sources that are not dependent on weather, directly supporting geothermal deployment in suitable regions.

National energy strategies clearly reflect this shift. The U.S. Department of Energy announced in 2023 a funding program of USD 60 million specifically for enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), aiming to unlock geothermal resources beyond traditional volcanic areas. The DOE estimates that EGS alone could support up to 90 GW of U.S. geothermal capacity by 2050, enough to power tens of millions of homes while maintaining grid reliability.

Developing economies also view geothermal as an energy-security solution. Kenya’s Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority reports that geothermal already supplies about 45% of the country’s electricity, reducing dependence on hydropower that is vulnerable to drought. This reliability has helped Kenya avoid power shortages during dry seasons and stabilize household electricity prices.

Restraints

High Upfront Drilling Risk and Capital Cost Limit Large-Scale Adoption

The biggest restraining factor for geothermal power generation is the high upfront cost and financial risk linked to exploration and drilling. Unlike solar or wind projects, geothermal plants must confirm underground heat resources before power generation begins. This requires deep drilling, which is expensive and uncertain. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) states that exploration and drilling alone can account for 30% to 50% of total project capital costs, even before a single unit of electricity is produced.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), around 20–25% of exploratory geothermal wells globally fail to deliver commercially usable heat or flow rates. These failed wells generate no return, yet their full drilling cost must still be absorbed, making financiers cautious about funding early-stage geothermal projects.

Capital intensity further slows projects in emerging economies. The World Bank estimates that developing a single geothermal well can cost between USD 3 million and USD 10 million, depending on depth and location. For a typical commercial plant requiring multiple wells, upfront investment quickly rises above USD 100 million, which is challenging for countries with limited access to low-cost financing.

Governments are trying to reduce this barrier, but progress is gradual. The U.S. Department of Energy notes that drilling costs have declined only about 10–15% over the past decade, far slower than the rapid cost reductions seen in solar or wind technologies. This slower learning curve limits geothermal’s competitiveness in energy auctions focused mainly on lowest upfront price.

In developing regions, public risk-sharing mechanisms are essential but still limited. The World Bank’s Global Geothermal Development Plan has mobilized about USD 200 million for risk‐mitigation funding since launch, yet this covers only a fraction of global project pipelines.

Opportunity

Scaling with Next-Generation Geothermal Technologies

One of the most promising growth opportunities for geothermal power generation lies in next-generation technologies that could massively expand where geothermal plants can be built. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if technological improvements continue and costs are brought down, geothermal could supply as much as 800 GW of global capacity by 2050 — a huge jump from today’s roughly 15–16 GW.

That kind of capacity could meet up to 15% of global electricity demand growth between now and 2050. Such growth would transform geothermal from a niche, regional energy source into a central backbone of clean energy systems worldwide — offering stable, low-emission baseload power alongside solar and wind.

This opportunity is especially significant for regions with limited surface-level geothermal resources today. With “enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) and advanced drilling, even areas without classic volcanic or high-enthalpy geology could tap deep heat reservoirs. The IEA notes that harnessing only a small fraction of global geothermal potential — including these unconventional resources — could transform energy access in many developing regions.

On the policy side, several governments are beginning to support geothermal through incentive programmes, funding for demonstration projects, and streamlined regulation — making the economics more favourable for new entrants. As policy and technology align, geothermal could emerge as a core component of clean-energy transformation across many parts of the world.

Regional Insights

Asia Pacific leads with 38.6% — valued at USD 3.5 billion, driven by rich geothermal resources and rapid project development.

In 2024, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 38.6% of the global geothermal power market, representing approximately USD 3.5 billion, a position supported by large resource endowments in Indonesia, the Philippines and emerging projects in Southeast Asia and East Asia. The region’s share reflects both sizeable installed capacity and an active pipeline: global geothermal capacity approached ~15 GW by 2023, with Asia-Pacific nations contributing a material portion of recent additions and pipeline projects.

Technology improvements—better corrosion-resistant materials, modern turbines and enhanced geothermal system (EGS) pilots—have raised plant load factors and lowered levelised costs, improving the economics of both flash and binary plants across varied reservoir types in the region.

From an event hall in Bozeman, Montana, a small city in the American Midwest, Gov. Jenniffer González said in mid-October that “Puerto Rico should be the showcase of how American Energy Dominance can be [done].”

She was referring to President Donald Trump’s energy policy, which seeks to position the United States as the global leader in energy exports, driven by fossil fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, an option González had publicly dismissed just a month earlier.

Beyond the political alignment already visible between Trump and González Colón, some argue that Trump’s energy agenda for Puerto Rico should be even more expansive.

In an opinion column published in August, Justin Peterson, a Washington, D.C. lobbyist close to Trump and a former member of Puerto Rico’s Fiscal Control Board, proposed that the federal government take charge of privatizing and rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power system, anchored in natural gas and nuclear energy.

“The Presidential Council for Energy Dominance and the Department of Energy should lead this effort, working with a potentially reconstituted [Board],” Peterson wrote, after the White House removed five of the Board’s seven members in August.

The Centro de Periodismo Investigativo (CPI) asked La Fortaleza whether González Colón’s support for Trump’s energy agenda, as she stated in Montana, also extends to Peterson’s proposal.

“We respect Mr. Peterson’s opinion. He’s no longer part of the Board. He’s not an elected official. Obviously, as a colony, there are many people who like everything to be federalized,” said Jean Peña Payano, a legislative adviser to the Governor.

According to him, the González administration will pursue anything that helps achieve “energy relief and getting LUMA out.”

“If that includes [implementing Trump’s energy policy], we’ll gladly do it,” he added.

The CPI reached out, through a White House spokesperson, to the National Energy Dominance Council, a new executive office created by Trump to facilitate and accelerate projects aligned with this vision, but received no response.

Under the banner of “energy dominance,” Trump rolled back environmental regulations and sped up permit approvals for activities related to the extraction and export of fossil fuels, nonrenewable energy sources. In a recent proclamation declaring October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month, Trump said that “three simple words” define America’s energy future: “Drill, baby, drill.”

Although “American Energy Dominance” has barely been discussed in Puerto Rico, the González administration has been implementing Trump’s energy agenda almost verbatim.

During her appearance at the Big Sky, Bright Future Economic Summit, a forum hosted by Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, the Governor boasted that extending the life of the AES coal plant until 2032. The facility had been scheduled to shut down next year. She criticized the Biden administration’s strategy of prioritizing federal funds for renewable energy projects and pointed to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, as the main obstacle to lowering energy costs.

She also highlighted her first law in office, which eliminated the intermediate benchmarks established years ago requiring Puerto Rico to reach 100% renewable energy by 2050.

But if anything was unmistakable during her participation, it was her embrace of U.S.-sourced liquefied natural gas (LNG) as Puerto Rico’s primary energy source.

“I believe in American LNG,” González said repeatedly while discussing the $4 billion contract she signed with New Fortress Energy (NFE) to supply natural gas for seven years, a deal that had, until then, been rejected by the Fiscal Control Board.

On Friday, Nov. 28, the Board announced it had approved the NFE contract, but warned that even with the revisions made to the agreement, the company would retain a monopoly over the supply of that fuel at the Port of San Juan.

“This lack of competition affects the reliability of the energy system, prices, and Puerto Rico’s overall economic competitiveness,” the Board said.

Puerto Rico bets on gas again

This is not the first time Puerto Rico has pinned its hopes on natural gas. Over the past 20 years, governors from both major political parties have promoted the use of this fossil fuel under the premise that it would lower energy costs on the island.

Under former Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, construction began on the ill-fated “southern gas pipeline,” intended to transport gas from Peñuelas to Salinas. Then came Gov. Luis Fortuño, who also failed in his attempt to build the “northern gas pipeline,” known as Vía Verde, designed to move gas from the island’s south to its north. In the 2014 energy reform signed by Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, natural gas was framed as a “transition” fuel on the way toward renewable energy.

During the Ricardo Rosselló administration, two years after the cancellation of the Aguirre Offshore GasPort project in 2017, NFE arrived as the main gas supplier and to build a new receiving terminal. Its inauguration was celebrated in 2020 by then-Gov. Wanda Vázquez. And in his final week in office, Pedro Pierluisi laid the foundation stone for the new gas-fired plant now under construction in San Juan by the Energiza consortium.

But the Governor’s plans for natural gas, including the new contract with NFE, tie Puerto Rico’s energy future to this fossil fuel, placing the island’s goal of reaching 100% renewable energy by 2050 at risk.

In addition, the generation projects announced by her administration would result in an energy surplus in Puerto Rico, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), and would drive up electricity costs.

Of the 1,200 megawatts the Governor claims to have added to the grid in the past 10 months “just by fixing old plants,” nearly half relies on natural gas. And although the Energiza plant was initiated under former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, González has continued its construction; it would add 450 megawatts powered by liquefied natural gas. Fourteen emergency generators left behind by FEMA also run on this fossil fuel. Meanwhile, the private operator Genera PR, which manages the former Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority generation fleet, is pursuing projects to convert most of those plants to natural gas.

This administration also approved three new generation projects in October that would collectively add 800 megawatts, primarily through diesel. That same month, the Government released a new request for proposals for up to 3,000 megawatts of additional generation.

“If these plans materialize, Puerto Rico will have far more capacity than it needs, and this problem will only worsen in the future as residents and businesses continue adopting rooftop solar with battery storage,” said Cathy Kunkel, an Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) consultant.

Those who remain connected to the centralized power system would face higher electricity costs because of these inefficiencies.

To supply nearly 100% of the natural gas the island needs, the González administration selected NFE, the parent company of Genera PR.

“What I did over the summer is that I renegotiated a deal to bring more LNG to the island, because we need to move forward from petroleum, and I cut from $20 billion to $4 billion a contract of LNG for the island and I’ve been waiting since June to get it approved by this federal board. […] I believe in American LNG,” González said in Montana.

The Governor was referring to the Fiscal Control Board. However, she did not clarify that her administration had tried unsuccessfully to execute the same contract, at 15 years and $20 billion. At the time, the Board rejected the agreement, noting that it would establish a monopoly over fuel supply, among other concerns.

In September, a renegotiated version of the contract was announced, this time for seven years and $4 billion. Although González claimed her administration removed a clause preventing another supplier from entering the market if NFE failed to meet its obligations, the Board raised new objections in October regarding the contract’s language.

Late Friday night, the Fiscal Control Board announced its conditional approval of the contract, requiring revisions to a separate agreement between NFE and the Government that governs the entry of other gas suppliers into the Port of San Juan if NFE is unable to do so.

Regarding this deal, IEEFA warned that, in addition to the possibility that Puerto Rico may end up buying more gas than it needs, the Government would remain tied to a company facing serious financial troubles.

As the CPI revealed in 2022, NFE has repeatedly failed to deliver natural gas as agreed, forcing the Government to purchase diesel, a more expensive fuel whose cost is passed directly to customers through higher electricity bills.

As part of its approval of the NFE contract, the Board required the Government to prepare “an evaluation of the amounts that should be returned to the people of Puerto Rico to compensate for diesel expenses incurred as a result of NFE’s delivery failures under existing contracts.”

This report must be submitted no later than March of next year.

Energy Dominance Council

Trump created the National Energy Dominance Council in February through an executive order. The Council is led by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and its mission is to fast-track projects that “help America at home, help us sell energy overseas,” explained Executive Director Jarrod Agen in an interview.

Agen, who also advises Burgum and previously served as communications director for Vice President Mike Pence, said the Council works with the oil, gas, and mining sectors to advance projects that, in his view, have been stuck in permitting processes for years.

“We’ve been very effective — because we didn’t bring in a bunch of academics. We took people directly from industry in particular areas — oil and gas, coal, mining, and nuclear. And so, we have a very small team. It’s a start-up within the White House,” Agen said in September.

Trump also canceled renewable energy programs funded with federal dollars, some of which were intended for solar and battery projects in Puerto Rico, eliminated restrictions on oil burning, and opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to fossil fuel exploration.

The measures taken by Trump have largely benefited the oil and gas industry, which financially supported his 2024 presidential campaign. One of the key figures behind shaping Trump’s energy agenda was Burgum, who pledged at campaign events that the president would halt “the hostile attack on American energy,” The Washington Post reported.

As early as February, González posted a photo of a meeting with Burgum at the White House, where they discussed “energy and permitting matters for Puerto Rico,” according to her social media post.

Meanwhile, the González administration has hired at least three lobbying firms for $1.5 million to position itself in federal discussions on Capitol Hill and at the White House about energy policy.

One of these firms is Navigators Global, through which the Puerto Rico Government has monitored the implementation of Trump’s energy agenda, according to invoices obtained by the CPI through a public records request.

In March, for example, Navigators’ lobbyists reported that they “flagged comments by Secretary of Energy Wright regarding Puerto Rico’s energy system, identifying opportunities for strategic follow-up,” while in April they closely tracked congressional discussions about vulnerabilities in the U.S. electrical grid with the goal of “elevating the urgency of modernizing Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure.”

The invoices also describe coordinated meetings with members of Congress and White House officials. Among the lawmakers most frequently mentioned is Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

Senator Lee is not a newcomer to Puerto Rico’s energy affairs. In 2019, the CPI revealed emails showing that before the Government announced its intention to privatize the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority that same year, and before LUMA Energy arrived in 2021, Lee had quietly promoted, through communications with the Fiscal Control Board, a proposal to privatize the public corporation through federal legislation.

At least since last March, the González administration’s lobbyists have sought to establish a direct line to Lee’s office.

The March invoice submitted by Navigators notes that the firm coordinated with Spencer Stokes, a Utah lobbyist who served as Lee’s chief of staff more than 12 years ago, “to ensure continued follow-up and scheduling of a meeting between Chairman Lee and Governor Gonzalez.”

In April, Navigators reported coordinating a meeting between Puerto Rico’s Federal Affairs Administration and a staff member in Lee’s office “who agreed to assess the possibility of a congressional delegation visit to Puerto Rico focused on energy resiliency.” The lobbyists then followed up “to confirm interest in scheduling a direct meeting with Governor González-Colón and to coordinate staff-level engagement on upcoming territorial hearings.”

Another meeting arranged by Navigators on energy issues involved Wendy Baig, the director of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and an adviser to Sen. Lee, to “explore legislative avenues related to Puerto Rico’s energy resiliency and infrastructure modernization.”

Governor’s double message on renewable energy

During her appearance in Montana, González said the Biden administration used Puerto Rico, and the nearly $18 billion in federal funds she claims to have secured for the electric grid while she was Resident Commissioner, as a “laboratory” for renewable energy.

She noted that she is still waiting for the delivery of storage batteries that the Government purchased from Tesla for $750 million, suggesting that they are not a short-term solution. She also said her administration used $365 million in federal funds allocated to a solar energy program to carry out repairs at power plants that would add 400 megawatts of capacity.

“In the last four years, it was Washington dictating what the island needs. And what happened [is] they decided to have Puerto Rico as a laboratory for renewable, solar panels, batteries. And I don’t have anything against that. But you cannot run an island, businesses, manufacturing and hospitals, 24/7 with batteries,” González said.

However, Puerto Rico is home to manufacturers such as Eaton and Medtronic and pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Eli Lilly, whose plants are partially powered by solar and battery systems, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Two weeks later, at the Solar and Energy Storage Association (SESA) conference in San Juan, the Governor struck a different tone when talking about renewable energy.

“From the Tesla Megapack battery project to the accelerated approval of renewable energy under Executive Order 2025-047, we are working hand in hand with organizations like SESA to achieve our shared goal of delivering real progress for our people with a new grid operator,” read the statement La Fortaleza sent to the press.

The Governor’s shifting rhetoric on energy may reflect the Trump administration’s softened stance toward renewables, according to former Popular Democratic Party Sen. Eduardo Bhatia, now a public policy professor at Princeton University, who led the 2014 energy reform as Senate president.

“The biggest challenge the Governor has faced is trying to decipher Trump’s Department of Energy,” Bhatia told the CPI.

“I think the Governor has been very careful not to cross a line,” he added.

Beyond González Colón’s statements about American energy dominance and the solar industry, her administration’s actions point in a clear direction: liquefied natural gas.

Even before taking office, González appointed Josué Colón as her “Energy Czar,” a new role with authority to oversee, coordinate, and monitor the reconstruction and modernization of the electric system, according to the announcement of his appointment. Colón began steering the system toward natural gas nearly 15 years ago, when he served as generation director at the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority during the Luis Fortuño administration. In 2021, he returned as the public corporation’s executive director, and under his leadership, PREPA handed over the operation of most of its generation fleet to Genera in 2023.

Like the Governor, the so-called Energy Czar believes natural gas should be Puerto Rico’s primary power source. Colón has argued that solar energy is not “cost-efficient” for most residents and that, to carry out González Colón’s public policy of making U.S. natural gas the island’s main energy source, Puerto Rico would need to build gas pipelines, which he describes as the “most efficient, safest, and most cost-effective” way to transport the fuel.

“And the public needs to understand that,” he said in June during a luncheon hosted by the United Retailers Association (CUD, in Spanish).

Hours later, at a press conference where the Energy Czar was also present, the Governor denied that her administration had any plans to build gas pipelines.

For Bhatia, the issue represents “a major political problem,” considering that Puerto Rico has no political or social appetite for such projects.

The first bill González submitted to the Legislature as governor — and the first to become law — eliminated the intermediate benchmarks established under Energy Public Policy Law Act 14, which mandates that 100% of Puerto Rico’s energy come from renewable sources by or before 2050. According to her, this action opened the door to using liquefied natural gas as a “transition” fuel, even though LNG had already been part of the island’s energy policy since 2014.

“What she did amend [from the energy reform] was the use of coal. That was supposed to end by 2027, and she pushed it [to 2032],” Bhatia said, referring to the AES coal plant.

When the Montana event opened to audience questions, there was only one, from a man who said he had friends in Puerto Rico “because it’s a tax haven,” who asked: “Why doesn’t Puerto Rico build a port for natural gas traffic? Has it considered that?”

“Of course. And that’s what we all want. And we’re on the same page. I was criticized during the campaign because I was the only one calling about using American LNG. How are we the main [LNG] provider for many countries and we cannot do that in our territory?” the Governor replied, referring to the possibility of increasing Puerto Rico’s consumption of U.S.-produced liquefied natural gas.

“I’m looking for two things: switching from 62% petroleum to LNG. And the second one is literally changing the operator of the transmission system [LUMA],” she said.",https://newsismybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Montana-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:13.937351

Deaths have topped 1,200 across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, with more than 800 still missing in floods and landslides. In Indonesia, entire villages remain cut off after bridges and roads were swept away. Thousands in Sri Lanka lack clean water, while Thailand’s prime minister acknowledged shortcomings in his government’s response.

Malaysia is still reeling from one its worst floods, which killed three and displaced thousands. Meanwhile, Vietnam and the Philippines have faced a year of punishing storms and floods that have left hundreds dead.

What feels unprecedented is exactly what climate scientists expect: A new normal of punishing storms, floods and devastation.

“Southeast Asia should brace for a likely continuation and potential worsening of extreme weather in 2026 and for many years immediately following that,” said Jemilah Mahmood, who leads the think tank Sunway Centre for Planetary Health in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Asia is facing the full force of the climate crisis

Climate patterns last year helped set the stage for 2025’s extreme weather.

Atmospheric levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide jumped by the most on record in 2024. That “turbocharged” the climate, the United Nation’s World Meteorological Organization says, resulting in more extreme weather.

Asia is bearing the brunt of such changes, warming nearly twice as fast as the global average. Scientists agree that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events are increasing.

Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for storms, making them stronger and wetter, while rising sea levels amplify storm surges, said Benjamin Horton, a professor of earth science at the City University of Hong Kong.

Storms are arriving later in the year, one after another as climate change affects air and ocean currents, including systems like El Nino, which keeps ocean waters warmer for longer and extends the typhoon season. With more moisture in the air and changes in wind patterns, storms can form quickly.

“While the total number of storms may not dramatically increase, their severity and unpredictability will,” Horton said.

Governments were unprepared

The unpredictability, intensity, and frequency of recent extreme weather events are overwhelming Southeast Asian governments, said Aslam Perwaiz of the Bangkok-based intergovernmental Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. He attributes that to a tendency to focus on responding to disasters rather than preparing for them.

“Future disasters will give us even less lead time to prepare,” Perwaiz warned.

In Sri Lanka’s hardest-hit provinces, little has changed since 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, said Sarala Emmanuel, a human-rights researcher in Batticaloa. It killed 230,000 people.

“When a disaster like this happens, the poor and marginalized communities are the worst affected,” Emmanuel said. That includes poor tea plantation workers living in areas prone to landslides.

Unregulated development that damages local ecosystems has worsened flood damage, said Sandun Thudugala of the Colombo-based non-profit Law and Society Trust. Sri Lanka needs to rethink how it builds and plans, he said, taking into account a future where extreme weather is the norm.

Videos of logs swept downstream in Indonesia suggested deforestation may have made the floods worse. Since 2000, the flood-inundated Indonesian provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have lost 19,600 square kilometers (7,569 square miles) of forest, an area larger than the state of New Jersey, according to Global Forest Watch.

Officials rejected claims of illegal logging, saying the timber looked old and probably came from landholders.

Billions are lost, while climate finance is limited

Countries are losing billions of dollars a year because of climate change.

Vietnam estimates that it lost over $3 billion in the first 11 months of this year because of floods, landslides and storms.

Thailand’s government data is fragmented, but its agriculture ministry estimates about $47 million in agricultural losses since August. The Kasikorn Research Center estimates the November floods in southern Thailand alone caused about $781 million in losses, potentially shaving off 0.1% of GDP.

Indonesia doesn’t have data for losses for this year but its annual average losses from natural disasters are $1.37 billion, its finance ministry says.

Costs from disasters are an added burden for Sri Lanka, which contributes a tiny fraction of global carbon emissions but is at the frontline of climate impacts, while it spends most of its wealth to repay foreign loans, said Thudugala.

“There is also an urgent need for vulnerable countries like ours to get compensated for loss and damages we suffer because of global warming,” Thudugala said.

“My request … is support to recover some of the losses we have suffered,” said Rohan Wickramarachchi, owner of a commercial building in the central Sri Lankan town of Peradeniya that was flooded to its second floor. He and dozens of other families he knows must now start over.

Responding to increasingly desperate calls for help, at the COP30 global climate conference last month in Brazil, countries pledged to triple funding for climate adaptation and make $1.3 trillion in annual climate financing available by 2035. That’s still woefully short of what developing nations requested, and it’s unclear if those funds will actually materialize.

Southeast Asia is at a crossroads for climate action, said Thomas Houlie of the science and policy institute, Climate Analytics. The region is expanding use of renewable energy but still reliant on fossil fuels.

“What we’re seeing in the region is dramatic and it’s unfortunately a stark reminder of the consequences of the climate crisis,” Houlie said.

Colorado and the nation face increasing energy demands and critical mineral supply needs. These pressures are amplified by population growth, energy-intensive artificial intelligence, a shrinking energy supply portfolio, and geopolitical challenges that have fundamentally altered historical supply chains. In Colorado specifically, approximately a quarter of our electric energy is supplied by coal.

However, public policy decisions will result in this supply largely going offline during the next five years as a result of premature coal fleet retirements. The already significant gap left by these retirements has been made even more challenging by the rise of AI technology expected to increase energy consumption by 6.7% to 12% by 2028, according to a Department of Energy report. At the same time, critical minerals supply chains for advanced technologies used in defense applications, renewable energy and electric-vehicle batteries have become constrained by China, which has a near 90% monopoly on the critical minerals market.

It’s becoming increasingly apparent our energy portfolio must include carbon-free nuclear energy, and our minerals supplies must be sourced domestically with the highest environmental standards, rather than from unreliable adversarial nations with little to no environmental protections. In 2024, federal legislation was enacted banning the import of Russian Uranium and the current administration took decisive action issuing executive orders earlier this year to better coordinate the review process for domestic minerals projects. The U.S. Geological Survey also designated uranium as a critical mineral, and in May of last year Coloradans of both parties came together to enact legislation defining nuclear energy as a clean-energy source for municipal financing purposes and to count toward Colorado’s statutory carbon emissions reduction goals.

Colorado is well positioned to play a leading role in sustainably sourced critical minerals production and has some of the nation’s richest reserves of uranium, the supply source for nuclear energy, and vanadium used in high-strength alloys. However, our ability to meet these supply needs is directly challenged by new county regulatory proposals that would conflict with existing requirements already administered by the Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety (DRMS), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Specifically, San Miguel County on Colorado’s western slope has been promoting a regulatory framework to establish the nation’s first county-level comprehensive mining and reclamation program.

This is problematic for a number of reasons, beginning with the fact under Colorado Law, DRMS has the exclusive authority to regulate mining and reclamation in the state. Similarly, Bureau of Land Management regulates mining operations on Federal Public Lands, and the DOE administers specific uranium leases under its authority. These regulatory entities have decades of experience and highly qualified staff to ensure Colorado’s mining and reclamation operations are among the safest and most environmentally sound anywhere in the world.

San Miguel County’s “purposely duplicative” proposal would complicate program administration, allow for a county-level veto of state and federally granted permits, and interfere with vested mineral rights, all without any added measure of environmental protection. Instead, the county proposal would drive away investment in sustainably sourced minerals and eliminate good paying jobs in the county’s west end, which widely supports new mining operations. A recent report by the Common Sense Institute found up to 170 permanent, good-paying jobs could be generated in the near future as a result of new mining activity in the area. Finalizing the county’s proposal would severely jeopardize this potential economic activity in rural Colorado communities.

The Colorado Mining Association has engaged with the county for almost a year in five Board of County Commissioners hearings and submitted detailed comments regarding industry concerns and how to address them. Most recently, CMA urged the county to work collaboratively with DRMS, BLM and DOE to make full use of the wide range of communication and coordination tools already available to ensure county concerns are heard and addressed in state and federal permits. DRMS, BLM and DOE have signaled their willingness to work with the county in this effort, rather than see the county move forward with a program inconsistent with state and federal law. CMA remains hopeful the county will consider working collaboratively with state and federal regulators to ensure the regulatory entities can continue implementation of Colorado’s world-class mining and reclamation standards without needless duplication and conflict that would impede clean-energy development, national security supply chains, rural jobs and county budgets.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/UraniumOpEdMug-Adam-Eckman.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 08:58:50.863092

Dec 2 (Reuters) – The U.S. Department of Energy said on Tuesday it will provide up to $800 million to support development of small modular reactors by the Tennessee Valley Authority and private company Holtec.

The Trump administration and nuclear companies believe SMRs will help supply electricity to the U.S. where power demand is rising for the first time in two decades on artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency mining and electric vehicles.

Backers say SMRs could save costs because they are expected to be built in factories. But no such reactors are under construction in the United States and questions exist about whether they can provide power as cheaply as today’s larger reactors. Nuclear power also creates long-lasting radioactive waste for which there is no permanent repository.

TVA, a U.S.-owned power utility, will receive up to $400 million in federal cost-shared funding for development of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River site in Tennessee and other projects, the Energy Department said.

Holtec, which will also receive up to $400 million, plans to build two SMRs at its Palisades, Michigan, site. Holtec is hoping to reopen the 800-megawatt Palisades conventional reactor this year, which shut in 2022 after operating for more than 50 years.

The plant secured a $1.52 billion loan guarantee during former President Joe Biden’s administration, and so far the Energy Department’s loan office has disbursed more than $490 million of the financing.

The Energy Department expects the SMRs to be developed by the early 2030s. “These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release.

Tesla has long established itself as the leader in self-driving technology, especially in the United States. Although there are formidable competitors, Tesla’s FSD suite is the most robust and is not limited to certain areas or roadways. It operates anywhere and everywhere.

The company’s current position as the leader in self-driving tech is being ignored by legacy automakers, a parallel to what Tesla’s position was with EV development over a decade ago, which was also ignored by competitors.

The reluctance mirrors how legacy automakers initially dismissed EVs, only to scramble in catch-up mode years later–a pattern that highlights their historical underestimation of disruptive innovations from Tesla.

Elon Musk’s Self-Driving Licensing Attempts

Musk and Tesla have tried to push Full Self-Driving to other car companies, with no true suitors, despite ongoing conversations for years. Tesla’s FSD is aiming to become more robust through comprehensive data collection and a larger fleet, something the company has tried to establish through a subscription program, free trials, and other strategies.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sends rivals dire warning about Full Self-Driving

However, competing companies have not wanted to license FSD for a handful of speculative reasons: competitive pride, regulatory concerns, high costs, or preference for in-house development.

Déjà vu All Over Again

Tesla tried to portray the importance of EVs long ago, as in the 2010s, executives from companies like Ford and GM downplayed the importance of sustainable powertrains as niche or unprofitable.

Musk once said in a 2014 interview that rivals woke up to electric powertrains when the Model S started to disrupt things and gained some market share. Things got really serious upon the launch of the Model 3 in 2017, as a mass-market vehicle was what Tesla was missing from its lineup.

This caused legacy companies to truly wake up; they were losing market share to Tesla’s new and exciting tech that offered less maintenance, a fresh take on passenger auto, and other advantages. They were late to the party, and although they have all launched vehicles of their own, they still lag in two major areas: sales and infrastructure, leaning on Tesla for the latter.

Musk’s past warnings have been plentiful. In 2017, he responded to critics who stated Tesla was chasing subsidies. He responded, “Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 and then crushed them in a junkyard,” adding that “they would be doing nothing” on EVs without Tesla’s efforts.

Companies laughed off Tesla’s prowess with EVs, only to realize they had made a grave mistake later on.

It looks to be happening once again.

A Pattern of Underestimation

Both EVs and self-driving tech represent major paradigm shifts that legacy players view as threats to their established business models; it’s hard to change. However, these early push-aways from new tech only result in reactive strategies later on, usually resulting in what pains they are facing now.

Ford is scaling back its EV efforts, and GM’s projects are hurting. Although they both have in-house self-driving projects, they are falling well behind the progress of Tesla and even other competitors.

It is getting to a point where short-term risk will become a long-term setback, and they may have to rely on a company to pull them out of a tough situation later on, just as it did with Tesla and EV charging infrastructure.

Tesla has continued to innovate, while legacy automakers have lagged behind, and it has cost them dearly.

Implications and Future Outlook

Moving forward, Tesla’s progress will continue to accelerate, while a dismissive attitude by other companies will continue to penalize them, especially as time goes on. Falling further behind in self-driving could eventually lead to market share erosion, as autonomy could be a crucial part of vehicle marketing within the next few years.

Eventually, companies could be forced into joint partnerships as economic pressures mount. Some companies did this with EVs, but it has not resulted in very much.

Self-driving efforts are not only a strength for companies themselves, but they also contribute to other things, like affordability and safety.

Tesla has exhibited data that specifically shows its self-driving tech is safer than human drivers, most recently by a considerable margin. This would help with eliminating accidents and making roads safer.

Tesla’s new Safety Report shows Autopilot is nine times safer than humans

Additionally, competition in the market is a good thing, as it drives costs down and helps innovation continue on an upward trend.

Conclusion

The parallels are unmistakable: a decade ago, legacy automakers laughed off electric vehicles as toys for tree-huggers, crushed their own EV programs, and bet everything on the internal-combustion status quo–only to watch Tesla redefine the industry while they scrambled for billions in catch-up capital.

Today, the same companies are turning down repeated offers to license Tesla’s Full Self-Driving technology, insisting they can build better autonomy in-house, even as their own programs stumble through recalls, layoffs, and missed milestones. History is not merely rhyming; it is repeating almost note-for-note.

Elon Musk has spent twenty years warning that the auto industry’s bureaucratic inertia and short-term thinking will leave it stranded on the wrong side of technological revolutions. The question is no longer whether Tesla is ahead–it is whether the giants of Detroit, Stuttgart, and Toyota will finally listen before the next wave leaves them watching another leader pull away in the rear-view mirror.

This time, the stakes are not just market share; they are the very definition of what a car will be in the decades ahead.

Elon Musk stated that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make traditional work unnecessary within two decades.

Speaking on entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath’s podcast, Musk predicted that machines will soon handle most forms of labor, leaving humans to work only if they choose to.

Work as a “hobby”

During the discussion, Musk said the accelerating capability of AI systems and general-purpose robots will eventually cover all essential tasks, making human labor a choice rather than an economic requirement. “In less than 20 years, working will be optional. Working at all will be optional. Like a hobby,” Musk said.

When Kamath asked whether this future is driven by massive productivity growth, Musk agreed, noting that people will still be free to work if they enjoy the routine or the challenge. He compared future employment to home gardening, as it is something people can still do for personal satisfaction even if buying food from a store is far easier.

“Optional” work in the future

Elon Musk acknowledged the boldness of his claim and joked that people might look back in 20 years and say he was wrong. That being said, the CEO noted that such a scenario could even happen sooner than his prediction, at least if one were to consider the pace of the advancements in AI and robotics.

“Obviously people can play this back in 20 years and say, ‘Look, Elon made this ridiculous prediction and it’s not true,’ but I think it will turn out to be true, that in less than 20 years, maybe even as little as ten or 15 years, the advancements in AI and robotics will bring us to the point where working is optional,” Musk said.

Elon Musk’s comments echo his previous sentiments at Tesla’s 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting, where he noted that Optimus could ultimately eliminate poverty. He also noted that robots like Optimus could eventually provide people worldwide with the best medical care.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tesla-fsd-v14-1-7-test-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:59:21.526119

As a matter of course, federal agencies make and implement regulatory policies with stakes for state, local, and tribal governments.

Agency consultation with state and local governments is broadly based on federalism values. The federal government’s obligation to consult with the governments of Indian tribes is grounded both in the unique government-to-government relationship between tribes and the United States and in the Indian trust responsibility, which requires the federal government to support tribal nations, including through Congress’s longstanding policy of promoting tribal self-government and economic development. As early as 1970, for example, President Richard Nixon sent a special message to Congress calling upon the federal government to “act on the basis of what the Indians have long been telling us.” Intergovernmental consultation may improve regulatory policymaking, strengthen relationships between governments, and recognize that those who are most affected should be involved in policymaking that will affect them.

For these reasons, many federal statutes, including the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, a federal statute that aims to identify and limit federal legislation that would impose unfunded mandates on state and local governments, and longstanding executive orders—including those on federalism, tribal consultation, and regulatory planning and review—direct agencies to consult when their policies have implications for state, local, and tribal governments. Although these statutes and executive orders have been on the books for decades, and many agencies have attempted to implement them, intergovernmental consultation too often becomes a “box-checking” exercise that does not improve policy or embody respect for state, local, and tribal governments or their constituencies.

The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) engaged us to study the legal frameworks and best practices for consultation among federal agencies and state, local, and tribal governments. ACUS’s prior recommendations on public engagement recognized the value of intergovernmental consultation but did not address the unique legal, political, and practical questions involved in this process.

We set out to understand what federal agencies are actually doing when consulting with other governments. This meant looking at agencies’ consultation policies—when they existed. It also required examining what agencies actually do when making, implementing, and consulting about regulatory policies. To these ends, we analyzed more than 20 published consultation policies and over 100 recent comments on agency consultation from the Federal Register and interviewed experts with experience in intergovernmental consultation, including representatives of federal, state, tribal, and local governments. We also took a close look at public statements on consultation from representative national organizations, such as the National Congress of American Indians, and compared our findings with those of other studies, including studies by the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Research Service. Prior work, we found, identified an overriding worry: that agencies approach consultation as a “box-checking” exercise and lack effective policies and structures to implement the executive orders requiring consultation.

One of our main findings was that agencies have developed formal policies to implement Executive Order 13,175, directing consultation with tribal governments, but not to implement Executive Order 13,132, directing consultation with state and local governments. Both the Obama Administration and the Biden Administration directed agencies to adopt tribal consultation policies and plans to implement Executive Order 13,175. Our analysis of 21 sample policies revealed important similarities and differences with respect to the definition of “tribal consultation,” the criteria for whether—and, if so, when—tribal consultation should occur, the process for consulting with tribal governments, the rules for handling and keeping confidential information shared during consultations, and the institutional structure within the agency that delegates responsibility for implementing the consultation policy. The most obvious differences stood between the policies of executive and independent agencies, as well as between policies primarily addressing informal rulemaking and formal adjudication.

We further found that federal agencies do not generally have publicly accessible, comprehensive policies and implementation plans for state and local consultation—a surprising result because Executive Order 13,132 directs agencies to develop such policies, and agencies have been comparatively diligent in developing policies for tribal consultation. We learned, however, that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does in fact have a robust formal policy for such consultation and that the agency developed this policy through an iterative, strategic, and intentional process led by key agency personnel.

Moving beyond formal policies, we identified recurring concerns about agency consultation among tribal, state, and local governments. For example, the National Congress of American Indians’ 2009 background paper on tribal consultation found that Executive Order 13,175 “is viewed by federal agencies as merely a procedural requirement” and that federal agencies “ignore or refuse to carry out their responsibilities” to consult. Our study found that the most common concern about tribal consultation was agencies’ failures to consult when the law or executive policy required it. For example, Executive Order 13,175 requires agencies to consult when a proposed regulation has “tribal implications,” but a concern frequently raised in comments and in our interviews was that agencies often missed obvious and important tribal implications.

Commenters and interviewees also stressed that for consultation to be meaningful, it must occur before agencies decide upon a course of action. Executive Order 13,175 requires agencies to consult “with tribal officials early in the process of developing the proposed regulation.” But we found that federal officials are increasingly aware that meaningful dialogue is not possible when federal agencies do not devote sufficient resources to consultation and do not send high-level officials with decision-making authority to a consultation meeting.

The same concerns arose in connection with state and local consultation. Despite the explicit requirement in Executive Order 13,132, we found little evidence in our interviews and review of documents that such consultation reliably took place. This does not mean that engagement between agencies and state and local governments, whether individually or through associations that represent such governments, never happened. Nonetheless, we found these interactions were episodic and, as with tribal consultation, often came too late to meaningfully influence the outcome of rulemaking and implementation.

Stakeholders in state and local governments and from relevant organizations who represent state and local governments recounted a rather desultory approach to consultation. They urge the federal government to improve the process of consultation, in the hopes of improving regulatory performance and fostering the federalism values undergirding important regulatory statutes and executive orders. Our study suggested that both agencies and the White House, through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, should undertake reforms to improve consultation with state and local governments.

Based on our research, ACUS adopted Recommendation 2025-02. The recommendation suggests best practices for consultation, focusing on what agencies themselves can do to improve their engagement with tribal governments and state and local governments. These recommendations include designating a federalism consultation official and a tribal consultation official with responsibility for coordinating consultations with appropriate agencies, adopting comprehensive and distinct policies on tribal, state, and local government consultation, and developing publicly available consultation webpages with easy access to the agency’s consultation policy, contact information for consultation officials, and information on consultation activities.

ACUS’s recommendation, if implemented, would increase the transparency of a process that is too often opaque and incomplete from the vantage point of tribal, state, and local governments and constituents. Implementation would not only improve the performance of agencies but also support the unique nation-to-nation relationship between the federal governments and tribes and the unique regulatory federalism in the United States.

And when you look at the economics and the finances in the long term, it’s pretty obvious that the answer is clean energy generation.”","Environmental advocates who have been years urging state lawmakers to codify ambitious clean energy targets are making a final push to get the bill passed during this lame duck legislative session.

The New Jersey Sierra Club, the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and other clean energy supporters rallied outside the State House on Monday morning in support of a bill to require the state to get 100% of its electricity from clean sources like solar, wind and nuclear by 2035. Such a transition has been touted for years as critical to slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and creating new jobs. But as the affordability crisis intensifies in New Jersey, advocates are pushing clean energy as key to keeping utility bills low in coming years.

“New Jersey, as well as many states across the region, are currently experiencing incredibly high electric bills,” Anjuli Ramos-Busot, the state director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, told NJ Spotlight News. “There has been a boost for demand of electricity across New Jersey, and our electricity bills have skyrocketed.”

Skeptics have argued that the upfront costs of building out clean energy infrastructure makes it more appealing to instead invest in more fossil fuel development, like natural gas power plants. But Ramos-Busot says those gas plants can still take years to bring online, and are more expensive to operate as time goes on.

“Truly clean energy is the way that we can save money. Clean energy, opposite to what you’ve heard from opponents, have actually reached price neutrality. So basically it is now cheaper to generate clean energy with solar, with battery sorage, with offshore wind than it is to build a natural gas power plant.”

Gov. Phil Murphy used an executive order to set a goal for New Jersey to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, and his administration has pushed for clean energy investment over the past eight years. State energy master plans released under Murphy have been written with this target in mind. Ramos-Busot said the onus is now on lawmakers in Trenton to support that effort beyond the Murphy administration.

“They need to decide how is New Jersey going to generate this electricity. Are we going to continue to move into the trajectory of the status quo, which is natural gas and even coal power generation? Or are we going to go with the cheaper, faster, cleaner and healthier version, which is clean energy generation?” Ramos-Busot said. “This is a long-term game.

The recent Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2025 was a reflection of the great momentum for the energy transition the region has generated and the opportunities lying ahead.

However, it also underlined the geopolitical, investment, regulatory and innovation challenges APAC needs to master to both secure its energy security and successfully navigate decarbonization.

Asia Pacific in the global race to net-zero

Southeast Asia alone is projected to drive a quarter of global energy growth by 2035(link is external), fueled by economic and population growth, and expansion in manufacturing, cloud computing and AI.

Many countries are making significant investments in renewable energies in response. In Southeast Asia, clean energy is set to meet more than 35% of demand growth to 2035, driven by a rapid expansion of solar PV and wind.

As it does, gas will also have a key role, according to Takehiko Kikuchi, Chief Regional Officer, Asia Pacific & India, at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. “Gas will be an important bridge in Asia’s energy transition as it provides reliable and affordable low-carbon power by helping to cut emissions in comparison to coal and keeping the grid stable when renewable energy is not available,” he explained.

“MHI is supporting this transition with efficient gas turbine technology, and our GTCC systems offer the highest thermal efficiency available today. Replacing a coal-fired power plant with a GTCC power plant can reduce CO2 emissions by about 65%.”

Natural gas and APAC’s energy transition

There is a growing understanding of the continued role of natural gas as a transition fuel and a pragmatic solution to skyrocketing demand. Several countries are already boosting production levels to position(link is external) themselves as regional natural gas hubs.

“We’re looking at a realistic energy transition(link is external) these days. A couple of years ago, thermal power generation was essentially seen as decreasing relative to all the renewables coming in. We're now realizing that that's not really the case. Renewables and gas are truly very complementary and can support each other to become an affordable and sustainable energy mix,” Takao Tsukui, President and CEO, Mitsubishi Power, a power solutions brand of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), told CNBC.

Natural gas will balance out the intermittency of renewable output, Kikuchi added. Given that Asia Pacific is the world’s largest logistics market(link is external), he also stressed the growing importance of LNG bunkering and of bio-methane, a low-carbon drop-in fuel for the shipping industry.

Alongside gas, countries in APAC are looking to nuclear as another option for reliable power, including in Southeast Asia, which currently has no operational nuclear capacity. There is ""renewed interest in the technology(link is external) across the region, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie.

A role for CCUS in APAC

With natural gas stepping up to meet growing power needs in APAC’s thriving manufacturing, industrial and data center businesses, CO2 capture and utilization (CCUS) is expected to expand rapidly.

After trailing behind expectations(link is external) for many years, cumulative investment across the value chain(link is external) — capturing, transporting and storing CO2 — is forecast to reach $622 billion across the region by 2050. Japan is set to become the regional leader thanks to early investments and cross-border collaboration agreements with Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia on transport and storage(link is external).

A seat at the table for low-carbon fuels

Along with CCUS, green fuels and feedstocks including hydrogen and ammonia are slated as major contributors to decarbonization.

Mitsubishi Power has conducted a series of successful tests using a mix of natural gas and hydrogen as fuel for power generation. At Mitsubishi Power’s validation facility at Takasago Hydrogen Park, tests with 100% hydrogen firing are also being conducted. Mitsubishi Power’s Tsukui told CNBC, “For now, all investments in data centers are expected to be 100% natural gas. But in the future, that’s convertible to hydrogen. When the time comes and the supply chain is ready, data centers will be using hydrogen-fired gas turbines.”

MHI’s Kikuchi expects clean hydrogen to be mainly locally produced and consumed, due to the difficulties of storing and transporting hydrogen. Even so, APAC needs to focus on building out its regional infrastructure for clean hydrogen(link is external). Countries like Australia are positioning themselves as future hubs for producing both green hydrogen and ammonia, a derivative.

Ammonia is mainly used in the production of fertilizers today. However, it can also serve as a fuel in its own right — for example in shipping — or as a carrier for hydrogen, simplifying its storage and transport from where it is produced to where in the region it’s needed.

Strengthening regional collaboration

APAC needs to play its cards right to maximize the opportunities the energy transition offers. The biggest challenge will be bringing a very diverse region closer together, strengthening collaboration and regional integration.

“No single company or country can tackle the energy trilemma alone. Truly sustainable solutions require a shared commitment to invest in growth, adopt new technologies and make the right decisions to move forward,” said Mitsubishi Power’s Tsukui at SIEW(link is external).

EPA’s grant of primacy gives the RRC authority over permitting, implementation and enforcement of the Class VI injection well program. In practice – starting with the rule’s effective date on Dec. 15, 2025 – this decision shifts the day-to-day regulatory control of the program in Texas to the RRC, while EPA maintains an oversight and review role.

Previously, Texas projects required permits from both EPA and the RRC. With the grant of primacy, the RRC becomes the primary point of contact for permit applications, technical review, monitoring and testing requirements, corrective-action plans, financial responsibility demonstrations and post-injection care. New applicants may submit directly to the RRC.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects and Class VI well developments are expected to expand rapidly in Texas. The RRC announced that it has received 18 applications1 and is aware of additional projects that are planned by the industry. Additionally, applications for Texas projects that are currently being processed by EPA will be transferred to the RRC, in line with agreements between EPA and RRC regarding transition of the program.

The Seattle-area company has not publicly offered an explanation for the downsizing or said how many workers were impacted. In a recent email to business partners, officials referenced recent funding changes and said it was undergoing a “broader restructuring effort.”

Modern Hydrogen raised $125 million since launching a decade ago. It developed a device for cracking natural gas molecules, producing hydrogen as a climate friendly fuel and a material known as solid carbon that has a variety of industrial uses, including as a key ingredient in asphalt.

Gates explored that application during a visit to Modern Hydrogen last year. The Microsoft co-founder grabbed a wheelbarrow and shovel to fill a parking lot pothole with the carbon-trapping asphalt.

The layoffs hit as the company was preparing to finish its first commercial unit for a customer in Texas and had performed two successful pilot projects with utilities in Portland, Ore., and Miami.

In January, Modern Hydrogen announced a memorandum of understanding with Puget Sound Energy, a major Seattle-area utility, to collaborate in identifying industrial customers interested in the clean hydrogen technology. That was expected to include steel and cement makers and pulp-and-paper manufacturers that use processes requiring ultra-high temperatures that could be met by hydrogen.

Given that the company had seemingly solved the new technology’s technical hurdles and was building commercial momentum, employees and business partners were surprised by the layoffs.

“A lot of folks were rooting for us,” Michael Jung, Modern Hydrogen’s former government affairs and public policy lead, told GeekWire. “I think we would have solved some key problems in the energy transition.”

On Oct. 30, Amir Moftakhar, Modern Hydrogen’s chief financial officer, sent an email to some of its subcontractors and vendors disclosing the change of course.

“We wanted to inform you that, due to recent changes in our funding situation and a significant reduction in company operations, we must terminate our engagement with you effective 10/30/2025,” stated the email, which was shared with GeekWire by one of its recipients.

“This decision is part of a broader restructuring effort which is being developed and does not reflect on your work,” Moftakhar continued. “We want to sincerely thank you for the professionalism, dedication, and quality you’ve shown throughout our collaboration and for your understanding.”

It is unclear if the company is closing entirely, what will happen with the machinery and technology, and if some component of the effort will continue in a different form.

GeekWire reached out to Modern Hydrogen CEO Tony Pan for an official comment and will update the story if he responds. We contacted a Gates’ representative for a comment as well.

One subcontractor, who asked not to be named, said that until the email went out, “things were cooking along” in their collaboration with Modern Hydrogen. Now the company is anxious about if and when it will get paid for outstanding invoices that total tens of thousands of dollars.

Modern Hydrogen got its start in 2015 at Intellectual Ventures, an innovation hub created by former Microsoft researcher Nathan Myhrvold with backing from Gates. The startup, which was originally called Modern Electron, initially focused on devices that paired with home furnaces and hot water tanks to capture the appliances’ wasted heat and turn it into electricity.

In 2023 it pivoted to focus on hydrogen and changed its name. The company’s most recent round was $25 million raised a year ago. It had approximately 80 employees at the time, according to an analysis of LinkedIn data. Modern Hydrogen co-founder and former CTO Max Mankin left the company in January.

Gates has in the past been an enthusiastic supporter of hydrogen fuel. In June 2022, he posted a Gates Notes touting the so-called “Swiss Army knife” of clean energy given its versatile applications. He was a prominent investor in the company, whose other backers included NextEra Energy, one of the world’s largest utilities; Miura; National Grid Partners; IRONGREY; Starlight Ventures; Valo Ventures and Metaplanet.

Hydrogen saw a surge of interest during the Biden administration, which created hydrogen hubs around the U.S. to bolster the technology. That funding and support has been largely curtailed under the Trump administration.

And on Oct. 28, Gates posted a memo on his personal blog that dampened his earlier excitement around climate efforts.

“Although climate change will have serious consequences — particularly for people in the poorest countries — it will not lead to humanity’s demise,” Gates wrote. “People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Modern-Hydrogen-H2-production-unit-at-NW-Natural-1-1260x945.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 00:57:46.587199

Insurance is the climate crisis’s canary in the coal mine. Climate change, due to increasing greenhouse-gas emissions, is causing more extreme and severe natural catastrophes. Insurers respond to the substantial increase in property-insurance losses caused by these disasters by increasing prices and not writing or renewing insurance. State efforts to address the problem through deregulation of the insurance market, like Florida, or by allowing substantial rate increases, like California, do not address the underlying driver of the insurance crisis. There are several measures that can help keep insurance available and affordable in the short to medium term. Insurer-focused policies include ending insurers’ financial support for the fossil-fuel industry, encouraging subrogation lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies, and requiring insurers to account for mitigation measures in pricing and underwriting. Land-use policy measures, like curbing development in high-risk areas while promoting building and development practices that reduce the risk of loss, will also help. Other state-level measures include strengthening the financial stability of residual markets through bond financing. There is also a need for federal involvement. Congress should enact a federal reinsurance program for state residual markets and a subsidy program for low-income households to afford residual-market premiums. But the risk of loss from climate-driven events keeps climbing and will eventually overwhelm the benefits of these additional policies. The only long-term solution to preserve an insurable future is to transition from fossil fuels and other greenhouse-gas-emitting industries.

Introduction

The Los Angeles wildfires of January 2025 killed at least thirty-one people and destroyed over 16,000 structures. Estimates put the economic losses from this horrific event as high as $250 billion. Insurance companies are expected to pay $40 billion in claims—the largest insured loss from a wildfire anywhere, ever. Facing over $4 billion in claims, California’s insurer of last resort—the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan—needed a $1 billion bailout, more than half of which will land on all California insurance policyholders as a result of a recent state policy change. Research indicates that climate change made this disaster 35% more likely to occur—two years of above-average precipitation caused rapid brush growth, followed by an abnormally dry year that converted the brush into kindling awaiting ignition.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural-catastrophe events, which, in turn, damage and destroy homes and businesses at an unprecedented scale. In the last ten years, climate change accounted for over 30% of insured natural-catastrophe losses incurred across the globe. Global insurance losses from natural catastrophes keep climbing. In response to rising losses, property-insurance companies have significantly raised their rates and are increasingly refusing to write or renew insurance for homes and businesses, creating an insurance crisis.

Insurance is the climate crisis’s “canary in the coal mine.” And the canary is dying. In an effort to keep insurance available and affordable for a while longer, this Essay will analyze recent policy and regulatory responses to the property-insurance crisis and propose additional solutions to address their inadequacies. This Essay relies not only on research and engagement with insurance-sector participants, regulators, policymakers, and other stakeholders related to the insurance crisis, but on my own experience as the former Insurance Commissioner for the State of California, where I worked to get insurers to evaluate, consider, and address the growing risks and losses associated with the global climate crisis.

Part I provides background on the property-insurance industry and describes the nature and scope of the growing insurance crisis, including its implications for homeownership and the U.S. economy going forward. It will then delve into the examples of California and Florida, which have responded differently to the insurance crisis. California has maintained its regulation of rates and insurers but has recently embraced some deregulatory measures. Under these measures, insurers can use probabilistic models to justify rate increases and incorporate reinsurance costs into rates, so long as they promise to write more insurance in high-risk areas. Florida, by contrast, has long declined to regulate rates and has recently embraced even more deregulation of its insurance market.

While both approaches might enjoy moderate short- and mid-run success, they will prove inadequate in addressing the insurance crisis in the long run. Florida’s blanket deregulatory approach may provide an opportunity for keeping some property insurance available (albeit, not affordable). But Florida homeowners and businesses pay four times the national average in rates. Moreover, because Florida does not require insurers to demonstrate sufficient financial strength, Floridians face the likelihood that future damage claims from a major hurricane will be unpaid.

California’s current regulatory approach will be insufficient as well. The state continues to regulate insurers’ rates and reserves, though recent regulatory changes allow substantial rate increases linked to promises to write more insurance in high-risk areas. But this approach, too, will likely be overwhelmed by the insurance losses from the growing frequency and severity of climate-driven events. Fundamentally, both approaches fail to address the greenhouse-gas emissions driving the crisis. And both states fail to require insurers to account for risk-reduction measures in their decisions to write and renew insurance.

Part II lays out state-level solutions to help keep some home and small-business property insurance available. One set of solutions focuses on state-level regulation of insurers. It includes proposals that would require insurers to recover some portion of their climate-driven natural-catastrophe losses from fossil-fuel companies and account for risk reduction associated with proven climate-adaptation and resilience measures in their decisions to write and renew insurance. Another set of state-level solutions expands the focus beyond insurers, exploring ways to discourage development in areas at high risk of climate-driven disasters through land-use policy. Part II also discusses measures that would help stabilize state-created residual markets, like requiring real-estate developers to post bonds to cover expected losses and issuing catastrophe bonds to provide an alternative means of risk transfer. Throughout the discussion of these various proposals, I will identify and respond to legal and policy-based objections.

In Part III, I discuss the need for federal intervention, in the form of both a reinsurance program for state-run residual markets and subsidies enabling low-income homeowners forced to buy insurance in residual markets to afford insurance. Part III also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of a proposal to establish a federal all-risk, all-disaster property insurance scheme and concludes that the benefits of this proposal are outweighed by the harms.

To be clear, these insurance-policy solutions, while important, are only stopgaps. Unless we transition away from fossil fuels and from other greenhouse-gas-emitting industries that continue to drive up global temperatures, we will continue to march—at an increasing pace—toward an uninsurable future.

I. marching toward an uninsurable future

Three factors contribute to the growing insurance crisis globally and in the United States. First, climate change results in more severe and more frequent weather-related disasters, which damage and destroy home and business property and contribute to record insurance-company losses. Second, these losses are compounded by the rising costs of replacing or repairing homes and businesses. Finally, the increasing construction of homes and business properties in areas prone to climate-driven natural catastrophes expands insurance losses when disaster strikes. The last two factors, however, would not matter as much if the first were not true.

In response to increased losses from these three factors, insurance companies raise rates for policyholders and refuse to renew existing insurance policies or write new ones. This generates a crisis in which insurance is more expensive and less available. States like California and Florida have taken different approaches toward addressing this climate-driven insurance crisis. These recent state measures, while likely to keep some insurance available in the short run, do not address the root cause of the insurance crisis. Insurers in these states—indeed, in all states—will be overrun by the increased risk and losses resulting from rising global temperatures.

A. A Primer on the Property-Insurance Industry

With roots going back as far as ancient Babylon, property insurance as we know it developed in the seventeenth century at Lloyd’s coffeehouse in London, as a way for owners and investors in ships and their cargo to spread shipping risks and losses. Insurance continues to serve this function today: a financial instrument that protects against risk and loss. Insurance allows an individual or business to transfer the risk of a loss to someone else—an insurance company—who agrees to shoulder the burden in exchange for a payment called a premium. An insurance company remains profitable—collecting more in premiums and returns on investments than it pays out in claims—by pricing and spreading risk and excluding or limiting coverage for losses and risks that are so high that the insurer is likely to lose money covering them. Property insurance is no exception to these fundamental principles. This Section will describe several applications of these core principles of insurance that are crucial to understanding the nature of the insurance crisis and potential solutions.

Property-insurance companies use several methods to price and underwrite risk for properties, including catastrophe models. Insurers “underwrite” the risk of loss or damage to a property by writing or renewing a property-insurance policy, usually for a year’s duration, in which the insurer agrees to cover and make payments for certain losses or damage to the property up to a coverage limit and subject to exclusions and terms set forth in the insurance policy. Catastrophe models determine the probability and potential magnitude of losses in future years by accounting for the nature, severity, and frequency of disasters, as well as their impact on, and the vulnerability of, insured property. As climate change has exacerbated natural disasters, insurers have increasingly relied not just on their recent history of losses but on future projections of losses using catastrophe models.

Insurance companies not only price risk and spread it across the pool of insureds but also transfer risk to insurers of their own. This insurance for insurance companies is called reinsurance. Direct writers of insurance purchase reinsurance from reinsurance companies, which usually operate globally, in order to transfer some of the risk they face to global capital markets. Reinsurance contracts often have attachment points that dictate the threshold of losses above which the reinsurer assumes responsibility to pay the direct writer of insurance to cover those losses. Reinsurance contracts also typically have coverage limits that cap the amount of payment from the reinsurer.

Insurers and reinsurers also transfer risk of loss to capital markets through the issuance of “insurance linked securities” like catastrophe bonds. Catastrophe bonds are a type of high-risk, high-yield investment that transfers the risk of natural disasters from insurers to capital-market investors. If a predefined catastrophic event, like a major hurricane or earthquake, does not occur during the bond’s term, investors receive their principal back plus interest payments. However, if the event occurs, the investors can lose all or part of their principal, which is then used by the insurer or reinsurer who issued the catastrophe bond to help cover claims.

When insurers pay claims, they have the right of subrogation, which exists in almost all insurance contracts and under state law. Insurers can sue third parties whose actions or inactions cause damage or injury to insurance policyholders, which in turn requires the insurance company to pay the policyholder’s claim. Subrogation enables insurers to stand in the shoes of their policyholder and bring suit against third parties to recover the insurance proceeds paid to the policyholder.

But, as risks become certainties and losses increase substantially, the business of risk transfer (that is, insurance) can become unprofitable even with higher prices. Private-property insurers begin to stop underwriting, that is, they stop renewing existing policies and issuing new insurance policies. As homeowners and small-business property owners are unable to find insurance from traditional “admitted” private insurance companies, they are forced to buy insurance from the less regulated and more expensive nonadmitted “surplus lines insurers” or from insurance “residual markets” established by state law as insurers of last resort. While admitted insurers are fully licensed and regulated by the state, surplus-lines insurers are not licensed, less regulated, and will write insurance for risks or exposures that admitted carriers decline to cover, albeit with higher premiums.

Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia have established “residual markets” to write insurance for properties that private admitted carriers refuse to write policies for. In most of these states, legislation establishes a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan. A FAIR plan is an involuntary association of admitted property and casualty insurers, who must participate in order to obtain and maintain a license to sell insurance in the state. FAIR Plans and other residual markets are usually structured so that if there is a shortfall in reserves to pay claims, the insurance-company members of the association share in making up the shortfall through an assessment collected by the FAIR Plan or residual market from insurance companies, based on their relative market share in the state.

The implicit rationale for requiring private insurance companies to make up such shortfalls is that they are the ones determining the number of policyholders who will be forced to buy insurance through the residual market or FAIR Plan in the first place. By virtue of deciding not to renew or write insurance for certain properties, private insurers send policyholders to the residual market or FAIR Plan. States decided insurers should not be able to “cherry pick” the best risks and throw everyone else onto the FAIR Plan or other residual market, without bearing some responsibility if the FAIR Plan or other residual market runs out of money.

Florida and Louisiana are notable exceptions to the usual state-law approach requiring private insurers in the state to make up for shortfalls in FAIR Plan or residual-market reserves based on their relative market share. In these two hurricane-prone states, property-insurance policyholders in the state, including those not on the FAIR Plans, are assessed by Louisiana’s or Florida’s version of a FAIR Plan in the event their reserves are insufficient to pay claims. In other words, private insurers in those two states are not on the hook if the residual market—necessitated by private insurers’ refusal to write insurance—runs out of money. Insurance policyholders are.

B. The Crisis Facing the Insurance Industry

Climate change is not just tomorrow’s scourge; it is today’s reality. Climate change makes existing natural disasters more frequent and severe, and transforms previously mundane occurrences, like rainstorms, into destructive events. While climate-driven catastrophes vary in severity and frequency across the United States—with states like California, Florida, and Louisiana most at risk—there is virtually no place in the United States that is not experiencing worsening weather-related events. The resulting increase in losses has caused insurers to raise rates and stop renewing and writing insurance. Higher rates and less underwriting, in turn, make mortgages and other forms of credit less affordable or available because lenders require the borrower to have and maintain insurance. Obstacles to homeownership and higher rents as landlords pass insurance costs onto renters only exacerbate the nation’s housing crisis. Together, these trends set up the central challenge for policymakers: keep insurance available in the short term while facilitating the energy and economic transition to net-zero emissions necessary to preserve the long-term viability of insurance and housing markets.

There is strong expert consensus that global temperatures are on track to rise over two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, potentially by as early as 2029. Climate scientists warn about approaching “tipping points” that will accelerate changes in climate and related catastrophic events. And even if all greenhouse-gas emissions ceased today, substantial climate change has been baked into our climatic system. Already we are experiencing the impacts: more frequent and intense weather-related events, such as wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, extreme heat, river and coastal floods, and severe convective storms. These climate-driven catastrophes will kill and injure more people, damage and destroy more property, render entire geographies unlivable, undermine agricultural production, and potentially result in mass migration, to name but a few impacts.

Climate change is also expanding losses from perils that were not historically major sources of losses. Severe convective storms accounted for at least forty-one percent of insured natural-catastrophe losses in 2025. Rising global temperatures result in larger amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere, which, coupled with changing weather patterns, enable “atmospheric rivers” of water vapor to stay over a particular geography for longer periods of time. Severe convective storms characterized by heavy rain, and sometimes with hail and wind, are landing across the United States in historically unprecedented ways.

The effects of climate change are not limited to states like California, Louisiana, and Florida. Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of weather-related events throughout the United States. For example, wildfires are not limited to the West, but are also occurring in New England and the Southeast. The Gulf and Atlantic states are being hit with more intense hurricanes and wind. Severe convective storms are landing throughout the United States, including the Midwest, New England, the South, and the West, causing major losses.

Another factor that exacerbates losses is the development of new homes and businesses in areas at the highest risk of climate-driven weather-related events. For example, between 1990 and 2010, forty-three percent of all new homes were built in wildfire-prone areas, accounting for twenty-five million residents. Moreover, the increased cost of replacing homes and business property only adds to the burden on insurers. However, the presence of more homes and businesses in areas at risk and the increased costs of replacing homes and business property would not drive insurance losses as significantly without more severe and frequent climate-driven events.

The upshot of climate change coupled with unwise development choices and rising replacement costs is increased losses for insurers. Globally, insurers had over $137 billion in weather-related natural-catastrophe losses (payments to policyholders) in 2024—significantly exceeding the ten-year average of $98 billion. Losses are on track to increase to $145 billion in 2025. Swiss Re, one of the world’s largest, oldest, and most respected reinsurers, estimates a one-in-ten probability that global insured natural-catastrophe losses could reach as high as $300 billion in 2025.

The situation in the United States is consistent with these global trends. In the United States, insured natural-catastrophe losses are also at record levels, reaching $117 billion in 2024, which exceeds the rolling ten-year average by 52%. In 2024, there were twenty-seven events that resulted in over $1 billion in losses in the United States.

Insurers respond to increased losses in two principal ways. First, they increase the price of insurance. Second, they reduce their exposure to losses by not renewing insurance policies and not writing new insurance policies. U.S. insurers do both. In the last three years alone, home-insurance premiums on average rose by twenty-four percent. Across the United States, insurers are not renewing home and small-business owners’ property insurance, and they are reducing the issuance of new insurance policies.

The increased prices and decreased availability of property insurance place a heavy burden on homeowners and the economy at large. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that in areas where insurance prices are rising due to losses from climate-driven events, there is a corresponding increase in mortgage-payment delinquencies and defaults. Mortgage lenders require the borrower to maintain insurance. As insurance costs go up, the borrower’s ability to maintain mortgage and insurance payments decreases. If insurance is unaffordable or unavailable to the borrower, the lender can “force place” insurance (obtain insurance for the property and force the borrower to pay for it), which usually costs even more than traditional home insurance, leading to more defaults.

A Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis survey found that owners and operators of permanently affordable multifamily housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households are getting squeezed by insurance price increases. Affordable-housing owners and operators cannot increase rents to cover higher insurance costs, increasing the potential for defaults on loans and discouraging the development of new, permanently affordable housing. Owners and operators of market-rate rental housing are also feeling the squeeze. As they raise rents to cover increased insurance costs, rental housing becomes even more unaffordable, exacerbating the nation’s housing crisis. Increased pricing of property insurance falls hardest on low-income households, who have limited or no ability to cover increased home-insurance or rent costs.

The long-term outlook is grim. During his semiannual testimony before Congress, Federal Reserve Chairperson Jerome Powell addressed the growing issue of insurers withdrawing from regions at high risk of natural disasters. “If you fast-forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage,” Powell said. He explained that “financial institutions and insurance providers are increasingly avoiding areas prone to wildfires, hurricanes,” and other climate-driven risks.

A recent analysis of the impact of climate change on U.S. housing markets over the next twenty-five years found that homes may decrease in value by over one trillion dollars across the country. Increased insurance costs and decreased availability of insurance will reduce the ability to obtain a mortgage and reduce demand for housing. Economic losses and physical impacts from weather-related events will negatively impact local economies, which will affect employment opportunities and people’s ability to continue living in areas hit by disasters. Climate-related migration will reduce housing demand in these geographies, which, in turn, will further drive down housing values. There is potential for a runaway effect—lower property values also squeeze local-government budgets, which rely on property taxes as their primary revenue source, thus degrading the quality of local services and reducing the ability to service or issue debt necessary to finance local public-infrastructure projects.

The dwindling availability of mortgages and affordable housing is just one example of the systemic risk that climate change poses for the financial system, through the impact of climate-driven losses on insurers. Without insurance, households and businesses cannot recover or rebuild in the wake of more climate-driven disasters. But the impact is not limited to high-risk areas. As losses mount, we can expect to see more insurance-company insolvencies, more unaffordable insurance price increases, and more insurers declining to write or renew insurance, all of which will negatively impact credit availability and asset values, which, in turn, will harm the real economy. A recent report from the U.S. Senate Budget Committee described the economic consequences of the insurance crisis as “2008 all over again,” except with more permanent results.

C. California’s Response to the Insurance Crisis

Insurers in California, as elsewhere in the United States, have responded to increased losses from climate-driven perils in typical fashion. California insurers incurred substantial wildfire-related losses in 2017 and 2018, nearly $12 billion in 2017 and over $13 billion in 2018. In response, insurers increased home-insurance prices by an average of 43.7% from 2018 through 2023. In the substantial areas of the state facing high wildfire risk, prices on average have increased far more.

Likewise, increased losses and increased risk of losses from wildfires have resulted in increased nonrenewals of home and small-business property insurance in California. In 2023, major national insurance companies announced that they would stop writing insurance policies for new customers in California. They also announced that they would increase their selective nonrenewal of homes and businesses they perceived as too risky.

One indicator of the acuity of the insurance crisis is the increase in FAIR Plan or other residual-market policyholders. Because the California FAIR Plan is an insurer of last resort, an increase in its membership indicates a lack of options in the private market. The California FAIR Plan had 140,000 policyholders in 2018. Since then, the Plan has more than tripled in size, with over 610,000 policies in force as of June 2025, 97% of which were home-insurance policies.

But higher premiums and refusals to renew and write new insurance policies should not be automatically equated with the financial collapse of the insurance industry. For one, insurers have been able to absorb part of the impact of increased losses through subrogation claims. For example, $11 billion of the over $12 billion California insurers paid due to the 2018 Camp Fire was recovered through subrogation claims against Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). PG&E equipment started the fire, which wiped out the town of Paradise, took at least eighty-five lives, and destroyed over 18,000 structures. More generally, insurance rates in California were sufficient to enable the companies to make underwriting profits on home insurance annually from 2019 through 2023, as well as profits on the investment of their reserves.

Both things are true—California property insurers made profits from underwriting and investing between 2019 and 2023, and concluded that the rising risk of severe wildfire meant that they needed to reduce their exposure to loss going forward. They thus decided to write less insurance and demanded even higher prices for the insurance they continued to renew.

California’s recent policy response to the insurance crisis includes a number of regulatory changes that will allow insurers to justify and obtain higher rates and reduce their exposure to an assessment from the California FAIR Plan when it runs out of money to pay claims. While these changes might lead insurers to start writing insurance again in the short run, they will be overrun in the long term by the increased risk and magnitude of loss due to climate change.

California is one of only sixteen states that require property- and casualty-insurance companies to obtain approval from the state insurance commissioner before rates can be increased. Insurers in those states bear the burden of justifying why the rate increase is not “excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.” Insurers’ rates can cover their projected losses, administrative costs, profit, and reserving requirements. The thirty-four other states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico do not regulate rates—insurers are free to set rates as they see fit, and while the rates are filed with the state department of insurance, they are not reviewed or approved before going into effect.

Insurers asked California to amend its rate regulations to allow them to use probabilistic catastrophe models in setting the catastrophe portion of rates. For context, insurers in California had historically been allowed to include an additional “catastrophe” factor or “load” in their rates to reflect rare but severe catastrophe-induced losses that exceed historically typical losses. Insurers could also use probabilistic models to determine rate relativities, that is, adjust base premium rates in light of individual risk characteristics. However, insurers were not permitted to use forward-looking probabilistic models to determine the catastrophe factor in their rates and were instead required to formulate the catastrophe factor based only on historical data. Insurers argued that the growing risks of wildfire due to climate change warranted the use of probabilistic modeling for the catastrophe load or portion of the rate as opposed to relying on past experience. California’s Insurance Commissioner agreed, issuing a regulation effective in January 2025 that allows insurers to use catastrophe models to justify rate increases, with the proviso that they have to increase their insurance writing in areas of high risk.

The next item the insurers requested was the ability to include reinsurance costs, that is, the premiums they pay for reinsurance, in their rates. Unsurprisingly, the price of reinsurance has been climbing—in fact doubling between 2018 and 2023—as reinsurers witness an increase in losses (payouts to insurance companies) for the same reason that insurers are bearing higher losses—more frequent and severe weather-related events. Historically, California was the only state not to allow insurers to include reinsurance premiums in their rates. The Department of Insurance staff reasoned that allowing insurers to increase rates based on reinsurance payouts as well as reinsurance costs would be “double dipping,” because rate increases covered not only insurers’ direct losses but also the portion of their losses covered by reinsurance. Moreover, reinsurance prices are not regulated, and Department staff were concerned that passing on unregulated reinsurance costs to consumers was contrary to the objectives of the state’s rate-regulation law.

However, last year, in the face of insurers declining to write insurance for new customers, the California Insurance Commissioner agreed to the insurers’ request and issued a regulation allowing them to include their reinsurance costs in their rates.

Finally, insurers asked that their exposure to an assessment from the California FAIR Plan be limited. Instead of shouldering the responsibility to cover FAIR Plan shortfalls, insurers wanted to shift that financial liability to all California insurance policyholders, as was done in Florida and Louisiana. Consistent with this request, the California Insurance Commissioner issued an order in 2024 limiting private insurers’ collective exposure to a FAIR Plan shortfall to $500 million. Any additional California FAIR Plan shortfall will be covered through a surcharge on all insurance policyholders—much as in Florida and Louisiana.

With these changes going into effect at the start of 2025, insurers in California indicated they would resume writing new insurance again and write and renew some additional insurance in high-wildfire-risk areas.

But all of these regulatory developments occurred before the wildfires that devastated portions of Los Angeles in early January 2025 and resulted in an estimated $40 billion in insured losses. Faced with over $4 billion in claims, which exceeded its reserves and reinsurance coverage, the California FAIR Plan asked for and received the Insurance Commissioner’s approval of a $1 billion bailout to make up the shortfall.

Under the 2024 order, insurers will be assessed only $500 million collectively, and the remaining $500 million will be collected as a surcharge on top of their insurance premiums from all home-insurance policyholders in the state of California. There is a high potential for additional surcharges, since it is very likely that the California FAIR Plan will need more than $1 billion to pay claims. In June, a California state court determined that the FAIR Plan has been unlawfully limiting or denying payments for smoke damage, which will no doubt increase the payouts the FAIR Plan has to make beyond its projections when it asked for the $1 billion bailout. Given the burdens they shift from insurance companies to California policyholders, will these recent regulatory changes ensure that insurers start writing new insurance in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires?

State Farm—the largest insurer in California —suggests that the answer is no. State Farm received approval for a 17% emergency rate increase in May 2025. The company agreed to refrain from wholesale “block” nonrenewals, but did not agree to refrain from selective nonrenewals of individual homes and small businesses. State Farm continues to request an additional 11% increase on top of the 17% granted in May and a 20% increase approved last year. Notwithstanding these rate increases, State Farm indicated that it will not be able to start writing insurance for new customers.

On the other hand, Mercury and CSAA Insurance Group recently filed for rate increases under the new California rules and indicated that they would resume writing new policyholders, including in high-wildfire-risk areas, if granted the rate increases. Other insurers have said that they will wait to see if, under the new rules, they are able to get substantial rate increases sufficient to cover their projected losses, before deciding whether they will start writing new insurance again. Nevertheless, a recent New York Times investigation found that, despite the regulatory changes allowing for rate increases, insurance nonrenewals increased substantially and that the conditional requirement to write more insurance in high-risk areas has so many loopholes that little if any additional insurance will be written in those areas.

D. Deregulatory Failures: Evidence from Florida and Other States

While California has modified but maintained its strong regulation of insurance rates and insurers generally, Florida has taken a very different approach to address the impact of climate change on insurance pricing and availability. Florida historically has not regulated rates and has taken a number of other recent actions to deregulate the insurance market and reduce insurance-company costs. In addition to Florida, there are thirty-three other states, one territory, and the District of Columbia that do not regulate rates. But their experience shows that in the long term, we are not going to deregulate our way out of the climate-change-driven insurance crisis.

Even in states where rates are unregulated and insurers are free to set rates as high as they want, losses driven by climate change are causing insurers to increase nonrenewals, stop writing new insurance, and depart markets entirely. For example, due to the increased incidence of severe convective storms, at least four insurers in Iowa stopped writing all insurance in the state in 2023.

In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners’ coverage in eighteen states, more than a third of the country, according to a New York Times analysis. That’s up from twelve states in 2019, and eight states in 2013. Most of those eighteen states are in the interior of the country, hit by tornadoes, derechos, severe storms and hail in the Midwest and Southeast, and wildfires in much of the West. And most of those states do not regulate rates. In response, insurers have not only raised premiums, but have also narrowed coverage, dropped customers, and withdrawn altogether. As these states show, price increases and deregulation are insufficient to prevent insurers’ nonrenewals and withdrawals.

Florida dispels any lingering notions that treating insurers’ every wish as the government’s command will ameliorate the insurance crisis in the long run. As climate change is increasing the intensity of hurricanes and other wind events in Florida over time, the Sunshine State has enacted everything insurers requested of California, and much more.

In Florida, home-insurance rates are deregulated and are four times the national average—and climbing. Florida has allowed catastrophe models to be used to set rates for decades and has developed its own state-run catastrophe model, too. Similarly, Florida has permitted insurers to include reinsurance costs in rates for some time. Florida created two taxpayer-funded reinsurance programs to offer lower-cost reinsurance to private insurers and the Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Florida Citizens), the state’s residual-market insurer of last resort. Still more, Florida decades ago became one of the first states, if not the first state, to eliminate private insurance companies’ responsibility to cover its residual market’s reserve shortfalls and shift that burden to all home and small-business insurance policyholders in Florida. Florida eliminated all of the insurers’ exposure to assessments as opposed to keeping them on the hook for $500 million, as is the case now in California. When Florida Citizens runs out of money to pay claims—and it has—a surcharge is placed on all Florida policyholders, on top of the premium they are paying, in the amount necessary to enable Florida Citizens to pay claims.

Florida’s deregulatory zeal goes further than California’s in other ways, too. Florida recently enacted laws that make it substantially more difficult for aggrieved policyholders or third parties to bring lawsuits against insurance companies. The end result for Florida policyholders has been an increase in claim denials because insurers are emboldened by the diminished threat of lawsuits. Florida’s nonrenewal rate has also climbed rapidly, nearly tripling between 2018 and 2023 from 0.79% to 2.99%, the highest in the nation by over a full percentage point.

To be fair, as of late, new Florida-based and regionally based insurers have entered Florida’s market, and existing insurers in the market are writing more insurance in Florida again. Likewise, the number of Florida Citizens policyholders has declined, although it is still substantially higher than California’s FAIR Plan. But these new companies tend to be poorly capitalized, often startup insurers that are extremely vulnerable to market shocks. For example, seven of twelve new insurers are not traditional property-insurance companies, but “reciprocal exchanges” who are only required to maintain at least $250,000 in surplus funds, as opposed to the minimum reserves of $2.5 million required of traditional insurers. Unsurprisingly, the number of insurers who failed the state financial-fitness test more than doubled over the past year.

Florida’s historical approach to rating insurers’ financial condition is instructive of the long-term effects of relying on financially weak insurers. Since the 1990s, Florida has allowed insurers to use a less rigorous rating agency called Demotech to rate their financial conditions. While that has allowed more insurers to enter the Florida market, those insurance companies are less able to withstand major climate-driven losses. All seven of the Florida insurance-company insolvencies in 2021-2022 were insurers rated by Demotech. Indeed, nineteen percent of Demotech-rated insurers entered insolvency proceedings between 2009 and 2022.

The upshot is that Florida is just one major hurricane away from another wave of insurance-company insolvencies, insurers pulling out of the state again, and a further rise in Florida Citizens policyholders. In the wake of the last major hurricane, at least nine insurance companies became insolvent and unable to pay claims. National insurance companies are not writing insurance in Florida, even with prices four times the national average and all of the deregulatory steps taken above: the risk of substantial losses even at the highest prices is too great.

Florida’s experience demonstrates that price increases and deregulation are not long-term solutions to the climate-driven insurance crisis. The higher rates that will result from recent regulatory changes in California, then, may help in the short or medium term to get insurers to write more insurance in California (although, as discussed above, even that remains an open question). But rate increases and deregulation will eventually be overwhelmed by the rise in risk and increased losses driven by climate change. So, what can and should be done to help keep insurance available in the long run?

II. what can states do to keep insurance available?

There is no “magic wand” that we can wave or regulatory “dial” that we can turn to keep private insurance available in the long run in the face of increasing global temperatures. To slow or stabilize the increased losses experienced by insurers, we need to address climate change itself, which requires a major transition away from burning fossil fuels and from other greenhouse-gas-emitting sectors of the economy. In the meantime, however, states can take a number of steps to help keep insurance available. States should require insurers to end their financial support for the fossil-fuel industry, encourage insurers and residual markets to recover losses from major oil and gas companies through subrogation claims, and require that insurers account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale adaptation and resilience measures. States and local governments should improve building codes to require more resilient homes and businesses and limit development in high-risk areas. In particular, they should require developers of new housing subdivisions in these areas to post a bond with the residual market to cover losses in the event of a disaster. Finally, states should bolster the financial stability of residual markets by authorizing the issuance of bonds, including catastrophe bonds. This Part will discuss and defend each of these recommended steps in turn.

A. States Should Require Insurers to Transition from Insuring and Investing in the Fossil-Fuel Industry

As many scientists have noted, we need more, not less, investment in clean energy and more regulation to move us away from fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and home and commercial heating. To start, insurers must stop propping up the industries that fuel their demise. Because insurers have thus far refused the call, states should require them to transition from insuring and investing in the fossil-fuel industry.

There is an important role for insurers to play in supporting the transition to a net-zero economy. Currently, insurers in the United States are investing over $500 billion in the fossil-fuel industry, whose emissions are creating an existential challenge for the home and business property-insurance market. Globally, twenty-eight major property and casualty insurers collect $11.3 billion annually in premiums from insuring the fossil-fuel industry. Insurers should end their support, through investments and insurance, for the very industry that poses a critical threat to their ability to write insurance. Such a move would be far from symbolic. A recent study found that insurers restricting coverage for coal enterprises contributed to a reduction in coal production and burning, with essentially no financial impact on insurers. Nevertheless, insurers have rejected calls to end their insurance of and investment in the fossil-fuel industry.

It is time for the states to act. As a legal matter, states have broad authority to regulate the underwriting and investing activities of insurers, a power which has been conferred by Congress and repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court. States have previously enacted laws that limit which investments meet insurer capital-adequacy requirements and prohibit certain categories of investments. States have also prohibited certain kinds of insurance coverage.

States should exercise this legal authority to require insurers to transition, over a reasonable period of time, away from investing in fossil fuels and writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry.

While fossil-fuel investments often provide positive returns for investors, insurers can find other investments that also provide positive returns. Moreover, fossil-fuel investments do not always provide positive returns. Consider the bankruptcy of at least sixty-three U.S. coal companies and the decline in the Dow Jones Coal Index over time. The International Energy Agency projects that global demand for fossil fuels will peak in 2030 and then begin to decline. Wind and solar energy are now a lot cheaper than fossil fuels and are growing substantially as a source of energy globally.

Premiums from selling insurance to fossil-fuel companies do provide revenue to some insurers, but the rise of litigation against fossil-fuel companies and the potential that courts will hold them liable for climate-related damage ought to give insurers pause. The premiums collected annually from fossil-fuel enterprises, while not insignificant, are not so large as to be necessary for the financial viability of insurers. If an oil and gas company can’t get insurance, it will have to self-insure. This means that it will have to bear the cost of the risks that insurance would typically cover, such as property damage or liability for third-party injuries. Thus, a successful lawsuit for major damages or losses contributed to by the oil and gas company could reduce its profits or even degrade its financial condition, which could reduce fossil-fuel production and emissions.

It is unlikely that these firms will be able to pass some or all of these costs onto businesses and consumers either indirectly (for example, increased price of plastic containers for businesses that sell goods in plastic containers) or directly (for example, gas price increase). The global price of oil, which largely reflects OPEC production quotas, is the number one factor in the price of gas at the pump, not the costs faced by any one oil and gas company. There is also the question of timing, as companies may not immediately pass on a large loss to consumers. In fact, a recent paper indicates a direct relationship between the magnitude of the pass-through effect and consumer awareness of increased costs, which would presumably be low when the cause is inability to procure liability insurance. Moreover, the cost of insurance currently is a partial measure of the annual cost of risks faced by the fossil-fuel industry. The annual premiums paid by the fossil-fuel industry are a fraction of its overall annual revenues, so having to self-insure will help internalize the costs of its activities and impact its bottom line while resulting in little if any additional pass through of costs beyond that which is already occurring.

One final counterargument that might be raised is that insurers might cease operations in states requiring them to divest from and stop writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry, in favor of less regulated states where they can continue to insure and invest in fossil-fuel companies. But insurers still earn profits in more regulated states like California, which, by itself, accounts for over ten percent of homeowners-insurance premiums and over thirteen percent of commercial-insurance premiums nationwide. As discussed above, insurers can make investments other than in fossil fuels that provide positive returns. And requiring insurers to transition from writing insurance for fossil fuels should not reduce home-insurance revenues because home insurance is written as a separate line from the general commercial insurance that covers fossil-fuel enterprises. Insurers therefore retain ample incentive to continue operating in states that institute this proposal.

Right now, insurance companies can maximize their profits by providing financial support to the fossil-fuel industry while denying insurance coverage to homes and businesses and passing on costs to consumers through higher rates. Increasingly, insurers can even pass along to policyholders the costs of FAIR Plan/residual-market losses that exceed reserves—that is, costs brought about by the very fossil-fuel industry that insurance companies invest in and insure. It is only fair that the state step in to prevent its residents and businesses from (literally) paying the price for the decisions of insurance companies to invest in and write insurance for the fossil-fuel industry.

B. Sue Oil and Gas Majors

Another important policy solution to help keep insurance available is to hold the major oil and gas companies accountable for their emissions’ contribution to the increased frequency and severity of weather-related disasters. All affected parties, including states and local governments, individuals, private businesses, private insurance companies, and FAIR Plans/residual markets, should exercise legal tools already at their disposal—and be given new ones—to force the oil and gas industry to internalize the costs of its emissions. In the short to medium term, encouraging private insurers and FAIR Plans/residual markets to pursue subrogation claims against fossil-fuel companies could help stabilize insurance markets by reducing the need to increase rates, stop writing insurance, and surcharge policyholders.

States and local governments have begun to bring lawsuits against the oil and gas majors to recover for public expenditures associated with responding to and rebuilding public infrastructure after climate-driven natural catastrophes. States can and should make it easier for private individuals and businesses to recover against oil and gas majors for their emissions’ contribution to climate-driven physical injury or property losses. While public-nuisance doctrine allows for claims against the oil and gas majors for their harm to the general public, state laws do not explicitly address individual physical and property damages associated with oil-and-gas-company emissions. In California, Senate Bill 222, introduced by Senator Scott Wiener in 2025, would create a new cause of action for private individuals and businesses to bring lawsuits against oil and gas majors who misled and deceived the public about the impact of their emissions on climate change. The bill would impose strict liability for property damage caused by fossil-fuel emissions by way of temperature rise and resulting weather-related events. While the bill did not advance this session, it is an example of how states can make it easier for private individuals and businesses to hold the oil and gas majors accountable for their emissions.

States should also enact legislation to encourage insurers to join governments, individuals, and businesses in accountability efforts. Insurers already have the potent tool of subrogation claims, which they should bring against the fossil-fuel companies to recover insurance payouts associated with climate-driven, weather-related disasters. But on their own, insurers are unlikely to bring these lawsuits, given their collective investment of over half a trillion dollars in the fossil-fuel industry. States can insist that increasing rates and not writing insurance are not the only ways that insurers can address rising losses from climate change. In Hawaii, legislation was introduced by Senator Chris Lee to require that the Insurance Commissioner’s approval to increase the catastrophe load—the portion of the rate covering catastrophes—be conditioned on insurers agreeing to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors to recover losses from climate-driven natural catastrophes. Likewise, California’s Senate Bill 222 would encourage insurers to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas companies by reducing their assessment in the event of a FAIR Plan reserve shortfall if they bring subrogation claims.

States can also adopt statutes requiring residual markets or FAIR Plans to consider and bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors to recover losses from climate-driven natural disasters. This will reduce the pressure to increase rates or the need to assess insurers or surcharge policyholders in the event the FAIR Plan/residual market runs out of money. Existing state laws place duties on receivers appointed to oversee the liquidation of insolvent insurance companies to bring claims against third parties to recover assets or monies owed in order to enhance the ability to pay outstanding insurance claims and satisfy other legal obligations. Similarly, states can enact laws placing a duty on residual markets or FAIR Plans to bring subrogation claims against oil and gas majors for climate-driven losses, to help pay for claims and reduce the likelihood and amount of assessments, surcharges, and rate increases. After all, FAIR Plans/residual markets and receivership of insolvent insurers both reflect failures of the private insurance market that force state policymakers to intervene.

Successful subrogation claims will result in oil and gas companies paying out some amount of damages to insurers and residual markets to cover part of their losses. Paying these claims could increase the cost of doing business for oil and gas companies and reduce their profits, especially if the cost is not passed wholly onto consumers. As discussed above, consumers will likely see minimal price increases because, among other reasons, the global price of oil, driven by supply and demand, is the primary factor influencing the price of gas at the pump and is likely a larger determinant of the price than the addition of a marginal cost associated with subrogation-claim payouts. And even if there is an increase in the price of oil and gas products, that cost is outweighed by the loss reduction for insurers and residual markets, which in turn will prevent or slow down rate increases that also land on the backs of consumers and businesses.

C. Enact State Laws to Require Insurers to Account for the Risk-Reduction Benefits of Mitigation in Their Pricing and Underwriting

There is substantial empirical and scientific evidence and a broad-based consensus that adaptation and resilience measures taken at the property, community, and landscape scale can reduce the risk and magnitude of loss from climate-driven perils. States should pass legislation requiring insurers to account for the risk reductions in both their pricing and underwriting models, given that insurers have largely refused to incorporate this information into their models voluntarily. Accounting for risk-reduction measures in pricing and underwriting models will incentivize their adoption, which will, in turn, reduce risk of loss, helping stabilize prices and allow for the renewal and writing of more insurance.

The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS), the empirical-research arm of the property and casualty insurers, has developed a list of home-hardening measures that reduce the risk of loss of homes due to wildfire. These include using less combustible roofing and siding materials; protecting vents in the eaves of a home with screens to reduce ember intrusion; using heat-resistant glass for windows and doors so that the heat of the fire does not shatter the glass or door allowing embers to flow into the building; eliminating any wooded structures attached to the home such as decks, sheds, or fences that can be a conduit for the fire; and more. Having “defensible space” around the home, which includes clearing the first five feet of vegetation, limiting vegetation within one hundred feet from the home, and eliminating overhanging tree canopy, also reduces the risk of loss due to wildfire. Community-level adaptation includes keeping a distance between newly constructed homes to reduce house-to-house spread, creating fire breaks around the community, and reducing brush and vegetation in the community. Landscape-scale mitigation of wildfire risk includes using prescribed fire and thinning of forests and chaparral lands to reduce the fuel load and, in the forest context, eliminating “ladder fuels” like small trees and bushes, which become conduits for fire to move into the tree canopy.

With regard to hurricanes, other wind events, and severe convective storms, the IBHS has relied on empirical testing to develop a “fortified home” standard for roofing and other elements of the home, which reduces the risk of wind, hail, and heavy rain damage and loss.

While these measures at the property, community, and landscape scale do not guarantee that individual homes will not be damaged or destroyed by a wildfire, hurricane, or other climate-driven peril, they significantly reduce the risk of loss. Increased federal, state, local, and private expenditures and investments in property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation are needed to help reduce the risk of loss and, correspondingly, make it possible for insurers to keep writing insurance for areas hit by climate-change-driven catastrophes. Insurers need to do their part by taking these risk-reduction measures into account.

Both the public and private sectors are already investing substantially in landscape-scale mitigation for severe wildfires, for example. At the federal level, the bipartisan infrastructure bill enacted in the first year of the Biden Administration contained $5.1 billion for forest management and other fuel-reduction measures on federal lands across the United States. California has appropriated $4 billion for landscape-scale forest-fuel reduction through prescribed fire and thinning in the last few years. In 2024, California voters passed Proposition 4, which authorizes the sale of Climate Bonds that will raise an additional $1.5 billion for landscape-scale forest management to reduce wildfire risk. On the local level, cities and counties in California are taxing their residents and spending money on community- and landscape-scale fuel reduction and forest-treatment projects. Mitigation efforts extend to the neighborhood level, where private homeowners associations are collecting fees from their members to pay for landscape-scale forest and chaparral management projects.

State-sponsored risk-reduction efforts are not limited to California. To assist homeowners in fortifying their homes against wind and hurricanes, a number of states on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts have enacted limited grant programs and other financial incentives to help homeowners with the cost of retrofitting their home to meet the IBHS fortified-home standard. In the Midwest, nature-based solutions to reduce river flood risk are also being implemented.

While more federal, state, local, and private investments are needed for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation, homeowners and businessowners who spend thousands of dollars on home hardening, HOA fees, and local, state and federal taxes for mitigation measures are justifiably frustrated when their insurer fails to account for these mitigation measures in deciding whether to write or renew them insurance.

Insurance models used for pricing and underwriting have the technical capacity to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in setting a risk score for particular properties. However, when deciding whether to write or renew insurance, only two insurers out of hundreds in California account for mitigation in the risk-score models they use to decide whether to write or renew insurance.

As insurers were not voluntarily accounting for risk-reduction measures in pricing, some states, like California and Alabama, adopted requirements that insurers provide homeowners with a premium discount for home hardening against wildfire (California) or wind (Alabama). But in these states, insurers issue discounts to homeowners for home-hardening measures yet still refuse to renew or write them insurance. This means that you can be eligible for a home-hardening discount, but the insurer will still not renew your policy or write you insurance, which makes the discount for mitigation effectively worthless. Thus, to properly incentivize risk-reduction measures, states will need to require that insurers incorporate property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation into their models when deciding to write or renew insurance.

Insurers may complain that there is not one database to which they can look to obtain information as to whether homeowners or businesses have undertaken mitigation measures. But insurance companies routinely ask current and prospective customers for information about their homes and businesses to decide whether to write insurance. Recall the list of questions you were asked the last time you shopped for new property insurance. Customers are asked the age of the home, what materials were used in construction, the age of the roof, the materials used for the roof, the number and type of rooms, whether there is a basement, crawl space or the house is on a concrete slab, how the home is heated and cooled, and more. Insurers can simply ask the customer if they have undertaken home hardening and, for wildfire risk, defensible space, just as they ask all sorts of other questions to collect data to input into their models or underwriting guidelines to decide whether to write insurance for the home.

Data on community- or landscape-level mitigation is also available. For example, the State of California maintains a database of the locations of forest-treatment projects to reduce the risk of wildfire, which insurers can access to obtain data to account for community- and landscape-scale mitigation in their modeling.

The insurance industry clearly has the technical capacity to use this readily available data to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in setting a risk score for particular properties. As discussed previously, the insurance industry has established empirically based standards for home hardening against wind, wildfire, hail, and heavy rain. Thus, there is a list of items that the insurance industry’s own research arm has developed, about which the customer can be asked, to obtain data to account for property-level mitigation in their models. Further, the availability of data and the ease of incorporating it into models dispels worries that requiring insurers to take into account property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation would result in substantial additional costs.

Just this year, Colorado grew tired of waiting for insurers to account for risk-reduction measures in their pricing and underwriting models, and took action. With the support of Colorado Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, the state enacted H.B. 25-1182, which requires insurers to account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in the computer models they use to set prices and to decide whether to write or renew insurance. In my view, this is the most important property-insurance law to be enacted this year (if not in several years) anywhere in the United States and should serve as a model for other states to follow.

D. States and Local Governments Should Update Building and Zoning Codes

Just as states and local governments should incentivize the adoption of mitigation measures from the bottom up by requiring insurers to account for them in their pricing models, they should leverage their authority over building and zoning codes in a top-down manner to mandate safer building practices and development patterns.

Strong building codes help reduce the risk and magnitude of loss. For example, homes in Paradise, California, built after the latest major building-code upgrade were substantially more likely to survive the firestorm than those built before. Conversely, in North Carolina, the state legislature delayed updates to the building codes, which resulted in more homes suffering more damage and loss than if they were built under the updated codes.

Zoning codes can also reduce the risk and magnitude of loss. Building houses too close together, for example, can accelerate the spread of fire from home to home. Local zoning codes should take into account the latest science with regard to mitigating the risk of climate-driven perils in that particular geography. State laws should limit the ability to approve more low-density homes in high-risk areas.

There is no inevitable tradeoff here that will result in increased housing costs. Even in high-risk areas, states and local governments should eliminate code provisions that don’t improve resilience but add substantial costs to housing development, like requiring parking or requiring two stairwells in multistory multiunit structures. At the same time, state laws should also require local zoning codes to facilitate more housing in lower-risk areas, such as by allowing higher-density housing structures (duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, and mid- and high-density multifamily structures). This would address both the short-term and long-term causes of the insurance crisis. Land-use regulations account for up to 10% of the cost of wildfire risk by limiting development and raising rents in urban cores, which results in more development in urban peripheries subject to higher wildfire risk. Similarly, in coastal regions, single-family zoning can limit the ability to move to nearby areas with lower flood risks. Relaxing these regulations would therefore prevent further migration to higher-risk areas and help people move out of harm’s way. It would also allow for more people to live in more compact development patterns, which reduces vehicle miles traveled and overall emissions associated with housing.

E. States Should Curb Development in High-Risk Areas

Over time, states and local governments have approved more development in areas at high risk of loss from river flooding, coastal flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and other climate-driven perils. The presence of more homes and businesses in high-risk areas has contributed to insurance-company losses. Instead, states should limit and discourage development in high-risk areas. One insurance-related example discussed further below would require developers of new housing subdivisions in high-risk areas to post a bond with FAIR Plans/residual markets that will be used to cover losses in the event of a natural disaster.

The rising price and declining availability of insurance in higher-risk areas sends a strong market signal that these are, in fact, areas of high risk. But that signal alone has not been enough to overcome homeowners’ demand for housing in these areas, which creates profits for real-estate developers and revenue for local governments. Rather than addressing the underlying cause of the problem and reducing development in high-risk areas, states require their FAIR Plans or residual markets to keep insurance available for new and existing homes built in areas at high risk of loss. And in the case of flood risk, the federal government created a flood-insurance product for homes and small businesses at risk of flooding, which encouraged new development in areas at high risk of flooding.

States and local governments should enact laws to reduce or limit new development in higher-risk areas. States can map areas of high risk and limit development in those areas accordingly. It bears emphasis that decades of exclusionary land-use policy demonstrate that states and localities are adept at limiting development when they want to.

Like with the last proposal, one objection here might be that limiting development in high-risk areas will limit housing supply in the state. If the state has a housing shortage, limiting supply through restrictions or limitations on development in high-risk areas arguably would keep housing prices higher than they should be otherwise, increase the number of rent-burdened households, and contribute to homelessness.

However, limiting or restricting development in high-risk areas does not entail a reduction in overall housing supply. First, allowing greater density of structures on infill parcels can provide more supply without developing outward into areas of high risk. Second, the state can and should require local governments to allow higher-density structures throughout the state in areas that are not high risk, to increase supply of housing as needed and to offset any loss associated with restricting or limiting development in high-risk areas. Indeed, recent studies demonstrate that housing demand can be met nationally with more compact development at higher densities, which also provides substantial benefits in terms of greenhouse-gas-emission reductions.

One way that states could reduce development in high-risk areas would be to require developers of new housing in high-risk areas to internalize the risks and cost of having to rebuild that housing in the event of a climate-driven event. Specifically, in high-risk areas, developers of new subdivisions should be required to post a bond with the FAIR Plan or residual market, instead of shifting the risk and cost of rebuilding to private insurers, or more likely, to the FAIR Plan or residual market. In the event of losses due to a wildfire, hurricane, or other climate-driven event, the FAIR Plan would use the bond amount to cover the losses. The bond amount should match the expected losses for the subdivision, determined according to the same models used by private insurers. Also, the determination of expected FAIR Plan or residual-market insurance losses for the subdivision should account for home hardening and other risk-reduction measures in order to incentivize risk mitigation, as described above.

By requiring the posting of a long-term bond, the developer would be held responsible for a cost that it otherwise externalizes to the FAIR Plan or residual market, and thus ultimately to all insurers and policyholders. Developers may pass the cost of the bond along to prospective homeowners, but in the case of developments in high-risk areas, increased costs and reduced demand are a virtue rather than a vice. In some cases, having to take the risk of wildfire into account will mean that the development will not be economically viable, which would be a successful policy outcome.

The bond requirement should survive legal challenges arguing that it violates the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Under the Takings Clause, conditions on development like the bond requirement are subject to an “essential nexus” and “rough proportionality” analysis. As the U.S. Supreme Court, in Sheetz v. County of El Dorado, explained last year, the first prong requires an “essential nexus” between the permit conditions and the land-use interest, which “ensures that the government is acting to further its stated purpose, not leveraging its permitting monopoly to exact private property without paying for it.” The second prong demands a “rough proportionality” between the impact on the state interest and the permit conditions such that the landowner cedes only what “is necessary to mitigate harms resulting from new development.”

Here, the “essential nexus” between the bond requirement and the state interest is clear. The bond accounts for “the social costs of the applicant’s proposal.” Development in a high-risk area will increase reliance on the state-created FAIR Plan, which will have to pay to cover damage to homes in the development. Likewise, the “rough proportionality” standard is met because the bond does not exceed the amount needed to cover future FAIR Plan insurance payouts for homes burned in the development.

F. States Should Support FAIR Plans and Residual Markets with Bond Financing

In addition to reducing high-risk development, another benefit of the previous proposal is the infusion of much-needed funds to cash-strapped FAIR plans and residual markets. To further bolster the financial stability of FAIR plans and residual markets, states should authorize them to sell bonds to cover financial shortfalls and to improve their negotiating positions with reinsurers through the issuance of catastrophe bonds.

For example, California recently enacted legislation to allow the state to sell bonds and raise funds to cover shortfalls in FAIR Plan reserves. While the FAIR Plan would need to repay the bonds over time, bond financing can help reduce the immediate need for the FAIR Plan to collect an assessment from insurers or a surcharge from policyholders. Although insurers and policyholders will likely need to be assessed or surcharged over time to repay the bondholders, bond financing would effectively allow for amortization of assessments and surcharges and thus reduce sudden price shocks.

States should also pass legislation to allow FAIR Plans and residual markets to issue catastrophe bonds and other insurance-linked securities as an alternative source of risk transfer. As discussed earlier, catastrophe bonds are financial instruments that allow insurers to transfer risks to capital markets through complex four-way transactions. In form, catastrophe bonds look like normal debt vehicles—investors purchase bonds and receive annual interest payments. However, if a predefined loss or risk-related trigger occurs within a certain period and losses exceed a specified attachment point, the investors forfeit their right to the principal used to purchase the bonds, which then goes to the insurer. If the loss or risk-related trigger does not occur within the specified period, the investors get their principal back (and keep the high interest payments). While catastrophe bonds require the FAIR Plan to pay interest to bondholders, they can provide competition to reinsurers and help obtain better-negotiated reinsurance pricing for the FAIR Plan. In fact, both California and Florida have previously issued catastrophe bonds in order to bolster residual markets for earthquake and hurricane insurance, respectively.

III. congress should establish a federal reinsurance program and means-tested premium subsidy for fair plans and residual markets

Congress should enact a federal reinsurance program for state FAIR Plans and residual markets to help offset the cost of private reinsurance and enable access to more reinsurance. The federal government should also institute a subsidy program to enable low-income households to afford the high premiums charged by FAIR Plans/residual markets. These two measures would work in tandem to enhance the affordability of FAIR Plans/residual markets while sending accurate market signals about the risk of loss. While a federal all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme is an alternative that would have some advantages, a narrower reinsurance and subsidy scheme for FAIR Plans/residual markets shares its advantages while avoiding some of its flaws.

Currently, FAIR Plans and residual markets turn to the private reinsurance market to cover some of their exposure to losses. Reinsurers have been raising rates in the face of climate change, which raises costs for FAIR Plans and residual markets and requires that they raise premium prices for their policyholders. As they cover homeowners and businesses with the highest risk, FAIR Plan and residual-market premiums are generally higher than the private market. More and more homeowners are going without home insurance as they cannot find private insurance and cannot afford FAIR Plan or residual-market insurance. Over thirteen percent of all homes in the United States are uninsured —a substantial increase from five percent in 2019.

A lower-cost federal reinsurance program would help FAIR Plans and residual markets offer lower prices. A federal reinsurance program that does not seek profits, that is exempt from state and federal taxation, and whose reserves are funded by U.S. taxpayers would be able to offer reinsurance at a lower price than private reinsurers, along with better terms such as lower attachment points and more coverage than private reinsurers are willing to take on. The lower costs and broader coverage of reinsurance would go hand-in-hand with higher availability. Namely, the federal program would help reduce the likelihood that state FAIR Plans and residual markets have to assess private insurers to make up for shortfalls, thus encouraging more private underwriting.

In addition to a federal reinsurance program, the federal government should establish a premium subsidy program for lower-income households on a sliding-scale basis to assist them in paying for FAIR Plan and residual-market insurance. FAIR Plan and residual-market rates should reflect the actual risk of loss, both to improve the likelihood that they will have sufficient funds to pay claims in the event of a disaster and to send an accurate market signal that climate change is increasing the risk of loss. Subsidizing the premium for low-income households does not artificially suppress the premium rate or the market signal associated with the rate. An income-based sliding-scale premium assistance program, much like the state and federal health-benefits exchanges under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), would enable lower-income households to afford FAIR Plan insurance.

A. A Federal All-Risk Disaster Insurance Scheme Would Send the Wrong Price Signal About Risk and Deepen Inequities

With the onset of the insurance crisis at the state level, there are calls for federal interventions in insurance markets that go well beyond a federal reinsurance and premium subsidy program for state FAIR Plans. This Section will focus on one such proposal—an all-risk, all-disaster national home and small-business property-insurance scheme. While a national all-risk, all-disaster insurance program would have some benefits, on balance, the disadvantages and poor historical performance of federal insurance programs make the reinsurance and premium-subsidy approach for FAIR Plans and residual markets a better alternative. A federal all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme would cost much more, send the wrong price signal about climate-driven risk, supplant the private market, and be more regressive, unlike a narrower federal reinsurance and subsidy scheme.

1. Advantages

A national scheme would spread the risk of loss among all policyholders across the nation who purchase insurance from the scheme. Assuming the insurance program is risk-rated, those facing higher risks would pay more and those facing lower risks would pay less. Spreading the risk nationally, as opposed to at the state level, may help make insurance more available in smaller markets where there is less opportunity to spread risk.

The public scheme would be nonprofit, so its rates should be naturally lower than private insurers. However, underwriting profits for private property insurers can be relatively low and sometimes nonexistent, so there might not be a large comparative reduction in rate. On the other hand, the national-insurance scheme would not pay federal income tax or state premium taxes, which should further help reduce rates. And assuming that the national program is required to maintain adequate reserves to pay claims and that it can invest those reserves, the returns from the investments would not be paid as profits to shareholders or owners but rather could be added to reserves and/or used to reduce the premium price that the program needs to collect. Indeed, nonprofit-governance rules require that financial decisions further the mission of the nonprofit, which here would be to provide affordable property insurance to Americans in every corner of the country.

The national scheme could also include a premium subsidy for lower-income households like that provided for health insurance sold in state and federal health-benefit exchanges under the ACA. And, in line with the best practices described in Section II.C, a national scheme could account for property-, community-, and landscape-scale mitigation in pricing. This would create an incentive for homeowners, communities, and states to invest in mitigation, which would reduce the risk of loss across more properties, communities, and geographies.

The availability of the national-insurance scheme in a state could be conditioned on the state taking action to improve building and zoning codes, limit new development in high-risk areas, and invest in adaptation and resilience programs, all of which would help to reduce risk of loss for the national-insurance scheme. On the other hand, states are often resistant when the federal government tells them what to do, which raises doubt as to whether an insurance scheme enacted with such conditions could be truly national. For example, ten states still refuse to adopt the Medicaid expansion under the ACA.

A national-insurance program would allow states to eliminate their FAIR Plans or residual markets, which would become redundant. This in turn would reduce the potential for assessments on private insurers and surcharges on policyholders in states like California and Florida. If the national scheme enjoys the full financial backing of the federal government, then it may not need to purchase reinsurance, which could further help to reduce premiums. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Congress would put the federal treasury on the hook to cover the losses of the national scheme. More likely, the national-insurance scheme would be capitalized with an initial infusion of federal funds or federal loans but then be required to set rates sufficient to maintain reserves to pay claims. Under this setup, purchasing private reinsurance may be a useful addition to the claims-paying capacity of the national scheme.

2. Negative Consequences

Even taking these positive elements of a national-insurance program at face value, there are a number of negative consequences that also require consideration. The historical record of national-insurance schemes is spotty, to put it mildly.

For starters, national-insurance schemes have failed to set rates based on risk, which results in underpricing. This means that insufficient premiums are collected to cover losses, demanding major taxpayer subsidies to maintain claims-paying capacity. The Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP), for example, does not charge farmers premiums that actually reflect the risk of loss. As a result, the FCIP is heavily subsidized by federal taxpayers. Similarly, the rates of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) did not reflect the actual risk of loss for decades. In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages NFIP, repeatedly reduced premiums for wealthy oceanfront dwellers by redrawing maps to place them in a less risky flood zone, even when their properties had previously suffered flood losses. As a result, taxpayers have had to bail out the NFIP.

Because national-insurance schemes have not set rates based on risk, they send the wrong price signal about the risks associated with the activities or property they are insuring. For example, the FCIP does not provide lower rates for regenerative agriculture practices even though there is substantial evidence that these practices reduce the risk of loss. And the NFIP, whose rates did not accurately reflect the risk of loss until recently at best, has incentivized more development of homes and businesses in areas at high risk of flooding. To be fair, as discussed earlier, private-property insurers often do not adjust their rates or underwriting to reflect risk-reduction measures. However, it is an entirely different matter and a much bigger problem if the rates fail to account for the likely losses from the peril (flooding) itself, as has been the case with the NFIP.

National-insurance schemes likewise do not actually “underwrite”—determine the risk of loss and decide whether to assume it—because they write the insurance regardless of the risk of loss. For example, with limited exceptions, the NFIP will write flood insurance regardless of the risk of flooding where homes are located. This eliminates an important (albeit, so far substantially ignored) signal about the risk of loss associated with developing homes and businesses in a high-risk area. Unlike private home insurance, where insurers may send an important signal about the risk of new development in an area by declining to write or renew insurance, there is no such market signal sent by the NFIP, other than its price, which historically has not reflected risk. Although FAIR Plans also write insurance regardless of the risk of loss, they are not funded by taxpayer dollars.

National-insurance schemes have been very regressive. The FCIP requires that low-income households pay federal taxes to subsidize crop insurance for large corporate owners of agricultural lands. And the minority of Americans who are renters are subsidizing flood insurance for the 65% of Americans who are homeowners, even though renters typically earn lower incomes and have less overall wealth than homeowners.

National-insurance schemes have also tended to supplant the private market. While Congress created NFIP in the 1960s in response to private home insurers excluding coverage for flood insurance, it now writes about 95% of home and small-business flood insurance in the United States. Efforts to get private insurers to cover flood risk have failed, as the NFIP premiums, even if increasingly risk-adjusted, are still lower than the rates at which private insurers can make a profit. Supplanting the private insurance market means that the benefits of a private market for insurance are potentially lost, including access to risk transfer to private capital markets, innovation in developing new insurance products, risk-rated pricing, and sending market signals about risk through pricing and reduced underwriting.

There is one example of a national-insurance scheme that did not supplant the private market, but that program was narrow and limited, unlike an all-risk, all-disaster national home and small-business property-insurance scheme. In the wake of 9/11, when insurance companies stopped insuring commercial buildings in urban centers due to the risk of terrorism, Congress enacted the national Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and program. TRIA is a federal-insurance backstop, which kicks in to reimburse insurers for commercial-property-related claims above a certain level in the event of major losses from a major terrorist event. Unlike FCIP and NFIP, TRIA has worked as intended. Private insurers started underwriting commercial buildings again, bolstered by TRIA’s ability to pick up major catastrophic losses. But TRIA is for a specific type of loss, much narrower than the broad, guaranteed, and growing losses that would be covered under a proposed all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme. Further, TRIA is a backstop, not an insurance program per se. In sum, TRIA does not supply evidence to counter the likelihood that a national all-risk, all-disaster insurance scheme will supplant most if not all of the private-insurance market.

A narrower federal scheme of reinsurance for private home insurers would share many of these flaws. It is likely not to be risk-rated and thus will send the wrong price signal to insurers. It is also likely to require a regressive taxpayer subsidy and a large one at that, with renters, who tend to be lower-income, subsidizing reinsurance for private home insurance. Further, the nonprofit reinsurance program’s ability to offer lower rates may cause it to supplant the private reinsurance market and its ability to access private capital markets to spread risk. To make up the difference, even more federal reinsurance might be required. Finally, even if there are conditions placed on states to enable insurers to access federal reinsurance, their willingness to comply with those conditions may be low.

Given the relative costs and benefits of a national scheme, the better approach is still the more targeted federal program of reinsurance for FAIR Plans/residual markets and a premium-subsidy program for low-income households who depend on FAIR Plans/residual markets. A narrower federal reinsurance program for FAIR Plans and residual markets avoids supplanting the private-insurance markets and private-reinsurance markets for private insurers. It would not send an incorrect price signal to developers and homebuyers about the risk of loss in an area, since those prices would still be set by private insurers (and approved by regulators in rate-regulated states) and FAIR Plans/residual markets. The narrower FAIR Plan reinsurance program would be far less regressive because it will require less federal funding, and will help those who are in greatest need—households who cannot obtain insurance on the private market and are forced to purchase insurance through a FAIR Plan. The progressive premium subsidy targeted to lower income households would also lessen the regressive impact.

Conclusion

The insurance crisis is driven by the climate crisis. In response to rising losses due to climate-driven events, insurers are increasing prices and decreasing the availability of insurance. Policy responses to date have focused on deregulation (Florida) or modifying existing rate regulations (California) to allow for higher rates conditioned on writing more insurance. The deregulatory approach comes at a heavy expense to policyholders, in the form of higher rates and the inability of less regulated insurers to pay claims when the next disaster strikes. Both approaches fail to address underlying causes of the losses—emissions from the fossil-fuel industry and increased development in high-risk areas.

States, localities, and the federal government should implement a number of policy responses that can help make insurance more available. These include insurer-focused measures, like requiring insurers to transition from investing in and writing insurance for the fossil-fuel industry, to bring subrogation claims to recover from oil and gas companies for their share of losses associated with their emissions, and to account for risk-reduction measures in both pricing and underwriting—the decision whether to write or renew insurance. Land-use policy interventions are also warranted. States and local governments should update building and zoning codes to reduce the risk of loss and restrict new development in high-risk areas while meeting statewide housing demand by requiring higher-density development in low-risk areas. One specific measure to reduce high-risk development would require developers in high-risk areas to post a bond with the FAIR Plan or residual market to cover expected losses, which would have the added benefit of providing financial support to beleaguered FAIR Plans and residual markets. States should further shore up the finances of FAIR Plans and residual markets by allowing them to issue bonds, including catastrophe bonds.

The federal government must also take action to address the nationwide insurance crisis, while learning from the mistakes of its previous interventions in private insurance markets. Rather than establishing a federal all-risk all-disaster insurance or reinsurance program, Congress should enact a narrower federal reinsurance program for FAIR Plans and residual markets and a means-tested premium subsidy for low-income households forced to buy insurance through the FAIR Plan or residual market.

But in the long run, these stopgaps will be outrun by the growing risk and magnitude of losses from climate change. To preserve an insurable future, we need to transition from burning fossil fuels and from other greenhouse gas-emitting sectors. Otherwise, the insurance “canary in the coal mine” will sing no more.",,N,,2025-12-02 23:57:37.024777

The effects of the energy transition varied widely across regencies.
“Accelerating the energy transition offers Indonesia a chance to build new industries and create more resilient, inclusive economies,” said Bathandwa Vazi, policy advisor, IISD.

The study, by the International Institute for Sustainable Development and Traction Energy Indonesia, highlights that Indonesia’s shift away from coal presents a powerful opportunity to meet its 2030 climate targets while strengthening local economies—provided the transition is managed carefully and inclusively.

In coal-dependent regions, where coal contributes up to 80% of GDP, and many residents work informally, qualitative research through focus group discussions, interviews, and community engagement revealed that people are deeply concerned about how they will sustain livelihoods beyond coal. These insights also surfaced gender-specific challenges and local priorities that modelling alone often misses. Many communities feel excluded from decision making and uncertain about their future: women see fewer re-employment opportunities, youth are anxious about education and jobs, and older residents worry about reduced welfare support.

The study also used economic modelling to examine the potential impacts of coal closures and identify pathways to safeguard jobs, local economies, and vulnerable groups across five coal-intensive regencies and five provinces in Indonesia. The effects of the energy transition varied widely across regencies.

For example, potential job losses ranged from 5,000 in Sarolangun regency to 24,500 in Muara Enim. The employment impact did not always correspond directly with the magnitude of economic losses, reflecting structural differences in industrial composition and labour intensity across Indonesia’s coal-producing regions.

Unsurprisingly, the more diversified economies showed greater resilience against coal closures. These findings reinforce the need for region-specific just transition strategies, including economic diversification, worker retraining, welfare support, and investment in sustainable sectors tailored to the local economic structure.

“Accelerating the energy transition offers Indonesia a chance to build new industries and create more resilient, inclusive economies,” said Bathandwa Vazi, policy advisor, IISD. “If we prepare early, coal-dependent regions can transform risk into opportunity—protecting decades of development progress and driving new pathways for growth.”

At the provincial scale, East Kalimantan’s economy is currently highly dependent on coal, meaning the province faces significant exposure in a transition, including output losses of USD 42 billion, sectoral income decline of USD 5.5 billion, and over 490,000 jobs at risk.

Yet the modelling also shows a clear pathway forward: with targeted investment in dynamic sectors like food and beverage manufacturing and renewable energy, the region could not only offset projected losses—it could generate up to 2.5 million new jobs and build a more diverse, resilient economy.A just energy transition will also require targeted policies for informal workers, including retraining for green sectors, support for small to medium-sized enterprises, and robust social protection. Such measures are essential to ensure the transition promotes equitable outcomes for communities most at risk. Policies need to be developed with communities and workers to ensure their needs and priorities are addressed in the final package.

“Our findings show deep regional disparities in how the coal transition will impact communities. Transition planning can turn risks into opportunities for more stable, inclusive, and sustainable long-term growth, but communities need to be involved every step of the way,” says Refina Muthia Sundari, program manager at Traction Energy Asia. For policy-makers, the lesson is clear: to succeed, just transition policies must be locally informed, gender responsive, and rooted in inclusive, multi-level governance. By prioritizing green sector development, gender equality, disability and social inclusion (GEDSI), and institutional coordination, Indonesia can transition from a coal-dependent economy to a resilient, low-carbon, and inclusive future.

Eastman's 2025 Sustainability Report presents its advancements and ongoing efforts toward its climate and circularity objectives.

The organisation's climate strategy is central to its operations, with a primary goal of achieving net zero by 2050. This is supported by a decarbonisation plan that emphasises energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources.

Eastman has set a target to lower its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2035. To this end, Eastman has 50 active energy efficiency projects underway globally, including at its large manufacturing sites in Tennessee and Texas.

Eastman's climate strategy and decarbonisation

Eastman is focused on procuring renewable energy for its facilities and developing low-carbon technologies.

These include thermal batteries and carbon capture, which could be vital for decarbonising energy-intensive industrial processes and achieving substantial emissions reductions. The report highlights how material innovation is key to its strategy.

Mark Costa, CEO at Eastman, says: “As we continue to navigate a challenging global economic environment, we remain committed to a strategy built on growth through innovation that aligns with sustainability macro trends. That strategy is working and our focus on sustainable innovation is delivering our business results and reinforces our purpose to enhance the quality of life in a material way.

""Our 2025 Sustainability Report is an ideal place to learn more about our growth strategy and how material innovation is vital to building A Better Circle.”

Eastman is also developing material solutions that directly address its climate impact. One such solution is molecular recycling, which processes hard-to-recycle waste to produce new materials with up to 50% lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods.

Strategic partnerships in carbon capture

To further its climate objectives, Eastman is engaging in strategic partnerships.

Its involvement with the Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute connects it with governments, corporations, research bodies and NGOs. This collaboration is designed to share best practices and promote scientific advancements in carbon capture technology.

According to Eastman's report, carbon capture and storage solutions could be instrumental in reducing emissions, particularly from heavy industry.

One of Eastman’s primary objectives is to establish a circular economy for plastics. Eastman has a goal to recycle at least 500 million pounds of plastic waste each year by 2030. This amount is equivalent to preventing 22 billion single-use water bottles from entering landfills.

Chris Killian, Chief Sustainability Officer at Eastman, says: “Eastman has the opportunity to make a substantial positive impact through better, more sustainable materials. We can help solve global issues like plastic waste through circular plastics and biodegradable cellulosic polymers that reduce environmental impact.

""For the sake of future generations, product innovation in the materials industry must be more sustainable.”

Molecular recycling and the circular economy

Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, which cannot process many everyday items like carpets, polyester clothing or coloured PET bottles, Eastman’s molecular recycling technology can. This process breaks down these complex waste products to create its Renew materials.

These materials are supplied to global manufacturing markets and are indistinguishable from plastics made from virgin resources.

Hybrid cooling towers to save water Under the MoU, Fermi and MVM EGI will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, and assess site and height constraints.
“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century, maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” stated MVM EGI P.L.C.
In October, the company signed an agreement with Energy Transfer to connect to nearby pipeline infrastructure by Q1 2026.","On December 1, Fermi America signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Hungarian power-cooling specialist MVM EGI Zrt.

The partnership aims to develop advanced cooling systems for Fermi’s planned data center and energy campus in Amarillo, Texas, which could reach up to 11GW in capacity.

The two companies will start by doing engineering and feasibility studies for a set of indirect hybrid cooling towers. These towers are intended to support up to 6 GW of planned natural gas generation and four AP1000 nuclear reactors on the campus.

Hybrid cooling towers to save water

Under the MoU, Fermi and MVM EGI will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, and assess site and height constraints. They will also model the water-saving potential of hybrid cooling at scale.

“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century, maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” stated MVM EGI P.L.C. CEO Péter Kárpáti.

The cooling design primarily uses air and closed-loop water circulation to reduce evaporative loss. The companies also plan to explore recycled water, underground reservoirs, and solar-covered retention ponds to further conserve resources.

Construction on the first tower is expected to start in January 2026, with full build-out by 2034.

Local leadership and regional commitment

The operator emphasized that the project is rooted in the local community.

“Fermi isn’t some out-of-town operation parachuting in. Our leadership is from West Texas — we grew up on this dirt, and we care about the land and its resources,” said Fermi America Co-Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer.

Neugebauer added, “As promised, we’re working with global innovators like MVM to ensure Project Matador complements the long-term water needs of the region, building something big, but doing it the right way.”

Ambitious data center and energy plans

Project Matador, to be developed on Texas Tech University land, could become one of the largest data center campuses in the world. It will cover 18 million square feet (1.67 million square meters) and combine natural gas, solar, wind, and nuclear energy to power operations.

The company has already secured multiple energy deals. In October, the company signed an agreement with Energy Transfer to connect to nearby pipeline infrastructure by Q1 2026. Earlier, it reached a non-binding deal with Siemens for up to 1.1GW of gas turbines and purchased more than 600MW of natural gas capacity through separate transactions.

For nuclear power, the project team plans four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, each with a capacity of roughly 1,100–1,117 MWe. The company is working with Westinghouse on a Combined Operating License Application to speed approvals.

The project has drawn major investment, including a successful IPO in October that valued the company at $14.8 billion. Earlier funding included $100 million in Series C equity led by Macquarie Group and a $250 million senior loan.

Even with strong support, the project has challenges. The first two phases are expected to cost more than $2 billion, and the long timeline for AP1000 reactors could make it harder for the campus to reach its 11GW goal.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IE-Photo-72.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:59:27.382186

The Department of Energy announced it renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies” effective immediately on Monday.
Colorado saw “substantial growth” in renewable energy consumption between 2005 and 2022.
Bush renamed it the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to reflect its growing range and designated the site as an official national lab.
“For decades, this laboratory and its scientific capabilities have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible and delivered impact to the nation,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director of the now-named National Laboratory of the Rockies, in the announcement.","The National Renewable Energy Laboratory based in Golden has a new name to match the shift in U.S. energy policy under President Donald Trump.

The Department of Energy announced it renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies” effective immediately on Monday.

The renaming of the lab is meant to highlight the Trump administration’s desire to invest in cheaper energy sources of all kinds, rather than focusing on renewable alternatives, the agency said.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Assistant Secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson in a news release. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources.”

The laboratory sits on a 327-acre campus in Golden by South Table Mountain. It also has a facility 13 miles north called the Flatirons Campus near Boulder.

The Trump administration wants to focus its priorities on building scientific research to “restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand,” Robertson added, in which the National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a “vital role.”

The Trump administration has pushed toward what it calls “energy dominance,” an initiative to remove regulations that are “ideologically motivated” and to limit as many barriers as possible to drive energy costs down.

The Department of Energy is led by Chris Wright, a Denver businessman and founder of oil company Liberty Energy. At his confirmation hearing, he stated he would focus on the U.S. supporting more access to cheaper energy — including geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

Some critics worry the Trump administration is rolling back plans to reduce pollution across the U.S. and efforts to support cleaner energies.

U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said the lab should continue its groundbreaking work in pushing for affordable and net-zero energy under its new name.

“President Trump’s ‘Drill Baby Drill’ slogan will never solve our nation’s most complex energy challenges,” Bennet said in a statement. “Instead, we must pursue innovation so America’s energy economy continues to compete effectively in the world and ultimately leads the global energy transition.”

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE LAB

The laboratory is a major economic generator in Colorado and had a $1.9 billion economic impact in the fiscal year 2023, according to a report released last year by the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The laboratory is one of the top five employers of Jefferson County, though it has been hit by federal cuts during the Trump administration that led to the lab eliminating 114 jobs earlier this year.

Since the lab was founded, CU Boulder’s report showed the U.S. continues to rely on natural gas and crude oil. Colorado saw “substantial growth” in renewable energy consumption between 2005 and 2022. The use of coal, which used to be a top source of energy alongside natural gas, fell 57% nationally and 40% in Colorado from 2007 to 2022.

Since then, the report said, coal is consumed about as much as renewable energies are.

HISTORY OF THE NREL

It’s not the first time the lab has been renamed. It was originally called the Solar Energy Research Institute when it opened in 1977.

The lab was created in response to the energy crisis sparked after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of oil and Saudi Arabia cut off all oil exports to the U.S.

In 1974, President Gerald Ford established the Energy Research and Development Administration — which was later replaced by the Department of Energy — and the Solar Energy Research Institute to invest in an alternative to oil.

It took several more years before it opened in Golden.

As the lab’s research expanded to other energy sources beyond solar, Republican President George H.W. Bush renamed it the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to reflect its growing range and designated the site as an official national lab.

“For decades, this laboratory and its scientific capabilities have pushed the boundaries of what’s possible and delivered impact to the nation,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director of the now-named National Laboratory of the Rockies, in the announcement.

Virden said the lab’s new name “embraces a broader applied energy mission entrusted to us by the Department of Energy to deliver a more affordable and secure energy future for all.”",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/226a_x046_4b9f_9-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 02:00:08.884679

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement.

About Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike Duke Energy customer rate increases would begin Jan. 1, 2027, with a second increase the next year, if approved by the utilities commission.
From 2027 to 2028, commercial customers for Duke Energy Carolinas will see increases of 8.7% and 3.9%.","State Attorney General Jeff Jackson said late Tuesday that he is intervening in Duke Energy’s proposed 15% customer rate hike and reviewing it to “ensure it is necessary.”

Two hours later, Gov. Josh Stein said he too is opposed to the increase, citing family affordability issues.

Less than two weeks ago, the Charlotte-based utility giant filed a revised rate request for 15% over two years with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Duke Energy said demand for electric power is rising at an unprecedented pace, and critical grid upgrades are needed for reliability, to protect against severe weather and to support North Carolina’s continued growth.

The filing would affect both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress customers, covering much of the state. Combined the company has more than 4.5 million customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Duke Energy has said the proposed rate hikes will increase reliability through power grid updates for the growing state, including new businesses that are mainly manufacturing facilities. More electricity-hungry data centers also are expanding in the Carolinas, fueled by the boom in AI that requires lots of power.

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”

Jackson’s office sent a news release to reporters about the move with the message header: “Attorney General Jeff Jackson Intervenes to Fight Duke Energy Rate Increases.”

The issue of affordability is one that continues to resonate nationally as well as locally, with politicians on both sides of the aisle seeking to claim the mantle of helping consumers.

Stein thanked Jackson for intervening. In a news release, the governor added, “Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy.

“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less,” Stein said.

When asked to comment on Jackson’s and Stein’s statements, Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton told The Charlotte Observer: “We do not take any requests to increase rates lightly, knowing that our investments to meet North Carolina’s growing energy needs will be carefully evaluated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the public, and interveners such as customer advocates and the attorney general.

“We look forward to continuing the constructive dialog of all parties as the review moves forward next year,” Norton said.

Jackson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves the western half of the state, including Charlotte. Duke Energy Progress operates in the eastern half, including the Triangle region.

About Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike

Duke Energy customer rate increases would begin Jan. 1, 2027, with a second increase the next year, if approved by the utilities commission.

For Duke Energy Carolinas customers, the monthly bill would increase by $17.22 in 2027 and by $6.34 in 2028. In the first year, that would take average bills from $144.98 to $162.20. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $168.54

For Duke Energy Progress customers, bills would increase by $23.11 in 2027 and by $6.59 in 2028. That would take the monthly bill in the first year from $163.84 to $186.95. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $193.54.

Commercial and industrial customers would also experience rate increases.

From 2027 to 2028, commercial customers for Duke Energy Carolinas will see increases of 8.7% and 3.9%. Industrial customers will see 6.3% and 3.4%. On the Progress side, commercial hikes will be about 9.2% and 4.6%. Industrial will be around 7.4% and 4.3%.

The utility commission’s decision is expected in late 2026 following public hearings.

Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands.
During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility.","On November 7, 2025, the Trump administration published its updated list of critical minerals. This update added ten new minerals to the U.S. Geological Survey’s critical minerals list, including copper, uranium, silver, and metallurgical coal. The inclusion of these minerals on the list for the first time makes it clear that the Trump administration is using the list to advance its agenda of prioritizing resource extraction over all other uses of our national public lands. Designating these minerals as ‘critical’ paves the way for land use and permitting decisions that will negatively impact Western public lands and wildlife habitats for decades to come.

What is the critical minerals list and why does it matter?

The Energy Act of 2020 defined critical minerals and specified a process and criteria for the U.S. Geological Survey (part of the Interior department) to develop and update the official critical minerals list. The law states that to be considered critical, a mineral must be essential to U.S. economic or national security, have a supply chain vulnerable to disruption, and be essential to manufacturing a product that is important to economic or national security. The law also specifically states that fuel minerals are not eligible for inclusion on the list. The list must be updated at least every three years, and the Trump administration has pledged to update it at least every two years. (In addition to Interior’s critical minerals list, the U.S. Department of Energy also maintains a critical materials list, which includes the critical minerals as well as additional materials that are vulnerable to supply chain disruption and essential to energy technologies specifically.)

Once a mineral is designated as critical, it can qualify for heightened consideration in areas such as U.S. defense and trade policy. Projects involving critical minerals can qualify for federal funding opportunities such as research and development grants, priority funding for mapping, and Defense Production Act investments. Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands. In particular, critical minerals mining and processing projects are eligible for the “FAST-41” program. This program, so called because it was created by Section 41 of the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, was originally established during the Obama administration to streamline permitting for infrastructure projects.

During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility. The Biden administration permitted two critical minerals projects—the South32 Hermosa mine in Arizona and the Stibnite mine in Idaho—through the FAST-41 program. The Trump administration has since added several more mining projects to the program. The expansion of FAST-41 beyond what Congress intended in order to include mining projects is concerning. Mining on national public lands is governed by the Mining Law of 1872, which predates the nation’s environmental laws. The Mining Law grants sweeping rights to claim-holders; once established, these rights can last for decades and prevent other uses of public lands. The impacts of mining also can last for decades, and can damage drinking water sources, wildlife habitats, and other irreplaceable natural resources. This makes mining unlike transportation infrastructure and unsuited for a program intended to streamline infrastructure development in already-impacted and developed areas of the country. The mine permitting process is often the only opportunity the government and the public have to protect public lands and the species and communities that depend on them from the negative impacts of mines, such as pollution, water usage, loss of recreation access, and habitat damage. Speeding up this process limits these opportunities to balance multiple uses of our national public lands and threatens these resources we all depend on.

What’s new in the latest update?

The 2025 critical minerals list adds ten materials not previously included. Notable among the additions: copper, uranium, and coal.

Copper, often in the form of wires, is essential to many forms of technology. Its inclusion on the critical minerals list is inappropriate because the U.S. already has significant stockpiles of copper. However, designating copper as critical could help speed up permitting for domestic copper mining projects, such as the Resolution copper mine at Oak Flat in Arizona on land sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe.

The addition of uranium is even more inappropriate since the Energy Act of 2020 specifies that fuel minerals may not be included on the critical minerals list. (Uranium is the fuel for nuclear reactors.) To justify adding uranium, the USGS pointed to President Donald Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed January 20, 2025, which directed USGS to consider whether uranium could be included on the list. As with copper, designating uranium as critical is likely intended to help boost domestic uranium mining, which in turn would support an expansion of nuclear power in the U.S. A handful of uranium projects, including the Velvet Wood mine near Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Pinyon Plain mine near the Grand Canyon in Arizona, are already moving forward. Velvet Wood is especially notable because it was touted by the Interior department as the first project to be permitted under a new fast-tracked Interior department process that compresses environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act to a mere 14 days. (This is separate from FAST-41, which expedites permitting.)

Perhaps the biggest stretch is the addition of coal to the critical minerals list. As with uranium, coal should be ineligible for inclusion since it is a fuel mineral, and the law that established the critical minerals list specifically excludes fuel minerals from the list. Rather than follow the law, the USGS relied on a Trump executive order, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” signed April 8, 2025, which directed USGS to consider adding metallurgical coal to the critical minerals list. There are several different types of coal, and metallurgical coal is the type that is suitable for use in steel production. (Thermal coal, also referred to as steam coal, is the type that is used in power plants. While metallurgical coal can also be used in power plants, it is usually more expensive. Thermal coal cannot be used in steel production.) Designating metallurgical coal as critical could help bolster both metallurgical coal mining and a domestic market for metallurgical coal in the U.S. by making projects that use metallurgical coal eligible for federal funding opportunities and expedited permitting. (Currently, the majority of metallurgical coal mined in the U.S. is exported.) However, it is also another example of disregard for the law, which states that fuel minerals may not be designated as critical, to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda of propping up the dying coal industry.

What does this mean for public lands in the West?

President Trump’s “energy emergency,” his executive order to increase domestic mineral production, and the addition of copper, uranium, and coal to the critical minerals list present serious threats to national public lands, outdoor recreation access, and wildlife habitats in the West. The Trump administration’s policies are designed to prioritize mineral production over all other uses of national public lands. These policies have already resulted in the resurrection of zombie mines, such as the Velvet Wood mine, and disregard for Tribal sacred sites, such as the Resolution copper project at Oak Flat in Arizona. Many more projects are already being fast-tracked, guaranteeing more damage to public lands and wildlife habitats in the years to come. Even when mining ceases, the impacts of these projects will be felt for decades into the future, as the West has already seen over the past century.",https://westernpriorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25134706586_9df777fb6b_k.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:38.087611

Beard said with an increase in demand for students wishing to join the music program, there is a limited amount of space, meaning several students work as the bands practice around them.
Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.","Giving Tuesday is a day for those all over the world, including Ohio University Bobcats, to share their generosity and support for those in the community.

Multiple organizations and non-profits encourage the public to donate and support various causes. This year, Bobcats have the opportunity to support the environment and local students through Giving Tuesday fundraisers.

At Jackie O’s Taproom, located at 25 Campbell St., residents and students are invited to Pints with a Purpose, hosted by Stuart’s Opera House in support of its after school music and audio program. The music program was implemented for students in the area in need of an artistic outlet to share their love of music and performance.

Juno Beard, assistant director of arts education for Stuart’s, said the opera house is supporting about 65 students this year and 11 bands.

Beard said with an increase in demand for students wishing to join the music program, there is a limited amount of space, meaning several students work as the bands practice around them.

Beard also said the rooms are large and create an echo, which might affect the songwriting process.

“So when you have really loud amps or drums (and) students trying to play their song or get the full experience of their song, it can be really difficult to hear,” Beard said.

To combat this issue, Tuesday’s event is raising money for acoustic treatment for Stuart’s practice and recording rooms. Acoustic treatment, the process of improving sound quality in a space, ensures sound waves are reflected correctly, according to Audiophiles. Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.

“It makes it so that music and sound isn't bouncing off the surfaces of the walls and ceiling and floor as much, which just makes it a more conducive listening environment,” Remnant said. “Which will benefit the students, will benefit the staff. It'll just make everything sound better.”

From every featured pint of beer from Jackie O’s, $1 is donated to Stuart’s and guests have additional opportunities throughout the night to donate directly to their fund.

Evan Seurkamp, AMP alum and instructor and member of the Laughing Chimes band, is performing, followed by Carter Tinkham, current AMP student, a solo performer and songwriter with a country adjacent sound. Beard and Remnant are also performing in their band Shirt Brothers.

“We are going to play a couple of original songs and maybe one cover,” Beard said. “It’ll be short … but just an extra thing to make it a fun evening and encourage people to get out and donate for Giving Tuesday.”

Locals can also give back Tuesday by supporting the Athens Conservancy, a non-profit land trust protecting wild land and biodiversity in the environment. The Conservancy strives to protect its 3,200 acres of land, and have partnered with the city and county to protect 300 acres of public land.

The non-profit had $5,032,824 in assets at the end of 2021, with $273,974 from contributions and grants. It is matching all donations dollar for dollar to its Bluebell fund. Dollars raised helps pay for university student’s summer internships, guided hikes, outreach programs, land acquisition and stewardship and invasive-plant removal.

Kate Kelley, president of the Conservancy, said donations will help acquire land from owners who want to protect the natural environment on their property. Kelley said the Conservancy focuses on protecting watersheds and forested areas because they are important for public health and carbon sequestration, the long-term storage of carbon in plants, soils, geologic formations and the ocean.

“(Carbon sequestration) is very important for buffering the effects of climate change,” Kelley said.

Kelley highlighted the importance and impact the Conservancy’s interns have, and said they make a positive impact in their local areas. Kelley said engaging young minds makes a difference and it is essential to have the funds to support them.

“People out of town can visit and feel what it feels like to be in a mature forest,” Kelley said. “You can see the use of your dollars in terms of carbon sequestration, and you can go out and enjoy it. It's not something far away that you'll never see, you'll never enjoy. This is right here, and everyone has access to our preserves.”

The corporate restructuring follows stringent pushbacks against Chinese owned firms in the US market.

Canadian Solar will own 75.1 percent of each JV, which will run the solar manufacturing assets through a leasing model. For Canadian Solar, founded by Chinese origin Dr. Shawn Qu, the perception battle has been an ongoing effort, with many assuming that the firm is a Chinese firm, when it is clearly not. The latest move goes further to derisk the firm's operations from action against Chinese owned firms in the US.

The three facilities to be part of the JV are a solar wafer plant, a battery factory, and an energy storage manufacturing site that is still under construction.

The China listed CSI will receive a one-time payment of CNY352 million (USD49.8 million) based on an asset valuation of CNY469 million. Post deal, CSI will focus on non-US markets exclusively.

CSI also plans to provide Canadian Solar with a counter-guarantee limit of upto CNY44.6 billion (USD6.3 billion) to support the latter in providing performance and financing guarantees for CSI and its holding subsidiaries. CSI was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2023, at the height of the boom in solar stocks in China, which has subsequently ebbed after the downturn caused by over capacity and low prices.

TVA, the nation's largest government-owned utility, reapplied for the $800 million funding opportunity in April after President Donald Trump's administration revised the grant criteria to remove diversity, equity and inclusion requirements in the original grant announced under former President Joe Biden's administration. TVA and its partners originally applied in January.

The two recipients of $400 million each, TVA and Holtec Government Services, were announced Tuesday.

TVA plans to build a 300-megawatt reactor designed by GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy by 2032. The TVA board of directors approved $350 million for the project before losing its quorum in April after Trump fired two of its members.

TVA led a team of partners to apply for the grant funding, including Bechtel, BWX Technologies and the state of Tennessee. The funding is meant to assist companies working to build the next generation of nuclear reactors, which the Trump administration has tied to artificial intelligence leadership.

The TVA reactors could be the first small modular reactors in the U.S. In May, the federal utility became the first power company to apply for a construction permit for a small modular reactor. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission could approve construction by the end of 2026.

Small modular reactors are designed to be smaller, safer and more financially feasible than large, traditional nuclear power plants.

The first TVA reactor in Oak Ridge will cost around $5.4 billion to build, according to a draft of the utility's long-term energy plan. The cost would go down with each new reactor, TVA officials have said.

""This award affirms TVA's continued leadership in shaping the nation's nuclear energy future,"" Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said in a press release. ""With (the Department of Energy's) support and the strength of our partners, we're accelerating the deployment of next-generation nuclear -- reducing financial risk to consumers and strengthening U.S. energy security. This is how we deliver reliable, affordable energy and real opportunity for American families.""

CELEBRATING AWARD

The grant is a critical source of funding for the self-funded utility, which operates under a legal debt limit of $30 billion, set by Congress in 1979 and never adjusted for inflation. TVA ended its fiscal year Sept. 30 with $23.8 billion of debt.

TVA generated a record $13.7 billion in revenue in 2025, with $1.4 billion in net income after expenses. The utility is building more than 3,500 megawatts of new power generation, enough for more than 2 million homes, mostly from natural gas plants.

Holtec, the other grant recipient, plans to build two reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. Both projects use Generation III nuclear technologies, which have similar designs to existing nuclear plants.

Three traditional nuclear plants supply around 40% of TVA's power, which is used by more than 10 million people in seven Southern states. TVA is headquartered in Knoxville and maintains its largest operations and employee base in Chattanooga.

The federal award, approved by Congress in 2024, was celebrated by members of Congress on Tuesday.

""TVA and East Tennessee are primed to spearhead the deployment of next-generation (small modular reactors) that will fundamentally change America's energy future,"" U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Ooltewah, said in a press release. ""I commend TVA, (the Department of Energy) and the Trump White House for their work in making today's announcement a reality.""

U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, R-Tennessee, have criticized TVA's board for what they claimed was a slow, bureaucratic approach to nuclear technology. The pair pushed the Trump administration to select a new board shortly before Trump fired the first of three terminated Biden appointees in March.

""I look forward to seeing Tennessee play a central role in shaping the future of nuclear power for the country,"" Hagerty said in a press release Tuesday.

Since moving to Asheville in 2004, Judy Mattox has been on a mission to protect the mountains of Western North Carolina. “Asheville is just ‘take-your-heart,’” she says. A lover of hiking and gardening, Mattox decided to increase her knowledge of the natural world and how to care for it by joining the local chapter of the Sierra Club in 2007. In 2010, she was voted WNC Sierra Club chair. “I do the little piece that I can do, although sometimes, it’s not that little.”

Mattox explains that the Sierra Club has a multitude of goals for WNC, centering around protecting natural resources, fighting the effects of climate change, and educating the public on how they can get involved. She goes on to say that a large portion of their work revolves around local politics. “Our main bottom line is to affect elections, to affect good environmental candidates to safeguard the state,” Mattox says, stating that the Sierra Club endorses the environmentally-minded candidates across the entire NC ticket, and makes sure the voters are informed on who those candidates are. In the last election, the club handed out over 40,000 endorsement cards to voters. “We have the ear of a lot of people. They’re turning to us, going, ‘Who do we vote for?’”

The WNC Sierra Club has tackled a wide variety of environmentally-related issues. In 2020, they helped to shut down the Duke Energy coal-fueled power plant at Lake Julian. Along with partner Southern Environmental Law, they fought to establish zoning laws and ordinances for steep slope developments to prevent runoff into the river, and to protect farmland from being bought out by big developers. They also helped to pass dark sky ordinances to reduce light pollution and protect the migrating birds, as well as noise ordinances to ban crypto-mining (which she says can create jet engine level noise) in WNC. Currently, they are championing the cause Plastic-Free WNC to outlaw single-use plastics. On the first Wednesday of every month, the club holds a public program covering a range of topics from Reducing Your Carbon Footprint to Birding and Wildflowers. “There’s never any lack of things to be involved with,” Mattox says of the club’s many good works. “I haven’t slept well in fourteen years.”

A recent WNC Sierra Club accomplishment that Mattox is particularly proud of is joining with high school students across Buncombe County to petition the county to approve a goal to have 100% renewable energy by 2042. In December 2017, based on the students’ testimonies, the county changed their vote and passed the resolution. “Kids are powerful,” Mattox remarks. She goes on to say that the WNC Sierra Club’s award-winning Kids Adventure Club starts early in educating children to appreciate the natural world around them. The club takes young people on hikes and trips to the NC Arboretum, and hosts kids’ programs on birds, trees and snakes. “You gotta teach kids to love nature. They’re the best reason of all to get involved.”

When Hurricane Helene hit WNC last year, the WNC Sierra Club was needed even more. They partnered with MountainTrue, RiverLink, and Asheville GreenWorks, to repair the local ecosystem with efforts like live-staking the eroded stream beds, and giving away free trees to plant. They also helped educate the public about what effects the storm actually had on the trees and forests. Mattox comments that the people who live in Asheville feel that it is their duty to protect its natural resources, and that it has one of the largest number of environmental groups in the country. “Pretty much everywhere I go, everybody I meet wants to protect our mountains, wants clean air and clean water,” she says, commenting on how rewarding it has been to see their club’s meeting attendance grow in the past few years. “We have 1.1 million acres of forest surrounding us, which is why a lot of us are here; it’s beautiful.”

In 2024, Mattox and the club’s political chair Ken Brame were awarded the Environmental Champion of the Year by the WNC Rotary Club. She also received an award in 2020 for the Adventure Club program. Mattox says that her favorite aspect of her work as club chair is that she gets to bring all of these different groups together to talk about the best options for the environment, and that she hopes her own charm, humor and directness serve her role well. “It’s really fun when things are successful,” Mattox says. “All of this takes forever, so you just keep trying, keep trying.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-02 19:02:08.697084

“But undoing Biden’s radical and reckless policies takes time, and I appreciate Alabama Power’s responsiveness to the Public Service Commission’s immediate and primary objective: providing much-needed relief to Alabama families and ratepayers.
Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.” “Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen?
That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said.
I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.","Members of the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) approved on Tuesday a two-year rate freeze proposed by Alabama Power in a recent filing.

The PSC regulates utility companies in Alabama.

Commissioner Jeremy Oden said in a statement after the vote on Tuesday, ""The high cost of living is hurting the quality of life of every Alabamian, and Alabama Power’s commitment to keep rates flat for two years is a win for ratepayers.”

“Biden’s war on American energy is over, and President Trump is ushering in the golden age of American energy dominance,” he added. “But undoing Biden’s radical and reckless policies takes time, and I appreciate Alabama Power’s responsiveness to the Public Service Commission’s immediate and primary objective: providing much-needed relief to Alabama families and ratepayers. I’m proud of the work my fellow commissioners and I put into bringing everyone to the table and pushing for real, practical solutions that make energy more affordable.""

Commissioner Chris Beeker said, “Alabama Power’s announcement that it will seek to keep utility rates flat for the next two years brings welcome relief at a time when all of us are struggling with the inflation hangover created by the Biden administration and woke initiatives like the Green New Deal.”

“Every member of the Public Service Commission sent strong signals that any request for a rate increase would be a non-starter because too many families across Alabama are already finding it difficult to make ends meet, and consumers need relief,” he continued. “We appreciate the fact that our message was received, understood, and accommodated. During his first term in office, President Trump built the greatest, strongest, and most successful economy in our nation’s history, and as a proud MAGA Republican, I know he will repair the economic damage Biden left behind, restore affordability to our everyday lives, and make America great again. At the same time, I’ll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump to stop committed communists and socialists like AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Zohran Mamdani from destroying the capitalist system that built the greatest nation history has ever known.""

Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.”

“Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen? Why is it that the utilities are going to the PSC, saying ‘Here’s what we’ll do’ in response to these reports and also I think to Sen. (Katie) Britt’s comments about high rates that Alabamians pay. That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said. “I’m sure that they’ve got concerns about what is coming. You mentioned Georgia. That’s two (PSC) seats that flipped to the Democrat Party. They’ve got to be looking from Georgia to Alabama, saying ‘Well, what’s going to take place here?’”

He continued, ""It goes back to: why do we have the difference in rates between Georgia and Alabama? WBRC reported that Alabama has the third-highest electric bills in the nation behind Hawaii and Connecticut. With that being the case, why would our rates be that high compared to Georgia and the other southern states? The answer that you receive from the Public Service Commission quite frequently when you ask those questions is, ‘Well, it gets hot in Alabama.’ Well, it gets hot in Georgia and Mississippi and Louisiana and Florida. I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.

“I think the people of Alabama are going to see this vote for what it is. It is an act being carried out by the commissioners because they are concerned about their position. I don’t think that they are going to be successful in what they are trying to do which is keep Alabamians from realizing just what a poor job the commissioners have been doing over the last several years,"" Woodall said.

Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, who is challenging Oden in the Republican primary in 2026, told 1819 News on Tuesday, “It’s ironic that the timing is five months before the election that’s coming up.”

“When you’re in a position like the Public Service Commission…it’s your job to take care of the citizens, it’s your job to take care of the businesses and make sure that there’s balance for them to be successful. It’s your job to work hand in hand for economic development (and) growth but also make sure that our citizens are taken care of and it’s your job to be a voice for them,” Gentry said.

Most participants pay or finance systems on their own, but Solar for All funding was poised to reach families without the upfront capital.
The nonprofit was preparing to deliver residential solar across the Northern Plains — projects designed to reduce bills and build energy sovereignty.","The Trump Administration sought “energy dominance” in 2025 — and dominate they did. Reminiscent of the president’s WWE days, the administration put the solar industry in a series of submission holds: tariffs, FEOC rules, tax credit tweaks, new oversight from the Department of Interior — all aimed at slowing the post-IRA renewable boom.

The quickest TKO came from EPA head Lee Zeldin, who canceled the $7 billion Solar for All program in a social media video — cutting off funding that would have expanded solar access for low-income households across the country.

But the fight over that funding isn’t over. It is escalating.

By god — that’s … that’s the Southern Environmental Law Center’s music!

The SELC started the official rematch by filing a federal lawsuit in October, joined by Lawyers for Good Government, the Conservation Law Foundation, and the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, to reverse what they call the administration’s “illegal termination” of the program. The government has 60 days to respond to the filing (Dec. 5 at the latest).

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All,” said SELC Senior Attorney Nick Torrey. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

Then came the states. Attorneys general from 22 states — plus D.C., Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin’s economic development agency — have filed their own lawsuits to force the EPA to reinstate the money. Their filings argue the agency “has no lawful authority” to de-obligate funds Congress already awarded and obligated under the IRA.

Adding to the pressure, 32 U.S. senators (30 Democrats and two independents) sent a joint letter to Zeldin demanding reinstatement:

“Your agency’s decision to terminate Solar for All is not only unlawful — given this funding was congressionally appropriated and fully obligated — but also ill-timed… Solar for All will save Americans an estimated $350 million annually on their energy bills at a time when working families need it most.”

The senators warned the cancellation is already disrupting workforce training underway in West Virginia, Alaska and across the Midwest, and pressed EPA for a full accounting of how it plans to repair what they describe as a breach of trust.

As this political brawl spills from social feeds into federal courtrooms, we’re keeping the spotlight where it belongs — on the communities and contractors left waiting.

The stakes

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 34 million American households are energy insecure, often forced to choose between electricity and other basic needs.

The 60 programs tied to Solar for All funding would have given 1 million homes access to solar power, according to the Clean Energy States Alliance, and provided more than $400 million in savings annually for decades to come.

That’s a modest start given the scale of energy insecurity — but a meaningful one, since those benefits would compound every year through lower bills, local jobs, and community ownership.

Anya Schoolman, executive director of Solar United Neighbors (SUN), estimated Solar for All would “slash household electricity costs by 20 percent, lowering electricity bills for each household by roughly $400 each year.”

The funding was spread across the map.

“Appalachian communities have been hard hit by the downturn of the coal industry and rising electric bills. Solar for All is a practical program that could create real relief for households across the region,” said Dana Kuhnline, program director at ReImagine Appalachia.

The Solar for All program had granted $637 million to projects in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky, plus another $811 million in multi-state initiatives. Kuhnline estimates that canceling those awards “undermines good work for more than 6,000 Appalachians over four years, and prevents solar installations for 150,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities.” Those projects, she added, “would have saved Appalachia’s low-income households more than $70 million on their utility bills.”

In Georgia, the funding expanded the Georgia BRIGHT program, which offers no-cost solar to about 900 low-income households statewide. Nearly 500 households signed up within 24 hours of the launch. Additional lease and community solar programs were in the works.

Grassroots programs left hanging

For Solar United Neighbors, the Solar for All cut stopped years of work mid-stride.

SUN, a nonprofit that organizes bulk-purchase solar programs, has helped more than 11,000 families install 92 MW of rooftop solar since 2007. Most participants pay or finance systems on their own, but Solar for All funding was poised to reach families without the upfront capital.

“Scale is what makes this model work,” says Ben Delman, editorial director of SUN. “Solar for All lowers the cost of solar for everybody — and lowers everybody’s energy bills — because we’re putting so much more clean electricity back on the grid.”

With that funding, SUN expected to help 6,000 families go solar in Florida, with additional projects in Texas and Indiana. Each program was tailored to local needs: some focused on single-family homes, others on community solar or multifamily housing.

In Houston, SUN was developing “Hub Homes” — resiliency centers with solar and batteries. “If the power goes out, those homes can open their doors to neighbors to charge phones, stay cool, or power medical equipment,” Delman said. “That’s the kind of locally driven design Solar for All made possible.”

Each project was also structured for long-term support, with maintenance contracts built in and opportunities for local workforce participation. All of it — from the Houston Hub Homes to the early outreach in Florida — is now on hold.

Tribal energy sovereignty on pause

For groups like GRID Alternatives, the nation’s largest nonprofit solar installer, the losses are measured in real numbers: tens of thousands of low-income households, hundreds of millions in bill savings, and thousands of job opportunities.

GRID had already begun preparing its first Solar for All ribbon-cutting, planned in Traverse City, Michigan, with Habitat for Humanity. That project, and dozens of sub-awards from other recipients eager to partner with GRID, are now indefinitely suspended.

By 2029, GRID’s two Solar for All programs — rescinded by the EPA at a value of nearly $330 million — were projected to serve 40,000 households, generate $541 million in savings, create 6,700 job-training opportunities, and avoid 3.4 million tons of CO₂ emissions.

The cuts hit Tribal programs particularly hard. Indigenized Energy, part of a coalition of 14 tribes awarded Solar for All funds, confirmed it has already made staff cuts and lost its opportunity to participate in a $135 million initiative through the Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition (TREC).

The nonprofit was preparing to deliver residential solar across the Northern Plains — projects designed to reduce bills and build energy sovereignty.

“This isn’t just about numbers on a spreadsheet,” said Cody Two Bears, founder and CEO of Indigenized Energy. “It’s about families who can’t afford their electricity bills, skilled workers in Indian Country who just lost their livelihoods, and a planet that desperately needs us to heal it. The true cost will be felt in homes, on our lands, and across our shared future.”

Bottom line: A breach of trust

Even if Congress or the courts restore the money, the damage may be done. We’re talking non-profits and small businesses. Many programs can’t survive long-term uncertainty.

“In Florida, for example, we’d already begun pre-qualifying folks,” Delman says. “To suddenly say, ‘Sorry, we’re not doing this anymore,’ is a big breach of trust — especially for communities that have been promised help before and seen it vanish.”

The sudden stop of Solar for All, through no fault of the participating organizations, risks deepening that skepticism.

“For your audience,” Delman adds, “we’re encouraging folks to reach out to their members of Congress. This money was appropriated. Congress holds the power of the purse — and this is a proven way to lower energy costs in their districts.”

But the damage goes beyond dollars. Solar for All wasn’t just about expanding access to new technology. It was about building a path forward for clean energy can serve everyone.

And once that trust is gone, no court order can flip the switch back on.

What the numbers show The report reveals that almost two-thirds of organisations have moved past proof-of-concept into live industrial AI deployments focused on sustainability.
“Climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth require customers to embrace energy transition, circularity transition and societal changes at the same time,"" says Eva Riesenhuber, Global Head of Sustainability at Siemens.
The share of respondents expecting a high or medium positive impact on accelerating the energy transition climbed from 42% in 2024 to 71% in 2025.","AI and sustainability have become two of the most powerful drivers, challenges and imperatives for industries across the globe. As expectations and urgency grow on both fronts, innovators are discovering ways not only to bring them closer together, but to make them accelerate one another.

With 74% of organisations targeting net zero by 2040, AI is fast becoming core infrastructure for tackling decarbonisation at the necessary speed and scale.

Addressing this dual challenge and opportunity, Siemens has released a report, From Pilots to Performance: How Industrial AI is Helping to Scale Sustainability Impact, produced in partnership with Reuters Events. The study covers 263 senior sustainability leaders, conducted in the third quarter of 2025.

What the numbers show

The report reveals that almost two-thirds of organisations have moved past proof-of-concept into live industrial AI deployments focused on sustainability.

“Climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth require customers to embrace energy transition, circularity transition and societal changes at the same time,"" says Eva Riesenhuber, Global Head of Sustainability at Siemens.

“The complexity of juggling global interconnected system transitions in times of major disruptions can only be mastered with AI.”

Energy management leads the way

Energy management has emerged as the most advanced application area, with 65% of organisations deploying industrial AI solutions in this field. The technology is proving especially effective in optimising energy use across assets and processes, with 52% of respondents citing it as the primary way AI will help reach sustainability targets. Real-world projects highlight the environmental upside.​

In the Netherlands, Alliander – the electricity and gas network operator serving 3.5 million customers – has adopted Siemens’ Gridscale X platform to support the energy transition. The software delivers real-time visibility via a digital twin of the grid, enabling up to a 30% increase in grid utilisation without new physical infrastructure. This added capacity is also allowing more renewable generation to come online.​

Data centres and cooling innovation

In Estonia, Greenergy Data Centers has rolled out Siemens’ White Space Cooling Optimization control system at its site near Tallinn.

The solution uses dense sensor networks to constantly track temperature and airflow, automatically fine-tuning cooling equipment to actual demand.

“When we first launched the system, it improved our efficiency by approximately 30% at the push of a button,” Kert Evert, Chief Development Officer at Greenergy Data Centers, says.

“But this was just the beginning, because the system learns, adapts and improves over time.”

Beyond boosting efficiency, AI is helping to advance circularity and resource productivity. Around 60% of organisations are using AI for resource efficiency management, while 43% apply it to improve waste handling. At the same time, predictive maintenance solutions designed to extend asset life and cut material use have been adopted by 60% of organisations.​

AI for circular product design

At the product level, AI is enabling sustainability criteria to be built into design workflows from day one. Some 63% of organisations report using generative design for physical products, helping teams optimise for material use and embedded carbon at the outset.

Eryn Devola, Head of Sustainability at Digital Industries, a division within Siemens, says AI tools are making sustainable design practical without overwhelming engineering teams.

“It’s now easier to say, ‘While we’re working on this design, let’s also address resource efficiency and carbon footprint.’

“Today, we can model these factors and embed them into decision-making to achieve the right trade-offs without adding major effort for engineering.

“And we can go further: since we’re already touching the design, we should also explore how to dematerialise, reduce size, increase modularity, etc.

“These are all key factors that contribute to creating a truly sustainable product for the long term,” she says.

Lighter robotics and cleaner glass

Siemens has showcased these capabilities with lightweight robot grippers produced from a lower-carbon polymer. The grippers weigh under 2kg and account for just 30kg of CO₂ emissions from cradle to gate, versus 670kg for traditional metal grippers weighing close to 50kg. According to the company, upgraded production lines using these components have cut energy use by around half and reduced CO₂ emissions by more than three tonnes.​

Automation Innovation, a specialist in glass production equipment, has also applied AI-powered analytics and digital twin technology to overhaul mould cleaning. The new automated system has saved 700,000 tons of raw materials annually, trimmed on-site energy demand by 30% and avoided nearly one billion kilograms of CO₂ emissions so far, while eliminating the need for hazardous cleaning chemicals.​

Rising confidence in AI’s impact

Confidence in industrial AI as a lever for the energy transition is rising sharply. The share of respondents expecting a high or medium positive impact on accelerating the energy transition climbed from 42% in 2024 to 71% in 2025. Separately, 59% say they are already using AI to help decarbonise operations, according to the Siemens Infrastructure Transition Monitor 2025.​

Brooke Tvermoes, Director of Climate, Energy and Environment at IBM’s Chief Sustainability Office, says: “We implemented AI in our manufacturing operations and the focus was actually to help improve product quality and yield.

“But by doing that we also reduced waste and energy consumption. That’s a tangible result with real dollar values associated with it, which resonates with people.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f96bd8e5eebe9be636445d38497c295d:65e74f160662555d4c2dda13a5b9a266/eva-riesenhuber-global-head-of-sustainability-at-siemens.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:58:52.524277

The 300-megawatt reactors, which could be the first of their kind in the U.S., would be built at the site of the closed $800-megawatt Palisades nuclear power plant that Holtec is reopening.

""President (Donald) Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release.

Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec has targeted a mid-2030 commissioning date for the novel reactors in Van Buren County's Covert Township. They would have a capacity of up to 300 megawatts per unit, which is about a third of what a traditional reactor produces. They are a tenth to a quarter of the size and are modular, meaning they can be made in a factory and installed on site and are less expensive.

Just look at any automaker's sales report following the credit's expiration, and the impact was clear.

Despite this, Hyundai is not backing down from its electrification strategy, which currently includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and will soon expand to include extended-range electric vehicles.

""Our EV strategy was never based on current policy because then you just have a timer until the next administration. We were building an EV plant and had an E-GMP platform prior to the IRA. And we will obviously work with whoever's in the administration to comply with whatever regulations there are at that time.""

– Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America

CarBuzz spoke with Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America, at the 2025 Los Angeles Auto Show. We learned how the South Korean automaker currently sees itself in a major consumer shift with regard to who wants a new EV. This shift may require new products, new powertrains, and a rethink on how Hyundai prices its vehicles.

EV Sales Dropped Last Month, But Are Up Overall

You may undoubtedly read headlines about how EV sales are rapidly declining and almost no one is buying them anymore. We encourage you to read deeper and use critical thinking skills, as these headlines may be intentionally misleading to get your click. Glancing at Hyundai's sales report for November 2025, EV sales were indeed down compared to the same month in 2024. The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 5 saw a 59% drop from last year, while the Ioniq 6 fell by 56%. There was not enough data for the Ioniq 9 in October 2024, and the Kona Electric is not separated from the gas model in Hyundai's sales report.

Seeing those huge negative changes compared to 2024 may seem like it spells doom for EV sales, but the numbers are already starting to level out. In fact, the November sales are up from October when the Ioniq 5 sold 1,642 units and the Ioniq 6 only moved 398 units; the Ioniq 9 remained relatively steady from last month's 317-unit pace. It's also important to look at the year-to-date sales, where the Ioniq 5 is up 12% compared to 2024 and, despite a rapidly slowing sedan market, the Ioniq 6 is down just 9%. EV sales overall are not growing as fast as they were previously, but they are not yet in decline.

Hyundai Was Ready Without The Credit

Hyundai was among the automakers most ready for the $7,500 tax credit to expire, as the Korean automaker almost immediately announced massive price cuts on its popular Ioniq 5 EV. Depending on the trim, the difference actually surpassed the amount you would have been given by the federal government (up to $9,800). This move was done intentionally to help cater to a new audience of EV buyers.

""Early EV consumers were new adopters, and now we've moved to the center of the (innovation adoption) curve. That middle of the curve is people who prioritize affordability and ease of use. We need to make sure EVs cater to them,"" Boyle explained. ""We look at it in advance and say, 'this is what the customer wants, but they will only want to pay this much in four or five years.' So we work internally with R&D to say the material cost is commonized in advance such that we can offer it at that price or readjust the options in our car.""

Even with a nearly $10,000 discount on the Ioniq 5, Boyle admits she knew October sales would not match Hyundai's lofty September numbers before the federal tax credit expired. For reference, the Ioniq 5 sold 8,408 units in September (a 152% change compared to the same month in 2024), its best sales month ever. ""A lot of people just wanted to get the credit before it went away. There was encouragement even from senators and lawmakers,"" she added.

EREVs Solve The Infrastructure Issue?

After affordability, Boyle sees infrastructure as the next major hurdle to overcome on the road to EV adoption. More chargers are a clear solution, but Hyundai believes there are other short-term answers that fit consumer's needs. ""What we've done as a strategy is a diversity of powertrains and flexibility in manufacturing: ICE, HEV, and battery EV. And now also we're saying EREV,"" she said.

""It's not a consumer issue, it's an infrastructure systems issue. It's not that I don't like EVs, it's if the infrastructure was there. That was a pain point for the middle of the curve. So you need a strategy to accommodate the middle of the curve.""

""People like to hear 'I can have a 600-mile range.' You can get that with EREV. That is a big motivator, especially if you are driving something like a truck,"" Boyle described. ""They are just looking for that max range, maybe if it's 150 or 200 miles (on electric), you can go without charging two or three days. I think it becomes more of a proposition the higher you get that all-electric range.""

It's unclear which Hyundai product will be the first to receive an EREV powertrain, but Boyle may have given a hint during our interview.

""EV-only is a tough sell, especially in pickup trucks. You don't get 600 miles. We just announced a midsize truck. Give us time.""

While Hyundai works on changing its lineup, the company is also working on improving existing infrastructure with its partnership in Ionna, a North American charging network that will soon challenge Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai is one of seven automakers invested in Ionna, helping to build DC fast-chargers across the country.

""We've only been a company for about 20 months, but we've contracted 4,000 charging bases across the US, 1,000 just in California. We plan to have 1,000 charging bays live by the end of the year,"" said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna. ""Everything we are deploying is 400 kilowatt charging: 40% NACS and 60% CCS, but we watch the market, and we can see queuing if we need to go back and make changes.""",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-hyundai-palisade-grille.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:21.215831

Coalition of Pro-Environment Legislators and Advocates Call for Passage of the Energy Leadership Act Bill During Lame Duck

Environmental champions in the Legislature joined with advocates from across the state today to ask the Senate Budget Committee to advance historic clean energy legislation at its Dec. 8 hearing.

The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act would put New Jersey on the path to 100% clean electricity by 2035. This landmark legislation is designed to lower electricity costs and create union jobs by quickly bringing locally produced renewable energy online to respond to the growing energy affordability crisis.

“Last month’s election provided a clear mandate for bold action to lower energy prices,” said New Jersey LCV Executive Director, Ed Potosnak. “The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act will put our state at the forefront of lowering electricity prices for working families while creating union jobs in growing clean energy industries. This legislation is the centerpiece of Governor Murphy’s environmental legacy, and the time to act is now.”

The press conference came after months of thorough discussions between Governor Murphy, legislators and key stakeholders to create the strongest possible legislation that creates union jobs, strengthens environmental justice protections and addresses skyrocketing energy prices.

“The New Jersey Clean Energy Act of 2024 is a critical step toward lowering utility bills and making our energy system more affordable for every family in our state,” said Assemblyman Robert J. Karabinchak (D-Middlesex). “By expanding clean, reliable power, this bill will help to stabilize energy costs while cutting emissions. It also creates strong consumer protections and supports good-paying jobs as we transition to a cleaner grid. This is the kind of forward-looking policy New Jersey needs, one that protects both our environment and our wallets.”

""Clean energy is an environmental issue and a kitchen table budget issue. Energy demands are escalating fast. More than 50 data centers have been built or approved to be built in New Jersey with 100 more applications expected in the near future. While we grapple with how to address these new development pressures, these data centers are driving demand and prices. Clean energy is the fastest energy we can build and bring to market. Clean energy is also the least expensive type of energy for New Jersey residents and businesses,"" said Jennifer M. Coffey, Executive Director Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions (ANJEC). ""Offshore wind and solar energy are also the cleanest forms of energy and will help us meet our climate change goals, which are incredibly important in the fastest warming state in the nation here in New Jersey.""

“Making 100% clean energy the law in New Jersey is not just an essential climate goal—it’s an investment in healthier communities, stronger local economies, and long-term reliable and affordable energy,"" said Patty Cronheim of ReThink Energy NJ. ""By balancing environmental responsibility with smart innovation, we can ensure a sustainable future that benefits every resident across the state and generations to come.""

Trenton must lead on this issue more than ever in the face of dangerous environmental rollbacks from President Trump and his MAGA allies in Washington — which are causing energy costs to skyrocket to further enrich oil and gas billionaires.

“The goal of 100% Clean Energy by 2035 is achievable, when we have humane leadership that considers the future of our planet, and will host all of our descendants with a healthy earth, that has clean air, clean water, and clean soil,” said Sharonda Allen, MPA, Chapter Co-Chair, Greater New Jersey Gateway Chapter of the Climate Reality Project. “This can be achieved by sourcing our energy from clean, green energy such as Solar, and the re-ignition of Offshore Wind here in New Jersey! Our geography is well-suited for smart energy production that will produce jobs and help to lower electricity costs for all New Jerseyans.”

At the same time, November’s elections underscored a clear mandate from voters to lower energy costs by investing in clean, renewable energy. This legislation would ensure New Jersey has access to cleaner and cheaper energy that can be built much more quickly than dirty fossil fuels.

“The Energy Leadership Act is the legislature’s chance to deliver on energy affordability for New Jerseyans, and we need it to become law right now. Each day, working families are bearing an energy burden created by Big Tech and our grid operator, PJM. This landmark legislation would put our state on a path toward alleviating that burden by expanding large-scale, cheap, and fast, clean energy generation. We urge Speaker Coughlin and Senate President Scutari to do what is right for New Jerseyans by securing our clean energy progress, clean our air, and bring costs down by passing the Energy Leadership Act. We now urge Senator Sarlo to post S237 on the Senate Budget.” Anjuli Ramos-Busot, NJ Sierra Club Director

“New Jersey is known for innovation, and that pioneering spirit should carry into our push for cleaner, cutting-edge forms of energy that protect people’s health, safeguard our environment, and lower costs,” said Senator Angela McKnight (D- Hudson). “Clean energy is cheaper and faster to develop than fossil fuels, and it has the power to improve affordability for families while rapidly expanding our in-state generation. We must pass the Energy Leadership Act to meet the energy needs of our state, strengthen our grid, and secure a more sustainable future for the next generation.”

""New Jersey has the opportunity to lead the nation in building a clean energy future. As a proud sponsor of this legislation, I know that promoting 100% clean energy isn’t just about protecting our environment. It’s about protecting our communities, our economy, and the generations to come.” Said Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D- Essex and Passaic).

“This is a defining moment for our state. Climate change is not some far-off threat—we already feel its effects as it devastates our communities with more frequent storms, extreme heat, and rising sea levels,” said Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex/Mercer). “Governor Murphy’s vision for 100% clean energy by 2035 is an ambitious, yet necessary goal for New Jersey to mitigate these negative effects and help create a more sustainable planet. I commend the LCV and Sierra Club for leading the charge on this front.” Senator Linda Greenstein (D- Mercer and Middlesex).

,Texas Environment,2025-12-02 21:40:21+00:00,Inside Climate News,New Analysis Provides More Evidence That Heat Standards Save Lives,"Liza Gross, Georgina Gustin",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122025/worker-heat-standards-save-lives/,"Similar precautions are included in the heat standard the Biden administration proposed last year, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to finalize by early next year.
“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.
Donate Now California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020.
But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.
“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said.","Last year was the hottest on record, but global warming isn’t just overheating the planet. It’s killing workers.

Now a new analysis of the impact of state-implemented outdoor heat standards on worker deaths adds to the growing body of scientific research showing that requiring employers to take simple precautions to prevent heat stress can reduce the risk of injury, illness and death from exposure to high temperatures on the job.

Similar precautions are included in the heat standard the Biden administration proposed last year, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to finalize by early next year.

Under the proposed federal rule, employers must provide adequate water, rest and shade when the heat index—a measure of how humidity amplifies heat’s effects on the body—reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and take additional measures, such as providing paid 15-minute breaks every two hours, once the index reaches 90 degrees.

For nearly two decades, California was the only state to mandate such protections for outdoor workers. Over the past three years, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have passed similar rules.

In the new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Affairs, labor policy experts compared heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in California, which adopted the nation’s first outdoor heat standard in 2005, with neighboring states that have similar climates but lacked a standard during the study period, from 1999 through 2020.

Critics argued that the 2005 standard was not actively enforced and its ambiguous wording allowed employers to skirt requirements. In keeping with those critiques, the researchers saw a drop in worker deaths relative to the surrounding states only after 2010, when the state enhanced enforcement and subsequently strengthened requirements to ensure workers had access to water, shade, breaks and emergency services during hot days.

The California standard became increasingly effective over time, said study author Adam Dean, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University, while worker deaths in the neighboring states of Arizona, Nevada and Oregon increased.

“After 2010, we’re finding a statistically significant association between the heat standard and heat-related outdoor deaths,” said Dean, meaning that the effect seen was not due to chance.

And there was a significant drop in heat-related deaths after stronger enforcement was implemented, Dean said, calling the observed 33 percent reduction in deaths “a conservative estimate.”

California officials ramped up enforcement of the heat standard starting in 2010 by increasing workplace inspections, issuing more citations for violations and expanding educational outreach to both employers and workers.

“The study’s methods are sound and its results are of great importance, documenting the life-saving impact of a comprehensive workplace heat standard,” said epidemiologist David Michaels, a professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health and a former top OSHA administrator who was not involved in the study.

“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.

Undercounting Heat Deaths

Far too many workers are getting sick and dying from preventable heat-related illnesses, former OSHA deputy assistant secretary Jordan Barab said in formal comments in October as the agency considered a heat standard more than 50 years after government scientists first recommended one.

“And because of severe undercounting,” Barab said, “far more are dying than we even know about.”

Heat-related deaths are routinely undercounted for various reasons, including a failure to recognize how high temperatures trigger fatal heart attacks, strokes and deadly accidents as well as inconsistent reporting by medical professionals and coroners. Heat exposure is extremely risky for workers with underlying heart or lung conditions, especially if they’re laboring in polluted air.

Because working in hot conditions can impair cognitive function and lead to accidental injury and death, Dean and his colleague Jamie McCallum, an expert on worker struggles at Middlebury College, included vehicular deaths related to equipment in agriculture, construction and transportation as potentially caused by heat stress.

While the study didn’t attribute every vehicular fatality to heat, Dean said, if the heat standard is effective, they would have expected to see a decline in those types of deaths relative to other states after implementing the policy. “What we’re saying is that the fact that these kinds of deaths in California decreased relative to those deaths in the neighboring states after the heat standard was passed is evidence in favor of the heat standard having been effective.”

In all, the team identified more than 6,000 heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in 126 counties in Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon, about 300 deaths a year on average, between 1999 and 2020. Arizona had the most deaths overall and holds the county with the highest number of deaths in a year, Maricopa County, which had 233 deaths in 2020.

All the states had spikes in worker deaths until 2010, when a very rapid increase in deaths in Arizona, plus spikes in Oregon and Nevada, together accounted for the 33 percent drop in California deaths relative to the other states, Dean said.

Dean said the study makes no claim that California’s 2010 enforcement campaign was “perfectly successful.” In fact, he said, worker deaths in California have actually increased since 2010 on average, but the increase in the surrounding states that lack a standard is much more extreme.

California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020. But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.

“Climate change and increasing extreme heat is increasing the risk of heat-related deaths among outdoor workers everywhere,” Dean said. “Heat-standard precautions can mitigate the worst risk.”

Officials with U.S. OSHA did not respond to questions from Inside Climate News about when they expect to finalize the proposed heat standard or whether they will require employers to ensure workers have adequate water, shade and rest periods during hot days.

“Chronic and Persistent Vacancies”

The finding that worker deaths decreased over time in California is notable given perpetual understaffing challenges at Cal/OSHA, the state occupational safety and health agency, as outlined in a recent California State Audit report.

The study indicates that regulations on paper, especially those with loopholes, mean very little without effective enforcement by regulators, said Garett Brown, a retired Cal/OSHA field inspector who now serves as an agency watchdog.

“California’s enforcement gains are currently being undermined by chronic and persistent vacancies among field inspectors,” Brown said, noting that Cal/OSHA is currently operating with 95 inspector vacancies, a third of the available positions, and a $16 million cut in its enforcement budget, Brown said.

Still, just having a standard on the books can help save lives, said Michaels. Many agriculture employers learned about the stronger standard, heard about citations being issued by Cal/OSHA and decided to comply with the standard by providing water, shade and rest breaks, he explained.

“More farmworkers are alive today than would be if the stronger standard were not in effect,” Michaels said. “And more lives will be saved if federal OSHA adopts a similar standard.”

As temperatures continue to rise with greenhouse gas emissions, enforcement will be ever more critical to protecting undocumented workers and others who fear retaliation for taking the precautions that save lives, Dean and other labor experts say.

“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said. “We also worry that it will not be effective in protecting workers unless it’s matched by the kind of increased enforcement that we’ve seen in California since 2010.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1629940610-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:27.946562

Food is fuel, food brings people together. Food is also big business, and innovative companies are helping advance the growing and producing of food throughout the world. Agribusiness is a thriving industry, due to consistent demand and continued scientific advances that help farmers and other stakeholders mitigate challenges.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, in its 2022 Census of Agriculture, U.S. farms and ranches produced $543.1 billion in agricultural products, up from $388.5 billion in 2017. The value of crop sales exceeded livestock sales, with crops accounting for 52% of the total.

Increasingly, technology plays a pivotal role in agriculture. The USDA Economic Research Service, in its “America’s Farms and Ranches at a Glance, 2024 Edition”, reported that farms of all sizes are using precision agriculture (PA) technologies to increase yields, reduce purchased input costs, improve environmental quality, and save on labor time. Among the top technologies were yield monitors, yield maps, and soil maps—used by 13% of small farms and 68% of large-scale crop-producing farms. Guidance autosteering systems on tractors, harvesters, and other equipment were used on 9% of small farms and 70% of large-scale crop-producing farms. According to the research, technology such as drones, robotic milking, and wearable livestock technologies are less common, especially among small farms.

While good soil and favorable weather are key components of success in agribusiness, so are location, workforce, and education.

Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more.","The U.S. energy sector is undergoing a historic transformation, driven by soaring electricity demand from new technologies, ambitious corporate sustainability goals, and major federal roadblocks. This has triggered a nationwide land rush, placing real property at the center of the energy transition conversation in the U.S. With the existing grid struggling to keep up with increasing power demands, utilities are aggressively shifting from passive energy procurement to direct real estate acquisition and development. For corporate leaders, understanding this new utility strategy is essential for strategic site selection and competitive positioning.

The Utility Shift to Real Estate and Development

Historically, regulated utilities often met renewable energy needs through long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, with independent producers. Today, utilities are increasingly pursuing direct asset ownership.

The primary driver of this shift is that it allows utilities to add the value of a power plant to their “rate base,” which is the value of property on which they are allowed to earn a specified rate of return for shareholders, as set by a public utility commission. Power purchased from others is merely a pass-through expense, offering no such return.

Direct ownership also gives utilities greater control to meet state and federal decarbonization mandates, improve grid reliability, and stabilize long-term prices. This allows them to capture the full project value, including energy, capacity payments, and renewable energy certificates. Consequently, utilities are now competing directly with power producers and commercial developers.

A Comparative Analysis of Key Transaction Models

The decision to build, buy, or simply contract for power is a complex one, forcing utilities and developers to weigh the trade-offs between risk, control, capital investment, and speed. Various transaction model options exist because there is no one-size-fits-all solution; each structure allocates critical variables differently to suit a company’s specific financial situation, risk appetite, and strategic goals.

While no single model is universally preferred, regulated utilities are showing a distinct preference for structures that result in asset ownership — such as direct ownership or build-transfer agreements — because of the powerful incentive to grow their rate base. A build-transfer agreement, or BTA, is a hybrid model where a developer handles the high-risk early stages of a project, such as obtaining site control and permits, before transferring the “de-risked” asset to the utility upon completion. This model leverages developer agility while allowing the utility to add the final asset to its rate base. While this approach mitigates early-stage risk and benefits from specialized developer expertise, it often comes with a higher acquisition cost and requires complex negotiations, especially given current market conditions.

In contrast, entities in deregulated markets or those looking to avoid massive capital outlays continue to rely heavily on the flexibility of power purchase agreements. PPAs remain a common model where a utility or other large electricity consumer buys power from a project owned and operated by an independent power producer for a long term, typically 15–25 years. This allows the power purchaser to avoid all development and operational risk and requires no upfront capital, providing predictable energy costs. However, for a utility, this path forgoes the opportunity to expand its rate base, offers less operational control, and prevents it from directly monetizing tax incentives.

In the direct utility ownership, or “self-build,” model, the utility acts as its own developer, directly acquiring land and managing the entire project. This approach offers maximum control and rate base value but places all development, construction, and financial risk squarely on the utility and its ratepayers. While it maximizes shareholder return, this model can be slower and less efficient than private development.

Mitigating the Top Three Real Estate Legal Challenges

Whatever transactional model utilities choose, proactive risk management is essential for project survival. Energy projects are defined by massive upfront capital investment and long, complex development timelines where real estate is the most critical component. Failing to proactively manage land-related risks means that fatal flaws — such as an undiscovered title defect or community opposition — may only be discovered after millions of dollars have been spent. This reactive approach inevitably leads to crippling delays, explosive budget overruns, and, in a worst-case scenario, the complete abandonment of the project, reducing a promising asset into a substantial financial loss.

First, navigating the zoning and permitting gauntlet is often the most unpredictable part of development due to community opposition and complex regulations. Such opposition and complexity may be mitigated by early and transparent engagement with local officials and community leaders; however, early engagement can be more difficult with a BTA model, where a developer is in control during this phase, potentially leaving the acquiring utility to inherit landowner issues. Success depends on incorporating local zoning codes into initial site screening and utilizing state-level siting authorities where available to streamline approvals.

Second, securing necessary land control is paramount, as unforeseen issues can present fatal flaws to a project. Obtaining option agreements creates site control with minimal upfront capital while also providing a crucial window for due diligence before committing to a long-term agreement. It is also vital to obtain comprehensive land title surveys and proactively negotiate with existing mineral rights holders, a challenge particularly pronounced in states with a long history of oil and gas activity.

Third, navigating landowner relationships from negotiation to operation is critical. Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more. A failure to establish a clear and fair agreement at the outset can lead to persistent operational friction and ongoing community opposition. Conflicts can arise over issues not clearly defined in the initial lease, such as maintenance, interference with farming activities, and access rights.

A comprehensive lease agreement, negotiated with transparency, is the foundational document for a lasting relationship. This includes clearly defined compensation with escalator clauses, precise mapping of land use and access rights, and explicit reservation of the landowner’s rights on adjacent property. Proactive operational management, including a designated local point of contact and clearly delineated maintenance duties, can also be beneficial. Finally, planning for decommissioning from the start, with a detailed plan and financial guarantee for land restoration, builds crucial long-term trust.

A C-Suite Guide to Site Selection in the New Energy Paradigm

For corporations planning energy-intensive facilities, the site selection playbook must evolve because the energy landscape itself continues to change focus. Power is no longer a simple commodity; it is now the primary gating factor for any major industrial development — especially as the race to build AI data centers increases demand for electricity. Corporations that adapt their strategies to treat energy as a critical strategic asset can secure a powerful competitive advantage, enabling faster construction and more reliable operations. Failing to evolve risks being saddled with sites that cannot be powered on a viable timeline, leading to catastrophic project delays, stranded capital, and a loss of market position.

Power availability is now the primary factor determining a site’s viability. With grid capacity constrained and interconnection queues backlogged for years, the “time to power” can make or break a major investment. Site selection teams should perform deep diligence on a location’s energy readiness by analyzing the local utility’s integrated resource plan, investigating the regional grid operator’s interconnection queue, and understanding the utility’s preferred transaction models to predict its behavior.

This reality has given rise to the “Bring Your Own Power” imperative, where leading corporations develop on-site generation to ensure power reliability. This strategy requires much larger land parcels that can host both an industrial facility and a power plant, creating a new premium class of “energy-anchored” industrial real estate. Two recent examples highlight this shift. First, Amazon Web Services acquired a 1,200-acre data center campus in Pennsylvania directly connected to a 2.5 GW nuclear power plant, securing up to 960 MW of reliable, carbon-free power through a long-term PPA. Second, Microsoft, as part of its goal to eliminate diesel backup generators by 2030, successfully tested hydrogen fuel cells to power a row of data center servers for 48 consecutive hours, proving the viability of clean hydrogen for providing uninterrupted power.

As corporations navigate this new landscape, executives must integrate an energy-first mindset into their planning. This involves elevating energy to a core business strategy, embedding deep energy diligence at the outset of site selection, future-proofing real estate acquisitions by prioritizing larger sites, and proactively engaging with utilities as strategic partners to understand long-term infrastructure plans.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id34503_utilities-are-becoming-developers1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:46.759958

Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 MW of natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are also part of a new expedited interconnection study process.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

Last December, Meta announced its intention to develop its largest-ever artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Richland Parish, about 30 miles east of Monroe, LA. The $10 billion, 4 million square foot mega site represents one of the largest private capital investments in state history and offers to fundamentally transform the economics of what has been called a “neglected corner” of Louisiana.

But Meta’s $10 billion estimate only covers a portion of what it will cost to get the site online. Entergy Louisiana previously announced it will invest $6 billion in electric infrastructure to power the project, including a 10,000-acre solar farm, three natural gas turbines, and 100 miles of new transmission lines. Carbon sequestration will offset 60% of the new gas emissions with the potential of future wind or solar expansion, according to the company.

Entergy Louisiana argues its customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, the company said.

We cannot slow down in our progress to create our New Nuclear Future, and I will keep working tirelessly as Energy and Water Chairman to continue to build on this phenomenal work that will be the cornerstone of America’s energy future.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said, “President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission. Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn(R-TN) said, “Tennessee is leading the way to deliver reliable, affordable, and secure energy for the American people. The Tennessee Valley Authority will play a critical part in shaping our country’s nuclear energy future, and I’m thrilled the TVA has been selected for a grant from the Department of Energy to accelerate the deployment of a small modular reactor at the Clinch River site.”

U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) said, “Tennessee is quickly becoming the epicenter for nuclear innovation. I appreciate President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for their confidence in our region. This grant will help advance the nation’s first Gen III+ SMR which is an important step forward for strengthening America’s energy future. It is clear that Tennessee is positioned to lead the next era of nuclear energy. President Trump’s leadership has helped renew momentum in America’s nuclear sector and support the resurgence of our industrial base. I look forward to seeing Tennessee play a central role in shaping the future of nuclear power for the country.”

Don Moul, TVA President and CEO said, “TVA is once again answering our nation’s call. Our employees are leading the way with advanced nuclear to power not just homes and businesses, but the technologies that will define America’s future. As AI, data centers, and digital infrastructure drive unprecedented energy demand, we’re building our nation’s nuclear energy foundation right here in the Tennessee Valley. This is about more than innovation, it’s about creating lasting opportunity, lowering energy costs, and securing a better tomorrow for American families today.”

Grant Award Background:

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - $400,000,000

TVA intends to deploy a GE Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear Site in Tennessee and accelerate the deployment of additional units in coordination with Indiana Michigan Power in Indiana and Elementl in Alabama. The effort would also strengthen the domestic nuclear supply chain through planned work with Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) - $400,000,000

Holtec intends to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Covert, Michigan, providing a potential viability model for additional domestic and international orders. The company is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment, serving as the technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor, operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to nearby utilities and end users.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA.","Read Time: 3 mins

On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (90 Fed. Reg. 82320, Nov. 20, 2025). The agencies’ proposal responds directly to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), and aims to align federal jurisdiction with the Court’s limitations while reducing ambiguity for regulators and regulated entities.

If finalized, this rule could significantly reduce the number of CWA Section 404 and Section 401 permits required for greenfield and infrastructure development, especially in areas with ephemeral or isolated water features. However, stakeholders should be aware that state-level regulatory responses are likely, particularly in jurisdictions that traditionally exercised broader water protections.

Summary of Key Changes to WOTUS Rule

1. Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(a))

The proposed rule narrows the WOTUS definition by specifying only two jurisdictional categories:

Traditional Navigable Waters (TNWs)

Relatively Permanent Waters and Their Adjacent Wetlands

This excludes several previously jurisdictional features and emphasizes Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” test.

2. “Relatively Permanent” Standard Clarified (§ 120.2(c)(7))

The rule defines “relatively permanent” as surface waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or during the “wet season.” The “wet season” is defined as periods when monthly precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, based on long-term climatic data. Ephemeral streams, by contrast, are excluded under § 120.2(d)(4).

Additionally, such waters must:

Possess a bed and bank

Connect to a downstream jurisdictional water via a relatively permanent flow path (§ 120.2(c)(7)(ii))

Tributaries that flow only in response to precipitation events—i.e., ephemeral streams—are no longer jurisdictional.

3. Adjacent Wetlands Must Be Physically and Hydrologically Connected (§ 120.2(c)(8))

Jurisdictional wetlands must:

Physically abut a jurisdictional water (e.g., TNW or relatively permanent water)

Have surface water continuously present during the wet season

Critically, the rule clarifies that a wetland separated from jurisdictional waters by discrete features (e.g., levees, berms, or culverts) is not “adjacent” unless surface water is continuously present on both sides during the wet season (§ 120.2(c)(8)(ii)).

4. Elimination of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

Interstate waters are no longer jurisdictional based solely on their interstate nature. They must independently qualify under the revised categories (§ 120.2(b)(1)).

Expanded and Clarified Exclusions (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(d))

The rule proposes new clarity around exclusions:

Groundwater is expressly excluded, including tile-drained and subsurface flows (§ 120.2(d)(1))

Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely in dry land are excluded, even if they eventually convey relatively permanent flow (§ 120.2(d)(3))

Prior Converted Cropland retains its exemption unless abandoned for >5 years and reverted to a WOTUS-qualifying wetland (§ 120.2(d)(2))

Waste Treatment Systems are excluded under an expanded definition that includes treatment ponds, lagoons, and infiltration systems (§ 120.2(d)(5))

Section 404(f) Farming Exemptions remain unchanged, continuing to protect routine agricultural discharges (§ 120.2(f))

Implications for CWA Permitting Programs

CWA Section 404: Fewer Permits, Fewer Delays

By narrowing the scope of WOTUS, the agencies expect a marked reduction in Section 404 permit obligations, particularly for projects involving ephemeral streams and non-abutting wetlands. This is likely to reduce costs, project delays, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) triggers tied to Section 404 actions.

Notably, in arid or semi-arid regions, where ephemeral waters dominate, the proposal could eliminate permitting requirements for many previously regulated features.

CWA Section 401: Reduced Certification Burden

Because Section 401 certifications are contingent on federal permits, the expected decline in Section 404 permits will lead to fewer 401 certification requests. This may reduce administrative workload for state and tribal agencies.

CWA Section 402: Nuanced Impact

Discharges from point sources to waters no longer deemed jurisdictional may no longer require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, permit obligations may persist if pollutants ultimately reach a WOTUS via hydrological or artificial conveyance systems.

State Response and Potential Regulatory Gaps

While the proposed rule reduces federal oversight, it acknowledges that states and tribes may respond by expanding state-level jurisdiction (90 Fed. Reg. at 82325). Currently, at least 24 states regulate waters more broadly than the federal standard, including Washington, Oregon, and California. These states may develop or expand dredge-and-fill programs to fill potential regulatory gaps.

For instance, Washington State has already initiated steps to establish a Section 404 analog at the state level, ensuring continuity in environmental protection despite federal contraction.

What Should Stakeholders Do Now?

Below are key considerations and timely moves that stakeholders may want to discuss with counsel:

Map and Assess: Identify and reassess project site water features under the revised definitions.

Engage in the Rulemaking: Public comments are due by January 5, 2026, and may be submitted through regulations.gov under Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OW–2025–0322.

Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.

Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA. While it is expected to ease permitting burdens and regulatory costs for developers, energy firms, and agricultural stakeholders, it also introduces complexities at the state level that merit close attention.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/water-marsh.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:46.838430

Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE.","The global lithium market, a critical barometer for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has entered a new phase of stabilization in late 2025, following a dramatic period of price volatility. After plummeting by as much as 90% from its late 2022 peak, lithium prices have found a floor and are now showing signs of a modest rebound. This pivotal shift offers a more predictable cost environment for EV manufacturers, potentially fueling continued innovation and broader adoption, even as the outlook for EV demand presents a mixed picture across different regions.

The Tumultuous Path to Stability

The journey to lithium price stabilization has been tumultuous. From an all-time high in November 2022, prices experienced a precipitous decline through 2023 and the first half of 2025, driven by an influx of new supply and, at times, concerns over decelerating EV growth in certain markets. This sharp downturn pushed many high-cost lithium producers to curtail or even halt operations, effectively rebalancing the market's severe oversupply. By June 2025, prices began to stabilize, with lithium carbonate futures in China now trading around 94,400 CNY/T (approximately $13,400 USD/metric ton) as of December 2, 2025 – a significant recovery from their lows, reflecting a 25.73% year-to-date gain.

Several factors have converged to underpin this stabilization. Strategic production adjustments by major lithium miners, coupled with a robust and continuously growing global EV demand – particularly strong in China, where new energy vehicle output increased by 33.1% in the first ten months of the year – have been instrumental. Global EV sales surged to 2.1 million units in September 2025, marking a 26% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, ongoing inventory drawdowns and supportive governmental policies, especially in China, have played a crucial role in preventing further price erosion. An emerging demand vector from lithium-based battery storage systems for data centers powering artificial intelligence is also contributing to the upward pressure, with projections indicating a 30-40% surge in overall lithium demand from this sector in 2026. This confluence of supply-side corrections and sustained demand has led analysts like Goldman Sachs to forecast a gradual increase in prices, with battery-grade lithium carbonate potentially reaching $11,000/mt in 2025 and $13,250/mt in 2026.

Despite the recent recovery, the market remains cautiously optimistic. While prices are not expected to revisit their 2022-2023 peaks in the near term, the current stability provides a healthier foundation for the industry. The average EV battery pack price in China, for instance, reached approximately $94 per kWh in 2025, falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold, largely due to cheaper lithium and the widespread adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries. This improved cost predictability is a significant boon for EV manufacturers, allowing for better long-term planning and potentially more affordable electric vehicles for consumers.

Companies Navigating the Evolving Landscape

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook present a varied landscape for public companies across the value chain. Lithium miners, previously battered by the price collapse, are now seeing a path to improved profitability, while EV manufacturers must balance cost benefits with intense competition and regional demand disparities.

For lithium miners, the rebound in prices is a welcome relief. Companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), which saw its stock decline due to weak lithium prices in 2024, are now poised for recovery. Albemarle has demonstrated resilience through cost execution and a focus on its energy storage segment, lifting its 2025 volume growth forecast to over 10% and returning to profitability in Q2 2025. With lithium prices showing a rebound in late 2025, Albemarle's outlook for 2026 appears stronger, with forecasts suggesting sales could reach the $7 billion range. Similarly, Livent (NYSE: LTHM), which faced a weaker outlook during the downturn, could benefit significantly from the market's shift to a potential deficit by 2026, especially given strong long-term demand fundamentals.

On the EV manufacturing front, the impact is more nuanced. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a global leader, benefits from the overall increase in global EV sales and lower battery costs. The stabilization of lithium prices should support its battery production costs. However, the cautious trajectory of EV adoption in North America, coupled with policy uncertainties and increased competition, could impact its regional sales growth. Tesla's ability to manage costs, innovate, and adapt to regional market dynamics will be crucial.

In stark contrast, BYD (HKEX: 1211) has solidified its position as the largest global EV producer, leveraging its dominance in the rapidly growing Chinese market and strategic expansion into Europe and Latin America. BYD's vertical integration, including investments in lithium mining projects, provides a significant hedge against price volatility. Analysts project a bullish trajectory for BYD's stock, further bolstered by its investments in advanced battery technologies like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries, which could reduce its long-term reliance on fluctuating lithium prices. The continued strength of the Chinese EV market, driven by competitive pricing and government support, positions BYD favorably.

Wider Significance and Industry Ripple Effects

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook are not isolated events; they are profound indicators of broader industry trends, generating significant ripple effects across the global economy and policy landscape. This period echoes historical commodity cycles, where market forces and strategic interventions reshape entire sectors.

A primary trend is the continued drive towards battery technology and cost reduction. The achievement of an average EV battery pack price of $94 per kWh in China in 2025 – falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold – is a game-changer. This is largely due to the cost-effectiveness of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cells, which are approximately 25% cheaper than NCM/NCA alternatives. This cost advantage, primarily driven by Chinese manufacturing, is creating global downward price pressure, making EVs more accessible and accelerating mass-market adoption.

The supply chain dynamics are also undergoing a critical transformation. The lithium market is transitioning from oversupply to a potentially tighter market by 2025, with a projected deficit by 2026. Looking further ahead, a significant ""raw material disconnect"" is anticipated, with lithium supply potentially trailing EV demand by 572,000 tonnes by 2034. This long-term outlook underscores the urgent need for continuous investment and strategic planning to meet future demand. Investment and resource security have become paramount, with nations like Saudi Arabia investing in lithium projects, while policy uncertainties in regions like the US could hinder domestic supply chain development. The burgeoning Energy Storage Systems (ESS) market, projected to grow by 37% in 2025, is another significant driver of lithium demand, recognizing its role as essential grid infrastructure.

The ripple effects are far-reaching. Economic impact includes reduced EV manufacturing costs, leading to more affordable vehicles and stimulating exponential market growth. However, abrupt policy changes, such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits in the US, can disrupt markets and necessitate financial adjustments for manufacturers. Geopolitical implications are intensifying, with a fierce competition for control over EV and battery technologies, particularly between the US and China. China's proposed restrictions on lithium extraction and refining technologies in early 2025 aim to enhance its control over the global lithium supply chain, highlighting the strategic importance of this critical mineral. From an environmental and sustainability perspective, the push for electrification continues to drive lithium demand, while advancements in extraction technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) are improving efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint. Recycling initiatives are also gaining vital importance.

Regulatory and policy implications are profoundly shaping the market. The anticipated reversal of key EV policies in the US under a potential Trump administration, including the removal of production mandates and the scaling back of federal tax credits, is expected to create significant uncertainty and potentially slow EV adoption. New tariffs on Chinese-made EV batteries and critical raw materials are also projected to raise manufacturing costs. Conversely, China has actively supported its EV market with subsidies, although the expiration of the zero-tax policy on EV purchases at the end of 2025 will likely trigger a surge in late 2025 sales. Europe is promoting green energy policies but also imposing tariffs on low-cost Chinese EVs to protect its domestic industry.

Historically, the current market dynamics echo precedents in other critical commodity industries. The commodity price cycles seen in lithium are similar to those in oil and copper, where periods of oversupply lead to price collapses, followed by production cuts and eventual stabilization. These cycles underscore the challenge of managing supply in volatile global markets and the enduring influence of macroeconomic factors. Just as prolonged low prices in copper can hinder investment in new mines, the recent lithium downturn slowed new project development, potentially leading to future supply shortfalls.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future

The future of lithium prices and EV demand is a complex tapestry woven with short-term volatility and robust long-term growth, demanding strategic pivots and offering both significant opportunities and challenges. As of late 2025, stakeholders are positioning themselves for an evolving landscape.

In the short-term (2025-2026), lithium prices are expected to exhibit some instability, despite the recent rebound. While a small market surplus is predicted for 2025, it is forecast to shift into a deficit by 2026. This suggests continued upward pressure on prices, though significant corrections could occur if supply disruptions don't materialize or if the adoption of alternative battery chemistries accelerates. Global EV sales will continue to rise, exceeding 20 million units in 2025, but regional disparities will persist, with China leading the charge and Europe showing strong growth, while North America faces a more cautious trajectory due to policy uncertainties. The declining average EV battery price, expected to reach US$90 per kWh in 2025, will further enhance affordability.

The long-term (2027-2040) outlook for lithium prices is overwhelmingly bullish, driven by a projected widening supply-demand gap. Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE. By 2030, a significant shortfall of 97 Kt of lithium is anticipated, expanding to 621 Kt by 2040. This structural deficit, combined with risks from project delays and underinvestment, suggests sustained upward pressure on prices. Similarly, long-term EV demand remains robust, with the total EV share of light-vehicle sales globally projected to surge to 44.6% by 2030 and 69.5% by 2035. Heavy-duty electric trucks and buses, along with energy storage systems, will significantly contribute to this growth.

To navigate this future, several strategic pivots are required. Diversifying supply chains and enhancing regional resilience are paramount, with Western nations investing in domestic lithium mining and processing to reduce reliance on concentrated production. Technological innovation in extraction and batteries is crucial, including the widespread adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) for more sustainable and efficient recovery, and continued investment in next-generation battery chemistries like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries. The development of a circular economy through recycling is also essential for resource security and sustainability. Governments must adopt adaptive policy frameworks that support domestic resources and infrastructure, while automakers need to prioritize cost optimization and affordability to accelerate mainstream EV adoption.

Market opportunities are abundant. The lithium-ion battery recycling market is poised for explosive growth, offering a critical solution for resource scarcity. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) present a rapidly expanding demand for lithium beyond EVs. Innovations in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) offer more environmentally friendly production methods. Emerging EV markets in developing economies, driven by lower-cost models, represent new growth avenues.

However, significant market challenges persist. Geopolitical and supply chain risks remain high due to concentrated production. The market is still susceptible to oversupply and price fluctuations. Infrastructure gaps, particularly in charging networks, need massive expansion. Regulatory uncertainty from shifting government policies can create unpredictable market conditions. The emergence of alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion could impact lithium demand in certain segments. Finally, environmental and social concerns of mining require continuous innovation in sustainable practices.

Comprehensive Wrap-up and Investor Outlook

The global lithium and EV markets are at a pivotal juncture in late 2025, characterized by a hard-won stabilization in lithium prices and a dynamically growing, albeit regionally varied, demand for electric vehicles. This intricate interplay underscores a market in transition, driven by strategic supply adjustments, evolving policies, and rapid technological advancements.

Key takeaways highlight lithium's impressive rebound in 2025, driven by robust demand, inventory drawdowns, and Chinese regulatory tightening. While global EV demand continues its upward trajectory, with over 20 million units expected in 2025, regional nuances are significant, particularly China's dominance. A crucial new demand driver is the emerging need for lithium in AI data centers, projected to surge by 30-40% in 2026, fundamentally expanding lithium's value proposition beyond transportation. The imperative for strategic supply chain security has also become a defining feature, with substantial investments aimed at diversifying sources and reducing reliance on concentrated production.

The market assessment reveals a shift from oversupply to a potentially tighter balance in 2025, with a looming deficit by 2026 and beyond. This is fueled by producers' supply cuts and delayed projects, alongside soaring EV manufacturing and energy storage system demands. However, the ""great raw material disconnect"" – where the lengthy timeline for new lithium mine development lags behind rapid battery facility expansion – persists, demanding massive investment. The EV market, while expanding significantly, faces challenges from market saturation and policy reversals in some regions, despite advancements in battery efficiency and charging infrastructure.

The lasting impact of these dynamics includes a fundamental reshaping of global supply chains, with a strong push for localization outside China to mitigate geopolitical risks. Technological evolution is accelerating, with LFP batteries gaining prominence and gigafactories preparing for next-gen chemistries like solid-state. The increased importance of recycling for a circular economy is undeniable, becoming crucial to supplement primary lithium sources. Perhaps most significantly, lithium's newfound role as a critical enabler for AI infrastructure signifies a profound shift in its perceived value and procurement, adding another layer of demand pressure that will reverberate for years to come.

For investors, navigating this market requires a nuanced approach. Lithium miners with low production costs, diversified operations, and strong ESG practices are well-positioned for the long-term, given the potential for structural deficits. Battery manufacturers innovating in chemistry and securing robust supply agreements offer substantial opportunities. EV manufacturers must demonstrate strong technological differentiation, competitive pricing, and adaptability to regional policy shifts and market dynamics. Companies involved in infrastructure and technology providers for charging, recycling, and advanced extraction (like DLE) are poised for growth. Key risks include market saturation, abrupt policy changes, technological challenges, and the capital intensity of new ventures. Diversification across the value chain and thorough due diligence are paramount. The unexpected, yet powerful, AI-driven demand for lithium introduces a new dimension to investment theses, potentially accelerating market tightening and price increases beyond what EV growth alone would dictate, making lithium an even more critical commodity for the future.

These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

With today’s announcement, DOE is supporting the following first-mover teams to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States:

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - $400,000,000

TVA plans to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) - $400,000,000

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, demonstrating viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad. Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

As the nation prepares for continued growth in electricity demand, President Trump has charged DOE with adding new, affordable and reliable energy to keep America energy secure. Small modular reactors offer flexible deployment, proven technology, and the ability to leverage existing supply chains, making them one of the fastest and most scalable pathways to new nuclear capacity.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

While federal agencies have scaled back EJ initiatives, states are increasingly stepping in to fill the gap–advancing new policies, legislation, and regulatory approaches aimed at integrating EJ considerations into environmental permitting and enforcement. In this edition of the Environmental Justice Update, we examine the latest key trends, policy initiatives, and legal developments reshaping the EJ landscape.

Federal

In June 2025, a coalition of almost two dozen nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for terminating over 400 grants under the Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) Block Grants program created under the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law No: 117-169) (IRA), arguing that the grant terminations were unlawful. The plaintiffs contended that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious, contravened the Presentment Clause and separation of powers, and disregarded Congress’ directive to fund the grants.

In July 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta co-led a multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit. Among other points, the amicus brief argued that the termination of the program disproportionately harms marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities, undermining the core purpose of Congress’s instruction to EPA when it passed the IRA.

In a 29 August 2025 opinion, US District Judge Richard Leon of the District of Columbia denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, saying: “Put simply, I cannot order the Government to reinstate contracts and pay money due on them.” (emphasis in original). Pointing to decisions from earlier this year by the US Supreme Court pertaining to Department of Education grants and grants from the National Institute of Health, Judge Leon also dismissed the case, agreeing with EPA that the suit belonged before the US Court of Federal Claims.

The majority of plaintiffs appealed Judge Leon’s decision to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on 16 September 2025. Plaintiff’s emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal was denied as the court found “that harm to the plaintiffs if the grant funds were returned to the Treasury was not irreparable.”

As this legal dispute plays out, Congress’s rescission of all unobligated funding under the ECJ Block Grants program as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Public Law No.: 119-21), increases the potential difficulty plaintiffs may face in quickly reinstating their grants.

Multistate EJ Guidance

In response to the rollback of EJ under the Trump Administration earlier this year,1 many states have recommitted to EJ protections through a multistate EJ guidance. Specifically, in June 2025, a coalition of state attorney generals from 13 states2 issued the “Multi-State Guidance Affirming the Importance and Legality of Environmental Justice Initiatives.” This document aims to identify sources of legal support for state EJ laws and to provide assurances to stakeholders that EJ practices remain legal despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to curtail them.

The “Multi-State Guidance” challenges the Trump Administration’s labeling of EJ as “illegal discrimination,” locating support for EJ in a variety of federal statutes and the US Constitution. Specifically, the document finds key support in:

The US Constitution:

The Tenth Amendment: Granting states the power to pass laws that advance “Public health, safety, and welfare.”

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: Barring state and local governmental entities from discriminating based on race or sex.

The First Amendment: Barring the government from conditioning benefits on the waiver of free speech rights.

Civil rights statutes, including:

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Preventing those receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race, color, and national origin.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972: Preventing federal funding recipients from discriminating on the basis of disability, age, or sex, respectively.

Title VIII of the Federal Fair Housing Act: Outlawing public or private discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin in activities related to housing.

Federal environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act’s requirement for public notice and public comment.

Nonprofit laws that prevent the revocation of 501(c)(3) status by presidential executive order or directive.

Treaty obligations to Native American tribes.

In addition to laying out what they see as the legal basis for EJ, and based on this analysis, the state attorneys general provide a “non-exhaustive [list of] examples of work that public entities, non-profit and philanthropic organizations, and businesses lawfully undertake to advance environmental justice.” These activities fall into several broad categories:

Education, technical assistance, and funding support

Public engagement and participation

Burden identification and analysis

Preventing and mitigating pollution exposures

Climate readiness and resilience

Enforcement and remedies

In sum, the multistate guidance seeks to offer stability and assurance to stakeholders by providing clarity on the EJ strategies and resources that remain available to communities in the wake of the federal repeal of EJ initiatives.

Alaska

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Republican reconciliation effort passed in July 2025, has impacted US energy and natural resource development across states and industries. Alaska is one state in particular that is positioned to experience a significant change in energy policy as a result of OBBBA. Two key OBBBA provisions—mandatory lease sales in Alaska and an adjustment of revenue sharing rates—have drawn attention from Alaska’s tribal communities, both for their potential to stimulate economic development and for the increased risk of negative environmental impacts that development could bring.

Specifically, OBBBA directs the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and gas lease sales in certain sections of Alaskan land over the next 10 years, repealing the Biden Administration’s limitation on oil and gas leasing on millions of acres in Alaska and restoring leasing policies established under the first Trump Administration. In addition, OBBBA provides an adjustment of future revenue splits from oil and gas royalties between Alaska and the federal government. This change will result in additional revenue to the Alaska Permanent Fund, which provides cash dividends directly to Alaska residents, along with state and local governments and support services.

Responses to the changes in OBBBA from Native American organizations in Alaska have been mixed. Some Native American groups have shared their appreciation for the OBBBA’s reversal of Biden administration land policies, stating that the previous administration ignored “Alaska Native self-determination” by withdrawing millions of acres of Alaskan land from development and eliminating avenues of Tribal tax revenue. Other Tribal organizations in Alaska opposed OBBBA and have expressed serious concerns that the “aggressive” oil, gas, and coal development directed in the bill puts “ecologically sensitive and culturally significant” lands at risk. Tribal groups have argued that increased carbon emissions from new oil and gas developments, combined with local pollution from energy infrastructure, will exacerbate the already-significant environmental risks.

California

Earlier this year, the state of California filed a lawsuit against the city of Tulare, a small city south of Fresno, for alleged violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The suit, filed in January by Attorney General Rob Bonta, claims that Tulare improperly approved a zoning ordinance that allows the development of cold-storage facilities in light and heavy industrial zones. Tulare approved the zoning ordinance in 2024 without conducting an environmental review under CEQA, claiming that the ordinance was exempt from the law’s requirements. Bonta’s suit argues that these cold-storage facilities could pose increased “air pollution and cancer risks” in “a previously racially-segregated community that is now one of the most pollution-burdened and disadvantaged communities in the State.” The case was disposed on 29 April 2025. Notwithstanding, the litigation highlights the state’s efforts to put pressure on a local government to fulfill its legal obligations to mitigate potential environmental harms to residents.

Colorado

This summer, Colorado’s Environmental Justice Action Task Force (Task Force) sought nominations for communities facing environmental inequities to analyze and improve health impacts. The Task Force was originally created on 2 July 2021 with the passing of HB21-1266. Housed in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the main goal of the Task Force is to propose recommendations to the general assembly on how to address EJ inequalities, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. On 14 November 2022, the Task Force published a final report detailing their work and findings over the previous year. In this report, the task force recommended that CDPHE develop a branch of the department to conduct environmental equity and cumulative impact analyses (EECIA) across the state. This recommendation led to the passing of HB24-1338 on 28 May 2024.

HB24-1338 created an Office of Environmental Justice (the Office) housed within CDPHE. This Office specifically oversees the development process of EECIAs in selected geographic areas of Colorado with the goal of understanding how environmental factors affect the health and well-being of Colorado residents. When selecting these areas, the Office must choose disproportionately impacted communities, particularly those affected by a heightened exposure to environmental contaminants. Other factors in this selection process include the proportion of low-income families, the percentage of people of color, and locations with a history of environmental racism. Once these areas are selected, the Office will partner with an academic institution or another third-party to develop an EECIA, which involves hiring a contractor to perform scientifically rigorous analyses recommended by the Task Force. Some of these recommendations include increasing oversight at petroleum refineries, improving the response of the Air Pollution Control Division to air pollution complaints, and analyzing the cumulative impacts of pollution in the air, water, and soil of these communities. Within nine months of completing the EECIA, CDPHE will prepare a report identifying its findings and recommending resources to address environmental inequities.

The impact of these EECIA analyses is intended to help direct funds and resources from the state level to the local level to address issues for communities most exposed to environmental stressors, such as pollution and extreme heat conditions.

Illinois

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) is drafting proposed statutory language to formally codify the agency’s EJ policy and associated environmental permitting review procedures. Illinois EPA is proposing to limit the enhanced permitting review process to census tracts scoring in the 25th percentile or higher based on certain environmental indicators, with the underlying data to be updated every three years.

At the same time, several proposed EJ bills have yet to pass, including SB1307 and SB1686, which propose to amend the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Illinois Environmental Justice Act respectively, and the bills remain in Assignments (Committee) after the first readings. Against this backdrop, the Illinois Pollution Control Board opened a docket for interested parties to submit proposals for procedural regulations to “provide guidance to the Board when considering EJ issues, including the selection of screening tools for identifying areas of EJ concern, in its proceedings.” Illinois EPA, the Illinois Attorney General and various environmental interest groups have submitted comments.

The proposed legislation follows a 24 March 2025 EPA announcement that Illinois EPA had satisfied its obligations under the February 2025 Informal Resolution Agreement, which was issued to resolve allegations that Illinois EPA engaged in discriminatory permitting processes. Under the Informal Resolution Agreement, Illinois EPA committed, among other objectives, to “implement[ ] enhancements to its permit review process” and “ensure [Illinois] EPA’s public involvement process will be available to all persons[.]”

Under the current EJ policy, permitting actions in “areas of EJ concern”—defined as “a census block group with a low-income and/or minority population greater than twice the statewide average”—are subject to stricter scrutiny and heightened public participation requirements. Illinois EPA currently utilizes a GIS mapping tool, known as EJ Start, to determine areas of EJ concern within the state.

Massachusetts

Enacted under Senate Bill 2521 in August 2024, the Environmental Justice Trust (Trust) was signed into Massachusetts’ state budget following a joint proposal by Attorney General (AG) Andrea Joy Campbell, Representative Brandy Fluker-Oakley, and Senator Adam Gomez. Funded through civil penalties that are received in judgments and settlements from state cases involving the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Division, the Trust seeks to benefit community health by using these funds to address economic, environmental, and health-related burdens frequently faced by residents in disadvantaged communities. The Trust will help to address longstanding disparities in environmental health faced primarily by lower-income communities in Massachusetts.

The Trust is funded by the penalties accrued from cases against:

Companies that illegally emit or emit beyond permitted amounts, toxins and other pollutants into the air;

Contractors who expose employees to asbestos during demolitions;

Companies that discharge pollutants into local rivers and streams either illegally or beyond the scope of their permits; and

Entities that wrongfully destroy essential areas of wetland and green spaces that increase flood potential in surrounding communities.

The Trust allows monies to be directed at impacted communities to address financial burdens caused by violations, rather than the monies going into the commonwealth’s general fund. The money in the Trust will specifically be used to restore impacted natural resources, investigate environmental pollution or harm caused to local property, benefit the overall health of the affected community, and provide support to academic or government-funded research to further identify environmental protection and conservation measures in these areas.

On 27 January 2025, the AG’s Office announced that the first payments of a consent judgment against four companies, totaling US$155,000, would be placed into the Trust. More recently, on 8 September 2025, a local Massachusetts company reached an agreement with the AG’s Office for a settlement of US$300,000 in civil penalties, of which US$150,000 will be deposited into the Trust for a violation of the Massachusetts Clean Air Act and illegal asbestos removal. On 10 September 2025, the AG’s Office announced another settlement agreement with a Massachusetts based company for US$115,000 in penalties, with US$55,000 going into the Trust, for illegally handling, removing, and storing asbestos.

Maryland

On 17 July 2025, Governor Wes Moore signed the Valuing Opportunity, Inclusion, and Community Equity Executive Order (The VOICE Order). The VOICE Order, which went into effect immediately, creates the Interagency Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Council (the Council), which will strive to create a unified front among the state’s agencies to deal with the issue of environmental inequity. Made up of representatives from 14 state agencies appointed by the governor, the Council will coordinate state efforts, track relevant spending, and perform several other tasks to advise the agencies on advancing the governor’s EJ priorities. For example, the VOICE Order requires agencies to use Maryland’s EJ mapping tool, MDEnviroScreen, to “track and address disparities related to environmental hazards, exposures, risks, health outcomes, investments and benefits.”

Critically, the Council is tasked with developing enhanced public participation plans for communities with EJ concerns potentially affected by certain resource extraction, waste management, and industrial and manufacturing processes and activities. The Council will also provide technical assistance to localities in developing and implementing EJ programs and making concrete recommendations to the governor regarding how to best address disparate environmental health impacts caused by state action.

Michigan

On 1 July 2025 and 22 July 2025, Senate Bill 479 and House Bill 4742, entitled the “Protecting Overburdened Communities Act,” was introduced to amend Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) environmental permitting review process. The law would require EGLE to consider the cumulative impact of all pollutant types associated with a potential project. Additionally, the bill would require the agency to account for the greater risk of harm that social and economic factors have on communities. EGLE will use its EJ screening tool, MiEJScreen, to assess projects for environmental risk. If EGLE finds a negative impact on overburdened communities without a compelling need for the project, it has authority under the legislation to deny a permit application. Further, the policy requires permit applicants to give their community 60 days’ notice for a public hearing on the permit and prepare a project impact statement. Applicants must publish the information in at least two community newspapers, including a local non-English paper.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and Tourism and the Senate Committee on Energy and Environment in July and has not progressed further as of the date of this publication.

New Jersey

On 8 October 2025, the New Jersey Appellate Division held oral arguments on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s (NJDEP) adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:1C (the Rules), which implement the Environmental Justice Law N.J.S.A. 13:1D-157 to -161 (the EJ Law).

Petitioners focused on aspects of the Rules that they argue go beyond the authority granted to NJDEP under the EJ Law, such as the Rules’ application to “zero population blocks”, and the Rules’ definitions for terms such as new facility, existing facility, expansion, and geographic point of comparison. Petitioners and amici further raised the lack of predictability that the Rules provide, particularly in terms of timing of the EJ process and NJDEP’s application of the EJ stressors, which petitioners noted were implemented in the EJMAP tool without being properly subject to administrative procedures.

In response, NJDEP argued that the department reasonably and permissibly filled in the gaps provided in the law using its expertise. NJDEP and its amici also argued that the Rules’ definitions meet the plain language test and are consistent with defined terms in other NJDEP regulatory programs. The court pressed NJDEP on a number of issues including the Rules’ threshold for measuring the contribution of adverse cumulative stressors, NJDEP’s development of its EJMAP, and the fact that the Rules do not factor economic considerations.

The court has taken the matter under advisement for further consideration.

Conclusion

Our EJ Task Force continues to closely monitor developments in this rapidly evolving area, including the updates highlighted above. As the EJ focus continues to evolve, businesses—particularly those operating in overburdened communities—should remain vigilant and track policy shifts and enforcement trends at both the federal and state levels. Staying informed and proactive is essential to managing risk and aligning with emerging compliance expectations.

QUOTES

“The EPA was born from the power of our voices demanding for our fundamental rights to clean air, water, and land to be protected. Over half a century later, we cannot let the EPA dismantle critical protections that will allow polluters to once again poison our water, fill our lungs with smog, and disproportionately harm environmental justice communities. The future is ours to shape! We will keep fighting for an EPA and government that protects our rights, our health, and our future where all people breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have the opportunity to thrive.” – Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice

“Our communities built the movement that created the EPA 55 years ago. We refuse to go back to the days of burning rivers and deadly smog. The Trump administration is twisting the EPA’s mission on its head, and sacrificing our health and the livelihoods of our families for the sake of billionaires’ profits. We won’t stand by while the few protections we have left are dismantled. We demand clean air, safe water, and a healthy future for every family, no matter their ZIP code.” – Mar Zepeda, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“Fifty-five years ago, people-power led by communities on the frontlines of pollution and injustice pushed our government to create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA. That power still lives in environmental justice communities today. The EPA is meant to protect us from corporate polluters. Now is the moment to demand a new path, one where the EPA and our government truly embed environmental justice, honor community leadership, and deliver full health protections our communities have fought for across generations.”– Paulina López, Duwamish River Community Coalition, Seattle, Member of the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum

“Intense public concern over pollution and advances in science led to the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 55 years ago. Today, clean air, clean water, safe food and thriving communities remain enduring demands of the American people. The Trump Administration’s rollback of critical environmental regulations, elimination of environmental justice grants, and attacks on science fundamentally betray EPA’s mission and stand on the wrong side of history. Join the conversation about creating a roadmap for an EPA and federal government that truly protects public health and the environment, addresses the climate crisis, and embeds justice and equity throughout its programs.” –Charles Lee, Principle Author of the foundational report Toxic Wastes and Race, former Senior Policy Adviser at the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights at the EPA, Visiting Scholar at Howard University School of Law

“When the first Earthday gathering happened, thousands of people turned up in Central Park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to demand that we, as a nation, pay more attention to addressing environmental threats and harms. Just a few miles north in the historic Harlem neighborhood a huge Black and brown community was struggling with air pollution triggered asthma rates, lead poisoning from old housing stock, a lack of green space, and many other environmental threats. But for the most part my neighbors and I had no idea the historic Earthday gathering was taking place in Central Park, and we were not invited. One especially significant outgrowth of the first Earthday celebration was the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I didn’t know it at the time, but the standing-up of the U.S. EPA and the formation of West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT) some seventeen years later, would become intertwined as we worked to fight against a host of environmental harms enveloping our community. Most especially air pollution owing to the fact that we had the highest levels of PM 2.5 exposure of any community in the United States. Along with alarmingly high incidences of asthma and rates of premature death from asthma and other respiratory diseases. In collaboration with Harlem Hospital, the Columbia University Children’s Environmental Health Center, and the NY Urban program of NRDC we worked for thirty years to urge EPA to lower the level of the PM 2.5 standard which triggered local, state and federal action to improve air quality, particularly in overburdened communities like ours. Last year the Biden-Harris administration finally lowered the PM 2.5 standard from 12 to 9 micrograms. But a few days ago the current administration decided to abandon that revised standard and revert back to the higher level of allowable exposure. We know that many more people will die as a result of exposure to this hazardous air pollutant. Rest assured that we will not relent in our advocacy to restore EPA to its former glory, and to see them once again vigorously enforce environmental regulations to protect vulnerable communities like ours.” – Vernice Miller-Travis, Co-Founder and Board Member of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, Executive Vice President at Metropolitan Group

“Dr. Clarice E. Gaylord, the first Director and Founder of EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice along with a cadre of early environmental justice grassroot community leaders and a multi-discipline force of dedicated individuals from academia, business, local government and nonprofit organizations laid the groundwork for such a Roadmap. Prime examples were created both Agency specific as well as via interagency partnerships to promote national community driven projects. Two of these examples I managed and are most proud of is the 2003 EJ Collaborative Problem Solving (EJCPS) Grant Program (led by Dr. Gaylord) and the 2005 Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) Program (led by Rob Brenner formerly of the Office of Air and Radiation). Most importantly, was the development of Agency wide management of these two programs. There was both a national management as well as a regional management. EPA headquarters and regions managed the EJCPS program and for the CARE program there was added specific federal interagency agencies to assist in management. Building upon the foundation of these two very successful programs, with adequate time and resources could begin tackling the complex social and economic problems in local communities across the nation.” – Dr. Marva King Lorthridge, former Senior Policy Advisor with the Environmental Justice Office of the EPA

“People-power built the EPA 55 years ago, and people-power must save it now. As corporate polluters work to gut safeguards and steer the agency away from its mission, we cannot lose sight of what’s at stake. The Environmental Protection Network stands with communities across the country in demanding an EPA that truly serves the public — one that centers communities, equity and justice in every decision.” – Michelle Roos, Executive Director, Environmental Protection Network

Last fall, DOE announced $80 million in RMUC funding that will directly support more than 400 electric co-ops’ cybersecurity programs.
Electric co-ops are committed to doing their part, but collaborating with the federal government remains crucial, Lindahl said.
“With continued partnership and targeted investment, we can strengthen our defenses, protect critical infrastructure, and keep the lights on for 42 million Americans.
The last two decades have seen significant advancement in how electric cooperatives secure our grid, but there is much more work still to do.” Erin Kelly is a staff writer for NRECA.","Electric cooperatives are working together on innovative ways to strengthen their cybersecurity, but they can’t do it alone, a Kentucky co-op leader told a House panel Tuesday.

“Smart, targeted federal support through funding, workforce development and improved threat intelligence sharing is essential,” Tim Lindahl, president and CEO of Kenergy Corp., testified at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy.

“This will help close the resource gap and ensure rural communities are not left behind in the national effort to secure our energy infrastructure.”

Specifically, Lindahl asked lawmakers to reauthorize the Department of Energy’s Rural and Municipal Utility Cybersecurity Program and release its remaining funds. RMUC, a $250 million, five-year program authorized by Congress through fiscal year 2026, represents what he called “a generational opportunity to improve the cybersecurity posture of electric cooperatives and municipally owned electric utilities.”

“RMUC prioritizes co-ops with the greatest need of support that serve the nation’s most critical infrastructure, including military installations, to help them make the necessary investment to secure the grid,” Lindahl said.

Last fall, DOE announced $80 million in RMUC funding that will directly support more than 400 electric co-ops’ cybersecurity programs.

“Much of that funding has yet to be released to the award winners,” Lindahl said. “We encourage DOE to move expeditiously to distribute the awarded funds so that electric cooperatives can put them into action to defend their critical infrastructure.”

Electric co-ops face unique challenges in securing the grid because of their rural, often remote, locations and the fact that they are not-for-profit businesses, he said.

“Because cooperatives operate without shareholders or profit incentives, financing costly investments often requires reliance on debt, which must be approved by their boards and is ultimately paid back through rates paid by their members,” Lindahl explained, adding that one in four households served by co-ops earns less than $35,000 a year.

“These resource constraints can make it difficult to invest in advanced technologies and recruit and retain a skilled cyber workforce necessary to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, especially those from nation-state actors.”

Despite these obstacles, co-ops are uniting to do everything they can to improve their cyber readiness, said Lindahl, whose Henderson-based co-op serves over 60,000 homes and businesses.

“Co-ops across the country are coming together and thinking innovatively to overcome these challenges,” he said. “The seven cooperative principles, like concern for community and cooperation among cooperatives, are the driving force behind what we do.

“Additionally, our national trade association, NRECA, is leveraging private and public dollars to develop cybersecurity tools and resources to improve information sharing, deploy new technologies and build a capable workforce.”

Among those tools, he said, are the NRECA Threat Analysis Center, a secure technology platform that helps the co-op community detect, analyze and communicate cybersecurity threats, and the Co-op Cyber Goals Program, which helps co-ops improve their cyber defenses.

Electric co-ops are committed to doing their part, but collaborating with the federal government remains crucial, Lindahl said.

“With continued partnership and targeted investment, we can strengthen our defenses, protect critical infrastructure, and keep the lights on for 42 million Americans. The last two decades have seen significant advancement in how electric cooperatives secure our grid, but there is much more work still to do.”

(the ""Company"") (TSXV: DME) (U.S. OTC: DMEHF) (Frankfurt: QM01) from the President of the Company. DME is pleased to announce it has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to form a joint venture to build and operate a sodium–nickel–chloride (""SNC"") battery manufacturing facility in Roswell, New Mexico. The proposed operation would utilize produced water from regional oil and gas wells as part of an environmentally responsible cooling and processing system designed to support both battery production and a planned artificial-intelligence (""AI"") data-center complex.

Strategic Use of Produced Water & Integration with AI Data Center

Under the contemplated structure, produced water from area operators would be treated and repurposed for cooling and processing needs, thereby significantly reducing the volume of water extracted from the aquifer, as well as lowering operating costs for smaller oil and gas producers. Desert Mountain Energy's own wells generate minimal produced water, but the Company's processing expertise positions it to serve as a strategic solutions provider to neighboring operators.

The initiative also supports the Company's plan to use its natural-gas resources to generate local electricity for the produced-water system and the adjacent AI data-center infrastructure, creating a vertically integrated and energy-efficient footprint.

Sodium, REE and By-Product Management

As part of the produced-water treatment process, salts and certain critical rare earth elements (""REEs"") are extracted and separated.

Sodium will be dried and utilized directly in the production of SNC battery units.

Isolated REEs will be dried, sealed, and shipped to qualified facilities for further refining.

This creates multiple value-added revenue streams while minimizing waste and maximizing the commercial usefulness of extracted materials.

About SNC Battery Technology

Sodium–nickel–chloride batteries are known for their stability, long lifecycle, and strong safety profile. Unlike lithium-ion systems, SNC batteries cannot burn or explode, making them well-suited for grid support, industrial power systems, and data-center applications. Altech Batteries Ltd., a global leader in the space, is currently constructing a US$170 million SNC plant in Saxony, Germany, underscoring the technology's growing commercial relevance.

Altech's publicly available research notes several advantages for SNC chemistry, including the potential for alumina sourced from recycled specialty aircraft components—supporting broader circular-economy initiatives.

Economic Benefits for Roswell and the State of New Mexico

The joint venture and associated AI-infrastructure development are expected to create new job opportunities and diversify revenue sources for Chaves County and the State of New Mexico. Increased support services for smaller oil and gas operators—including lower disposal costs and extended well life—are expected to lead to higher production levels, which in turn increase tax contributions to local schools, counties, and state programs.

The initiative aligns with local, state, and federal programs offering incentives for energy-transition manufacturing, critical-materials management, and advanced-technology deployment, including elements referenced in yesterday's Genesis Mission Executive Order from the White House.",https://www.nacleanenergy.com/images/,N,,2025-12-02 22:58:48.045419

That’s a design, manufacturing, and governance reality, not a marketing claim. As Steve Richey, VP at eBliss Global, puts it: “Battery safety in all applications is and should be a concern for all people. This starts with good stewardship and understanding of any assembly, manufacturing, and use of a battery pack. Brands own a responsibility to design and produce safe products and an obligation to share proper usage.”

Recalls, and battery supplier risk

Recent headlines highlight the risks. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) urged consumers to stop using and properly dispose of certain Rad Power Bikes batteries (models RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304) after dozens of reports of fires and significant property damage. The New York Times reports on the CPSC advisory, emphasizing the urgency of the issue.

CPSC said in its news release the following: “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris. CPSC is aware of 31 reports of fire, including 12 reports of property damage totaling approximately $734,500. Some of these incidents occurred when the battery was not charging, the product was not in use, and the product was in storage. The batteries were manufactured in China.”

China is the world’s largest source of lithium-ion cells and packs, with both top-tier manufacturers and low-cost vendors, making robust battery suppliers vetting essential. The key risks with third-party battery suppliers include inconsistent cell grading and matching, undocumented part substitutions, relabeled or counterfeit cells, weak battery management system calibration, inadequate process controls for moisture and contamination, poor weld and insulation quality, gaps in traceability, and logistics exposures such as temperature extremes and handling damage.

Tesla recently recalled about 10,500 Powerwall 2 home battery systems due to a third-party battery cell defect that could cause overheating and, in some cases, smoke or fire. If a high-end, stationary system can be exposed to a supplier defect, the risk from third-party or mismatched batteries and chargers in e-bikes is even clearer.

Rad Power Bikes disputes the CPSC’s findings, citing a low incident rate compared to over 100,000 units and claiming compliance with high standards, stating, “The incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent. While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products.”

The statement continues: “Contrary to the CPSC's statement, mere exposure to water and debris does not create a hazard; rather, significant water exposure, as warned against in our manuals, can pose a hazard. These risks apply across industries and exist even in products that are fully UL compliant.”

Certify the system, not just the pack

This kind of conflict is precisely what unified, enforceable standards aim to prevent, where everyone in the e-bike ecosystem agrees to follow — manufacturers, third-party battery suppliers, importers, retailers, building managers, and riders.

When standards are harmonized, independently verified, and tied to traceable certifications, disputes can be resolved with data against an agreed baseline. Without that baseline, safety becomes a negotiation, with different rules by city, landlord, marketplace, or brand allowing risky products or practices to linger in the market and in homes.

Uniform standards must address the entire electrical system, not just the battery pack. That means mandating recognized certifications for both the pack and the complete e-bike system, validating cell quality, battery management architecture, thermal and abuse performance, ingress protection, and charger compatibility, to name a few.

Enforcement, traceability, and rider education

But paper standards without enforcement are promises without protection. Regulators should harmonize requirements across jurisdictions and enforce them at ports, during market surveillance, and on online platforms, blocking uncertified or counterfeit packs and mismatched chargers. Retailers must require third-party documentation, maintain verifiable serial numbers linked to certification files, and support rapid incident reporting. When hazards emerge, recalls and advisories need practical pathways for collection and safe disposal through municipal hazardous waste channels.

Riders need accessible, certified service options when battery packs are damaged, water-intruded, or show early warning signs. As Richey emphasizes, education is part of the engineering solution: proper charging, storage, and use, plus recognition of “key warning signs of battery degradation and or failure,” supported by “recent certifications, warnings, and education.”

Battery safety is not just a marketing claim; it is a system property that must be engineered, verified, and enforced. To prevent fires from making headlines, a baseline with unified standards is necessary, along with providing riders with education and access to certified service and end-of-life collection. When all stakeholders operate under the same rules and face the same consequences, safety stops being a matter of debate.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt36e77ec5607b90bc/692f3eb8494432e501a2fa5b/GettyImages-2217284511.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 16:01:49.385409

The news isn’t surprising, of course, as federal tax credits have disappeared. What is surprising, however, is the rise of gas-powered Mustang sales. In November, Ford sold nearly as many pony cars as it did EVs. I don’t just mean the Mach-E, but all electric Ford offerings combined.

Mustang sales have been slow this year up until this point. The automaker moved just over 1,800 examples in September. But Mustang shoppers turned out in force in November, with Ford selling an impressive 4,207 Mustangs last month.

By comparison, the Blue Oval brand only sold 4,247 EVs. That would be the Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit. Each of those models experienced a rapid drop-off last month. But one month only tells part of the story.

Overall, the EV lineup has achieved a greater sales volume year-to-date compared to the Mustang alone. Ford has sold nearly 80,000 electric vehicles in 2025 compared to just over 40,000 Mustangs.

While Mustang sales are still down year-to-date, the November uptick helps close the gap. This time last year, Ford had sold 41,528 Mustangs. In 2025, that figure is 40,870. The electric vehicle drop-off is worsening for Ford, particularly for the Lightning and E-Transit.

Ford moved just 227 electric vans in November. Just a year prior, Ford sold 1,240 examples of the electric Transit in the same month. That’s an 82 percent dip. The Lightning is down 72 percent this month compared to the prior year.

There are a few bright spots in Ford’s sales numbers. The Maverick is doing great. Ford sold 9,883 units in November, compared to 6,899 at the same time last year. Additionally, the Ranger is up 36 percent in November compared to the same month last year. As a whole, the automaker is up over 6 percent year-to-date.

It will be interesting to see if the Mustang finishes the year on a high note. The iconic pony car is experiencing a 1.6 percent decline in sales year-to-date compared to 2024. A strong December, however, could push it in the right direction.

As for the EVs in the family, the drop is likely to continue unless Ford serves up some serious incentives. So if you’re shopping for an EV, keep your eyes peeled for some serious deals as we head deeper into the holiday season.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBXv6k/s1/2026-mustang-ecoboost-with-the-rtr-package.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:00.931859

Five additional projects are under construction after reaching final investment decisions: Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG and CP2 Phase 1.
Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction.
The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets.
North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth.","North America is positioned for a major expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity by the end of the decade, with the United States, Canada and Mexico expected to add more than 17Bcf/d of new liquefaction capacity by 2029, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. The additions would more than double the region’s export capacity and represent more than half of global LNG growth projected through 2029.

The United States remains the primary driver of this expansion. With 15.4Bcf/d of existing capacity, US developers plan to add 13.9Bcf/d between 2025 and 2029 through a series of Gulf Coast projects. Several terminals, including Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III, have begun limited cargo shipments despite not having entered commercial operation. Five additional projects are under construction after reaching final investment decisions: Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG and CP2 Phase 1. Pipeline construction delays remain a key risk for the timing of future export flows.

Canada is advancing capacity on the Pacific Coast. LNG Canada shipped its first cargo from Train 1 in July 2025 and is expected to reach full capacity of 1.84Bcf/d in 2026. A proposed second phase would double the facility’s capacity after 2029. Two more projects, Woodfibre LNG and Cedar LNG, with a combined capacity of 0.7Bcf/d, are scheduled to begin exports between 2027 and 2028. Their location shortens shipping times to Asian markets compared with exports from the Gulf Coast.

Mexico is emerging as a strategic component of this regional expansion, even though its new capacity is comparatively smaller. Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction. The Fast LNG Altamira platform off the East Coast, supplied with US gas through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline, produced Mexico’s first LNG export cargo in August 2024. On the Pacific Coast, Energía Costa Azul is adding 0.4Bcf/d of capacity, also reliant on US feedgas. Both projects support Mexico’s shift toward becoming a re-export and transit hub for North American natural gas.

Implications of North American LNG Growth for Mexico

Mexico’s geographic position and growing midstream network are central to this shift. The country’s pipeline interconnections with the United States, along with access to both the Gulf and Pacific basins, have strengthened its role as a distribution corridor for regional gas flows. Industry analyses note that Mexico is positioned to expand from a net importer to a commercial platform that can process, store, and re-export natural gas to global markets. This evolution aligns with private-sector interest in leveraging LNG infrastructure to connect US supply with Asian and Pacific demand.

However, the strategy also raises structural questions for Mexico’s domestic energy system. The country remains heavily dependent on US pipeline gas for power generation and industry, and its emerging LNG capacity is not tied to increased local production. Independent analysts warn that large-scale export-oriented buildouts could raise wholesale gas prices and affect electricity affordability for consumers and industrial users, especially if global LNG markets tighten. Growing reliance on cross-border gas flows also places greater importance on regulatory stability, permitting timelines and pipeline reliability.

The broader geopolitical context adds another layer of complexity. US energy diplomacy has increasingly centered on securing long-term LNG influence, encouraging partner countries to sign multi-decade supply contracts. This approach offers supply stability but can lock importing nations into fossil fuel systems with long-term financial commitments. Global analyses indicate that as renewable energy and storage technologies become more cost-competitive, long-term LNG infrastructure could carry opportunity costs for emerging markets. These dynamics are relevant for Mexico, whose energy policy prioritizes sovereignty and domestic production but must also respond to regional market pressures.

Latin America is already grappling with the implications of this shift. Analysts note that new LNG import infrastructure across the region, including in Mexico, can reinforce long-term dependence on fossil fuels and divert investment away from renewable generation and electrification. The United States has also demonstrated willingness to use tariffs to influence energy behavior, as seen in its recent tariff increases on India for continued purchases of Russian energy. Such actions signal the potential for trade and energy policy linkages to affect future decisions in Mexico and across the hemisphere.

Mexico’s role in the regional LNG network is therefore multifaceted. The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets. At the same time, increased exposure to LNG volatility and structural reliance on imported gas require careful coordination between regulators, state-owned companies and private investors. Future policy decisions will influence whether LNG infrastructure reinforces long-term national strategies or creates new dependencies during a period of rapid global energy transition.

North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth. The timing and execution of US, Canadian, and Mexican projects will shape international gas markets and regional energy security, with Mexico increasingly positioned at the crossroads of these shifts.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/pexels-photo-13378350%20%281%29.jpeg?h=62c404c8&itok=D7L-z16m,N,,2025-12-02 16:03:49.185600

Automakers are betting on hybrids as they cope with an EV slowdown

Ford sold only 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month.

The loss of key electric-vehicle tax credits is still hurting automakers. That pain could linger, but there's a lone bright spot for the industry: Hybrid sales are surging.

First, the bad news. Ford Motor Co. (F) said Tuesday that it sold just 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month, a nearly 61% decline from the 10,821 units the Detroit automaker delivered in November 2024. That steep hit stems from poorer sales of each of Ford's EV models.

Sales of Ford's most popular EV, the Mustang Mach-E SUV, dropped by more than 49%, while deliveries of the E-Transit van took an 81.7% hit compared with a year earlier. Just 1,006 F-150 Lightning pickup trucks were sold last month, which reflects a 72.4% year-over-year decline as Ford reportedly considers axing the model.

At the same time, Ford is selling more hybrid vehicles. The Detroit automaker has delivered more than 206,000 hybrid vehicles through November, a 19.4% increase compared with the same 11-month period in 2024. It sold 16,301 hybrids last month, up 13.6% from a year before.

Part of that dynamic is because hybrids are typically viewed by consumers as an attractive alternative to expensive all-electric vehicles, since they are more eco-friendly than traditional gas-powered cars. In the wake of the expiration of the U.S. government's $7,500 tax credits for EVs, some automakers are also putting hybrids into focus.

More from MarketWatch: Tesla's Cybertruck is turning 2. It has been a big flop.

""We thought we were going to leapfrog the hybrids, but we can't,"" Kjell Gruner, CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, said at an October Reuters conference when discussing his company's plan to focus on EVs. ""We're all in"" on hybrids, he added.

That's part of why Toyota Motor Corp (JP:7203) plans to invest heavily to boost hybrid production in the U.S. over the next five years. Honda Motor Co. (JP:7267) also plans to double down on hybrids in the U.S., with a platform designed for large-scale vehicles.

Ford is ""prioritizing hybrids across our lineup, including the development of extended-range hybrid options,"" CEO Jim Farley said on his company's third-quarter earnings call.

Hyundai Motor North America said Tuesday that U.S. sales of its Ioniq 5 SUV and Ioniq 6 sedan more than halved in November compared with a year earlier. Kia America Inc. also reported steep declines in sales of its electric SUVs: the EV9 and EV6.

Executives at both companies owned by Hyundai Motor Co. (KR:005380) touted their hybrid lineups. Randy Parker, the chief executive at Hyundai's North American business, also noted that the brand hit a new monthly record for hybrid sales, which grew 42%.

Hochul’s decision to direct NYPA towards advanced nuclear development marks a pivotal moment for New York’s industrial future.","New York has taken a significant step toward reintroducing nuclear energy as a core component of its long-term industrial and economic strategy. In June 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear facility, signaling that the state is preparing to meet rapid load growth driven by advanced manufacturing, data centers and electronification. This shift positions New York to compete for the next generation of power-intensive industries, including semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and advanced materials production.

For companies evaluating expansion or site selection in New York, this moment presents a rare opportunity to engage early as the state defines its approach to its advanced nuclear deployment.

New York’s Policy Shift Toward Advanced Nuclear

Gov. Hochul’s directive reflects a broader national and global trend: advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular rectors (SMRs) are moving from concept to commercial readiness. Her public statements frame nuclear power as a tool to:

Attract large, energy-intensive manufacturers to upstate New York;

Strengthen grid reliability as AI, cloud services and electronification accelerate demand;

Provide stable, zero-emission baseload that complements intermittent renewables; and

Position the state as a leader in next-generation clean-energy deployment.

The combination of strong public support from the governor and the NYPA mandate creates a strategic opening for companies with significant future energy needs.

Technology Landscape: Advanced Reactors Move Toward Deployment

Advanced reactors represent a fundamental shift in how nuclear energy can be deployed and financed.

Modular manufacturing: SMRs can be factory-built, shipped and deployed quickly, reducing construction duration and cost risk.

Scalable output: Units can be sized to support industrial campuses, fabrication facilities or data-center clusters.

Enhanced safety: Passive safety systems decrease overheating or meltdown risk.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.

These attributes directly align with sectors that require high-reliability and predictable long-term energy costs.

Remaining Barriers: Financing and Regulatory Certainty

Despite technological progress, deployment still faces:

Regulatory complexity, even as NRC modernizes its review process;

High capital costs in early phases; and

Financing gaps for first-of-a-kind projects.

Discussions in Congress regarding a potential national infrastructure financing authority could materially change the landscape. Federal credit support, long-term financing tools and project development incentives would reduce risk and enable deployment in markets like New York.

Strategic Considerations for Manufacturers and Large Load Users

Companies considering New York should evaluate opportunities to engage early in state planning processes. Early action can secure:

Preferential access to nuclear-enabled industrial hubs;

Priority positioning in procurement and interconnection discussions;

Eligibility for state and federal incentive programs;

Opportunities to partner with reactor developers, utilities and public agencies; and

Influence over emerging regulatory, siting and permitting frameworks.

This early engagement can materially affect cost structure, siting certainty and long-term operational competitiveness.

This milestone marks the dawn of a cleaner, more sustainable era in a place deeply rooted in Entergy’s history.

Honoring the past, powering the future

The solar facility site sits adjacent to what was once the iconic Sterlington Station, Entergy’s historic generating plant that first came online in November 1925.

In its earliest days, Sterlington Station was described as a “mighty power giant” for good reason: it started with two turbogenerators producing about 25 MW and was rapidly expanded into one of the largest power plants in the South by the late 1920s. The plant’s location was carefully chosen under the leadership of Entergy founder Harvey Couch for its access to abundant natural gas, water from the nearby Ouachita River, and its strategic position in a growing agricultural and industrial region.

Workers built a whole company town nearby: homes for about 50 families, a school, a church, even a boarding house for single employees. Over the decades, Sterlington Station fueled economic growth across northern Louisiana — and now, a century later, Entergy is writing a powerful new chapter by embracing renewable energy.

“To celebrate the ribbon-cutting of this solar facility at the very site where our roots first took place a century ago is profoundly meaningful,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president CEO. “It’s a testament to how far we’ve come — from the mighty power of Sterlington Station to the clean, sustainable promise of solar power. This is not just an investment in energy, but in Louisiana’s future.”

“The Sterlington Solar Facility stands as a powerful symbol of progress—honoring the legacy of Sterlington Station while embracing a cleaner, more resilient future for Ouachita Parish and all of Louisiana,” said Todd Edsall, president of Power Providers for Black & Veatch. “Our team’s dedication to safety and excellence is reflected in the thousands of incident-free man-hours invested here. This project is more than a source of renewable energy; it’s a catalyst for local jobs, economic opportunity and environmental stewardship. By working together with Entergy and our community partners, we’re helping to build a brighter tomorrow and ensure that Sterlington’s legacy continues to power Louisiana for generations to come.”

A clean-energy investment for the community

The Sterlington Solar Facility was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission as part of a larger renewable energy build-out: the 49-megawatt solar project is among approximately 225 MW of new facilities greenlit to bolster Entergy Louisiana’s clean energy portfolio.

This development is more than symbolic — it reflects Entergy’s commitment to modernizing its fleet, reducing its carbon footprint and investing in north Louisiana.

“This facility reflects our long-term commitment to modernizing our energy portfolio, reducing emissions, and creating economic opportunity in Ouachita Parish and beyond,” May added. “It’s a legacy honoring the past while shaping the future.”

Economic and environmental benefits

Job creation and local spending: The project contributes to the local economy during construction and operation.

Cleaner energy: As a zero-emission solar resource, the facility helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels and supports Entergy’s sustainability commitments.

Community participation: The Sterlington Solar Facility is part of Entergy Louisiana’s “Geaux Green” (Rider GGO) program, enabling customers to opt into renewable energy and help drive demand for clean power.

Infrastructure resilience: Investing in diversified energy sources strengthens the grid and supports long-term energy reliability.

A legacy renewed

From its humble beginnings — when Harvey Couch built the Sterlington Station to bring affordable power to a growing region — to today’s solar-powered present, the Sterlington community remains at the heart of Entergy’s mission. This ribbon cutting celebrates continuity, innovation, and a shared vision for a cleaner, brighter tomorrow.

1 | Part 1: Breaking down Denver’s Waste No More ordinance

Denver has begun implementing its community-led Waste No More ordinance, sweeping legislation designed to transform the city’s waste collection system toward a circular economy model. Given the compressed timeline between passage and enforcement, city officials established key milestones leading up to the deadline of September 1, 2026.

2 | Ohio start-up turns plastics into high-end furniture

Ohio’s Marble Plastics began, as many good ideas do, from frustration and an unanswered question: Why were small, high-quality plastics slipping through the recycling system untouched? During his early career at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, founder Joseph Klatt often found materials with clear value but no viable match, and those moments pushed him toward a different path. “I wanted to be on the side of actually doing the recycling part myself,” he said.

3 | Canadian PROs join forces to align design guidance

Five Canadian producer responsibility organizations are joining forces to provide clear, consistent guidelines to make packaging design recyclable, with plastics guidance anchored in the Association of Plastic Recyclers Design Guide.

4 | Michigan’s bottle bill at a crossroads

A new report from the University of Michigan warns that the state’s signature 10-cent bottle deposit system is faltering, with redemption rates dropping to their lowest level in decades and structural gaps threatening the program’s ability to support Michigan’s recycling and climate goals.

If there were a dictionary entry for Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drill, baby, drill”, it might be accompanied by a photo of Meg O’Neill.

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company’s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana’s history.

The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That’s basically equivalent to Woodside’s combined Australian operations. Trump’s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash “American energy dominance”. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking.

Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is “open for business”, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer.

We are bending the rules of this column: O’Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O’Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O’Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. “I like American-style filtered coffee,” she says. “I brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.”

O’Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh – and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John’s on Newfoundland island.

In 2018, O’Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet – “I had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ approach to who I was at work,” she says – but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company.

This is O’Neill’s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is “drill, baby, drill”, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

That includes an embarrassing 58 per cent of shareholders who voted against the company’s climate report at last year’s annual meeting, and a legal challenge to Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to approve an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG project to 2070. The UN’s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae.

It doesn’t rattle O’Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels.

She says Trump’s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia.

“It’s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,” O’Neill says.

“It’s opening the conversation up to one that’s not just, ‘We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else’, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.”

O’Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy.

In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O’Neill calls “highly ambitious”. “I don’t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,” she says.

How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. “While there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,” she says.

“The question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input – that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry – has not been addressed. You’re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That’s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.”

O’Neill’s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it “very tasty”. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid.

For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found – from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

In the Australian National University’s recent study on the 2025 election, the proportion of voters who ranked climate change as their most important issue fell to 5 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2022.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O’Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby’s bidding.

“In Australia, there’s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,” she says.

“So, I don’t know if it’s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it’s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it’s going to end up being poor for the consumers.” She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. “It’s not good for anyone.”

But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent a year – more than the annual emissions of some countries – despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country’s largest untapped conventional gas resource.

Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.

New laws that passed the federal parliament last week are a mixed bag for gas producers; coal and gas projects are not eligible for new “streamlined” approval pathways following negotiations with the Greens, but they may benefit from moves to eliminate duplication between state and federal assessments.

Part of this is, again, the Trump effect. Australia’s critical minerals deal with the US, agreed in principle during Anthony Albanese’s recent trip to Washington, means getting rare earth projects off the ground quickly. “Drill, baby, drill” is becoming not just a slogan but a policy the US exports to its allies.

O’Neill lays out a stark reality for a global company such as Woodside, which is eyeing a roughly 50-50 revenue split between Australia and the US early next decade. The US has plenty of gas, favourable taxation rates and a relatively quick process for environmental approvals. In Louisiana, the combined state and federal tax rate will be about 25 per cent.

“We have to ask ourselves first and foremost: where is the resource? Australia compares quite favourably to the US [on that],” she says.

“Where do we have confidence we can progress investments at a reasonable pace and generate returns for our shareholders? That’s where we’re fighting some headwinds in Australia.”

There has been speculation Woodside could shift its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but O’Neill says that’s not true. “We intend to maintain our primary listing in Australia.”

Before we leave, I ask O’Neill about life in Perth. She lives in City Beach with her wife, Vicky Hayes, and their teen daughter. Despite its isolation, O’Neill enjoys the relaxed pace and what she calls an “entrepreneurial spirit” that seems to imbue west coast cities.

“I like that feel of a city where people are ready to roll up their sleeves and make a difference,” she says. “It’s got a bit of the wild west to it.”

An NFL fan who backs the Houston Texans, O’Neill has been forcibly acquainted with Australian rules football, courtesy of Woodside’s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers. Woodside chairman Richard Goyder is also the outgoing chair of the AFL Commission.

O’Neill says she found the rules “a little fuzzy” and difficult to follow at first, but is now a convert and attends half a dozen matches a year. “I love the game. It’s fast-paced, it’s high scoring, there’s tremendous athleticism. It’s the full package.”

Not that the rules have gotten any easier to understand. “Like, why was this thing a push in the back and that thing was not?”

I could try to explain, but our time is up, and O’Neill is off – more meetings, and more drilling, await.

Demand for electric vehicles has taken a hit after Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill ended the $7,500 tax credits for new EV purchases in October.

Ford also had to contend with the impact of a fire at one of the plants of a key aluminum supplier, hitting production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup.

Sales of Ford's EVs, such as the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, were down about 61% to 4,247 vehicles in November from last year.

Overall sales of the Detroit automaker in the month slipped nearly 1% to 164,925 units from a year earlier.

Several automakers released November U.S. sales tallies Tuesday, including South Korea's Kia Corp. 000270 , which posted a 2.7% gain, and Honda Motor 7267, which said sales for the month fell 15%, hurt by a shortage of semiconductors.

Sales of Hyundai’s two top-selling EV models in the U.S. – the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 – each fell more than 55% in November. Overall sales slipped 2%.

Randy Parker, Hyundai’s CEO of North America, told Reuters the automaker expected a sharp decline following the tax credit’s expiration. He said some shoppers who may have been interested in a fully electric car have chosen hybrids, sales of which surged 42% for the month.

Parker said Hyundai will continue to push its EVs, and that he wants to get an “unfair share” of sales in the market.

Bernie Moreno said Tuesday.
They went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game,"" the freshman lawmaker from Ohio said during an auto industry conference.
Moreno, an auto dealer turned influential policymaker in Washington, has frequently railed against Biden-era moves to set aggressive emissions targets and boost federal support for EVs.
We're playing our game, and we're not going to allow these cars to come into the U.S. market,"" Moreno said.
The lawmaker's remarks came during an on-stage conversation with John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.","Washington — The United States should quit trying to compete with China on electric vehicles, Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said Tuesday.

""We were ahead of them by a mile, by 10 miles, on the internal combustion engine. They went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game,"" the freshman lawmaker from Ohio said during an auto industry conference.

""That was just irrational, dumb policy.""

Moreno, an auto dealer turned influential policymaker in Washington, has frequently railed against Biden-era moves to set aggressive emissions targets and boost federal support for EVs. He again condemned those policies and criticized American allies for allowing Chinese autos inside their borders, even as many in the industry stress that U.S. manufacturers need to find their own success with electric powertrains or risk ceding the future to China.

The senator called out Europe as a warning sign for the United States. Chinese automakers nearly doubled their market share in the European market during the first half of 2025, now exceeding 5% of new vehicle sales per data from JATO Dynamics Ltd.

""You have to be insane to allow the Chinese to take over the auto industry all over the world in a predatory way like that,"" Moreno said, responding to a question about China's excess automotive manufacturing capacity.

""You guys have Chinese infrastructure. You have Chinese automobiles,"" he continued.

""Why would you allow a country to bring in automobiles that would destroy your own industrial sector? That is, they're not here to compete. They're here to destroy. And you have, what, 90 car companies in China, all subsidized by the government, trying to kill each other.

""That's not about healthy competition. It's about taking over the auto industry and making the world dependent on their technology.""

Moreno also celebrated major policy changes during the first year of the Trump administration that cut back on the Biden-era federal push toward EVs. He highlighted congressional action to cancel stringent state-level EV regulations, the zeroing out of fuel economy fines and an end to federal EV subsidies.

Yet more changes are coming, as the Trump administration completed a review last month of key fuel economy standards. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the White House is expected to announce the new regulations Wednesday.

""We're not going to play (China's) game. We're playing our game, and we're not going to allow these cars to come into the U.S. market,"" Moreno said. He also said consumer preferences should guide automakers in the adoption of EVs and other new technologies.

The lawmaker's remarks came during an on-stage conversation with John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. His organization, the top automotive lobbying group in Washington, put on the conference Tuesday, bringing together policymakers, analysts and industry leaders.

Bozzella probed at Moreno's EV stance: ""Do we need to have a balance, though, between supporting our current leadership on internal combustion engines and remaining a cutting-edge technology developer for automotive technologies of the future? Do you worry that we risk becoming sort of an island market if we aren't keeping up with technology investments?""

The senator was unmoved. ""I pushed back on the premise that EV somehow is about innovation,"" he said. ""Electric vehicles were around in 1910. It's not like this new technology.""

""I'm all for innovation, but having a car driven by a 2,000-pound battery is not innovation in my mind. Now, maybe at some point in the future, there's somebody out there that invents something new. Who knows what comes up? But government shouldn't play the role of putting their hands in the scale.""

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-02 18:38:58+00:00,Charlotte Observer,Charlotte region faces data center energy and grid strain,"Catherine Muccigrosso, Caitlin McGlade",,,,,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/business/article312306586.html,"Understanding data centers Americans have lived with data centers for the better part of a century.
AI-oriented data centers are designed to support complex AI workloads, while traditional data centers focus on general computing tasks.
Apple’s data center in Maiden, spanning 505,000 square feet, is currently the state’s largest data center with capacity for 100 MW.
Data center scale remains blurry So how many data centers are in the Carolinas?
More data center worries It’s crucial to manage data center development to prevent transferring costs to other customers and to avoid worsening climate impact, said Jimenez, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.","In early October, one hand after another shot up across a packed room at Matthews Town Hall, where more than 100 people impatiently waited to speak. They called out comments for over two hours, eager to challenge a developer’s vision for a sprawling data center campus near downtown.

The proposed complex would span 123 acres and place five two-story buildings on a mostly wooded lot, with capacity for 600 megawatts — dwarfing all other data centers in the state and requiring enough juice to power about 450,000 average homes for a year.

Many residents felt like Lindsay Sawey, who lives near the proposed site. “They can’t change my mind,” she told The Charlotte Observer during the meeting. “I’m just here so that I can complain.”

The room grew heated as people peppered officials with questions about noise, power bills, water usage and fire safety. Still, not everyone opposed the plan. One man stormed out, calling his neighbors close-minded and yelling: “You won’t listen to the experts.”

It’s a ferocious debate playing out across the Charlotte region, as well as nationally and globally.

Over the past couple of years, the surging use of artificial intelligence fueling apps, websites and other tech has turbocharged the need for rapid expansion of massive data centers to handle the demand. The Carolinas is now seen nationally as a rising hub that’s helping expand that supply.

At this tipping-point moment for the industry here, new and serious concerns have emerged, The Observer found:

The energy needs of 30 data centers that are planned or under construction across the Carolinas, according to one industry report, would more than double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Projected demand on the power grid creates a slew of unknowns that North Carolina utility regulators have only recently begun to grapple with publicly.

The lack of public disclosure about the industry’s growth leaves the public in the dark over such basic questions as: how many data centers are in the Charlotte region now, what’s coming next and how much energy will they use?

“Without any transparency, without any sort of central source of information, it’s understandable to be very worried,” said Nick Jimenez with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit.

Understanding data centers

Americans have lived with data centers for the better part of a century. They began in 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania with the advent of computers.

Such centers operated inconspicuously in the Charlotte region for decades. Two data centers on a block on East Trade Street in uptown went virtually unnoticed until one of them filed for expansion in September.

But over the past couple years, their rapidly expanding scale is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.

“AI is really transforming the data center landscape,” said Eric Masanet, professor in sustainability science for emerging technologies at UC Santa Barbara. “A lot of investments are being made, a lot of competitive models being developed, that’s requiring lots and lots of additional AI servers, which require lots and lots of additional data centers.”

Today’s data centers are warehouse-like facilities housing computer servers and components essential for storing, processing and disseminating large amounts of data.

Tech giants such as Google and Amazon own Charlotte-region data centers. Other owners include Digital Realty and Segra, whose sites are built for a single user or as “colocation” sites with space leased to multiple businesses.

Not all data centers are alike. AI-oriented data centers are designed to support complex AI workloads, while traditional data centers focus on general computing tasks.

That means the facilities also operate differently. For example, Segra’s data center near Charlotte airport is cooled using HVAC while bigger data centers proposed for the region, like the one proposed in Matthews, use a closed-loop water system.

Segra, a Charlotte-based fiber network, recently doubled its size to 28,000 square feet at International Airport Drive with a $10 million investment.

Digital Realty, a Texas firm, plans to knock down a pair of century-old office buildings and construct a four-story, 12 MW data center on East Trade Street covering nearly the entire block. It also intends to open what would be the region’s largest data center campus in west Charlotte at 400 MW and 3 million square feet.

Here’s how such power usage breaks down, according to Duke Energy:

100 MW is equivalent to powering 75,000 homes.

1,000 MW equals 1 gigawatt, or GW, equivalent to powering about 750,000 homes.

Apple’s data center in Maiden, spanning 505,000 square feet, is currently the state’s largest data center with capacity for 100 MW. The $1 billion complex elevated the Catawba County area northwest of Charlotte as a data center corridor when it opened in 2010.

Big Tech continues to pour billions of dollars into Carolinas’ data centers to keep up with AI demand.

In February, Apple announced a $500 billion expansion plan for data center capacity and other projects around the U.S., including its North Carolina sites. And in October, Amazon broke ground on a 20-building, $10 billion data center to support its AI needs on 800 acres in Richmond County, between Charlotte and Raleigh.

Data center scale remains blurry

So how many data centers are in the Carolinas? Where are they and how much energy do they use?

No definitive public source can answer that.

Companies such as Chicago-based real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield offer some insight by combining information from multiple public and private entities. The Carolinas, counted as one group, appeared as an emerging market for the first time in the firm’s annual America’s Data Center Update list.

There are 67 data centers operating in the Carolinas, according to the report released in September. Another 26 — many substantially bigger than existing ones — are planned and four are under construction.

The Charlotte region, including Rock Hill, accounts for more than half of the existing data centers with 38, said John McWilliams, head of data center insights at Cushman & Wakefield. The region also has one center under construction and another 22 planned.

A quarter of the centers under construction in the Carolinas are in the Charlotte area, McWilliams said.

All told, the Carolinas has projects requiring a combined 400 MW under construction and another 2.7 gigawatts for planned projects, McWilliams said. That’s nearly double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Another company examining growth, Datacentermap.com, tracks thousands of facilities and offers energy capacity statistics on some sites. But company founder Sune Christesen, who provided the Observer with the firm’s data, cautioned that the company wasn’t confident about the stage of development each center was in as changes are hard to track.

When the Observer set out to verify Datacentermap.com data, most companies on its list responded, but not all shared basic information.

For instance, Microsoft refused to confirm the project status of the data centers planned or under construction near Hickory, Maiden and Roxboro near Durham, despite having posts about the ones in the Hickory and Maiden markets on its website.

Other local projects also have been shrouded in secrecy.

Residents frustrated with data center approval

On Nov. 7, 2022, just over the state line from Charlotte, York County Council members in South Carolina unanimously approved a seemingly routine 27-item consent agenda. It included a plan little noticed at the time: the first step for the county selling 173 acres in the Lake Wylie area.

A week later, the board held a special meeting for second approval on what it now said was an economic development deal dubbed “Project Cobra.” The meeting lasted all of two minutes.

The council unanimously approved the sale the following week, with no mention of what “Project Cobra” entailed.

That picture began to get clearer seven months later. In June 2023, York officials said the project and a related incentives deal involved a whopping billion-dollar investment for a new data center — the largest economic investment in county history.

As is common in such development work, the name of the company still was not publicly revealed. But the Observer’s sister paper, The Herald in Rock Hill, soon sussed out that a Kansas data center firm called QTS was behind the deal.

A September 2023 county agenda officially disclosed that “Project Cobra” was for QTS, and the council unanimously approved the data center incentives deal.

QTS is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in the Lake Wylie area. County leaders later approved allowing the campus to be built 80 feet high, 20 feet taller than other industrial or commercial properties.

But QTS said it does not release expected megawatts totals of its data centers.

More than three years after the county first referenced “Project Cobra,” and over two years after York County revealed who was behind the project, QTS held an informal community meet-and-greet Nov. 4 in Lake Wylie.

“This has been secretive like I’ve never seen,” one of the residents said, as a group of people huddled around QTS Development Program Manager Ryan Wehmann, bombarding him with questions.

Stacy Armstrong agreed. “We could not win because we didn’t know it was coming,” said Armstrong, whose Wedgefield Drive home borders the data center construction site.

Armstrong carried an inch-plus-thick notebook of documents and illustrations from research she’d done on the QTS plans, along with questions about potential risks from light pollution, noise levels and electric bill hikes.

“And the more we ask, the less scientific data we get,” Armstrong said. “ I have a ton of questions. I have less answers.”

She was about to undertake a major house renovation, but no more. Now, she’s planning to move.

Power demand impact

Public sector and nonprofit organizations are tuning in to the implications of this tech-sector boom.

In August, Gov. Josh Stein created the North Carolina Energy Policy Task Force, noting the need to power data centers amid the emergence of AI, among other trends, prompted new questions about how to “maintain an adequate, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity supply”.

And in October, the North Carolina Utilities Commission hosted a conference to study how to fairly and efficiently manage the growing electricity demand.

Key concerns included whether the power grid can handle the new demand, whether existing customers will have to pay more and what energy companies would do if they put resources into a big expansion only for the project to fall through.

The Carolinas risk power outages during winter storms in the mornings and evenings, said Stony Martin, manager of reliability, models and studies at the Southeastern Electric Reliability Corp. The nonprofit is a watchdog for the electric grid in the southeastern and central U.S.

Martin said at the conference that “the risk will only get worse” with expected demand from major energy customers like data centers.

Duke Energy is aware of the concerns.

The Charlotte-based utility giant assesses each high-demand proposal to determine if it’s feasible with the existing power grid, if it would require updates and whether the location is feasible, Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman said.

Duke Energy holds these customers to minimum billing requirements and other terms to ensure they “pay their fair share,” Poorman said.

And for the first time, Duke Energy published a report this year tracking forecasted growth from major energy users like data centers.

It counted 35 large-electric-load projects in the advanced planning stages in the Carolinas. From January 2024 to last spring, the number of projects didn’t change, but the report stated their forecasted energy needs grew by 50%.

While the report doesn’t specify how many are data centers, it’s clear that their growth is transforming the Carolinas.

“It’s not the same market that existed to serve local demand anymore,” Cushman & Wakefield’s McWilliams said. “It’s really growing into a regional player, and potentially has the opportunity to grow into a global player as well.”

A data center ‘evolution’ in the Carolinas

North Carolina and South Carolina have become an industry focal point as operators seek alternatives to “Data Center Alley” Virginia and, more recently, Atlanta, experts say.

“It was only a matter of time before the Carolinas began to experience the surge in activity seen over the past year,” Cushman & Wakefield’s latest annual report said. “Centrally located on the East Coast, the region boasts strong power infrastructure, robust fiber connectivity and favorable deal economics.”

The Charlotte area stands at the core of the Carolinas’ boom, McWilliams said.

Most of the current construction activity covers hyperscale sites by major tech companies. Hyperscale data centers are large-scale facilities that can rapidly handle massive computing power and data storage, typically consuming more than 50 MW annually.

But there’s a shift underway in the Charlotte region. It features more wholesale colocation sites by providers like Digital Realty.

Many colocation centers in the Carolinas, with an average facility size under 5 MW, are not equipped to meet the heavy demands of hyperscalers that now average 73 MW, according to Cushman & Wakefield’s report. “This market is at the beginning of its evolution,” the report stated, “and will soon host a growing hyperscale presence.”

Duke Energy and data centers

As the sector keeps growing, and residents keep pressing for more information, power utilities really are the only ones with the answers, according to CBRE. The commercial real estate services firm tracks data center growth within leasable space, but not the big, owner-operated facilities.

That brought us back to Duke Energy.

Data center developers trying to locate here sign contracts with Duke Energy committing to pay for certain amounts of energy before they launch. Duke Energy does not make the details of those agreements public, including the company that signed.

At the conference, both Sierra Club climate and energy advisor Jeremy Fisher and the Data Center Coalition’s director of energy policy Lucas Fykes, told utilities commissioners that they want to see more transparency in data center development planning.

“By the time we’re looking at a small number of customers that have the potential to consume more than 20% of the utility’s energy consumption, we need to start ... wondering what the implications are for other customers,” Fisher said.

Duke Energy ensures that data centers pay the “full cost of the infrastructure required to serve them, so those costs aren’t passed on to residential customers,” Poorman told the Observer.

Not everyone’s convinced.

Speaking at the utilities conference, Fisher said existing energy customers bear the brunt of the risk of rising electricity costs as data centers plan to move in.

More data center worries

It’s crucial to manage data center development to prevent transferring costs to other customers and to avoid worsening climate impact, said Jimenez, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

In northern Virginia, data centers already are being blamed for higher utility bills.

Fisher cited a 2024 Virginia legislature study, which concluded that data center energy demands would likely increase costs for the typical Dominion Energy customer by $14 to $37 a month by 2040. Dominion is proposing a new rate class for utility customers that use more than 25 MW.

Poorman told the Observer that comparing North Carolina and Virginia’s electricity systems is “apples to oranges” because they are regulated differently, which presents key differences in how resources are planned and rates are set.

In North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act became law in July. It allows Duke Energy to charge customers for new power plants, such as gas and nuclear, before construction is complete to keep up with growing energy needs, including from data centers.

Stein had vetoed the bill, which was overridden by state lawmakers. The governor cited a bill analysis by N.C. State University researchers that showed it could cost North Carolina ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050 due to higher fuel costs, the News & Observer reported.

Duke Energy has argued the changes will allow it to lower the price paid by customers for new generation facilities over a project’s lifetime by decreasing financing costs, and that legislators have cited an overall cost savings of as much as $15 billion.

Other concerns about hyperscale data centers in communities around Charlotte and the rest of the country include:

Water consumption: Data centers require lots of water to cool their systems. A single center can consume up to 5 million gallons a day, or enough daily drinking water for 50,000 households or farms, according to a University of Tulsa in Oklahoma report.

Land use and visual impact: These facilities are typically large, utilitarian buildings surrounded by security fences that cover large plots of land that some critics say could be better used.

Limited job creation: While data center construction provides many jobs, the long-term workforce is often small, typically several dozen or so.

‘What Matthews is all about’

While some Charlotte-area communities have embraced new centers, others, like Statesville and Mooresville, remain resistant.

Back in Matthews, neighbors were adamant they wanted nothing to do with a data center. Such a development isn’t as good a fit for the town as several hundred homes would be, resident Jim Dedmon said at the October meeting.

“You’re helping improve the town with families, not data centers,” he said. “You’re building community. That’s what Matthews is all about.”

Six days after that meeting, developers Engineered Land Solutions and Crosland Southeast withdrew the rezoning request for the project.

Matthews residents celebrated the news. Developers withdrew the request due to “overwhelming public distaste” for it, Mayor John Higdon said, and he doubted they’d resubmit it.

But despite all the unanswered questions and concerns enveloping similar projects, experts say one thing remains certain: more data centers are coming to the Carolinas.

It’s possible.

Energy leaders in 10 southern states, including Kentucky, are working to launch the Southeast Energy Resilience Accelerator, or SERA, group — an initiative responding to funding opportunities currently being afforded by the Economic Development Administration.

If approved at the regional, state and federal levels, this part of Kentucky might have the option to be involved.

According to the October 2025 Kentucky eClearinghouse Report, which is provided as a monthly update through the Pennyrile Area Development District, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation is beseeching Commonwealth officials to procure at least $5 million in federal appropriations — with a $1.25 million applicant buy-in — in order to:

+ Create a collaboration between the Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance, E4 Carolinas, several regional energy trade associations and three Georgia Tech interdisciplinary research institutes: the Strategic Energy Institute, the Advanced Technology Development Center and the Manufacturing Institute, in hopes of responding to an Economic Development Administration funding opportunity.

+ And, then, run no less than a 30-month program that could discover avenues forward in sustainable energies, and their ultimate production and distribution.

Sources indicate that initial funding, again, if approved, would come from the EDA’s FY 2025 Disaster Supplemental Implementation Path, with longer-term support expected from industry sponsors.

SERA would then serve 544 FEMA-designated disaster counties in the 2022-24 window across these 10 southeastern states — focusing on nuclear, hydrogen and similar resilient energy technologies capable of on-site fuel storage, micro-grid support or mobile deployment.

For Kentucky and the News Edge listening area, this would include Caldwell, Christian, Crittenden, Hopkins, Lyon, Logan, Muhlenberg, Todd and Trigg counties.

This is all building on prior federal funding of two completed regional studies — “The Economic Impact of the Nuclear Industry in the Southeast United States” and “The Green Hydrogen Value Chain in the Southeast United States” — which, among many insights, notes that:

+ Hydrogen production units are located in the Southeast U.S.— primarily in Calvert City and Catlettsburg in Kentucky; Decatur, McIntosh and Saraland in Alabama; and the country has other active production units in Georgia, West Virginia, Florida and North Carolina.

+ As of 2020, Kentucky already has a varied and well-respected renewable energy profile, with 10 dams producing 7% of the state’s electricity generation, 10% of green generation came from biomass, solar accounted for 0.2% of all electricity provided, and biofuels come from two ethanol plants.

+ Christian County has a hydrogen demand of 4,000 to 10,000 kilograms per square kilometer per year.

+ The Tennessee Valley Authority already has two nuclear plants in its profile, capable of producing no less than a combined 4,800 megawatts of power: Sequoyah in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, and Watts Bar in Spring City, Tennessee. Construction of a third unit, a small modular reactor near the Clinch River in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, is currently underway.

+ And the top 10 nuclear firms in the southeast are Japan’s Mitsubishi Power, London’s Rolls-Royce SMR, Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric, Seattle’s Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp, Boston’s General Electric, Kansas City’s Burns & McDonnell, Japan’s Toshiba Energy Systems, Germany’s Siemens Energy, Alameda’s Kairos Power and Lynchburg’s BWX Technologies.

Specific inventories have reportedly identified more than 180 interested power companies, and nearly 20 utilities, that are willing to help SERA define resilience needs, mentor startups and host demonstrations, and SERA, if given the go ahead, will be looking to recruit early- to growth-stage companies in these 500-plus counties to be ready for “an intensive acceleration process,” in order to “support commercialization and foster partnerships that enhance disaster resilience, diversify local economies, and generate new jobs and investment.”

In a written statement to the News Edge, Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance Advisor David A. Doctor said the project remains in the application review stage with the EDA — which typically operates on a 90-day review cycle.

However, he noted that with the federal government being closed for six weeks, and the EDA needing to sort through its project backlog, expectations are the review “takes a bit longer.”

Senior executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis plan to attend the White House announcement, signaling critical industry support for the policy shift.

This action formally resets the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, replacing stringent targets set under President Biden. The previous rules would have required automakers to achieve an average fleet efficiency of roughly 50 miles per gallon by the 2031 model year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which oversees CAFE standards, declared in June that the prior administration improperly considered electric vehicles when setting future requirements. The new rule establishes a legal foundation for standards that exclude such considerations.

The rollback represents the latest victory in President Trump's concerted campaign against regulations he has labeled an ""EV mandate."" His administration has already eliminated federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchasers and moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority to set its own, stricter tailpipe emissions limits. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency took the foundational step of proposing to rescind the 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" the determination that greenhouse gases harm public health, which underpins federal regulation of vehicle emissions.

Legal experts note that this aggressive federal retreat could ironically empower states. Ann Carlson, a former NHTSA official and UCLA law professor, argues that if the federal government determines greenhouse gases are not covered by the Clean Air Act, ""then California could presumably regulate them - and so could every other state."" California is already preparing for this conflict, with its air board launching a multi-year process to develop its own post-Trump vehicle emission rules, targeting a vote in 2027.

The administration’s push guarantees a protracted legal and regulatory battle. California, along with a coalition of other states, has already sued the administration over the revocation of its waivers. The outcome will determine whether a single national standard prevails or the country fractures into a patchwork of state rules, shaping the automotive market and environmental policy for years to come.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gas-pump.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:21.603912

Just months ago, he made headlines by betting against the AI frenzy, snapping up put options on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Those moves signaled his skepticism toward the tech sector’s explosive growth, driven by hype over artificial intelligence.

Now, Burry has turned his gaze to another high-flyer: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In a recent Substack post, he labeled the electric vehicle giant “ridiculously overvalued,” unveiling a fresh short position. This isn’t Burry’s first dance with Tesla — he held a $530 million bearish bet in 2021 — but it underscores his view that the stock’s surge defies fundamentals amid intensifying competition and questionable leadership decisions.

Decoding Burry’s Tesla Critique

Burry’s takedown of Tesla hinges on a core issue: its sky-high valuation. With shares trading around $430 and a market cap exceeding $1.4 trillion, Tesla commands a price-to-earnings multiple of over 287 times trailing earnings — dwarfing traditional automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), which hover below 15.

Burry argues this premium stems from relentless optimism among investors, who keep pivoting narratives to justify the price. “Tesla’s market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,” he wrote bluntly. He points to the “Elon cult” — die-hard fans who championed electric cars until rivals like BYD and legacy players ramped up, then shifted to autonomous driving dreams, and now hype humanoid robots like Optimus. But Burry warns competition will inevitably erode these edges, as it has Tesla’s 41% U.S. EV market share.

Error loading chart data: Turnstile challenge failed: 600010

The Musk Factor Risk

No Burry critique lands without a jab at leadership, and Elon Musk draws sharp fire here. Burry slams Musk’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package as a massive dilution threat, exacerbating Tesla’s already aggressive stock-based pay. He calculates the company hands out about 3.6% of shares annually to employees, with zero buybacks to counter the erosion.

This practice, Burry contends, inflates the share count without proportional value creation, punishing long-term holders. Musk’s package, tied to ambitious performance milestones, could flood the market with billions more shares if met — further pressuring the stock. Burry’s disdain echoes his broader beef with tech CEOs who prioritize spectacle over shareholder returns, likening Tesla’s trajectory to a bubble waiting to pop.

This short revives Burry’s 2021 Tesla wager, which he cashed out quickly as “just a trade.” Today, it fits his pattern of targeting frothy tech names. After shorting Nvidia and Palantir on AI overhyping and dilution parallels, Burry deregistered his Scion Asset Management hedge fund last month to go independent via Substack. There, he dissects overvaluations unfiltered, framing Tesla as exhibit A in a market detached from reality. At nearly 200 times forward profits, the stock leaves little margin for error if growth falters.

Key Takeaway

Burry’s Tesla short pits him squarely against bullish titans like Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, who forecasts $2,000 shares by 2027 on robotaxi and AI dominance, or Ron Baron, who touts Tesla’s moat in energy and autonomy.

Wood’s optimism hinges on exponential tech adoption, while Burry bets on mean reversion through competition and economics. History favors Burry, but Tesla’s cult-like following and Musk’s execution track record (SpaceX, xAI, The Boring Company) give bulls ammunition. Still, at these multiples, a correction feels probable if EV demand softens further or robots underdeliver.

For investors, don’t pick sides blindly. Diversify beyond Tesla, eye put options for downside protection, or trim exposure if shares hit resistance near $450. In volatile times, Burry’s caution provides an important reminder: Valuations matter more than visions.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry23-XRT.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 14:02:40.712954

County commissioners in 2024 also authorized Equitrans Midstream to survey Harrison County-owned land for a natural gas pipeline to the site.

It is not clear if other partners have any financial stake in the project, which has received state and local incentives, including a 30-year county exemption from paying local property taxes.

Plant site preparation, including controlled blasting, is underway, with operations expected to begin by 2027, said Blackstone, adding that it expected to create about 500 jobs during construction. A Blackstone spokesperson declined to respond to an ENR query on contractors selected for the project.

Blackstone acquired last year a majority stake in Plano, Texas-based Westwood Professional Services Inc., an engineering firm described as specializing in wind and solar energy, energy storage, power delivery, EV infrastructure, public infrastructure projects and other construction. The firm ranks at No. 77 on ENR's Top Design Firms list, reporting $412.8 million in 2024 revenue, about 44% in the power sector and 39% in building construction. Dean Palumbo, a former Stantec senior vice president, was named in August as Westwood chief operating officer.

Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a Virginia-based co-op with about 1.5 million customers through its 11 member-owner firms in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, including data centers and other industrial facilities, agreed in July to buy the power that will be generated by the Wolf Summit plant.

“Helping meet the rising demand for electricity from AI and other areas is among our highest conviction investment themes at Blackstone,” said Bilal Khan, a Blackstone senior managing director, in a statement.

Originally proposed in 2017 by the Energy Solutions Consortium as a 579-MW combined-cycle plant and a $615-million investment, project development halted following a lawsuit over air permits and financing issues, according to local media reports. The consortium withdrew from the project. Wolf Summit Energy, a subsidiary of General Electric, subsequently revived and expanded the project in 2023. The Blackstone spokesperson also declined to say if the plant will be co-located with a data center or if it is being designed to also use hydrogen-blended fuel.

Blackstone, based in New York City, is considered the largest investor in global data centers and AI infrastructure, according to a ranking by Data Centre, an online sector publication. The company also announced in September its $1-billion acquisition of Hill Top Energy Center, a 620-MW gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania, and a similarly valued purchase in January of Potomac Energy Center, a 774-MW gas-fired power plant in Virginia.

FORT WAYNE — The interim president of the Fort Wayne Common Council is urging Google to meet with residents as scrutiny grows over a new air permit tied to the company’s $2 billion data center now under construction on the city’s southeast side.

Google has asked the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for permission to install 179 diesel backup generators at the site. The request has prompted concerns from residents who fear possible health, noise and pollution impacts. Interim council president Geoff Paddock outlined those worries in a letter to the agency on Wednesday, Nov. 26 and said he has heard from numerous constituents since the application became public.

Paddock noted that when the council approved rezoning for the property in late 2023, officials did not raise the issue of large-scale backup power needs. He said the project had been described as a quiet operation with minimal impact on surrounding neighborhoods.

The data center was first linked to Google in January 2024 after operating under the name Project Zodiac. The company initially planned an $845 million investment, which expanded to $2 billion in April.

The development is expected to add about 200 jobs over several years.

Paddock has asked IDEM to ensure the company pursues the safest and most efficient backup energy options and uses top pollution control practices.

Additionally, Triodos Bank is campaigning for energy-efficient housing and bio-based building standards.","Triodos Bank has unveiled its first integrated Climate & Nature Strategy, announcing a comprehensive approach to accelerate the energy transition, reduce financed emissions and increase investment in nature-based solutions.

The Triodos Bank energy transition strategy, ‘Dare to Act. Now.’, sets out measurable targets to drive climate and biodiversity action by 2030.

Triodos Bank’s new four-pillar strategy marks the first time the bank has unified its climate and biodiversity ambitions.

The plan includes a commitment to cut absolute financed emissions by at least 42% by 2030, up from the 32% target set in 2022.

The focus is on three key activities that together account for 90% of the bank’s emissions footprint: business loans, mortgages, and listed equities and bonds managed by Triodos Investment Management.

Another pillar of the Triodos Bank energy transition strategy is the financing of 275 energy transition projects over the next five years. The bank aims to support next-generation, decentralised and community-led solutions, building on its “strong track record” in renewable energy finance.

The deal-count target is designed to ensure that finance reaches not only large utilities but also cooperatives, innovators and smaller community-led initiatives that often face challenges in accessing mainstream capital.

In addition to the energy transition targets, Triodos Bank plans to channel €500m ($580.39m) into high-integrity, nature-based solutions (NbS) by 2030. These projects are intended to deliver measurable ecological and social benefits, addressing both climate and biodiversity challenges together.

From 2026, the bank will begin reporting on its progress towards this investment goal, as well as on the positive biodiversity impacts of its financed projects. The aim is to provide greater transparency on how investments in NbS contribute tangible benefits for biodiversity.

Triodos Bank’s fourth strategy includes a strong advocacy component. The bank has called for systemic change in the financial sector.

It has stated that banks are still directing €650bn annually into fossil fuels, which sustains dependency on non-renewable energy sources.

The bank is advocating for international agreements such as the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to phase out fossil fuels and create robust frameworks for high-integrity NbS.

Additionally, Triodos Bank is campaigning for energy-efficient housing and bio-based building standards.

As part of its advocacy, Triodos Bank has sought for binding rules including mandatory fossil-phase-out pathways for all banks; required short-term emissions reduction targets for 2030–35, with transparent action plans; alignment of financial regulation with the Paris Agreement and adherence to 1.5°C reduction pathways; separate targets for emissions reduction and carbon removal; and robust integrity standards for nature-based solutions.

Triodos Bank CEO Marcel Zuidam emphasised the interconnectedness of climate change and biodiversity loss, stating: “Climate change and biodiversity loss are not separate crises. They are deeply interconnected. Restoring ecosystems is essential to stabilising the climate, and climate action must protect biodiversity. Our strategy is about real reductions, real solutions and real leadership.

“We invite the financial sector to join us in embracing long-term well-being and taking action for a hopeful future. Together, we can drive the systemic change needed to stay within planetary boundaries. This means aligning financial flows with the Paris Agreement, investing in nature restoration and a clear road map to end the financing of the fossil fuel industry.”

Trabish, Ethan Howland, Robert Walton",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/hurricane-power-outage-electricity-climate-change-helene-milton/806771/,"U.S. electricity customers experienced an average of 11 hours of power outages in 2024, nearly twice as many as the annual average across the previous decade, according to a new report from the Energy Information Administration.
Much of this was due to last September’s Hurricane Helene, which left 1.2 million customers in South Carolina without electricity.
Three days after the hurricane struck, 900,000 Duke customers remained without power across North Carolina and South Carolina, the utility said.
South Carolina, along with North Carolina and Florida, “dealt with strong winds and flooding from Hurricane Helene that affected transmission and distribution power lines as well as substations leading to prolonged power outages,” EIA said.

U.S. electricity customers experienced an average of 11 hours of power outages in 2024, nearly twice as many as the annual average across the previous decade, according to a new report from the Energy Information Administration.

Hurricanes accounted for 80% of those lost hours, with most of last year’s outages resulting from major weather events like hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton, EIA said in the report released Monday.

“Interruptions attributed to major events averaged nearly nine hours in 2024, compared with an average of nearly four hours per year in 2014 through 2023,” EIA said. “Service interruptions that aren’t triggered by major events routinely average about two hours per year.”

Customers in South Carolina were significant outliers in terms of outage duration, the report said, experiencing an average of 53 hours of outages in 2024. Much of this was due to last September’s Hurricane Helene, which left 1.2 million customers in South Carolina without electricity.

The report appears to build on a growing body of evidence that extreme weather is taking a heavier toll on the electric power system in parts of the country. In October, JD Power released a report that found the average length of the longest outages are getting longer and concluded that disasters have become a “fact of life” for many utility customers.

Helene, in particular, caused severe damage to utility systems in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.

Duke Energy said after the hurricane that transmission infrastructure in upstate South Carolina “was severely damaged and, in many cases, destroyed” and would need to be entirely rebuilt.

Three days after the hurricane struck, 900,000 Duke customers remained without power across North Carolina and South Carolina, the utility said. Following hurricanes Helene and Milton, Duke reported needing to replace around 16,000 transformers — more transformers than utilities generally require in an entire year, WoodMac Senior Analyst Ben Boucher said in February.

South Carolina, along with North Carolina and Florida, “dealt with strong winds and flooding from Hurricane Helene that affected transmission and distribution power lines as well as substations leading to prolonged power outages,” EIA said. The following month, Hurricane Milton “left 3.4 million customers in Florida without power,” it added.

“In contrast, customers in states such as Arizona, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Massachusetts experienced, on average, less than two hours of service interruptions in 2024,” EIA said

Project Overview

We’re seeking approval to construct and operate a 76-megawatt alternating current (MWac) utility-scale solar power center and associated facilities in Darlington and Chesterfield counties, S.C. The associated facilities will include a new 230-kilovolt (kV) solar generation substation and a new 230-kV generation tie line spanning approximately 225 to 250 feet between the solar generation substation and the existing Darlington power plant’s 230-kV switching station (the point of interconnection).

Construction is expected to begin in late 2026 or early 2027. The facility will provide fuel-free power and capacity to meet the growing needs of the Pee Dee region of South Carolina.

Transitioning to cleaner energy sources, while also meeting growing energy needs, requires a diverse mix of resources to help ensure continued reliability as older plants are retired. As energy needs continue to grow significantly, Duke Energy must invest in new infrastructure to keep jobs and investment coming to South Carolina.

We are using an “all-of-the-above approach” that incorporates renewables like solar, next-generation and existing nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric sources. This diverse mix will help Duke Energy meet customer expectations for cleaner energy while also reliably powering communities across the state.

Surprise funding will help smaller agencies with senior mobile food programs, weekend backpack efforts, food pantries, veteran programs

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

GREENVILLE, S.C., Dec. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are wrapping up a monthlong initiative to support organizations that address food deserts, insecurities and inequities across South Carolina by announcing nearly $275,000 in surprise microgrants and contributions to community organizations across the state.

The big picture: The announcement wraps up a monthlong campaign of financial support to and employee volunteerism with organizations in South Carolina that fight hunger across the state. These include programs that distribute food boxes, fill backpacks for weekend food programs for students, provide help to veterans and senior mobile meal programs, among other feeding initiatives.

In total, the initiative provided more than $600,000 to critical community partners that do this incredible work, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina, https://sc211.org/One SC Fund and AIM, among many others.

The microgrants and contributions were not solicited by the receiving organizations. The 'surcee' funding opportunities recognize the important gaps these typically smaller agencies fill in the neighborhoods they serve. A complete list of recipients can be found here.

Why it matters: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

What they're saying

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""If you grew up in South Carolina, you are likely familiar with a 'surcee' – a small, unexpected gift. Giving Tuesday is the perfect opportunity to give a little something extra and highlight the great work these organizations do throughout the year to help keep our friends and neighbors from going hungry.""

Mark Champagne, executive director, Sumter United Ministries: ""Thanks to the generosity of the Duke Energy Foundation's $5,000 grant, we will be able to place food into the hands of neighbors who are struggling more than I've seen in many years. As requests continue to rise and our shelves grow thin, this gift brings real hope at a time when our community truly needs it.""

Traci H. Kennedy, executive director, TOTAL Ministries: ""We so appreciate everything Duke Energy Foundation does for TOTAL Ministries. The grant is making an immediate and meaningful difference, allowing us to meet rising needs and care for families who are struggling the most.""

Melinda Waddell, executive director, The Manna House: ""The support from Duke Energy for our mission to create a hunger-free Florence allows us to continue to provide hot, healthy, nutritious meals to our clients. With more than 100,000 individual meals served in 2024, we truly appreciate their dedication and commitment to our neighbors and community.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

Under the EPA’s current Regional Haze Rule, states must submit state implementation plans every 10 years to protect visibility in treasured national parks – like Yosemite, Acadia, Shenandoah, and Rocky Mountains – and wilderness areas – like Sipsey, Joyce Kilmer, Dolly Sods, and Boundary Waters Canoe Area – to demonstrate continued, reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal of the Clean Air Act. The EPA intends to weaken the rule, and as a first step, issued a public comment period for its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. A second public comment period on the rulemaking is expected in early 2026.

“The Regional Haze Rule is a time-tested, effective program that requires federal and state agencies, federal land managers, and stakeholders to work together to restore clear skies in 156 national parks and wilderness areas (Class I areas). The Haze Rule has delivered significant cost-effective clean air benefits to national parks, wilderness areas and communities across the nation in the past 15 years — over 1.4 million tons of visibility impairing pollution has been reduced, improving scenic views and making air healthier to breathe across the nation,” reads the sign-on letter. “But there is still a lot of work to do as visitors regularly miss out on over 50 miles of scenic views and experience unhealthy air when visiting these treasured places.”

In both letters, the groups expressed concern that EPA’s deregulatory direction, as stated by Administrator Lee Zeldin in March 2025 and in Project 2025, will run contrary to the visibility goals of the Clean Air Act, weaken the Regional Haze Rule, and undermine years of progress toward cleaner air in parks and wilderness areas. The groups reject any efforts by the EPA to weaken the effectiveness of the rule, including by allowing states to avoid requiring pollution control systems, avoid identifying emissions reduction measures, and avoid developing regular regional haze plans altogether.

“Many sources of air pollution that were expected to retire, clean up, or otherwise reduce emissions can no longer be assumed to be on that same course given dramatic changes in the last year to clean air policies, facility or pollution control operations, and pollution exemptions granted by presidential decree,” reads the sign-on letter. “Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas. We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.”

The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, Earthjustice, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center also expressed concerns about the timing of the comment period due to the government shutdown, which prevented affected agencies like the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service from providing adequate feedback. The EPA ignored the groups’ request for a comment period extension.

A fixture of our modern economy, almost every product sold domestically is at some point contained in cardboard.
Seeing the success of the recycled materials industry in the Natural State has directly informed my policy priorities in the U.S. Senate.
The circular economy plays a small role in each of our lives.
I would encourage other states to follow Arkansas’s lead because it is clearly a winning play for our economy and the environment.","Across the country, companies are bringing production closer to home to strengthen supply chains, reduce dependency on imports and create jobs.

Notably, this process — known as “reshoring” or “nearshoring” — only succeeds when manufacturers have access to reliable, high-quality materials. That’s where Arkansas is leading the way, transforming recycled inputs into steel, plastics and paper products that power modern manufacturing in addition to helping build a circular economy that keeps critical resources at home and North American supply chains strong.

Circularity ensures yesterday’s waste is reintegrated while reducing dependence on mined ore or new, unused plastics shipped across oceans.

Added benefits include shortened supply lines, slashed transportation costs as well as emissions, and diminished exposure to global market shocks.

It’s also a workforce success story: sustaining thousands of high-wage jobs while ensuring the materials needed for cars, bridges, appliances and packaging remain readily available.

Recycling is not just good environmental policy –– it’s supply chain resiliency in action.

As old buildings and bridges are torn down to make way for new construction, and automobiles and washing machines reach their end of life, Arkansas recyclers accumulate and process them to recover high-quality ferrous metals. The result is a product that meets the same stringent performance standards as brand new steel made from mined ore.

Today, more than 70 percent of the steel forged in the U.S. is manufactured with recycled materials, and Arkansas is at the center of this story. Nucor’s mills in Mississippi County — one of the leading steel-producing counties in the nation — transform recycled materials into the steel that builds our cars and bridges.

The Natural State is also home to national leaders in plastics recycling. Revolution, one of the largest recyclers and manufacturers of agricultural plastics in North America, has a recycling hub in Stuttgart and manufacturing operations in Little Rock that have helped reutilize over 1 billion pounds of plastics. In Arkansas, it converts used farm plastics into new products like polytube and trashcan liners made with the highest certified post-consumer resin in the industry. Revolution’s success demonstrates how circularity drives economic growth.

That same story holds true for the simple cardboard box, one of the most widely recycled materials in America. A fixture of our modern economy, almost every product sold domestically is at some point contained in cardboard.

Corrugated cardboard is one of the most recyclable materials in use today. With six sustainable packaging facilities in Arkansas, International Paper plays a pivotal role in creating new corrugated packaging by reusing more than 5 million tons of recycled fiber annually to turn yesterday’s boxes, newspapers and office paper into sustainable packaging.

Since 2013, International Paper has increased its recovery rate of corrugated packaging by 93 percent and its overall recovery rate by 40 percent, removing unwanted waste, extending the lifespan of our fiber and timber resources, and creating well-paying jobs for Arkansans.

Seeing the success of the recycled materials industry in the Natural State has directly informed my policy priorities in the U.S. Senate.

Whether passing pro-growth and investment policies like tax reform or leading the Senate Recycling Caucus to promote awareness around this evolving sector, I am proud to work in bipartisan fashion and advance commonsense ideas. This year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously advanced my legislation, the Steward Act, to strengthen voluntary standardized data collection efforts that help Arkansas manufacturers make informed business decisions while discerning industry trends.

The circular economy plays a small role in each of our lives. From the bridges we drive across to the appliances we replace and cardboard boxes we break down, what is recycled today becomes the durable materials we rely on tomorrow. I would encourage other states to follow Arkansas’s lead because it is clearly a winning play for our economy and the environment.

Independent power producers and the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject a waiver request from American Electric Power utilities that would allow them to sell up to 750 MW in an upcoming “incremental” capacity auction.

It appears the utilities — Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power and Wheeling Power — want to offload capacity they acquired to serve data centers that didn’t materialize, said Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s market monitor, and the PJM Power Providers Group, a trade organization, in separate filings at FERC.

The utilities are Fixed Resource Requirement entities that supply their own capacity and don’t participate in PJM’s capacity market.

Early last month, the AEP utilities asked FERC for a waiver from FRR rules so they can sell up to 750 MW in an incremental auction set to begin on Feb. 24 for the 2026/2027 delivery year. Typically, PJM holds annual base capacity auctions three years in advance of a delivery year. It then holds incremental auctions for that delivery year to reflect any changes in supply and demand forecasts.

The AEP utilities said PJM needs more capacity and its offer in the incremental auction would help lower capacity prices to the benefit of ratepayers. Also, it is unlikely that offering 750 MW into the auction would hurt third parties because the upcoming capacity year, which begins June 1, is subject to a price cap and floor, the utilities said.

PJM supports the waiver request, saying it will ease resource adequacy concerns for the upcoming capacity year.

FERC in 2015 ruled that rigid enforcement of the FRR sales cap was not “necessary to protect competitive investment,” PJM said in a Nov. 21 filing.

However, Monitoring Analytics and P3 contend the AEP request fails to meet FERC’s standard for issuing waivers to rules it has approved.

“The waiver would allow generators with fully guaranteed cost recovery paid for by their customers to undercut the capacity market in which investors take the risks,” Monitoring Analytics said in a Nov. 26 filing. “The primary result of the proposed waiver would be that the AEP FRR entities would be able to take advantage of the high PJM capacity market prices.”

The AEP request fails to meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver be limited in scope, partly by setting a precedent that would undermine the PJM market design, according to the market monitor.

“If the cap can be waived whenever it proves inconvenient, it ceases to serve its market discipline function, undermines incentives for market based generators, and creates uncertainty for all participants in the PJM capacity market,” Monitoring Analytics said.

Further, the request doesn’t meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver address a concrete problem, saying neither PJM nor AEP has shown the grid operator will be short of supply for the incremental capacity auction, according to P3.

“Given recent downward adjustments for the 2026 load forecast, there is reason to believe that PJM may have over procured capacity for the 2026/2027 delivery year,” P3 said in a Friday filing at FERC.

Also, the waiver would harm market participants, the trade group said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xE5pnWNVVs2WgWR2KCUl4D6MLIwuf2VIvi8X_O2c8hU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Kb2huX0UuX0Ftb3NfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnQuX1VuaXRzXzFfYW5kXzIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-02 13:01:01.323497

So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.
But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.
The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.","But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02/Rob-C-12-1-C.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:26.709323

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas.
But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

“There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

~ Camilla Feibelman, director, Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.

“The Permian Basin is basically out of compliance with federal ozone standards,” Feibelman said. “It’s kids, it’s communities, it’s elderly people that are going to pay the price of this poor air quality no matter where they live.”

For example, in Puerto Rico, energy planners should integrate climate extreme risk models — here, that would be hurricane frequency and intensity — into infrastructure cost and resilience assessments.
While the case study is specific to Puerto Rico, the authors emphasize that the framework can be applied in other geographies and under differing policy horizons.
This research paves the way for more robust, uncertainty-aware energy transition planning, especially for regions facing extreme weather and institutional constraints.","A new article published in Nature Communications offers insight into how government planners can better account for the many uncertainties that accompany the transition from fossil-fuel power systems to renewable or decarbonized systems. The paper, titled “Identifying key uncertainties in energy transitions with a Puerto Rico case study,” is the work of a team from the University of Virginia including first author Kamiar Khayambashi, a Ph.D. student in the Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Khayambashi and his advisor, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering Negin Alemazkoor, worked with co-authors Andres Clarens, a CEE professor and associate director of the UVA Environmental Institute, and UVA emeritus professor of public policy William Shobe. In the paper, they make a compelling case that planners need to do better at taking the right uncertainties into account when readying for an energy transition.

The team developed a three-stage analytical framework and applied it to the electricity system of Puerto Rico, a hurricane-prone island heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The study analyzed three transition pathways: Business as Usual (BAU), Fully Renewable (FR) by 2050 and Fully Decarbonized (FD) by 2050.

Key results show that changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes due to climate change emerged as the single largest source of uncertainty in the expected total system cost. Organizational inefficiency (e.g., delays, miscoordination in restoration of infrastructure services) was the second most important uncertainty but is rarely included in energy-system modeling.

Demonstrating that uncertainty can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because they seem overwhelmingly complex.

“In a high-hurricane-risk region with a history of institutional inefficiencies such as Puerto Rico — and the case of grid restoration after Hurricane Maria — the yearly cost of the power grid cannot be accurately judged without explicitly modeling the uncertainties in climate, technology, fuel and institutional performance,” Khayambashi said.

Unfortunately, when it comes to planning and investments, the appropriate uncertainties are not considered, which leads to inaccuracies. As utilities and regulators plan long-term investments in clean energy transitions, many models assume a fixed “best-guess” value for fuel prices, technology cost declines, and weather or climate trends. This new research shows that such deterministic planning may miss critical cost-risks from multiple interacting uncertainties, especially in regions vulnerable to extreme weather and with consistent institutional efficiency challenges.

This study offers a strategic way to focus on data collection, modeling refinement and risk-mitigation efforts: identify which uncertainties matter most.

“Demonstrating that the high-dimensional uncertainty in long-term planning can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to explicitly account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because the problem seems overwhelmingly complex,” Alemazkoor said.

For example, in Puerto Rico, energy planners should integrate climate extreme risk models — here, that would be hurricane frequency and intensity — into infrastructure cost and resilience assessments. And organizational risk, such as restoration delays after storms, should be treated as a quantifiable input cost, not just a sidenote.

While the case study is specific to Puerto Rico, the authors emphasize that the framework can be applied in other geographies and under differing policy horizons.

“Our results show that resilience and organizational performance can matter as much as fuel price volatility when designing energy systems for the long term,” Clarens said.

Should the handy credits expire on December 31, a so-called “subsidy cliff” will be reinstated, putting Americans at risk of soaring health insurance costs.

Should the enhanced ACA premium tax credits expire on December 31, the roughly 22.4 million people relying on these subsidies would be hit with steep increases in their health insurance premiums starting in 2026.

Their premiums could more than double next year, per a preview of the available plans released by the Trump administration.

Millions more would lose subsidized ACA marketplace coverage, and roughly 3.8 million people are projected to lose health insurance coverage entirely and become uninsured each year from 2026 to 2034 due to high costs, per the Congressional Budget Office.

Around 47% of American adults reported fears that they would not be able to cover the cost of necessary health care should the tax credits expire, per a West Health-Gallup poll from last month.

The poll saw the highest level of concern surrounding health care in the past four years and also found that roughly 20% were unable to afford their prescriptions in recent months.

Rising medical costs are not sustainable in the long run, Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, told NewsNation.

“If current trends persist, by 2032 the typical American family will pay 40% … of their income just on health care premiums,” said White.

“The subsidies are a temporary fix. We’ve got a very expensive system. Subsidizing an expensive system will get you a more expensive system,” he added.

As Americans currently enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans are already seeing the higher premium costs reflected in plan previews during the ongoing Open Enrollment Period, Congress is planning to vote on the subsidies before the end of the month.

‘SUBSIDY CLIFF’

A major point of contention during the lengthy government shutdown earlier this year, the enhanced premium tax credits were originally established by the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act.

These refundable tax credits were intended to help Americans afford health insurance bought via the ACA marketplace.

They work by capping the amount that individuals and families must spend on their health plans, with the government subsidy covering the remaining portion.

Before 2021, only households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level were eligible for the tax credits, ultimately creating a “subsidy cliff” in which a small jump in income could completely disqualify a family for assistance.

The American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act enhancements temporarily removed this subsidy cliff by allowing access to the tax credits for households with incomes greater than 400% of the federal poverty level.

The changes also made the subsidies more generous overall, spiking marketplace enrollment significantly from roughly 12 million Americans in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025, according to an explainer from the Commonwealth Fund.

Today, the industry is evolving into something far more dynamic: a hub for innovation, sustainability, and purpose-driven careers. Experts say this transformation is reshaping not only what manufacturing looks like but why it matters.

Beyond the Assembly Line: A High-Tech Reality

“People still picture manufacturing as the assembly lines of the early 20th century,” says Thomas Kurfess, executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute. “The reality is very different. Modern plants are among the most advanced environments you’ll find, packed with robotics, automation, and data-driven systems. In fact, if you want to see the largest number of robots in one location, it will be at an automotive assembly plant.”

That disconnect between perception and reality is one reason manufacturers struggle to fill roles despite record demand. Kurfess notes that students often overlook manufacturing careers because they assume the work is low tech. “We need to expose educators, parents, and students to what manufacturing truly looks like,” he says. Facility tours and partnerships with technical colleges can help shift the narrative.

Pinar Keskinocak, H. Milton and Carolyn J. Stewart School Chair in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, agrees: “Showcasing innovations like AI-driven automation, 3D printing, and smart factories is key to changing perceptions.”

Green Tech and Digital Transformation

The rise of electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy is accelerating this shift. “Green technology presents a transformative opportunity for U.S. manufacturing,” Kurfess explains. “It is not just about sustainability; it is about national security and global competitiveness.”

These sectors are inherently digital, says Nagi Gebraeel, Georgia Power Term Professor in the College of Engineering. “Green tech manufacturing is being built in an era when advanced digital technologies are mature and widely accessible. Factories are designed from the ground up with automation and sensing embedded, creating highly interconnected systems.”

This evolution demands new skills. The labor force must navigate environments where operational technology and information technology converge. Gebraeel predicts that by 2035, manufacturing leaders will increasingly come from operations and data-driven backgrounds rather than traditional IT.

The Workforce Challenge

Despite the promise of high-tech careers, talent pipelines remain thin. Manpreet Hora, senior associate dean in the Scheller College of Business, points to a “demand-supply mismatch” driven by rapidly changing skill requirements. “Manufacturing now needs workers who combine technical, digital, and soft skills,” he says. “Meanwhile, younger workers often gravitate toward service industries for perceived growth and tech exposure. The manufacturing sector will collectively need to reposition themselves as employers of choice by making their digital tools visible, highlighting career progression, and offering flexible learning pathways.”

Experts agree that education must adapt. Kurfess advocates for a systemwide approach starting in elementary school, while Gebraeel emphasizes integrating AI into curricula and offering modular micro-credentials for upskilling. Hora adds that hands-on training should reflect realities like AI-enabled operations and sustainability-focused processes.

Purpose and Innovation

For younger professionals seeking meaningful work, manufacturing offers more than a paycheck. “These are high-tech, high-impact roles where workers build products that move the world, from aircraft and medical devices to renewable energy systems,” Kurfess says.

To position the industry as an innovation hub, leaders must embrace technologies that enhance efficiency and quality while fostering collaboration across schools, businesses, and government. “Modernizing the image of manufacturing demands aligned messaging and shared investment,” he adds.

Looking Ahead

By 2035, experts envision a workforce fluent in AI, committed to lifelong learning, and working in environments where cyber and physical systems are seamlessly integrated. Manufacturing will remain a cornerstone of economic strength, but its true value will lie in its ability to innovate, adapt, and deliver purpose-driven careers.",https://news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/hg_media/2025-02/fileKdkuny,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:41.885574

So, what are the consequences for real-time dynamics of adding these huge sources of demand to existing networks? And can domestic production meet significant demand growth from both LNG production and power generation?

Gas production and pricing and the impact of large-load real-time behaviour on power markets were key themes at our recent Power and Gas Trading Conference in Houston. Fill out the form at the top of the page to download slide decks from the event covering these and other topics, or read on for a brief overview.

Theme 1: The impact of large loads on power markets

Large loads are the new volatility source for power trading

Power market traders are used to tracking a range of issues that can impact real-time pricing in energy markets, from generating facility downtime, network outages and renewables intermittency to more serious weather-related disruption. However, our real-time analysis of US power markets shows that large-load behaviour is driving a critical shift, with large loads increasingly a major source of volatility.

Our case studies of the Lake Mariner Data Center in upstate New York and Meta’s 2.5 million square feet Henrico Data Center campus in Virginia show these single facilities are the source of massive, un-forecasted load swings. Lake Mariner executed 13 demand response events in July 2025 alone, more than twice the number of Emergency Actions taken by NYISO, the regional independent system operator. With the Lake Mariner campus representing around 9% of Zone A demand in NYISO, demand fluctuations at the facility are having clear price impacts.

Concentrated demand amplifies congestion risk

Real-time power market dynamics driven by Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin Texas highlight a further issue caused by concentrated demand from large loads: the amplification of congestion risk. This huge manufacturing facility employs around 20,000 people and is the world’s second largest building by volume. The site has an assumed consumption capacity of around 250 MW, with onsite solar generation and battery storage helping to reduce the amount of power drawn from the grid during peak summer pricing.

Fluctuating demand and generation at the facility bring congestion risk. For example, during the first week of September 2025, a constraint in Bell County coupled with a long-standing line outage in the area resulted in elevated real-time prices for the plant throughout peak consumption hours (see dotted lines on the chart below). This demonstrates how concentrated demand coupled with onsite generation can be susceptible to basis risk, that must then be managed around.

Real-time visibility into un-forecasted load ramps gives traders the edge

The ability to monitor and detect un-forecasted load ramp-ups and ramp-downs caused by large-load facilities like Lake Mariner and Gigafactory Texas is a vital advantage in fast-moving power markets. Wood Mackenzie’s PowerRT solution provides the real-time visibility traders need to act quickly and exploit trading opportunities as these events unfold. At the same time, our new Nodal Price Forecast for ERCOT leverages our congestion expertise, allowing large load facilities to manage basis risk while enabling traders to capture spreads ahead of the market.

Theme 2: Meeting growing gas demand from LNG and data centres

US LNG production continues to grow

Several major projects have contributed to US LNG export capacity growing by over 30% year on year. Work has progressed ahead of schedule on the third phase of Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas, with four of seven trains already online. At Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG plant, all trains are online, with power island commissioning ongoing. And at ExxonMobil and QatarEnergy’s Golden Pass joint venture in Texas, Train 1 (of three) is expected to begin liquefaction around the end of the year.

Can gas prices incentivise enough production to meet LNG growth?

Based on projects under construction or nearing a final investment decision, we forecast durable growth in US LNG production, with an additional 18 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of capacity becoming operational over the next ten years.

Gas production and LNG exports have become increasingly interconnected over the past few years, with the US Lower 48 and Western Canada effectively turned into synthetic storage, adapting daily production to ongoing demand. At the moment, gas prices are incentivising enough production to meet current growth expectations for increased LNG production, with supply from Haynesville, Marcellus/Utica and Permian plays expected to increase steadily. However, if incremental gas supply is needed to meet additional demand growth from large loads, higher prices will be required.

Can gas production grow as needed to meet large-load demand growth?

In theory, domestic gas production should be able to grow to meet the significant added power demand from the growth in data centres and other large industrial loads. Pipeline capacity could present an obstacle to supply growth; for example, there are limits on export capacity in the Marcellus/Utica. However, local demand growth should debottleneck the region and allow for more production growth. Increasingly, the availability of gas as an electricity generating resource will be a key factor in the siting of data centres and other large-load facilities.

H2 201 Explained

As hydrogen adoption continues to grow across the U.S., particularly in transit and municipal fleets, so does the need for thorough safety training. Hydrogen's unique properties - including its dispersion behavior, pressure requirements, and wide flammability range - make fuel systems that use it fundamentally different from those in natural gas vehicles (NGVs). This course bridges the knowledge gap for technicians who may already be familiar with CNG but need specialized training for hydrogen.

H2 201 covers critical topics like:

Hydrogen fuel system component function and identification.

Required inspection tools and methods.

Depressurizing, defueling, and leak detection.

Hydrogen cylinder damage assessments and classifications.

Requirements under SAE2579, CGA C-6.4, and FMVSS 307 and 308.

Along with its prerequisite course, H2 101: Hydrogen Vehicle Essentials and Safety Practices, AFVi's hydrogen fuel system inspector certification program is designed so that technicians who complete the training and pass the certification exam are fully qualified to conduct inspections that meet all current safety codes and standards.

Coursework was developed with cooperation from The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC), which allowed AFVi visual access to its hydrogen fueling station and vehicles, as well as contributed photos and videos.

As much as various high ranking officials in the Trump administration would like to pretend that energy storage is not a thing existing in time and space, it does. Batteries are already replacing fossil fuels in vehicles and power stations. Now they are beginning to pull duty in the sticky world of hard-to-decarbonize commercial and industrial applications. In an interesting twist, the latest development in the C&I space involves a concentrating solar power system capable of delivering the clean kilowatts on a ’round-the-clock basis, with the help of thermal energy storage.

Energy Storage & Concentrating Solar Power

The concentrating solar power angle may come as a surprise, considering that the technology got a bad rap here in the US after a series of high profile flops in the early 2000s. However, CSP has caught on elsewhere around the world.

For those of you new to the topic, CSP systems are just what the name says. Instead of converting sunlight directly to electricity in a photovoltaic cell, CSP systems typically deploy large fields of specialized mirrors called heliostats. They collectively bounce sunlight onto a central point, where a reciever heats a liquid transfer medium typically composed of molten salt. CSP systems can also come in the form of long, parabolic troughs, and they can heat particles of sand or other matter instead of heating a liquid.

Either way, the transfer medium acts as a sort of two-way energy storage system. It can be called up when needed for commercial and industrial processes that require heat, even after the sun goes down. Or, the transfer medium can be shunted to a generating station, where it produces steam to run a turbine that spits out electricity (see lots more CSP background here).

If that sounds complicated and expensive compared to simply parking a solar panel out in the sun, it is. During the Obama administration, the US Department of Energy tried to help the domestic CSP industry launch itself into being, but nothing of consequence stuck. Still, the Energy Department continued to fund innovation in the CSP field all during the first Trump administration from 2017 to 2021. The Biden administration also picked up the CSP R&D torch and ran with it, all the way until January 20 of this year, when the task fell to Trump again.

As of March, the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated that third-generation CSP research programs were continuing during Trump’s second time in the Oval Office. However, last week Energy Secretary Chris Wright changed NREL’s name to “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” so who knows what goes on there.

247Solar Has Fossil Fuel’s Number

The US startup 247Solar is among the CSP innovators not waiting around for further support from the Energy Department. The company’s flagship “247Solar Plant” heat-plus-power system combines CSP with a heat-storing battery, enabling it to last longer than earlier CSP-based energy storage systems. As a backup, the battery is also designed to be source-agnostic, running on alternate fuels in case of a shortfall in solar availability. The battery is also compatible with wind power and grid-sourced electricity, too.

The company is new to the CleanTechnica radar, so now is a good time for catch-up. It launched in 2015, co-founded by the late MIT Professor Emeritus David Gordon Wilson and longtime solar engineering and architecture professional David Anderson, who serves as CEO.

MIT News profiled the company last year, noting that Professor Wilson’s high-temperature heat exchanger provides the technology platform for the system. As described by Anderson, the heat exchanger is integrated with a conventional turbine. Similar to those used in jet engines, the turbine circulates hot air without requiring combustion or producing emissions.

MIT News reporter Zach Winn provides some further details about the system. The central tower in the CSP part of the operation supports a proprietary solar receiver capable of reaching 1,000 degrees Celsius. Some of the hot air can go directly to drive the turbines to produce electricity while the sun is shining. The rest is routed to a long duration solid-state thermal energy storage system, which takes over when the sun goes down.

“We offer round-the-clock electricity, but we also offer a combined heat and power option, with the ability to take heat up to 970 Celsius for use in industrial processes,” Anderson told MIT News. “It’s a very flexible system.”

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

247Solar has already cultivated a $250 million pipeline of projects around the world for its heat-plus-power CSP system, reportedly including a major utility in India. Accordingly, earlier this week 247Solar announced the launch of a new Series B capital raise aimed at hitting the $25 million mark, enabling it to scale up operations.

In a press statement, 247Solar indicated that its that its existing investors have already put up $3.5 million towards a successful raise, and that forthcoming commitments are in the pipeline pending due diligence.

The demand is certainly there. Although US President Donald Trump has done his best to throttle down the domestic wind and solar industries, the global race for reliable, economical clean power is continuing apace. 247Solar notes that its project pipeline includes Africa, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as India, with a focus on mining and desalination operations, among other industrial applications.

“Industrial companies worldwide face the urgent need to decarbonize their energy use — without sacrificing reliability, cost, or performance,” 247Solar emphasized in a press statement dated December 1. “And 60% of industrial energy use across sectors is to produce heat, not power, typically by burning fossil fuels.”

Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Typical CSP systems are sprawling, one-of-a-kind facilities tailored to their location, adding risk as well as expense. In contrast, 247Solar has developed a cost-cutting, modular system that can be fabricated in a factory setting and hauled out to the site.

With the combination of heat and power in hand, 247Solar notes that cutting carbon emissions down to the bone is just part of the picture. In addition to reducing the carbon footprint of an operation’s energy systems by up to 95%, 247Solar estimates that energy costs can be cut by 25% or more.

Adding to the attraction is 247Solar’s EaaS (Energy-as-a-Service) business model. EaaS contracts typically provide business with the ability to upgrade their energy systems without paying up front for new equipment. “In addition, 247Solar solutions typically increase reliability and improve performance,” 247Solar also says of itself.

That remains to be seen. However, considering the extent of 247Solar’s global project pipeline, apparently some leading energy consumers have seen enough. If all goes according to plan, 247Solar will deploy the Series B funding to establish a cost-cutting, mass production system for a new 3.5-megawatt module. That’s a big leap up from the company’s current size of 400 kilowatts, but the timeline calls for full development to be completed within the next six months or so, leading to deployment in 2027.

Don’t be surprised to see 247Solar cropping up here in the US, too. 247Solar includes North American on its to-do list, along with its overseas pipeline. For all the hot air about “American Energy Dominance” blowing out of the White House, solar power is the fastest, most abundant, and most economical way to add more kilowatts to the nation’s power profile.

Clean Energy has completed its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas.

The site, now one of the largest RNG plants in the U.S., can produce ~2.6 million gallons of RNG per year.

The project processes 300,000 gallons of manure daily using four anaerobic digesters.

EPA has approved the facility to generate RINs under the Renewable Fuel Standard, with LCFS credits expected in 2026.

The company's leaders and the dairy owner highlighted circular-economy and emissions-reduction benefits.

Clean Energy Brings New RNG Production Facility Online

Clean Energy has announced the successful completion of its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas. The plant, now producing pipeline-quality RNG, has begun injection into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

The facility, financed entirely by Clean Energy, represents an $85 million investment and is among the nation’s largest RNG production sites. South Fork Dairy houses approximately 17,500 cows and is capable of producing around 2.6 million gallons of low-carbon RNG per year.

Clay Corbus, Senior Vice President at Clean Energy, said, “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply… but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

Clean Energy Highlights Circular Benefits for Agriculture

Designed to process up to 300,000 gallons of dairy manure per day, the facility uses four anaerobic digesters along with advanced gas-conversion equipment. The RNG produced is injected directly into an on-site gas line, and Clean Energy will receive 100 percent of the output.

Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy, commented: “Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us… Being a part of something so circular that allows the dairy to reduce its emissions while providing an additional income stream is an added bonus.”

Construction temporarily paused due to a fire impacting the dairy, but operations at both the dairy and the RNG facility have since been fully restored.

Regulatory Approvals Advance Clean Energy’s RNG Expansion

The RNG produced at South Fork Dairy has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for generating Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The suit claims that Duke attempted to block Florida-based NTE from competing to provide electricity for the city of Fayetteville.
Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case.
The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.
Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.","The US solicitor general opposes Duke Energy’s request to have the nation’s highest court review an anti-monopoly lawsuit against the utility company. A federal Appeals court ruled in 2024 that competitor NTE Carolinas could move forward with its suit against Duke.

The suit claims that Duke attempted to block Florida-based NTE from competing to provide electricity for the city of Fayetteville.

Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case. The high court issued a June order inviting Solicitor General John Sauer to submit a brief expressing the federal government’s view of the case.

“This appeal arises out of a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from disturbing its long-dominant hold over a regional energy market,” according to the brief Sauer’s office filed Monday. “Applying the established summary-judgment standard, the court of appeals concluded that this exclusionary campaign did not involve competition ‘on the merits,’ because petitioner could not compete with respondent on the basis of efficiency. And the court found that this campaign produced the very harms the federal antitrust laws are designed to prevent — ‘reduced consumer choice, higher prices in the long term, and market foreclosure.’”

The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals “properly held” that Duke was not entitled to summary judgment in the case. “That fact-bound decision does not warrant further review,” Sauer’s brief argued. “Nor is this case a suitable vehicle to announce any broader rule of antitrust law.”

The solicitor general labeled Duke Energy the “beneficiary of a government grant more than a century ago.” Duke “has controlled the wholesale-power market in the Carolinas for generations. It has maintained that position in part because many barriers to entry exist in this industry.”

“Power plants have high startup costs, and ‘anchor’ clients sizable enough to cover those costs are rare,” the solicitor general argued. “By dissuading such customers from switching to a potential competitor, an entrenched monopolist can prevent new entrants from gaining a foothold in the region — without creating a better product, producing a better service, or implementing a general price cut.”

The record in the case “would support a finding that that is exactly what happened here,” according to the brief.

“Petitioner’s older plants were ‘not competitive’ with respondent’s plants, which used superior technology to produce cleaner power at a far cheaper rate,” Sauer’s brief argued. “So when respondent sought to build a new facility in the Carolinas, petitioner sought to target the competition itself. Petitioner recognized that this new plant would be viable only if respondent could sell power to the City of Fayetteville, the one sizable customer in the area whose contract was coming due. Petitioner therefore took a variety of steps intended to deter Fayetteville from switching to a new supplier.”

“Petitioner succeeded — and respondent presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that petitioner did so through means ‘other than efficiency,’” the brief continued. “For instance, petitioner ‘manufactured’ a ‘sham breach’ of an interconnection agreement to make it appear that respondent’s plant would be ‘unable to transmit its power.’”

“Likewise, petitioner restructured Fayetteville’s contract to give the City a short-term discount and lump-sum payment, which petitioner would recoup through a long-term price hike on other customers,” Sauer’s brief added. “All told, without ever competing with respondent on the merits (i.e., offering a better service), petitioner was able to prevent respondent from operating its superior facility.”

“When a monopolist engages in a coordinated campaign to squelch competition, no circuit holds that each discrete aspect of the defendant’s conduct must be analyzed in isolation,” the solicitor general argued. “Instead, courts uniformly agree, consistent with this [Supreme] Court’s precedent, that a holistic analysis is appropriate in circumstances like these.”

A unanimous three-judge 4th Circuit panel ruled against Duke Energy in August 2024. The panel threw out a trial judge’s ruling in the dispute. The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.

Duke’s Supreme Court petition criticized the 4th Circuit panel’s decision.

“This petition presents an important and recurring question of antitrust law: when can 0 + 0 = 1? The district court found that antitrust math is no different from ordinary arithmetic. If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke’s lawyers wrote. “The court of appeals concluded otherwise, embracing a ‘monopoly broth’ theory prominent in the 1960s to 1980s but long since discarded.”

“This Court’s intervention is needed to restore antitrust law to the principles that have governed for the last three decades,” the petition continued.

The 4th Circuit “bucked” the consensus of “[f]ive courts of appeals, numerous district courts, and the leading antitrust treatise” about the proper approach to the case, Duke’s lawyers argued.

“[T]o get around this Court’s well-established tests for predatory pricing, refusals to deal, and sham litigation, NTE dusted off the old monopoly-broth playbook, arguing that Duke was liable because of its overall ‘anticompetitive scheme,’” the petition argued. “This time, the move worked. Breaking from decades of case law, the Fourth Circuit held that antitrust plaintiffs can add up distinct, independently lawful actions and put their ‘combined effect’ before a jury.”

NTE Carolinas responded to Duke’s arguments in its Supreme Court brief.

“The Fourth Circuit held that respondents have a triable monopolization case for two independent reasons,” the brief explained. “First, a reasonable jury could find multiple acts by Duke unlawful under this Court’s canonical tests for predatory pricing and refusal to deal. Second, petitioners’ conduct involved ‘a complex or atypical exclusionary campaign, the individual components of which do not fit neatly within pre-established categories.’”

“Because this Court’s specific tests for common types of monopolistic conduct do not cover all the ‘many different forms’ of anticompetitive conduct, which ‘cannot always be categorized,’ the court below also considered Duke’s course of conduct ‘as a whole’ and found that a reasonable jury could find it anti-competitive,” NTE Carolinas’ lawyers wrote.

Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.

“In particular, NTE presented evidence in the district court that Duke devised a plan to ensure that NTE, its only serious competitor, would not have the opportunity to compete for the business of Fayetteville, North Carolina, the only major wholesale customer whose long-term contract with Duke was expiring soon enough to allow NTE to compete for its business,” Niemeyer wrote.

“The district court granted Duke’s motion for summary judgment, in which Duke argued that the conduct that NTE imputed to Duke constituted legitimate competition in seeking to retain Fayetteville’s business and that none of the actions on which NTE relied was unlawful,” Niemeyer added. “While the court concluded that there was a question of fact on whether Duke had monopoly power, it also concluded as a matter of law that Duke did not engage in anticompetitive conduct but rather legitimate competition to retain Fayetteville’s business.”

“While we recognize that much of Duke’s conduct can be understood to be legitimate competitive conduct, … we also have found much from which a jury could conclude that Duke’s actions were illegitimate anticompetitive conduct that violated § 2 of the Sherman Act,” the 4th Circuit opinion continued. “Because genuine disputes of material fact exist, we vacate the district court’s summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/john-sauer.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:41.313754

About Gratitude Railroad Gratitude Railroad is an asset manager and impact investing network dedicated to transforming capital to create a thriving world.","NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, December 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Plankton-Gratitude Yield Co. (PGY), a joint venture between Plankton Energy and Gratitude Railroad, announced the final close of its inaugural fund, surpassing its $10 million equity target to support a portfolio of 35 – 40 solar projects worth an estimated $40 million. The launch comes amid a surge in U.S. electricity demand — driven by electric vehicle adoption, AI data centers, and the broader electrification of industry — and demonstrates that distributed clean energy can continue to get financed and developed amid policy changes.

PGY’s development and operational strength is powered by Plankton Energy, an experienced distributed solar developer with a track record of energizing projects and delivering compelling financial returns. With a team specialized in development, engineering, operations, and asset management, Plankton enables PGY to aggregate projects into a diversified portfolio representing an under-served, high-potential market segment that can deliver predictable, tax-advantaged cash yield.

“The energy transition won’t happen solely on vast utility-scale fields,” said Dan Giuffrida, CEO of Plankton Energy. “It’s also taking place on rooftops, campuses, and buildings in our communities. By investing in the mid-market, we’re using existing infrastructure to generate renewable power close to where it’s consumed — improving grid reliability and accelerating decarbonization.”

Plankton Energy has developed a robust pipeline of projects across retail, industrial, office, nonprofit, and school facilities. PGY has already acquired eleven projects — three currently energized and eight in various stages of construction — that meet its financial and impact criteria. Plankton Energy is underway with development of an additional 25 projects across three northeastern states. More than half of the projects will be community solar, enabling low- and moderate-income residents to participate in the clean energy economy and save on their energy bills.

Anchoring this partnership is Gratitude Railroad, which brings more than a decade of experience in financial asset management, a committed network of investors, and a disciplined focus on opportunities that deliver both strong financial performance and meaningful impact. Identifying market gaps and shaping joint ventures are core to Gratitude’s work.

“This new fund represents a step forward for distributed clean energy,” said Rebekah Saul Butler, Managing Partner at Gratitude Railroad. “We aim to demonstrate that small commercial and community solar delivers solid financial returns alongside community benefits — reducing pollution, lowering energy costs, and powering the technologies that define our future.”

PGY recently closed a $7.5 million revolving construction facility with Locus that will enable the building of all of the portfolio projects. The fund also partners with RSF for term debt and receives additional financing through tax-credit transfers. Revenue is generated through a diversified stream of electricity sales and state incentives in the form of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs).

Amid ongoing policy shifts and evolving federal tax-credit guidance, PGY has moved decisively to leverage incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act — including community solar and domestic-content “adders,” as well as new tax-credit transferability provisions — which continue to be available for projects advancing in the lower middle market. These mechanisms expand project eligibility, increase available capital, and strengthen the economics of distributed solar, making it attractive to investors who are nimble and attuned to the policy context.

PGY meets rising investor demand for cash yield with meaningful impact at a time when reducing emissions and making energy more affordable are urgent priorities.

The grants will leverage more than $8 million in matching contributions from the grantees themselves, resulting in more than $20 million in total conservation impact for projects in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.

The 2025 Long Island Sound Futures Fund (Futures Fund) grants will support projects that:

Prevent 618,934 gallons of stormwater and 2,996 pounds of nitrogen pollution from entering the Long Island Sound

Remove 161,250 pounds of marine debris

Restore 70 acres of coastal habitat

Engage more than 300,000 people through programs that promote stewardship of the Sound

Conserve and enhance habitats for shorebirds, songbirds, diamondback terrapins, native pollinators and other wildlife

Restore fish passage for brook trout and migratory aquatic species such as alewives, blueback herring, shad and eel

Launch new oyster restoration efforts

Funding for the grant program comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Long Island Sound Partnership (LISP), with additional support from NFWF and The Zoetis Foundation.

“Estuaries and their surrounding lands and waters represent some of the most productive wildlife habitats and most economically important areas in the world,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF. “The Long Island Sound is the second-largest estuary on the East Coast and one of North America’s most biologically diverse estuaries. Its watershed stretches 16,820 square miles across five states, with more than 16,000 miles of rivers feeding fresh water into the sound.

“Sustaining the health of Long Island Sound benefits a wondrous assortment of wildlife while also ensuring prosperity for thousands of communities, large and small.”

The LISP initiated the Futures Fund in 2005 through EPA’s Long Island Sound Office and NFWF. The grant program has a strong history of making environmental improvements by supporting people and communities who value the Sound and take a direct role in its future.

Since its inception, the Futures Fund has invested $68 million in 688 projects. The program has generated an additional $87 million of grantee matching contributions toward these projects for a total conservation impact of $167 million. The projects have reduced 130,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the Sound, restored 862 acres of fish and wildlife habitat, treated 212 million gallons of stormwater pollution, and engaged 5 million people in protection and restoration of the Sound.

“This year’s Futures Fund projects will support water quality improvements, habitat restoration, and other critical efforts across the watershed that are vital to protecting Long Island Sound,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Mark Sanborn. “Long Island Sound is a national treasure, and this funding exemplifies EPA’s commitment to supporting the economic and recreational benefits the Sound offers to millions of people.”

“EPA is proud to support conservation and restoration efforts in the Long Island Sound, working alongside our state and local partners,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci. “These practical projects not only preserve vital ecosystems but also help build a legacy of environmental stewardship for future generations.”

“The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) stands proudly with the Long Island Sound Partnership and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in welcoming another year of impactful Futures Fund projects across the Long Island Sound Watershed,” CT DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “In Connecticut, eleven distinct NGOs took home a total of 12 awards (Save the Sound was awarded two!) for projects ranging from riparian buffers to fish passage restoration, hands-on science programs to saltmarsh restoration, and a green roof. These are just a few of the ways that today’s grantees are embracing this funding opportunity to further the health of our resources and residents across the Long Island Sound Watershed.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said ""DEC is committed to protecting Long Island Sound, one of New York’s most important natural resources, a vital economic engine, and a place cherished by communities along its shores. The Futures Fund supports projects that strengthen the Sound’s ecosystem by improving water quality, restoring habitats, and encouraging local stewardship, while reflecting a shared commitment with our partners at EPA, NFWF, and CTDEEP. DEC applauds the awardees for the meaningful benefits their work will deliver.""

Against this backdrop, four trends are reshaping the global renewable energy landscape.
All of these effects will help overcome the wider public’s two main bugbears of renewable energy – its intermittent nature and perceived high cost of electricity production – and hopefully make the widespread deployment of renewable energy more attractive.
FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond?
In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable.","FW: What do you see as the most transformative trends currently reshaping the global renewable energy landscape?

McWilliams: The global renewable energy landscape is shifting from climate-first to security-driven economics. China, Europe and the US now prioritise supply chain resilience and industrial competitiveness alongside long-term 2050 goals. China’s dominance – over 80 percent of solar manufacturing, 75 percent of batteries and 95 to 97 percent of rare earth processing – creates structural dependencies that the policies of other countries are aiming to unravel. A further structural trend is artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) rapidly rising electricity demand: industry projections suggest data centres could exceed Japan’s consumption by 2030, with grid bottlenecks already delaying around 20 percent of new projects. Renewables overtook coal as the largest source of global power in early 2025, but further gains depend on also allocating capital to grid infrastructure, storage and industrial electrification, where significant system-wide returns may now sit.

Duman: While the current economic and political climate has slowed down investments in renewable energy projects in certain jurisdictions and renewable energy developers and operators are contending with higher interest and inflation rates, more expensive renewable energy projects and a weakening of state government support and incentives – as demonstrated by the US federal government’s opposition to offshore wind projects, as well as the UK government’s recent consultation paper to change or pause the inflation escalator index for UK renewable energy credits – renewable energy still continues to remain a focus globally with global renewable power output continuing to increase rapidly. As a result, renewable energy developers have become more circumspect and selective with their investments. In this more selective environment, solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind continue to be the backbone of new renewable capacity. According to the International Energy Agency, around 95 percent of the next wave of renewables are likely to come from solar PV and onshore wind. Cheap solar in particular continues to be transformational, with declining module costs, faster installation and modularity – from rooftop to utility scale – pushing solar deeper into emerging markets. One of the biggest barriers to high renewables penetration is variability and the growing need for stable energy. Energy storage, especially battery storage, is developing at pace, both in scale and cost reduction.

Moir: Geopolitical tensions are fuelling volatility in energy markets, and in some regions, consensus on the energy transition is being questioned. Against this backdrop, four trends are reshaping the global renewable energy landscape. First, electricity demand is growing faster than overall energy demand, driven by AI adoption, electrified transport and cooling systems, while renewables dominate new capacity additions. Second, rapid electrification and renewable deployment are exposing grid constraints as a critical bottleneck, with connection queues far exceeding available capacity, highlighting the need for major transmission upgrades. Third, grid flexibility is becoming essential – integrating intermittent renewables requires assets that stabilise the grid, including short and long duration storage, such as batteries, hydrogen and pumped hydro, nuclear, including small modular reactors, dispatchable low-carbon power, and gas power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Finally, governments are responding to inflationary pressures by lowering the cost of capital and consumer prices through long term, transparent frameworks such as contracts for difference (CfDs), capacity markets and regulated asset base (RAB)-style models.

FW: How are recent advances in energy storage technologies changing the economics and reliability of renewable power systems?

Duman: Battery storage operators are now using AI to analyse complex and large datasets such as weather patterns, historical data and market prices to forecast energy needs and renewable energy output from solar and wind facilities. Analysis has shown that the forecasts of such AI models are 25 percent more accurate than forecasts using traditional methods. By using such AI models, battery storage operators are able to predict energy supply and demand more accurately and navigate the peaks and troughs of energy supply and demand more accurately, thus allowing them to maximise the arbitrage between the electricity they purchase from the grid and store in their battery systems during troughs, and the electricity they sell and discharge to the grid during peaks.

Moir: Recent advances in electricity storage are transforming the economics and reliability of renewable power systems. Storage is shifting from a niche role in ancillary services to a core component of system infrastructure. Falling battery costs and wider price spreads enable profitable arbitrage and co-location with wind and solar, reducing curtailment and negative pricing risk, improving revenue stability and project bankability. Long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is gaining traction, supported by mechanisms such as the UK’s cap-and-floor regime and Italy’s MACSE auctions, which de-risk debt and enhance financing. As short-term markets saturate, flexible resources and duration diversity become essential to manage multi-hour renewable lulls, intermittency and seasonal swings. Battery storage is now central to the energy transition, which is critical for higher renewable penetration amid grid constraints and rising electricity demand. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal storage to become increasingly important as renewables dominate supply.

McWilliams: Energy storage economics have flipped dramatically – global battery demand in one week of 2024 exceeded total annual demand a decade prior, reaching 1TWh for the first time. China’s control of over 75 percent of battery cell manufacturing delivers cost advantage through vertical integration and scale. Lithium-ion batteries have become cheaper despite raw material volatility, enhancing renewable project viability by mitigating intermittency. Beyond batteries, the EU leads in liquid air storage while pumped hydro delivers 46GW of EU capacity. Sodium-ion, flow batteries and solid-state technologies help diversify risks. However, regulatory frameworks and supply chain constraints for critical minerals remain challenges. Policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), EU Battery Regulation and UK Energy Act provide clarity on recycling mandates and manufacturing incentives, de-risking long-term storage investments essential for renewable reliability at scale.

FW: To what extent are policy frameworks like the Inflation Reduction Act or the EU Green Deal driving long-term investment in renewables?

McWilliams: The US IRA is reshaping deployment economics, mobilising over $1 trillion in projected investment through 2032. Solar additions are tracking around 40-50 percent above pre-IRA expectations, with around three-quarters of new clean energy investment flowing into below-median income counties. This reverses longstanding patterns of uneven regional investment and arises at a time when COP30’s Baku to Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035. The EU Green Deal is positioning wind as both a climate solution and a strategic industry, supporting around 300,000 jobs today and projected to become Europe’s largest power source by 2027. Policy risk remains, but framing decarbonisation through energy security has proven more politically durable and continues to anchor long-term private investment.

Moir: Investors seek certainty, stable policy and transparency. Political risk, including upcoming elections, often deters investment. A recent example is the uncertainty surrounding the IRA, which has shaken investor confidence in the US, delaying capital flows into renewable assets and slowing the energy transition. In contrast, Europe and the UK have earned credibility through stable frameworks like CfDs, capacity markets and regulated models, such as RAB for carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage, and new nuclear. These mechanisms are designed to reduce financing costs by providing predictable cash flows. Initiatives in the UK, such as Clean Power 2030 and targeted support for LDES, reinforce long-term commitments to renewables, flexibility and low-carbon dispatchable power. The lesson is clear – complex or shifting rules and political reversals deter investment. Stability, simplicity and credible delivery remain the decisive catalysts for attracting long-term capital.

Duman: Policy frameworks have been highly effective in attracting private capital to investments in renewable energy projects, by creating stable investment regimes and promising predictable investment returns for private investors. Indeed, both the IRA and the EU’s Green Deal have been recognised for rallying hundreds of billions of dollars of private investments into renewable energy projects, while creating and reskilling workers for numerous high-quality, well-paying jobs in the renewables sector. However, investors have become more cautious with respect to policy frameworks, noting that they can be easily withdrawn due to a change in governments or political headwinds and they can also lead to malinvestments in the renewables sector.

FW: What role do you foresee for green hydrogen in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors by 2026 and beyond?

Moir: Green hydrogen is entering early deployment, with its near-term role concentrated in hard-to-abate sectors where electrification is not feasible. Industrial heat, refining, chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel remain the most promising applications, but only if costs decrease. However, the buzz around green hydrogen a few years ago has started to fade, with many projects being delayed or cancelled – even those that have received generous government subsidies – and several players deciding to leave the market entirely. Aside from the challenging economics, the two key challenges being faced are the lack of an offtake market and of large-scale transportation and storage infrastructure. There simply is not a broad market of creditworthy offtakers willing to commit to long-term contracts with material potential liabilities, particularly if it may involve material capital expenditure to enable the facility or asset to use hydrogen or increased operational risk. And the lack of existing infrastructure heightens the risk of there being a single point of failure, for both the supplier and the offtaker, with no easy way to mitigate. If green hydrogen is to fulfil its potential, governments will need to address both these issues, including helping to solve the ‘chicken and egg’ issue in relation to building new infrastructure.

Duman: While hard-to-abate sectors are major contributors to global CO2 emissions – the production of steel, cement and fertiliser accounts for approximately 9 percent, 8 percent and 2 percent of annual global emissions respectively – the products of such sectors are necessary for human development, and we can only expect global usage of such products, and related CO2 emissions, to grow as the world population increases and global living standards rise. Therefore, green hydrogen will have a key role in the decarbonisation of these industries as it remains the most promising solution to this conundrum. However, large scale green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy and further investments, government support and incentives, alongside continued research and development, will likely be required to further develop and scale-up the technology.

McWilliams: By 2026, green hydrogen will primarily scale in sectors where consumers or manufacturers can absorb a sustainability premium, notably green steel and low-carbon logistics. China holds more than 60 percent of global electrolyser manufacturing, replicating the pattern seen in solar and batteries and complicating reshoring efforts elsewhere. Recent demonstrations show viable hydrogen use in glass, ceramics and minerals processing, with feedstock replacement and seasonal storage expected to follow. Hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation will rely on hydrogen-derived fuels, while blue hydrogen provides transitional volumes because it can be produced at industrial scale using existing gas infrastructure, bridging supply until green hydrogen becomes cost-competitive. Infrastructure remains the constraint, as pipelines, storage and port facilities must develop in parallel with demand. Amid all of this, companies are increasingly structuring contracts to preserve optionality as hydrogen economics evolve.

FW: How are supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies influencing project timelines and costs in the renewable sector?

Duman: The supply chain shocks stemming from recent events – ranging from the Houthi rebels’ attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, to tariff wars over solar panels and critical and rare earth minerals – have pushed the issue of supply chain vulnerabilities to the forefront of renewable project developers’ minds. Developers now have to plan for mitigants to counteract such vulnerabilities, including rerouting supply chains, finding contingency suppliers or replacing suppliers altogether, and purchasing more expensive insurance policies – all of which results in more costs for the project and potentially extensions to the project timeline. In relation to tariffs on supplies and equipment for renewable projects, developers are now keen to negotiate with their counterparties to allocate liability for unforeseen tariffs.

McWilliams: Supply chain brittleness is now the primary cause of renewable project delays, regardless of policy support. The 2025 US-Australia critical minerals framework, which is an $8.5bn pipeline with $1bn initial financing, highlights geopolitical realignment as Australia navigates friendshoring with other allies and while China tightens rare earth export controls. Analysts still expect 10-20 years before meaningful supply independence, with diversification constrained by China’s structural dominance comprising 95-97 percent of rare earth processing and major control of polysilicon. Operational limits compound these pressures because, even when materials are available, shortages in engineering capacity, fabrication and specialised installation vessels slow the shift from approval to construction. The UK faces a 1-2GW annual solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) shortfall, and vessel scarcity threatens delivery of roughly 42GW of approved offshore wind capacity, requiring near-doubling of installation capability. In this environment of structural constraint, nickel, cobalt and graphite may stabilise, but copper risks a 30 percent deficit by the mid-2030s. Developers are therefore lengthening procurement windows and adding escalation clauses, yet mine development cycles of 7-10 years mean supply cannot adjust quickly.

Moir: Supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies are increasingly shaping renewable project timelines and costs. Geopolitical tensions have exposed concentration risks, with China controlling most lithium, cobalt and rare earth refining. Export restrictions and price volatility for copper, steel and specialised components, compounded by tariffs and inflation, are extending lead times and raising EPC costs. Added scrutiny of Chinese components for environmental, social and governance, as well as cyber and broader national security concerns, are further tightening terms and affecting bankability. Offshore wind illustrates the challenge, as long waits for heavy-lift vessels, turbines, high voltage direct current cables and other key components are slowing deployment. Developers are responding with longer, more collaborative procurement, earlier supplier engagement and more robust standardised supply contracts, covering contingencies such as force majeure, change in law, and so on, realistic schedules and cost-control provisions. Governments are rolling out industrial strategies and port upgrades, but these measures will take time. For now, proactive risk management and disciplined planning remain essential to protect returns.

FW: In your view, how is digitalisation through AI, smart grids and the internet of things enabling more efficient and scalable deployment of renewables?

Moir: Digitalisation has shifted from being an add-on to a core enabler of renewable integration and scalability. AI-driven optimisation improves dispatch, revenue stacking and battery cycling strategies across multiple markets, while predictive maintenance reduces downtime and extends asset life. Smart grids and advanced system planning, centralised through bodies like the National Energy System Operator, use real-time data to prioritise reinforcements, manage congestion and unlock connections, moving from ‘first-come’ to ‘first-ready and needed’. At the edge, internet of things (IoT) devices enable consumer-led flexibility, complementing utility-scale storage and interconnectors, though progress has been slower than expected. Meanwhile, the AI and data centre boom driving demand is also catalysing flexible power purchase agreements and co-location with low-carbon dispatchable power. These projects benefit from low-cost integration at scale and the creditworthiness of offtakers, often major tech companies.

McWilliams: AI, IoT and digital grid controls are enabling more efficient renewable deployment and simultaneously increasing system stress. AI-enabled building and industrial management systems can cut energy use by 16-36 percent, easing peak loads at a time when global grids may need 80 million kilometres of new transmission by 2040. China leads large-scale smart grid rollout, using AI-controlled microgrids and smart inverters to integrate solar and storage while creating new revenue opportunities through virtual power plants. IoT sensors improve real-time grid visibility and fault detection, yet AI’s power demand is rising fast, pushing data centre developers to choose locations based on power availability rather than network infrastructure, with many planning onsite generation, including renewable sources, by 2030. The constraints are, however, familiar – high upfront costs, interoperability issues, cyber security exposure and regulatory lag. Coordinated investment in both digital and physical grid infrastructure is essential for renewables to scale reliably.

Duman: The digitalisation of the entire energy ecosystem will allow all stakeholders to better optimise their production, transmission and consumption of electricity, for example by improving the collection of energy data, which will then be used for more accurate energy demand and supply forecasts. It may also improve the monitoring and control of electrical grid balance, especially for the purposes of energy storage and integration of renewable energy facilities into the grid. End-users will also be provided with real-time information of their energy usage to enable them to make more informed decisions on their energy consumption. Digitalisation is also likely to increase the grid’s resilience with automated fault detection and mitigation measures. All of these effects will help overcome the wider public’s two main bugbears of renewable energy – its intermittent nature and perceived high cost of electricity production – and hopefully make the widespread deployment of renewable energy more attractive.

FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond? How might supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns influence future demand?

McWilliams: The outlook for 2026 and beyond is defined by strong ambition but uneven capacity. COP30’s Baku-Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance by 2035, but delivery depends on navigating China’s dominance across manufacturing and materials. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those linked to Russia, have also accelerated Europe’s pursuit of energy independence, boosting renewables even as supply chain bottlenecks slow deployment. Vessel shortages, rare earth dependencies and limited construction capacity remain critical risks that policy cannot resolve quickly. Social equity will shape political durability. Renewables create substantial jobs, but legacy energy workforce transitions must be actively managed to maintain support. Upfront system costs remain a barrier for low-income households despite improving economics. The outlook for 2026 and beyond depends on balancing these tensions. Countries that deepen domestic supply chains, secure critical minerals and manage social transitions effectively will capture outsize investment and deployment growth through the late 2020s.

Duman: Renewable energy technology is still becoming cheaper and more efficient, and this will continue to drive the investment case for the renewables sector. In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable. Finally, the trend of deglobalisation, which has been one of the root causes for supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns, could work toward solving some of the issues the sector currently faces as a result of governments’ focus on developing onshore industries – eventually leading to an increase in domestic manufacturing and enhanced national energy security.

Moir: We expect that renewables, storage and nuclear will continue to grow, driven by economics, electrification and AI mainstream adoption. The main constraint remains grid infrastructure. Transmission build-out, both on and offshore, the integration of flexible assets and connection reforms will determine how quickly queued projects reach commercial operations date. Due to the penetration of renewables, we expect more volatility and seasonality in power markets, increasing the value of flexibility and long-duration storage. Supply chain pressures should ease gradually with industrial policy, such as US nearshoring, but vessel availability, critical mineral diversification and geopolitics will continue to shape costs. Trade tariffs, election cycles and policy reversals will influence investor appetite and financing costs. Markets with stable, simple frameworks and credible delivery will attract capital. Finally, governments must manage consumer costs and deliver local benefits, including jobs and infrastructure upgrades, to maintain public acceptance and political stability.

Canada’s Gibson Energy just renewed decades-long contracts at its key Edmonton terminal, greenlit a new US infrastructure project, and laid out a fully funded growth and maintenance budget for 2026.

What does this mean?

Gibson Energy renewed a 20-year take-or-pay refined products services deal and added another 10 years to a terminal storage take-or-pay agreement at its Edmonton, Alberta terminal with major integrated oil sands customers. Those take-or-pay contracts guarantee Gibson a minimum level of revenue whether or not customers use the full capacity, smoothing cash flows in a volatile commodity world. The firm says these extensions prove the growing demand for its infrastructure and highlight how essential the Edmonton terminal is to oil sands producers’ logistics. South of the border, Gibson has approved a new infrastructure project in Texas that will tie into its Wink-to-Gateway system, supporting US-led growth. To back all this up, the company issued 2026 growth capital guidance of C$150 million – including about C$50 million of already sanctioned spend – plus a C$50–60 million replacement capital program, stressing that its 2026 plan is fully funded from existing resources.

Why should I care?

Markets: Locked-in cash flows soothe energy sector nerves.

Long-term take-or-pay contracts are prized in the midstream world because they provide clear visibility on future revenue, regardless of short-term oil price swings. By renewing a 20-year refined products agreement and tacking on 10 more years of storage services, Gibson is effectively pinning down a big slice of its future earnings with bond-like cash streams. That kind of stability can help support valuations and dividends in a sector where plenty of rivals still lean on more volume-sensitive, shorter-term deals. And with the Texas project tying into Wink-to-Gateway, Gibson is signaling that capital is still flowing into North American oil logistics, hinting that investors expect steady demand for oil sands and Permian barrels even as the energy transition rolls on.

The bigger picture: Pipelines still shape the energy transition’s messy middle.

Oil sands producers need dependable storage and transportation to keep exports flowing, and Gibson’s Edmonton terminal is part of that backbone. When “senior integrated oil sands customers” commit to 10–20 years of service, they are effectively betting on meaningful production and refining activity well into the 2040s, despite mounting climate policy pressure. At the same time, the Texas expansion and Wink-to-Gateway integration point to resilient cross-border energy trade between Canada and the US, even as both countries pour money into renewables. For policymakers and executives, that underscores a key reality: large midstream assets are still attracting multi-decade commitments, which will influence how the energy mix shifts and how capital gets split between fossil fuel and low-carbon infrastructure.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3515607_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=51712c2911317f791a3052e388c11439,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:04.381309

Total sales declined 0.9% to 164,925 vehicles for the month. Dealer services provider Cox Automotive Inc. forecasted U.S. sales for the industry would fall to 1.27 million in November, down 7.8% from last year. Two fewer selling days, the end of the federal EV tax credit and higher vehicle prices from tariffs affected the total.

Sales of F-Series pickups, the country's best-selling trucks and the Dearborn automaker's profit engine, fell 9.6%. Multiple fires at an aluminum sheet plant in New York over the past seven weeks halted electric F-150 Lightning production and disrupted Super Duty and F-150 volumes.

Ford expects to make up some of the lost production next year with an added shift at Dearborn Truck Plant and additional workers at Kentucky Truck plant. It's not clear when F-150 Lightning manufacturing will resume, and reports have suggested Ford is considering ending the program. The company plans to launch in 2028 a next-generation electric full-size pickup at its new BlueOval City plant in Tennessee.

The decision to suspend Lightning production came after the end of the federal tax credit. That's part of a campaign by the administration of President Donald Trump to dismantle what he has termed an ""EV mandate"" on consumers. It comes alongside efforts to revoke California's waiver to set its own tailpipe emissions standards that other state can adopt and to roll back federal emissions requirements.

Despite the EV drop, consumers did embrace some form of electrification: Hybrids were up 14%, being a more flexible option for buyers with EV range anxiety. Gas- and diesel-powered vehicles were up 2.2%, as dealers look to sell off 2025 model-year cars, trucks and SUVs.

Total truck sales were flat, while SUV deliveries declined 4.9% with the electric Mustang Mach-E down 49%. The Mustang coupe rose 79%. The Lincoln luxury brand declined 12%.

For SUVs, Expedition, whose production also was hit by the Novelis Inc. aluminum plant fires, was down 8.8%. Escape fell 32% ahead of the end of its production for retooling at Louisville Assembly Plant for an electric midsize truck built on the next-generation Universal EV Platform and Production System. Explorer grew 42%. Bronco was up 7%, but Bronco Sport fell 4.1%.

F-150 Lightning sales declined 72%. Ranger midsize truck grew 36%. Maverick small pickup was up 43%. Transit commercial van rose 17%, while the E-Transit fell 82%. General Motors Co. said last month it was ending production of its Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans built in Canada.

At Lincoln, Navigator and Aviator rose 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Nautilus fell 30% and Corsair, which is ending production alongside the Escape, declined 12%.

Elsewhere, Kia Corp.'s U.S. sales rose 3% in November. Hyundai Motor Co.'s were down 2%. GM and Stellantis NV don't report monthly sales. The Detroit Three will report fourth-quarter and full-year U.S. sales after the new year.

Reshoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms, the largest being increased payroll and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes.
It is touted by reshoring proponents that when a manufacturing facility moves back to the United States or expands, it creates domestic jobs that generate significant tax revenue.
These incentives often include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation and exemptions that reduce the immediate taxable income, lowering the initial tax revenue.
In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, 4.8 workers are added to the overall U.S. economy.","The Trump administration has stated that its economic agenda is designed to address the debt crisis by focusing on pro-growth policies that it expects will generate enough revenue to reduce the debt burden.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” is the cornerstone of the plan and involves significant tax cuts, which the administration argues will unleash rapid economic growth. The belief is that this accelerated growth will generate a larger tax base, ultimately leading to greater tax revenues that will help pay down the debt.

Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other non-partisan analysts, have estimated that the net effect of the tax plan, when fully accounted for, will likely add several trillion dollars to the national debt over the next decade due to lost revenue.

The administration’s trade strategy, which includes imposing new tariffs on imported goods, claims these duties will generate “trillions of dollars” for the federal government, providing a new source of revenue to offset the deficit. However, based on recent estimates from non-partisan economic think tanks, the new tariffs are generally projected to generate revenue in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion in 2026.

The final, official figure for the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget deficit is estimated to be approximately $1.8 trillion based on the final estimates and reporting from the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Treasury Department. For the first time, net interest payments on the national debt surpassed $1 trillion due to both high debt levels and higher interest rates.

Spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continued to rise significantly, growing by about 8% collectively. While revenues increased overall due to individual income and payroll taxes, this was partially offset by a decline in corporate tax receipts, potentially due to new tax deductions.

What could be a genuine game changer in attacking the $38 trillion federal debt is the speed and magnitude of the reshoring of foreign manufacturing to U.S. states. When looking at potential future revenue streams, aside from raising taxes to offset deficit spending, generating hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs that work in tandem with AI is a viable option that carries large tax revenue implications.

There are no specific estimates of future tax revenue from the reshoring of manufacturing. Reshoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms, the largest being increased payroll and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes. It is touted by reshoring proponents that when a manufacturing facility moves back to the United States or expands, it creates domestic jobs that generate significant tax revenue.

The second primary source of tax receipts is revenue from the profits of the new or expanded U.S.-based manufacturing companies, as well as revenue from taxes on capital investment, new construction and local property taxes for the new facilities. But reshoring is heavily incentivized by federal acts (like the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, etc.) and state programs. These incentives often include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation and exemptions that reduce the immediate taxable income, lowering the initial tax revenue. Hence, specific revenue estimates are elusive.

But the potential numbers look promising. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, there is a total impact of $2.65 to the overall U.S. economy. In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, 4.8 workers are added to the overall U.S. economy. This figure represents one of the largest sectoral multipliers in the economy. In 2024, manufacturing workers in the United States earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits. For all categories of manufacturing workers, average hourly earnings were $35.50, up 3.9% year over year.

Over the next decade, because of organic growth and reshoring efforts, 3.8 million manufacturing jobs will likely be needed, and 1.9 million are expected to be unfilled if more people do not pursue modern manufacturing careers. Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute found that of open jobs, 2.8 million will come from retirement and 760,000 from industry growth, and an estimated 230,000 jobs will be created from recent legislative and regulatory actions.

America leads the world in innovation, and manufacturers in the United States perform 52.9% of all private-sector R&D in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. R&D in the manufacturing sector has risen from $132.5 billion in 2000 to a record $404.8 billion in 2023. In the most recent data, pharmaceuticals accounted for 36.1% of all manufacturing R&D, spending $146.1 billion in 2023. Semiconductor and other electronic components (13.7%), other computer and electronic manufacturing (13.6%) and motor vehicles and parts (9.6%) also contributed significantly to R&D spending in 2023, with each hitting new all-time high levels of R&D for the year.

At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely. With retirements rising and digital fluency growing, manufacturers are capturing institutional knowledge, redesigning roles for human-machine collaboration and upskilling at scale.

Decarbonization is taking on new importance among companies who must reduce emissions to meet investor & customer expectations, while also delivering enterprise value. It is not a coincidence that decarbonization, when done correctly, enables companies to fulfill both obligations, given how interwoven emissions are with commercial value.

This third and final blog in our three-part series on operational decarbonization explores how companies can use tailored building management to reduce their real estate-based emissions while also bolstering operational performance. As with our first two blogs on industrial heat and fleets, we highlight real-world case studies to bring building sector decarbonization to life and highlight the unique challenges and opportunities associated with emissions across the built environment.

Reducing building sector emissions is a win-win for companies

Globally, energy used directly within buildings and for generating electricity and heat for buildings accounts for 26 percent of all energy-related emissions.These emissions are largely driven by electricity imports and fossil fuels such as natural gas, used for building heating applications.

The significant energy consumption giving rise to these emissions is naturally a major cost for building owners and occupiers, making reductions attractive both from an economic and emissions perspective.

Given these factors, reducing building energy consumption is a growing focus for building owners and occupiers, as is reducing associated emissions by switching to cleaner energy sources. The technologies needed to accomplish both objectives are mature and proven. Heating needs, for example, can be addressed by adopting heat pumps or connecting to heat networks and improving the building fabric with more efficient insulation and glazing solutions, as well as lighting upgrades. Building owners and occupiers can leverage smart technologies linked to advanced building management systems to optimize energy use, while also benefiting from the rapid growth of on-site renewables to generate low-cost, zero-carbon electricity.

There are clear benefits to tackling building energy use and reducing emissions. For example, building owners are more likely to attract tenants seeking a space with lower operating costs and who increasingly have emissions targets to meet, sometimes commanding a rent premium. Mandatory energy efficiency standards are also increasingly common. Thus, improving building performance helps avoid stranded assets, while also potentially offering access to preferential lending terms and higher valuations from sustainability-focused investors.

With real estate-based emissions being such a significant source of emissions for most companies, tackling them is a critical part of achieving any corporate-wide emissions reduction target. When paired with the cost savings from lower energy bills, building emissions reductions represent a major commercial opportunity.

Call to action

To get started on building decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.

Unlock hidden savings: Conduct a building energy audit to identify cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities through building efficiency improvements.

Invest in future-proof technologies: Invest in proven technologies like heat pumps, smart building management systems, and on-site renewables to increase operational efficiencies and attract tenants.

Move ahead of the curve: Avoid stranded assets, access preferential lending terms and higher valuations, and meet emerging energy efficiency standards by investing in building emissions reductions now.

Case study one

The situation

A global leisure and entertainment company with a portfolio of more than 120 sites worldwide sought a costed emissions reduction roadmap for its buildings portfolio to support its company-wide net zero target, and deliver an increased enterprise value via lower opex and an enhanced customer proposition.pe

The solution

ERM identified several sites that were representative of the company’s full portfolio, including a theme park, aquarium, museum, and mixed leisure attraction, before conducting deep-dive energy and carbon assessments on each archetype to establish its energy use profile.

For each archetype, ERM assessed a suite of carbon reduction measures, including energy efficiencies, on-site renewables, renewable energy procurement, and electrification of fossil fuel heating, cooling, and food preparation.

ERM then calculated emission impacts, costs, and benefits for the company’s full portfolio, adjusting for local climate and energy mixes at all global sites.

Lastly, ERM recommended measures to reduce the GHG emissions of the company’s building portfolio by over 90 percent. Key recommendations included: upgrades to heating, ventilation, cooling systems, lighting, motors, and pumps; installing rooftop and car-park solar photovoltaics; and procuring renewable electricity.

The impact

The site evaluation found that 73 percent of the building portfolio’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions could be eliminated with a total investment of just under $50 million. Furthermore, these measures all had a positive net present value or had no net cost impact.

ERM identified a further 20 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions that could be eliminated for an average cost of ~$100/tonne CO2

The assessment identified highly attractive energy efficiency measures, delivering GHG emissions savings of nearly 20 percent of base year emissions with payback periods of less than two years.

Lessons learned

Rapid progress towards an actionable decarbonization plan for large portfolios can be achieved through an ‘archetype-driven’ analysis focused on a sample of representative sites.

Companies can quickly evaluate and implement emissions reduction measures relevant to their global building portfolio, while accounting for regional climate and energy market contexts.

Layered assessments of multiple building decarbonization options can identify significant concurrent benefits, including operational cost savings, access to more favorable financing, and enhanced revenue protection.

Case study two

The situation

An automotive parts manufacturer with more than 60 manufacturing sites worldwide pursued energy consumption reductions across its site portfolio, using external capital funding through an Energy Saving as a Service (ESaaS) program.

The solution

ERM personnel applied a four-phase approach:

Identified Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) based on data collected from each site, on-site and remote audits of the manufacturer’s portfolio, plus workshops with local site teams. ERM personnel held workshops with each site team to “fill the gaps”, jointly, where there was missing data.

Secured funding for these ECMs, using a mix of energy supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Installed and commissioned the new

Delivered maintenance services for the installed equipment and provided active energy performance management via a dedicated digital platform to generate additional energy savings and drive behavioral change among employees (e.g., using energy more efficiently).

The impact

ERM personnel conducted audits on more than 60 sites across 10 countries and identified more than 250 ECMs and installed and commissioned the new equipment.

Over 500 GWh of energy use is now monitored for the manufacturer through a dedicated energy monitoring platform.

The above actions delivered an annual energy reduction of more than 10 percent across the site portfolio, representing annual CO2 savings of 40,000 tonnes, with no upfront investment by the company. Furthermore, the manufacturer achieved annual estimated cost savings of €6.2 million.

Lessons learned

Complex global companies can achieve significant energy and carbon reductions by implementing energy savings programs, with little or no capital investment, leveraging supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Data gaps do not have to block Companies can fill gaps via collaborative workshops with local site teams who better understand the specifics of their own operations and buildings portfolio.

Companies considering their own energy savings programs should ensure that their approaches are holistic (i.e., site- and company-wide, including process improvements) and verifiable through a comprehensive metering & monitoring campaign.

Conclusion

Our three-part blog series on operational decarbonization demonstrates how targeted emissions reduction initiatives can enhance corporate resiliency and performance amidst recent shifts in the business and geopolitical landscapes. These benefits are not exclusive to a select few companies. With the right actions, organizations operating across all sectors can access them regardless of their operational circumstances.

Taking lessons learned from the case studies covered above, companies with significant real-estate/built environment assets can translate decarbonization from ambition to actuality, reaping benefits along the way. Remember these key takeaways.

With the absence of the EV tax credit, automakers are predicting a market-wide slowdown over the next few quarters, and that puts brands in a weird limbo where executives expect the electric vehicle segment to stagnate despite the billions of dollars in recent investments.

But there's one market that automakers seem to be ignoring: the commercial one. It might seem obvious, but business-to-business sales aren't exactly paying the bills like the consumer auto market. They could be, though, and that's what one former General Motors executive is betting big on.

The Critical Materials Newsletter Has Arrived.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Nvidia is giving everyone the tools needed to build self-driving cars and Americans have had it with high car prices. Let's jump in.

30%: Automakers Are Retreating From Consumer EVs, But The Commercial Market Is Begging For Them

ZMD Truck Render

Former General Motors executive Dave Stenson believes that automakers are going about this perceived EV slowdown all wrong. While the big three in Detroit are seemingly leading a pullback in all things electric, Stenson is instead throwing his John DeLorean card onto the table and betting that his new startup has unlocked the secret to the next stage of electrification.

Stenson knows the drill—after all, he spent three decades in Detroit working through the algorithm of high-margin, high-volume consumer sales. Sell crossovers to suburbanites and the F-150s of the world. But when the government unstacks the deck and EVs no longer have a competitive edge, what can automakers do to ensure their new powertrains stay competitive?

Enter ZMD Motors, a startup that believes mainstream automakers have misjudged the timeline and approach to electrification. Essentially, ZMD is aiming to break the mold by moving into the medium-duty truck market. Stenson and ZMD see these platformed vehicles are the next big thing in the EV space.

Here's what Stenson revealed in an interview with Automotive News:

Stenson’s ultimate goal is to fill an untapped niche: the electrified Class 5 work truck category, to which the Ford F-550, Ram 5500 and Silverado 5500 belong. It’s been untapped for a reason, though. Automakers focused on light-duty, high-volume EVs first. Heavy-duty electrification poses unique challenges — range limitation being high on the list — with even less certain ROI prospects than light-duty electrics.

[...] The opportunity might be tough to see from Detroit, but in California, the business case is clear, Stenson said in an interview with Automotive News affiliate Crain’s Detroit Business.

“Nobody has brought a pickup cab-based, medium-duty EV to market,” Stenson said. “Whether it’s diesel or gas, you go out to California, and they don’t want either. They want electric where it fits their work needs.”

I know that you're just begging to hear about the next company that promises what might as well be vaporware. But ZMD's approach could just be the missing link in EV adoption.

See, the commercial segment of the auto industry is a completely different beast from passenger cars. Government, utility companies, construction firms and the like aren't shopping for the next big thing or a screen the size of a small TV. These consumers just want consistency and practicality, which gives brands an opportunity to focus on the tech and execution that can not only sustain a vehicle program but also build tech that will flow into the passenger car market in the future.

ZMD's truck-sized holes are the Class 5 work trucks. This opportunity represents an annual volume output of around 80,000 units. That's hardly an earth-shattering figure—GM sold nearly double that in passenger EVs through Q3 so far this year. But it is the perfect volume for a small startup that is eyeing up trucks with an ideal operating radius of less than 100 miles.

California in particular, is basically a goldmine in the waiting:

Electric medium-duty truck is a segment in high demand in California ZMD’s focus is on utility bucket trucks, municipal service trucks and the like, which make up a small but growing piece of the medium-duty niche. In California, there is huge demand for the product segment, said Daryl Trueblood, general manager at North Highland, Calif.-based vehicle upfitter One Stop Truck & Equipment.

Stenson's pitch is for automakers to supply the cab and chassis, then let ZMD do the rest. This lets both companies take a foothold in the Class 5 market while also supplying companies with a product that they so desperately want.

Will it work? Maybe. But what's keeping automakers from simply pivoting and copying ZMD's homework?

60%: Nvidia Gives Everyone The Brain Behind Self-Driving Cars

Nvidia Lidar

Nvidia has decided that if the world insists on building self-driving cars, it might as well give everyone a brain smart enough to handle the task.

The company officially released its newest self-driving model, Alpamayo-R1, this week. Nvidia is pitching it as the Rosetta Stone of robot driving that uses natural language to describe exactly what it sees and then acts on that description accordingly. Reuters explains:

On Monday, Nvidia released Alpamayo-R1 for self-driving vehicles. The software is what is known as a ""vision-language-action"" AI model, which means that the self-driving vehicle translates what its sensor banks see on the road into a description using natural language. [...]

For example, if the car sees a bike path, it will note that it sees the path and is adjusting course.

This seems like a basic problem to solve, but one of the biggest problems that engineers have reiterated time and time again is how difficult it can be to understand how self-driving models make the decisions they do. But with a model that describes its reasoning in an easy-to-understand natural language, that black box problem is less and less of a concern.

Most previous self-driving car software was limited in how it explained why the car chose a particular path, making it hard for engineers to understand what needed to be fixed to make the cars safer.

""One of the entire motivations behind making this open is so that developers and researchers can... understand how these models work so we can, as an industry, come up with standard ways of evaluating how they work,"" Katie Young, senior marketing manager for the automotive enterprise at Nvidia, told Reuters.

Nvidia says that the dataset has a total of 1,727 hours of recorded driving over 310,895 clips (each one about 20 seconds long). It isn't just perfect road conditions, either. The company says that it captured ""diverse traffic, weather conditions, obstacles and pedestrians"" in the model and also blends multi-camera and lidar for about half of the clips while 163,850 also have radar coverage as well. Half of the data is from U.S. roads.

If you're interested in exploring the model, you can download the dataset on Hugging Face and the developer kit on GitHub.

90%: Americans Have Had It With High Car Prices

For nearly half a decade, consumers have been paying the COVID-19 tax on new and used cars. Sticker price? Merely a suggestion as dealers are capitalizing on the ""Sure, I'll pay that!"" attitude since 2020.

But Americans have finally had enough of it. The average transaction price of a new car has skyrocketed to around $50,000, while new EVs are hitting a high of $59,125.

Those same dealerships are now noticing it in their sales trends. Analysts are also seeing in car-buying data that cars sit on lots for longer periods of time, and cash-on-the-hood discounts (which seemingly went extinct as the chip shortage started) are even making a comeback. The Wall Street Journal spills what's on consumers' minds:

Car buyers are downsizing, buying used vehicles, taking on longer car loans and holding out for deals.

“People are asking, ‘How can I afford this?’” said Robert Peltier, who owns dealerships in East Texas. He said traffic, while still solid, has slowed at his dealerships and more customers are gravitating toward less-costly cars such as the pint-size Chevrolet Trax. “There are people who are in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.”

This is kind of an unexpected, dramatic turn. 2025 was meant to be a victory lap—tax cuts, deregulation and American factories humming with domestic production that pump out affordable, home-grown cars. Basically, another year of people buying anything with four wheels and a made-in-America stamping.

But that's not what happened. Instead, the EV market is facing an anticipated collapse with Q4 being just the start. The loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit seemingly yanked thousands of theoretical sales off the board.

The loss of new car sales isn't just limited to electric cars, either. Gas cars are also showing signs of a downturn with fewer sales and longer times-to-turn. Some lenders are even easing up on their borrowing requirements, while auto loan defaults are encroaching on levels similar to the 2008 recession.

More from the WSJ:

Signs of strain are beginning to show up in the data. Cars are sitting longer on dealer lots. Dealers are piling on extra discounts to make sales. Lower-income borrowers are defaulting on car loans. Americans as a whole are spending less overall on vehicle purchases than they did a year ago.

“Other components of the economy are tugging on the consumer,” said Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst for the car-shopping website Edmunds.com. [...] The cost of car parts and repairs has climbed as well, so hanging on to old vehicles comes with its own costs. “You can’t really find relief,” Drury said.

This leaves American car buyers at an interesting crossroads. Keep an old car on the road while repair costs are soaring, or spend $50,000 on a new crossover?

Dealers know the jig is up. Discounts are rising, negotiations are back and earning your business is once again climbing the priority ladder. Meanwhile, consumers are simply refusing the notion of a $700-per-month car payment. Car buyer fever is breaking.

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( “Reagan Tax Cuts”) Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.","Since the creation of the federal income tax in 1913, Congress has regularly adjusted the tax code as the economy and national priorities have changed.

In this paper, the Bipartisan Policy Center presents a comprehensive timeline of major U.S. tax reform efforts from the end of World War II to the present, most recently passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). Our analysis includes the political dynamics, major policy details, and the budgetary effects of signature tax legislation throughout modern history. For this analysis, we define legislation as enacted on a bipartisan basis if its passage received at least one vote from a member of the opposite party. Our review also examines the trajectory and composition of federal revenue since the 1940s.

A few broad themes emerge from this review:

Increasing Partisanship: Tax laws were broadly bipartisan in the postwar era through the 1990s. At the turn of the century, each party started using the reconciliation process more frequently to advance partisan legislation—often including major tax revisions. Partly as a result, tax laws have become much more partisan in the 21st century than they were in the 20th.

Rising Spending and Deficits: Although this paper focuses on revenue changes, an unmistakable trend in the past quarter century has seen government spending rising as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) while revenue declined slightly. As a result, debt has been rising as a share of GDP—in good economic times and bad, in war and in peace. Major tax cuts this century have contributed to declining revenue, but significant increases in spending complete the picture.

Inflation Adjustments, then Extenders: From the 1940s through the 1970s, Congress frequently revisited the tax code because dollar amounts and thresholds were not automatically adjusted for inflation. This became a particular issue in the 1970s, as the country confronted high and persistent inflation. In 1981, Congress began automatically indexing various portions of the tax code for inflation, including income tax brackets. Since that change, lawmakers have needed to update the tax code for inflation less often. The inflation adjustments process was replaced through the 2010s with “tax extenders,” in which Congress would make temporary tax policies with an expiration date and extend them for only one or a few years at a time.

The Postwar Era: 1945-1969

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the U.S. national debt rose to the highest levels in history. Federal expenditures then fell precipitously due to the war’s end, but tax rates stayed high well into the early 1960s. It wasn’t until the end of the 1960s that Congress significantly lowered tax rates.

Revenue Act of 1945

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The federal government’s need for revenue declined quickly as WWII ended. Although the national debt was high, Congress sought to provide economic relief from higher wartime tax rates.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law had three main components. It 1) lowered all individual tax rates, with the top rate falling from 94% to 86.45%; 2) repealed the excess profits tax on companies; and 3) reduced the top corporate tax rate to 38%.

Budgetary Projection: The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (JCIRT, predecessor to the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT) projected that the Revenue Act of 1945would decrease revenue by $5.9 billion over the fiscal year (which ran from July-June before 1974).

Revenue Act of 1948

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Policymakers expressed a growing concern over the tax treatment of married couples in two different types of states—“community property” states and “common law” states.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law eased marriage penalties in the tax code by, for example, making it easier for two spouses in a couple to split income and allowing marital deductions for estate and gift taxes. It also increased personal exemptions and established the additional exemption for the elderly and the blind (later the additional standard deduction).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1948 would decrease revenue by $5 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Korean War began in June 1950. The United States needed to again raise military expenditures, which slowed down efforts to provide tax relief.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law raised individual tax rates across the board, with the lowest rate increasing from 16.6% to 20%, and the top rate increasing from 82.1% to 91%. Congress raised the top corporate tax rate from 38% to 45%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1950would increase revenue by $4.5 billion over the full year.

Excess Profits Tax of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: With government spending increasing in the face of the prolonged Korean War, Congress reinstated the excess profits tax.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law placed a 30% surcharge on excess business profits, meaning that some corporations faced a marginal rate of 77% (inclusive of surtaxes and excess profits taxes).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Excess Profits Tax of 1950would increase revenue by $3.3 billion over the full year.

Revenue Act of 1951

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As the federal government faced additional financing needs for national defense, the Truman administration asked Congress for nearly $11 billion in tax increases that would close a budget deficit of around $10 billion. Congress managed to approve $5 billion in this 1951 tax law, which one economist noted ended a long period of relative harmony between Congress and the president on tax reform.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income tax rates, corporate income tax rates (basic rate from 47% to 52%); capital gains tax rates (top rate from 25% to 26%); cigarette taxes (from $0.07 per pack to $0.08); gas taxes (from $0.015 per gallon to $0.02); and a variety of other excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1951 would increase revenue by $5.4 billion over the full year.

Internal Revenue Code of 1954

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress engaged in the first wholesale revision of the U.S. tax code since 1876, “renumbering every section” and “making over 3,000 technical changes in the law.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reorganized the tax code into seven subtitles, including for income taxes, estate and gift taxes, employment taxes, and two subtitles for excise taxes. The law also reduced some tax rates. The lowest individual income tax rate fell from 22.2% to 20%. The highest rate fell from 92% to 91%. The top corporate tax rate was extended at 52% through March 1955 and was set to fall to 47% thereafter, although the 52% was subsequently extended through 1963.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 would decrease revenue by $0.2 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1964 (“Kennedy Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Continuing to seek relief from the high tax rates of the 1940s and 1950s, Congress prioritized lowering taxes. The law inspired plenty of debate in Congress around “the wisdom of reducing taxes in a period of prosperity when the government was already running a sizeable deficit.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 91% to 70%, and the bottom rate from 20% to 14%. The law also reduced the top corporate tax rate from 52% to 48%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1964 would decrease revenue by $11.5 billion over the full year.

Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty,” Congress created Medicare and Medicaid. These mandatory entitlement programs altered the tax code and contributed to the elevated status of payroll taxes as the second-largest revenue generator after income taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law implemented a new federal payroll tax to finance the cost of Medicare, at a 0.70% rate (0.35% each for employees and employers) in 1966. Congress set the rate to increase in subsequent years, and then accelerated those rate increases in future years.

Budgetary Projection: Estimates for what the 1965 law’s payroll tax increases would have raised are difficult to come by, but Medicare costs quickly outstripped early projections. In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee projected that annual Medicare expenditures would be $238 million; instead, Medicare cost $4.6 billion in 1967, its first full year.

Tax Reform Act of 1969

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Richard Nixon had asked Congress for a new set of tax reductions earlier that year, but the Tax Reform Act of 1969 was the product of years of discussions between Congress and the Treasury Department (across several administrations) to reform the nation’s tax code.

Notable Tax Provisions: This law introduced new distinctions between single and married filers and differential rates. It also introduced a low-income allowance, functionally raising the minimum standard deduction for taxpayers to $1,000 (at this time, the standard deduction was a percentage of income rather than a fixed dollar amount). The law also set the maximum standard deduction to increase to $2,000 by 1973, and increased the charitable deduction amount to 50% of a person’s contributable base in that year. On the revenue-raising side, the 1969 law increased capital gains taxes, repealed the investment tax credit, and created a minimum tax for individuals.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1969would increase revenue by $6.2 billion over a two-year period.

The Stagflation Era: 1970-1983

The 1970s saw the end of the Vietnam War and the start of stagflation in which high inflation and weak growth gripped the U.S. economy. Tax policy sought to spur the economy and minimize the effects of persistent inflation. America experienced several recessions from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, in part due to the Fed’s aggressive efforts to curb inflation.

Revenue Act of 1971

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Beginning in the early 1970s, the U.S. economy began to slow. Concerned by the growing economic pressures on Americans, Congress sought ways to lower tax burdens.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the personal exemption from $650 to $675 in 1971 (and to $750 in subsequent years), and the minimum standard deduction from $1,000 to $1,300. The law also provided a 7% tax credit for businesses investing in expansions to their facilities and equipment, and repealed a 7% excise tax on passenger vehicles.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1971 would decrease revenue by $11.3 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reduction Act of 1975

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Amid high inflation and a sagging economy, President Gerald Ford and members of Congress expressed interest in stimulating the economy and adjusting several parts of the tax code for inflation. Lawmakers also wanted to address a sense of unfairness in the code due to the regressive nature of tax deductions, which provided a larger benefit to high-income taxpayers than to lower-income ones, by shifting policy from providing deductions to providing credits.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law provided refunds to those filers who had a tax liability in 1974, up to $200 for taxpayers making under $30,000. It also increased the low-income allowance, provided a $30 tax credit per person (including dependents), and created the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The law increased the investment tax credit from 7% to 10% for two years (1975-1976), with a scheduled decline back to 7% from 1977 onwards. It also reduced the rate of the corporate surtax and amount of income subject to the tax for 1975 only, and the lowest corporate tax rate from 22% to 20%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 would decrease revenue by $9.4 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reform Act of 1976

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The 1973 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo placed economic strain on American households that lingered for years after the resumption of normal trade relations. Congress also had a general interest in simplifying an increasingly complicated tax code, improving tax administration, and improving equity in the tax system without negatively impacting economic growth.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased alternative minimum taxes for individuals and corporations, with the individual minimum tax rate rising from 10% to 15%. The law also extended the holding period for long-term capital gains and phased in an increase for maximum capital loss deductions from $1,000 to $3,000. It expanded tax advantages for individual retirement accounts (IRAs); converted the child care deduction into a child care credit; increased the minimum standard deduction from $1,300 to $1,700 ($2,100 for joint returns) and the maximum deduction from $2,000 to $2,400 ($2,800 for joint returns); extended the EITC that was enacted in the year prior; provided estate tax relief; and extended the investment credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1976 would decrease revenue by $50 billion over five years (FY1977-1981).

Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Jimmy Carter had campaigned in 1976 on simplifying the tax code and stimulating a sagging economy. Congress and the president negotiated in the early months of 1977 on a tax law to fulfill those promises.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law changed the standard deduction from 16% of income to a flat $2,200 for single filers ($3,200 for joint), referred to as the “zero bracket amount.” It revised and simplified tax tables for filers. The law also extended the EITC for families with children through 1978. Finally, it extended through 1978 the corporate tax rate cuts for lower-income brackets that began in 1975 and created a new jobs credit for employers.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977 would decrease revenue by $34 billion over three years (FY1977-1979).

Revenue Act of 1978

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As stagflation continued to plague the U.S. economy, Congress sought to further cut taxes to minimize the economic burden on households and businesses and boost the economy.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the amount of income exempt from taxes in the “zero bracket,” which temporarily replaced the standard deduction, and increased personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000. The zero bracket rose for both single and married filers ($2,220 to $2,300 and $3,200 to $3,400, respectively). The law also lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 48% to 46%, reformed the alternative minimum tax, expanded and made permanent the EITC, and made permanent a 10% investment tax credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Revenue Act of 1978 would decrease revenue by $117 billion over five years (FY1979-1983).

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( “Reagan Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The United States was in a recession in 1981, triggered in part by Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes to combat high inflation. Congress lowered tax burdens to stimulate economic activity, a top priority of the newly elected President Ronald Reagan.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law cut tax rates across the board, including the top individual rate from 70% to 50%. The law also indexed tax brackets and the personal exemption to inflation for the first time and created a deduction for married couples filing jointly. Allowable IRA contributions were increased from a maximum of $1,500 to $2,000. Congress also introduced the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), which changed the depreciation schedule for business investments. And the law reduced estate tax rates and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act would decrease revenue by $482 billion over five years (FY1981-1985).

Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The 1981 tax cuts contributed to a spike in deficits and spurred concern about the long-term sustainability of the law. Seeking to reverse or moderate the largest tax cuts, the 1982 law rolled back a number of reforms from 1981.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law pulled back on some of the 1981 accelerations in business deductions and put new limits on claiming the investment tax credit. The law also increased tax withholding on certain dividends and interest; required employers of tipped workers to report receipts and tips to the IRS; included new tax enforcement measures; and increased airport, cigarette, and telephone excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 would increase revenue by $215 billion over five years (FY1983-1987).

Social Security Amendments of 1983

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Warnings that Social Security insolvency was imminent triggered congressional bipartisan action to extend the program’s solvency. The recessions of the early 1980s likely contributed to the accelerated depletion of the trust fund. This was due to rapidly rising unemployment, which peaked at 10.8% by the end of 1982.

Notable Tax Provisions: Federal government and nonprofit workers hired after 1984 became eligible for Social Security. The law thus broadened the payroll tax base to these workers. More broadly, the law increased payroll tax rates from 5.4% on Social Security taxes and 1.3% on Medicare taxes (each paid by employee and employer) to 6.2% and 1.45%, respectively, by 1990. The law also taxed Social Security benefits for high-income beneficiaries for the first time. Congress has changed payroll tax rates and rules several times since World War II. In this overview of major tax laws, BPC generally only covers the 1965 law that created Medicare and Medicaid and the 1983 law that extended Social Security solvency.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Social Security Amendments of 1983 would increase revenue by $57 billion over a five-year period.

The Reform Era: 1984-2000

Over the next 15 years, Congress focused on simplifying the tax code, broadening the tax base, and eventually balancing the budget. Three of the four major tax bills were bipartisan, and some were wrapped into broader budget negotiations.

Tax Reform Act of 1986

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) was the second of President Reagan’s major tax reform efforts. The 1986 law sought to revamp the entire tax code, driven primarily by a desire for simplification. Today’s tax code still reflects many of the reforms from 1986, and TRA still stands out as one of U.S. history’s most bipartisan, comprehensive federal tax reform laws.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 50% to 28%, and it collapsed more than a dozen tax brackets into just two—15% and 28%. The law also eliminated the preferential tax treatment of capital gains, taxing gains at a top 28% rate as well. The law phased out the ability to deduct several kinds of personal interest expenses, other than mortgage interest. The law also cut the top corporate tax rate from 46% to 34%, but overall it increased corporate tax liabilities by repealing the investment tax credit, changing corporate deduction rules, and expanding the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1986 Tax Reform Act would decrease revenue by $300 million over five years (FY1987-1991).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George H.W. Bush and Democrats in Congress—who controlled the House and the Senate—negotiated for months over a bipartisan budget agreement that would reduce deficits. The final package cut mandatory spending, increased taxes, and placed caps on discretionary spending.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income taxes by raising rates (including the top rate from 28% to 31%), phasing out personal exemptions, and limiting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The law also increased and/or extended several excise taxes, including on gas, alcohol, aviation, telecommunications, and tobacco. It also increased the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and JCT projected that OBRA 1990 would increase revenue by $158 billion over five years (FY1991-1995).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: A newly elected President Bill Clinton and Democrats in Congress—who controlled both the House and the Senate, although they did not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate—negotiated for months on a budget deal to reduce deficits in the years ahead. CBO ultimately projected that the deal would reduce deficits by $433 billion over five years, with a roughly even mix of tax increases and spending cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law added a 36% individual income tax bracket and a surtax on income above $250,000, bringing the top rate from 31% to 39.6%. The 1993 OBRA also increased gas taxes, the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes, and the top corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that OBRA 1993 would increase revenue by $241 billion over five years (FY1994-1998).

Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The Taxpayer Relief Act was one of two bills signed into law by President Clinton that together enacted a bipartisan budget agreement between the Democratic president and the Republican-controlled Congress. After months of negotiations, policymakers agreed on a package that reduced spending but also cut taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created the Child Tax Credit (CTC), allowing families to receive a credit of up to $500 per child. It also created tax credits for higher-education expenses, a deduction for student loan interest (up to $2,500 per year from 2001 onwards), and Roth IRA accounts that allowed people to contribute to tax-advantaged retirement accounts with after-tax dollars. The law reduced capital gains taxes (the maximum rate decreased from 28% to 20%) and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would decrease revenue by $68 billion over five years (FY1997-2001).

The Tax Cut Era: 2001-Present

At the turn of the century, the combination of a strong economy and bipartisan action to reduce deficits created the first budget surpluses in decades. Those surpluses would not last. Both parties have passed major tax cuts in the 21st century, albeit Republicans have done so more often than Democrats. These tax cuts have contributed to a decline in revenue as a share of GDP over the 21st century.

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“2001 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George W. Bush had campaigned in 2000 on tax reform, and Republican policymakers advocated using the federal government’s newfound surpluses to finance tax cuts. Although Congress used reconciliation to pass the 2001 tax law to avoid the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster, several Democrats in both chambers of Congress joined nearly all Republicans in supporting the bill.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created a 10% individual income tax bracket (the previous lowest bracket was 15%); reduced individual income tax rates across the board; provided $300 stimulus payments; increased the CTC from $500 per child to $1,000 per child over several years; reduced marriage penalties in the tax code; phased down and scheduled a repeal of the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes; and increased contribution limits for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2001 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $1.2 trillion over 10 years (FY2001-2010).

Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“2003 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Bush and congressional Republicans pursued a second major round of tax cuts to spur economic growth amid a slow economic recovery from the 2001 recession.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends; accelerated individual income tax rate reductions; accelerated the increase in the CTC to $1,000 per child; and provided additional relief from the AMT.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2003 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $351 billion over 10 years (FY2003-2012).

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After the 2009 stimulus package in the wake of the Great Recession, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats made expanding health insurance coverage and reducing health care costs a top priority. Their efforts culminated in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Notable Tax Provisions: Although the bulk of the law was focused on health spending provisions, it included several changes to the nation’s tax code. The ACA created premium tax credits to subsidize the purchase of health insurance on new state-based exchanges. To help pay for the premium tax credits and Medicaid expansions in the law, the ACA created several new taxes and fees, including the net investment income tax (NIIT); the Additional Medicare Tax; the Cadillac tax; individual and employer penalties for failure to obtain or provide health insurance; the medical device tax; and fees on brand drugs and insurers. Congress later repealed the Cadillac tax, medical device tax, and insurers fee.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the ACA would increase revenue by $525 billion over 10 years (FY2010-2019).

Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress and President Obama faced a December 31, 2010, expiration of trillions of dollars in 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. After the midterm elections in which Republicans regained the House, policymakers settled on a temporary extension of the expiring Bush tax cuts through the end of 2012.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law extended the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts through 2012, reinstated the estate tax after a one-year repeal, and extended more-generous business expensing allowances through 2012. It also introduced a temporary 2-percentage-point payroll tax cut for 2011 that was a key ask of the Obama administration as it sought to stimulate the economic recovery from the Great Recession.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2010 tax law would decrease revenue by $858 billion over 10 years (FY2011-2020).

American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: After the bipartisan 2010 tax law extended the expiring Bush tax cuts for two years, Congress faced another tax cliff on December 31, 2012. Weeks of negotiations between the Republican-led House, Democratic-led Senate, and President Obama produced a bipartisan deal that made permanent the majority of the expiring 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent, including lower individual income tax rates, lower capital gains tax rates, AMT relief, a larger CTC (then $1,000 per child), and an expanded EITC. The law raised the top individual income tax rate from 35% to 39.6% and the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. It also extended dozens of individual, business, and energy tax provisions through 2013.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ATRA would decrease revenue by $3.9 trillion over 10 years (FY2013-2022).

2015 Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Dozens of tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, with more expirations scheduled for the end of 2016 and 2017. Both parties in Congress and President Obama sought to address several of these expiring policies once and for all through permanent extensions, rather than treating them as “extenders” to be revisited every few years.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended a more generous CTC, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for higher-education expenses, the state and local sales tax deduction, the R&D credit, Section 179 expensing for small businesses, and exceptions to taxes on foreign income, among dozens of other provisions. Congress extended many additional provisions for a shorter period, through 2016 or 2019.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the PATH Act would decrease revenue by $622 billion over 10 years (FY2016-2025).

2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: During the 2016 campaign, several Republican presidential candidates and policymakers expressed an interest in comprehensive tax reform. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans turned their attention in summer 2017 to the law that became TCJA.

Notable Tax Provisions: TCJA significantly overhauled both the individual and business sides of the tax code. The law lowered individual income tax rates across the board; suspended personal exemptions; doubled the standard deduction; limited itemized deductions like the state and local tax (SALT) deduction; doubled the CTC; and provided relief from the AMT and estate tax. TCJA also lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (and eliminated the graduated corporate income tax schedule, leaving just one 21% rate); created a 20% deduction for pass-through business income; enacted a temporary expensing allowance for business machinery and equipment; and overhauled the tax treatment of U.S. multinational companies’ income earned abroad.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that TCJA would decrease revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2018-2027).

2020 COVID Relief Legislation

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented economic and social disruptions. Congress and President Trump enacted four laws on a bipartisan basis in 2020 to address those disruptions and provide tax relief, the largest of which was the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Notable Tax Provisions: The CARES Act included $1,200 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered as refundable, advanceable tax credits through the IRS. The CARES Act also created the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) for businesses that kept employees on payroll during the pandemic and provided businesses with increased flexibility to carry back tax losses. The CARES Act was followed by a December 2020 COVID relief law that provided an additional $600 stimulus check to tens of millions of Americans.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the 2020 COVID relief laws would decrease revenue by $809 billion over 10 years.

American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats were motivated in early 2021 to pass additional tax relief and stimulus to address the ongoing economic and public health effects of the COVID pandemic.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law included $1,400 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered once again through the IRS. The law also expanded the CTC from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child (and $3,600 for children under six) for 2021 only, expanded the EITC for childless workers for 2021 only, and expanded ACA subsidies for 2021 and 2022.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ARPA would decrease revenue by $590 billion over 10 years (FY2021-2030).

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After ARPA’s passage, President Biden and congressional Democrats turned their attention to major domestic tax-and-spending legislation. Failure in the Senate to pass the Build Back Better (BBB) agenda led to deliberations over what became the Inflation Reduction Act in summer 2022.

Notable Tax Provisions: The legislation included hundreds of billions of dollars in new or expanded tax incentives for clean energy, from electric vehicles to wind and solar projects to advanced manufacturing projects. The law also extended expiring ACA tax subsidies through 2025, restored a corporate AMT (previously repealed by TCJA), created a stock buyback tax, and appropriated $80 billion to the IRS for enhanced enforcement and modernization efforts. (The clean energy incentives and IRS funding have since been rolled back.)

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Inflation Reduction Act would increase revenue by $91 billion over 10 years (FY2022-2031).

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: The top priority of President Trump and congressional Republicans in 2025 was extending the expiring individual tax cuts from the 2017 TCJA. President Trump also sought to enact several new tax cuts he had promised on the campaign trail, such as “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended the vast majority of expiring TCJA tax cuts, including lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and CTC, and relief from the AMT and estate tax. It included several temporary tax cuts aimed at President Trump’s campaign promises, including a tips income deduction, an overtime pay deduction, a manufacturing expensing allowance, and a larger senior deduction—all scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. The law cut business taxes significantly, extending TCJA’s pass-through deduction, making bonus depreciation for machinery and equipment permanent, and restoring full expensing for business R&D. OBBB also rolled back most of the clean energy tax incentives enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, mostly by ending them early.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that OBBB would decrease revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2025-2034).

Overall Trends: 1945-Present

Research Notes

For determining whether a law was partisan or bipartisan, we rely on roll call vote data from GovTrack and from Congress.gov. For determining the budgetary effects of major tax laws, we use one methodology for laws from 1945-1975 and a different methodology for laws from 1976-2025. For the earlier years, we rely on a 2006 Treasury Department paper that succinctly summarizes the revenue effects of major tax laws in current dollars. JCT (formerly called JCIRT) used a variety of budget windows during that time period; first one year, then two, then three, and so on. For the later years, we generally rely on scores available from JCT’s website (and, in some cases, supplemented by CBO reports). We use five-year effects from 1981-2000, and 10-year effects from 2001-present",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tax-Reform-Papers.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:43.261273

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.
The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.
These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.
As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed amendments to simplify its Toxic Substances Control Act Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule, first released in 2023. Compliance deadlines have been postponed several times.

The proposed rule, announced in November, would narrow the rule’s scope and reduce compliance burdens by exempting certain categories not likely to produce high value information for the EPA, while maintaining many of the core reporting requirements for PFAS manufactured or imported between 2011 and 2022.

Under the proposed rule, the EPA would offer two key exemptions (among others) and adjust the submission period to reflect the narrowed obligations.

The reporting window would now open 60 days after the final rule’s effective date and remain open for three months, meaning regulated entities should anticipate a condensed reporting timeline in 2026.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.

It required detailed, compound-by-compound submissions covering each year in that period, including data on chemical identity, categories of use, production volumes, byproducts, environmental and health effects, worker exposure and disposal practices.

The rule applied broadly, even to entities that had never before filed under TSCA, and did not include exemptions for de minimis, imported-articles, or other customary TSCA chemical data, making compliance particularly challenging for manufacturers and importers with complex or global supply chains.

The EPA’s intent was to build a comprehensive database of PFAS presence and use across U.S. commerce to inform future regulatory and risk-management actions.

Key Proposed Exemptions

1. De Minimis Exemption (0.1%)

The EPA proposes to exempt from reporting all PFAS present at concentrations below 0.1% in mixtures or articles.

The EPA cited both legal precedent and practical considerations, noting that such trace-level information is generally unknown or not reasonably ascertainable for manufacturers and importers based on historical recordkeeping and labeling standards.

The 0.1% threshold aligns with long-standing Safety Data Sheet notification levels and recognizes that many PFAS used at low levels were never disclosed by suppliers during the 2011–2022 lookback period.

The exemption is intended to eliminate disproportionate compliance efforts to locate information of minimal regulatory or environmental value, while still capturing reportable PFAS above that concentration.

This will allow most manufacturers and importers to reasonably rely on their supplier SDSs as the justification for reporting (or not reporting) under the rule.

2. Imported Articles Exemption

The EPA also proposes to exclude PFAS imported as part of a finished article from the rule’s scope.

EPA found that importers of finished goods are least likely to have direct knowledge of PFAS content in those products and that Congress, in drafting TSCA Section 8(a)(7), intended reporting to apply to manufacturers of PFAS themselves, not to importers of products merely containing PFAS.

The EPA reasoned that this exemption will still preserve meaningful data through reporting by the original PFAS manufacturers, who remain responsible for identifying downstream uses of their PFAS in articles.

The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.

Other Clarifications

Although affecting a much smaller subset of industry, additional proposed exemptions include PFAS manufactured as byproducts or impurities, or used as non-isolated intermediates within a closed system and PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities solely for research and development purposes.

These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.

Practical Implications

While the proposed changes provide significant relief, especially for importers of finished goods/articles and small manufacturers, companies should not interpret the revisions as removing all PFAS-related reporting obligations under TSCA.

The rule remains broad in coverage for entities that directly manufacture or import PFAS compounds or mixtures containing them above the de minimis threshold and it will be important to continue internal compliance efforts.

Importantly, the reporting window will likely be shorter and the expected start date in 2026 means affected companies should begin re-scoping (hopefully in progress) compliance efforts in 2025 to align with the revised submission requirements.

Next Steps

The EPA’s proposed revisions are open for public comment until Dec. 29, 2025.

Sixty days after the rule is finalized, the submission period of regulatorily required reporting information (on a yet to be published online form) will open and run for three months.

As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.

Takeaways

The proposal is a shift to a narrower and more manageable PFAS reporting framework, emphasizing data from entities most likely to have meaningful information.

The de minimis and imported-articles exemptions are expected to simplify compliance while preserving the EPA’s ability to collect the most critical PFAS manufacturing data.

Manufacturers and importers should continue efforts to ensure compliance, as the EPA has recognized industry has been aware of this rule since 2023 and expects companies will need less time to prepare reports based on work to date.

The plant, located in Chile’s Ñuble region, will convert biogas into liquid biomethane, which Lipigas will distribute to transport companies and industries across the country as part of Chile’s move toward cleaner energy, reports Bioenergy Insight.

The new plant uses a modular, container-based “plug and play” system made up of six interconnected units. Three of the units handle biogas treatment processes — including cleaning and liquefaction — while the remaining three manage essential services such as water and dry air supply. This design enabled faster installation and commissioning.

The Bio-LNG is produced from biogas generated at an anaerobic co-digestion facility that processes organic waste from the pork industry. In its first phase, the plant will treat 7,500 m³ of biogas per day, with plans to expand capacity to 16,500 m³ per day as operations grow.

The resulting biomethane will be used as a renewable fuel at Lipigas service stations, supplying truck fleets travelling across Chile and helping reduce emissions from the road transport sector.

HAM Group said the project strengthens its commitment to lowering emissions and promoting sustainability in both transport and industry. The Ñuble site joins the company’s existing Bio-LNG plants in Girona, Spain, and Faenza, Italy, and marks a significant expansion into Latin America.

The site will form part of a Southeast Asian power grid initiative and further connect to Singapore to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

While the final scope hasn’t been announced, the initial sizing of the scheme is for a 2,000 square kilometre hybrid solar and battery energy storage system zone, with some 10,000 acres set for the initial phase of the project. This initial phase was said to be “expected” to include up to 4 GWp of solar capacity and 5.12 GWh of energy storage capacity.

The ‘Cooperation Document’ exchanged by key parties, including the Johor state, also brought together many initiatives. One is a pan-Southeast Asian grid initiative, dubbed the ASEAN Power Grid or APG, that aims to connect Malaysia’s Johor region with Singapore as part of a Johor–Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) masterplan and facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

It is also part of the Johor Renewable Energy Policy 2030, which details in an outline joint efforts across project development, technical support, and further potential financing for the project, and ties into the stated ambitions of the Johor Green Development Policy 2030.

There are some surprises in the details of the players involved.

Other investors, alongside the World Bank’s private sector arm known as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), included the strategic investment arm of the Johor State Permodalan Darul Ta’zim (PDT), and Ditrolic Energy, an independent clean energy company in Southeast Asia, headquartered in Malaysia. No funding splits or details were announced at a ceremony attended by officials and dignitaries, including the Queen of Malaysia, Raja Zarith Sofiah.

While likely to offer attractive renewable energy for the city-state of Singapore, the announcement also detailed that Johor is aiming to attract both manufacturing and hyperscale data center operators. Some 125,000 jobs were said to be created through the lifecycle of the project.

One of the surprise players is Ditrolic Energy, which according to ESS News information, has only 300 MW of active projects built, making this project dwarf its other engagements.

What they said:

Dato’ Ramlee bin A Rahman, President and Group Chief Executive of PDT: “As the state agency entrusted to formulate the Johor Green Development Policy 2030, PDT is proud to witness our strategic framework transition into tangible reality today. “The Southern Johor Renewable Energy Corridor (SJREC) was conceived as the cornerstone of this policy, specifically Strategy 1, to unlock the immense solar potential of the Kota Tinggi and Mersing districts.

“By partnering with global leaders like IFC and Ditrolic Energy, we are operationalizing the SJREC not only to power the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), but to actively facilitate cross-border energy trading. This project confirms Johor’s readiness to serve as a primary renewable energy hub for the ASEAN Power Grid, realizing the vision we set forth for a sustainable, high-growth future. The project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the region by creating an estimated 125,000 jobs through the construction, operations, and maintenance of renewable-energy infrastructure, enabling industrial expansion, and attracting high-quality, foreign-direct investment.”

Judith Green, World Bank Group Country Manager for Malaysia: “We are delighted to partner with Permodalan Darul Ta’zim and Ditrolic Energy on this innovative project. Not only will this project support the broader sustainable development ambitions of Johor, it will also create jobs, potentially attract foreign direct investment, while facilitating cross-border clean energy trade between two key ASEAN economies, bolstering the broader ASEAN Power Grid initiative.”

Tham Chee Aun, Chief Executive Officer of Ditrolic Energy: “We are proud to partner with the Johor State Government and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector, IFC, in this historic initiative. As a Johor-born company that has expanded across Asia and become one of Malaysia’s largest developers, Ditrolic is deeply committed to contributing back to our home state. Our 4GWp solar-plus-storage catalytic development within the SJREC will anchor Johor’s clean energy export potential and provide a foundation for industries seeking renewable, low-cost power in the region.”

Greening Singapore’s grid

Singapore’s relative lack of land to develop large-scale energy projects has led to somewhat of a boom in ideas, concepts, and projects to supply the region.

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-02 15:04:26+00:00,Canary Media,FirstEnergy seeks looser reliability rules as outages grow more common - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/firstenergy-ohio-lower-reliability-rules-outages,"Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.
Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.
FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall.
Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.","Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.

Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.

Comments regarding the request are due to the utilities commission on Dec. 8, less than three weeks after regulators approved higher electricity rates for hundreds of thousands of northeast Ohio utility customers. An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.

Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.

“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”

The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.

The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.

Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.

Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.

Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.

FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.

There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.

FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance. From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”

“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.

In summer, systems are burdened by constant air conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”

Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.

In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.

FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.

Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.

“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.

Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.

“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.

It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.

“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”

But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/51155404126_79c5193be4_c.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0cf0feeab3f5538062084b4e3769bb6d,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:54.040564

In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.","In Stockholm, city planners are reimagining how buildings can absorb carbon instead of releasing it into the air. In Melbourne, community advocates are working alongside city officials to ensure clean energy reaches neighborhoods that have historically been left behind. In Amsterdam, discarded solar panels are finding new life, preventing waste while expanding renewable energy access to those who need it most.

These aren’t isolated success stories — they’re part of a growing movement of cities around the world refusing to accept incremental change at a time when our communities need transformational action to thrive.

More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, and these urban centers account for approximately 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, cities hold tremendous power to slow climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy and eliminating those greenhouse gas emissions. While many cities have adopted climate action plans, most haven’t set goals big enough to fully remove all carbon pollution from city systems like transportation and buildings.

But a trailblazing group of cities is charting a different course. The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA) brings together leading cities worldwide committed to achieving carbon neutrality within 10 to 20 years, among the most ambitious targets undertaken by any city globally.

Created in 2015 with support from Kresge, CNCA enables these pioneering cities to advance their transformational efforts, collaborate to overcome barriers, foster innovative approaches and share lessons with others pursuing similar goals.

“The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance connects U.S. cities with international knowledge and resource hubs, and creates opportunities to learn from and workshop with peers and partners across regions,” said Kresge Environment Senior Program Officer Jessica Boehland.

Moving beyond technology to systems change

What sets this work apart is CNCA’s fundamental approach. Rather than focusing solely on technology and emissions reduction, CNCA champions a systems-based framework that addresses the root causes of climate change while putting people and nature at the center of climate solutions.

The alliance’s shared purpose is clear: mobilize transformative climate action to achieve prosperity, equity, resilience and better quality of life for all on a thriving planet.

“We believe that by supporting cities in developing and implementing game-changing climate policies, we will accelerate transformative climate action and generate replicable models for cities worldwide,” says Simone Mangili, executive director of CNCA. “This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about reimagining how cities function, who benefits from climate action and stewarding natural systems for generations to come.”

Putting bold ideas into action

Through its Game Changer Fund, CNCA has already invested more than $5 million in 76 city-led projects since 2015, leveraging an additional $46 million in continued support. These aren’t conventional projects that fit neatly into traditional public funding streams. They’re bold experiments tackling high-impact challenges at the intersection of climate change and equity.

Recent investments show this approach in action. Amsterdam’s project creates a system to reuse old solar panels instead of throwing them away. Melbourne is developing a community-driven plan to fight energy poverty grounded in data.

In the U.S., New York City and Washington DC joined with Copenhagen to explore equitable models for congestion pricing, which reduces traffic in certain areas of the city, improving air quality while providing revenue to support public transit and bicycling and walking paths. These projects don’t just reduce pollution — they make communities stronger and help local people create sustainable solutions.

Justice at the center

CNCA is also helping cities move toward genuine power-sharing in climate policy development. Through its Climate Justice Grant Program, community organizations now lead proposals in partnership with cities, shifting who shapes climate solutions.

The alliance facilitates learning cohorts where cities in the U.S. and around the world share strategies for building relationships with communities and designing context-specific policies. The goal is to create climate policies and programs that maximize benefits and mitigate burdens for communities that have historically borne the greatest impacts of environmental injustice.

“This represents a fundamental reimagining of how climate action happens — not to communities, but with them,” said CNCA’s Director of Climate Justice Tracy Morgenstern.

Tackling the toughest challenges

CNCA cities are also pioneering work in policy areas that have traditionally received less attention, but offer huge opportunities. In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.

CNCA now supports 15 European cities in identifying and implementing local policies to reduce carbon pollution embedded in buildings while ensuring these policies address housing, jobs and social inclusion.

The alliance also recently hosted a climate justice workshop where teams from five North American cities – Boston, Portland, Seattle, Toronto and Boulder, Colorado – and partners from community-based organizations joined their European counterparts to explore strategies and tools for improving buildings and infrastructure to benefit people’s lives and the economy. A new resource titled Embodying Justice in the Built Environment: Just and Equitable Land Use Transitions reflects some of the challenges and opportunities cities are facing on their journeys.

In addition, CNCA also plans to host a climate justice workshop for five teams of city staff and community partners from cities in the Midwest to support participatory and whole-of-government approaches to climate action planning.

Similarly, the alliance is helping cities tackle consumption-based emissions, transition towards more circular economies that reduce resource extraction and develop initiatives that pull carbon from the air and improve quality of life while regenerating natural systems. These approaches recognize that the same green infrastructure that captures carbon can also cool cities, reduce flooding and improve air quality — delivering multiple benefits to communities.

A network built on peer learning

At its heart, CNCA succeeds because it creates space for staff from cities at the cutting edge of climate action to build relationships and learn from each other. Annual meetings, regional convenings and virtual learning cohorts allow practitioners to share what’s working, troubleshoot challenges and inspire each other to stay the course even when facing political headwinds.

“CNCA’s annual meetings and virtual convenings have become an essential moment for members to commune with one another and inspire each other, deepen collaboration among city agencies and departments and work across city administrations to mainstream climate action,” said long-time CNCA member of CNCA Doug Smith, deputy general manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability at the City of Vancouver.

This peer learning accelerates innovation in ways that top-down approaches cannot. When cities with similarly ambitious goals share experiences, they move faster together than any could alone.

Looking ahead

As national and regional climate commitments waver, cities are proving that transformative action remains possible – and is often pioneered at the local level.

The window for climate action is narrowing rapidly. But in cities from Rio de Janeiro to Yokohama, and from Seattle to Copenhagen, practitioners are demonstrating that we can build a future that is not only carbon neutral but also more beautiful, more just and more livable for all.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/PHOTO-2022-10-12-09-24-56.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:11.748224

Clarkson’s project focuses on scaling up a non-thermal plasma spinning-disc reactor that produces plasma-activated water (PAW). PAW contains nitrogen available for immediate uptake through roots and leaves, enabling farms to generate fertilizer on-site. New York farms currently rely on nitrogen fertilizer produced with fossil fuels and transported up to 2,000 miles, contributing to 47 percent of the state’s greenhouse-gas emissions.

“This technology has the potential to transform fertilizer production from a global supply chain into a local, low-emission process,” Selma Mededovic Thagard, the Richard and Helen March Professor in Clarkson’s Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. “It’s about creating practical solutions that support farmers while protecting the environment.”

The Clarkson team will develop a farm-scale reactor prototype, conduct a lifecycle analysis and test PAW effectiveness on New York crops such as tomatoes and lettuce. The work aims to demonstrate that on-farm fertilizer generation can significantly reduce carbon footprints, lower nitrogen runoff and decrease economic vulnerability for rural and smaller farms.

The project, led by Mededovic Thagard and Thomas Holsen, Jean S. Newell Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Co-Director of CAARES, is one of seven statewide initiatives selected for funding through the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute’s (NYSP2I) 2025–26 Research and Development Program. NYSP2I awarded $650,000 this year to support practical, near-term sustainability solutions that help New York businesses reduce their environmental impact while improving economic competitiveness.

Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.
If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.","The race to replace outgoing US Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, is set to break records. Political strategists anticipate it will be the most expensive US Senate race in history — between $600 million and $800 million will likely be spent, according to Politico. Currently, the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff race holds the title of most expensive Senate race, with $472 million spent by the candidates and outside groups.

Former North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will face the winner of the Republican primary. Michael Whatley, former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and Republican National Committee, secured President Donald Trump’s endorsement against Navy veteran Don Brown in the primary election. Many observers think Whatley is likely to cruise to the general election.

A lack of competitive Senate races nationwide, North Carolina’s history of expensive campaigns and the current political climate all contribute to the level of expected spending, according to political experts who spoke to Carolina Public Press.

Money talks, loudly and often. Voters should anticipate an avalanche of political ads as candidates attempt to convince their supporters to get out and vote, sell their vision to persuadable voters and weaken their opponents.

One of few Senate battlegrounds

The level of anticipated spending on North Carolina’s Senate election starts with a simple math problem: national donors have a lot of money to burn, and very few places to effectively spend it.

Fewer truly competitive Senate races are expected in 2026 would have been the case a few decades ago. Voters have geographically sorted themselves based on their political ideologies. State politics has also become more nationalized, and as a result, US Senate race outcomes match presidential election results most of the time.

Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.

Currently, Democrats effectively hold 47 seats in the US Senate, with the votes of two Independents. Republicans have 53 seats. To stand any chance of gaining a majority, Democrats have to keep Georgia and Michigan, pick up North Carolina and Maine, and upset at least one Republican-leaning contest in Ohio, Iowa or Texas, Bitzer said.

Republicans, on the other hand, need to stand their ground. With so few seats to fight over, much of the national donor money will flow to North Carolina.

A costly precedent has also been set in North Carolina Senate races, said Douglas Wilson, a political consultant who has worked for Hagan, former President Barack Obama, Jeff Jackson and other state Democrats.

In 2014, the race between Tillis, then Speaker of the NC House, and incumbent US Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC, for a spot in the North Carolina congressional delegation was the most expensive of the cycle, at $121 million in spending.

The next time around, in 2020, groups supporting Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham spent $296 million, enough for third-highest spending. While Tillis won that race easily against the former state senator, the race had been close before a sex scandal undermined Cunningham’s support in the final weeks before the election.

But the 2026 race for an open seat is on another level. Wilson blames that on the current political climate, economic headwinds and the threat of losing Medicaid expansion in North Carolina — “ground zero for health care.”

Campaign finance

Past and future Supreme Court rulings may also contribute to spending levels. In 2010, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in Citizens United that effectively opened the floodgates to unlimited outside spending on elections.

The court ruled that corporations had a First Amendment free speech right to spend money as they wished, as long as it didn’t flow directly to candidates. As a result, corporations and outside groups can launch political ads, get out the vote campaigns and more on behalf of favored candidates without financial barriers.

More recently, the Supreme Court heard a case that would loosen restrictions on certain political party spending. If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.

“But the parties already have quite a bit of flexibility,” he added. “It won’t be a revolutionary change.”

These rulings impact who is backing candidates. Campaign finance watchdog and former Democracy North Carolina Executive Director Bob Hall thinks it’s for the worse.

“The whole political process is warped by private money,” he said. “It’s a public election, but unfortunately, private money has an enormous impact, and it’s just the result of Supreme Court decisions that protect the rights of campaign spenders.”

There may be a point of diminishing return; a time when candidates have squeezed as much as they can with their money, and it becomes less effective.

“When you have so many ads, it just becomes noise to the average voter,” Heberlig said. “Practically speaking, what all these groups are doing is just offsetting the spending and advertising of the other side. You don’t want to leave the other side to dominate the air wars, because then people are only going to receive information from one perspective, and therefore are more likely to go with that.”

Early bird gets the worm

As soon as Tillis announced his departure from Congress, all sights were set on Cooper. Among politicos, it wasn’t so much a matter of whether the former governor would run for U.S. Senate, but when he would declare his intention to do so.

He did so early. On July 28, Cooper announced that he would run for office — nearly a year and a half before the 2026 general election, and four months before he could officially file to run in North Carolina.

Three days later, Whatley followed suit.

By the end of September, both had garnered millions of dollars to support their campaigns. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, Cooper’s campaign and associated committees raised about $14.5 million, while Whatley’s raised $5.8 million, by the end of September.

Starting early offers an advantage, said Eric Heberlig, UNC-Charlotte political science professor.

“Early spending gives you the ability to define yourself positively and your opponent negatively before people have any other sources of information,” he said. “If you can do that over long periods of time, that means people get more hardened in the information they have and are less persuadable as we get closer to the election.”

Cooper is already well-known in North Carolina, as a two-term governor, four-term attorney general and longtime state lawmaker. His reputation will make it harder for Republicans to change people’s perception, Heberlig said.

However, Whatley is relatively unknown to voters, despite holding very powerful positions in the Republican Party. Cooper may be able to use Whatley’s lower name recognition, as well as the tendency for the president’s party to perform poorly in midterm elections, to his advantage, Heberlig added.

Despite those handicaps, Whatley’s certainly still a “formidable” opponent, Wilson said. After all, Trump won North Carolina three times, if only by a small margin.

“Republicans have a pretty good infrastructure here from their wins in General Assembly races, judicial races and statewide races, so he’s going to be able to run a pretty aggressive campaign,” Wilson said.

The primary election could help Whatley “warm up” and test out messaging before the general election, he added.

At the end of the day, it probably won’t matter who raises or spends more money; it’s about how candidates target their spending that makes the difference, Wilson said.

If it were up to him, he’d focus on a broad media spectrum, from traditional television advertisements to local and national podcasts to social media platforms.

“I would also be physically present in a lot of these communities that are suffering economically, and present a plan that folks can understand and grab hold to,” he said. “If you can do that, you can win this race.”

Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.
Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.
“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said.","Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada — a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.

Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.

Because her flowers were dried, they’ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms — from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.

As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event’s done.

Carbon emissions from importing fresh flowers

The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.

Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.

“It’s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work … you’re fighting against nature at every turn,” Chan said.

He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.

Shopping local for sustainable flowers

Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she’ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.

“When I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,” Lukasiewicz said.

Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.

For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.

“Some people prefer locally-grown, sustainable products and are willing to pay that higher price point. But oftentimes most consumers go, ‘I’m going to buy the cheapest one that’s there,’” said Neil Anderson, professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota.

Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.

“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said. “Next year, when your anniversary comes up and you see those flowers in bloom or you see them at the farmers market, they’ll remind you of your wedding.”

Esther Lee, editorial director at The Knot wedding planning website, said that a significant number of couples say sustainability is important to their wedding plans. She said couples hope to personalize their event and give guests a sense of the region where the event is being held.

“There is just such a unique ambiance and element to the local flora of a place,” Lee said.

Artificial flowers are sometimes advertised as a sustainable alternative to fresh flowers, but it is important to evaluate data from manufacturers that back up this claim, said Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia Business School. Many artificial flowers are made of plastic and are imported, so “we shouldn’t take the claim that they are more sustainable at face value,” she said.

For Day, the bride that grew her own flowers, that story didn’t end when the night was over. Her guests took home the dried flowers, and a friend later borrowed several arrangements for her own ceremony.

“That’s what’s cool about them too, is you can reuse them time and time again,” Day said. “And then when they get beat up, unlike plastic flowers, you can just throw them in your compost and say, ‘go back to the earth, see you later.’”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/PDTN/87564614007-ap-25295540824705.jpg?crop=5995,3374,x0,y306&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 11:07:18.837343

EIA data reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign confirms the storage sector surge experienced throughout 2024, where the battery capacity increased 66% in the calendar year, has continued deep into 2025.

While percentage growth off a smaller base means that storage is easily outpacing any other traditional generations, it was also second only to utility-scale solar in raw megawatts added, with solar capacity growing by an impressive 31,620 MW over the past year. In comparison, natural gas capacity added 3,417 MW, and nuclear added a neglible amount over the same period.

The EIA data suggests this trajectory will accelerate in the coming year. The administration projects developers will bring an additional 22,053 MW of battery capacity online over the next 12 months, with a map showing the additions with large concentrations of batteries noticeably clustering in Texas (ERCOT), California (CAISO), and more. While Arizona is showing good growth, California and Texas hold over 70% of the total national capacity combined.

At the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) Fall Colloquium, Kelty explored how GM is bringing next-generation battery technologies from lab to commercialization, driving American battery innovation forward. The colloquium is part of the ongoing MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition speaker series.

At GM, Kelty’s team is primarily focused on three things: first, improving affordability to get more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road. “How do you drive down the cost?” Kelty asked the audience. “It's the batteries. The batteries make up about 30 percent of the cost of the vehicle.” Second, his team strives to improve battery performance, including charging speed and energy density. Third, they are working on localizing the supply chain. “We've got to build up our resilience and our independence here in North America, so we're not relying on materials coming from China,” Kelty explained.

To aid their efforts, resources are being poured into the virtualization space, significantly cutting down on time dedicated to research and development. Now, Kelty’s team can do modeling up front using artificial intelligence, reducing what previously would have taken months to a couple of days.

“If you want to modify … the nickel content ever so slightly, we can very quickly model: ‘OK, how’s that going to affect the energy density? The safety? How’s that going to affect the charge capability?’” said Kelty. “We can look at that at the cell level, then the pack level, then the vehicle level.”

Kelty revealed that they have found a solution that addresses affordability, accessibility, and commercialization: lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries. Previously, the industry looked to reduce costs by lowering the amount of cobalt in batteries by adding greater amounts of nickel. These high-nickel batteries are in most cars on the road in the United States due to their high range. LMR batteries, though, take things a step further by reducing the amount of nickel and adding more manganese, which drives the cost of batteries down even further while maintaining range.

Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries are the chemistry of choice in China, known for low cost, high cycle life, and high safety. With LMR batteries, the cost is comparable to LFP with a range that is closer to high-nickel. “That’s what’s really a breakthrough,” said Kelty.

LMR batteries are not new, but there have been challenges to adopting them, according to Kelty. “People knew about it, but they didn’t know how to commercialize it. They didn’t know how to make it work in an EV,” he explained. Now that GM has figured out commercialization, they will be the first to market these batteries in their EVs in 2028.

Kelty also expressed excitement over the use of vehicle-to-grid technologies in the future. Using a bidirectional charger with a two-way flow of energy, EVs could charge, but also send power from their batteries back to the electrical grid. This would allow customers to charge “their vehicles at night when the electricity prices are really low, and they can discharge it during the day when electricity rates are really high,” he said.

In addition to working in the transportation sector, GM is exploring ways to extend their battery expertise into applications in grid-scale energy storage. “It’s a big market right now, but it’s growing very quickly because of the data center growth,” said Kelty.

When looking to the future of battery manufacturing and EVs in the United States, Kelty remains optimistic: “we’ve got the technology here to make it happen. We’ve always had the innovation here. Now, we’re getting more and more of the manufacturing. We’re getting that all together. We’ve got just tremendous opportunity here that I’m hopeful we’re going to be able to take advantage of and really build a massive battery industry here.”",https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/post-images/MITei-Kurt-Kelty.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:02:00.666509

If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.","On November 13, 20 folks attended the second annual rural clean energy convening in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, co-sponsored by the Center for Progressive Reform and the Center for Energy Education. Attendees included academics, energy policy advocates, small-scale developers, technical experts, and government representatives. We built off last year’s convening, addressing the new North Carolina policy landscape and context given the repeal of federal funding, the state’s proposed unfavorable carbon plan, and rising energy burden in communities.

The main topics of the day were the challenges and opportunities for an equitable and just clean energy transition for North Carolina’s rural communities. Across a diverse range of perspectives, there was one consistent theme: North Carolina’s rural communities are incredible, socially vibrant places, and they deserve better: better housing, better renewable energy resources, and better economic development.

Energy burden — or the high share of household income that goes to energy — is acute in North Carolina, which sits in the top half of states with the highest energy burdens for low-wealth ratepayers. Nearly 1.5 million North Carolinians are “overburdened” by energy costs, meaning that they pay more than 6 percent of their income on energy. Some even pay more for energy than for housing, and many live in rural communities.

Across all income brackets, rural counties have the highest energy burden in the state due to energy-inefficient housing, climate change, and structural disinvestment that has led to disparate rates of poverty and unemployment. North Carolina counties with the highest energy costs — also disproportionately rural — interestingly also tend to have a larger portion of renewable energy projects. While utility-scale renewable energy projects may produce benefits such as higher tax revenues, these projects can ignore structural issues of ownership, wages, and distribution of benefits and may even reinforce or exacerbate extractive practices in the production of electricity.

Participants at the convening highlighted some of the barriers to addressing these energy-related injustices. The rise of AI data centers has complicated what communities can leverage as a benefit. We also discussed false solutions like small nuclear reactors that take a long time to build, compared to clear, easy, real-time solutions like solar and wind resources.

As federal funding has been held up in lawsuits or otherwise totally rescinded — as is the case with most Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding — communities are grappling with understaffed agencies trying to dole out energy efficiency funds or otherwise undertake clean energy projects.

The EnergySaver program is just one example of a new state program intended to lower energy bills but faced with staffing hurdles. The EnergySaver program is supposed to help homeowners and renters across North Carolina cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades through HOMES (Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings) and HEAR (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) from the IRA. Staff at the Center for Energy Education have heard that some program participants have reported delays processing applications.

Participants also stressed the importance of making sure basic needs are always forefront in the conversation about a clean, healthy, equitable energy transition. Moldy or asbestos-filled housing, lack of clean drinking water, and mental health burdens are all examples of the multilayered concerns in rural communities, some of which are often directly connected to structures that lack energy efficiency or weatherization features. We discussed how to support and educate our commissioners on how renewable energy projects owned by the community are assets. These commissioners may otherwise be persuaded by organized corporate interests, which tend to ignore issues beyond installing and connecting large-scale energy projects to the grid.

Still, there are significant natural strengths of rural North Carolina that can overcome these barriers: social capital, strong communities, growing diversity, and, namely, a growing rural population: of 100 total counties in the state, 80 of them are rural. Indeed, North Carolina’s rural population is the 2nd largest in the country (after Texas). There were 3,474,661 people living in rural North Carolina as of April 1, 2020, with a 2.9 percent increase from 2010 to 2020. With a growing population comes new opportunities to position rural communities as epicenters of wealth-building clean energy initiatives.

Rural communities are also primed for renewable energy development. The rise of agrivoltaics can be mutually beneficial for farmers and communities. Resilience hubs in rural communities can be beacons for cooling and resilience before and after natural disasters. Microgrids and the emergence of balcony solar can encourage energy independence and also promote resilience in the wake of severe weather. Participants also highlighted the role of educating children about solar and their role in the ecosystem to build a more sustainable future through direct participation.

Ultimately, a “rural agenda” is needed to address the multifaceted challenges to a clean energy transition. If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.

Gitanyow Lax’yip (Northwestern British Columbia, Canada) – Ahead of an anticipated Final Investment Decision in 2026, Simigigyet’m Gitanyow (Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs) – a traditional Indigenous government mandated to protect Gitanyow Nation’s lands, resources, and laws – submitted a letter today to 43 banks and pension funds to respect Gitanyow rights, and urge against providing financing or equity investments for the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) project or its developers.

Read the full letter from Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs to major banks and pensions.

Simogyet Watakhayetsxw/Deborah Good:

“Investors considering financing Ksi Lisims LNG need to know that this project is an extremely risky bet for many reasons and continues to face mounting opposition. Gitanyow’s message is clear: we’ll continue to fight for our way of life and stand up against projects like this that threaten our Lax’yip.”

This comes amidst decades of resistance, from these lands and around the world, to LNG and other forms of fossil fuel expansion. 128 civil society organisations have endorsed the Gitanyow letter in solidarity.

Addressing the lack of consent by at least four additional First Nations, the mounting financial risks of LNG projects as the world rapidly transitions to renewable energy, and legal and regulatory climate and environmental threats, the letter states:

“We would like to alert you to significant negative impacts and risks posed to our people and the natural resources on which we rely from the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied natural gas project. Given our serious concerns, growing legal uncertainty and the withholding of consent for the project by Indigenous Peoples — including Gitanyow — as required under the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to which Canada is a signatory, we strongly urge your institution not to provide financing or consider equity investments for this project or its developers.”

On November 13, Prime Minister Mark Carney designated Ksi Lisims LNG of national significance and referred it to the Major Projects Office for fast-tracking and possible taxpayer-backed support. The 12 million tonnes of gas exported by Ksi Lisims would escalate climate-killing emissions while putting billions in the pockets of foreign-owned and MAGA-linked private equity firms. This also comes on the heels of COP30 in Brazil where the rights and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples rightfully dominated the negotiations.

The letter continues:

“The Gitanyow have never ceded or surrendered title to their lands, rights to their resources, or the power to make decisions within the Lax’yip (Territory)…We have challenged the project in court over threats to salmon populations in the Nass Watershed, climate impacts, inadequate consultation and absence of Indigenous consent..… consent and/or a decision on consent has not been granted for Ksi Lisims LNG by four of the six participating Nations: Lax Kw’alaams, Metlaktla, Kitsumkalum, and Gitxalaa.”

Multiple First Nations have challenged Ksi Lisims LNG legally, including ongoing individual federal court challenges from Lax Kw’alaams Band and Metlakatla First Nation launched in October 2025; Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs challenged Ksi Lisims LNG in BC Supreme Court over dangers to salmon, climate impacts, and failure to properly consult, which was recently dismissed are considering an appeal.

Offering four clear recommendations for financial institutions considering Ksi Lisims LNG financing, Gitanyow leaders requested direct response to this letter within two weeks, by December 15, confirming decisions around denying financing to this project as part of a broader LNG exclusion policy.

,American Energy,2025-12-02 14:02:10+00:00,S&P Global,Navigating the US data center energy demand - S&P Global,Not Available,,,,,https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/special-reports/look-forward/data-center-frontiers/navigating-us-data-center-energy-demand,"Limits to grid-based power generation and transmission capacity do not mean data center power demand will go unmet.
Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom.
A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection.
A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions.
In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale.","Although pockets of excess generating capacity exist across the US, data centers' impact on load growth is expected to exceed grid-based power generation and transmission capacity.

Limits to grid-based power generation and transmission capacity do not mean data center power demand will go unmet. Instead, technology, market, and policy approaches that deliver power supply for the grid's most constrained hours and locations will command a premium, as will strategies that quickly provide power independent of the grid.

Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom. Battery energy storage solutions also offer scalable near-term capacity but depend on evolving market rules and requirements.

With concerns rising over the slow pace of grid-connected capacity expansion, customer-sited energy resources and capabilities offer a faster path to power. Expansion of these resources may continue long term, especially as data center campuses grow.

US power grids have significant excess generating capacity to accommodate load growth throughout most of the year. In many industries, average capacity utilization is used as a measure of market tightness. In the power sector, coal and natural gas combined-cycle fleets averaged 50% to 55% utilization over the past decade. This suggests incremental new loads could be accommodated by increasing utilization of the existing fleet. However, power markets require supply and demand to stay balanced at all times, from peak summer afternoons to cold winter mornings. To estimate how much new load US power grids can integrate, it is essential to understand the supply-demand balance during the most constrained hours.

During the most constrained hours, excess generating capacity across the US totals about 70 GW, slightly greater than California’s peak electricity demand. Over the next few years, surplus generating capacity is expected to remain within this range, based on the current pipeline of new projects and the outlook for generation retirements and load growth outside of data centers.

At first glance, with a pipeline of about 85 GW of new data center capacity requests expected by 2030, US power markets face a seemingly modest generating capacity deficit of 15 GW. However, data center operators face a much higher level of grid constraints for several reasons. First, to reliably support an additional 85 GW of demand, approximately 100 GW of total capacity, including surplus, is required. Another reason is that surplus generating capacity is not well aligned with expected data center growth on a regional basis. A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection. PJM, named for the original three core states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, is the largest US Regional Transmission Organization; it operates the electric grid and competitive wholesale electricity market for all or parts of 13 Eastern US states and the District of Columbia. PJM surplus capacity has declined sharply in recent years, with recent record-high-capacity auction outcomes pointing to persistent near-term tightness. Upside risk to load growth from other industrial demand — particularly in the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) — threatens to exacerbate the capacity deficit in that region as well.

Even within a market, spare generating capacity may not be immediately deliverable to new data centers because of regional transmission grid constraints. As the size of new data center facilities or campuses grows — reaching hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatt scale within a few years — the concentration of power demand strains local transmission systems. This may require extensive, time-intensive upgrades, including installation of large transformers and breakers.

Although orders for large turbines have surged over the past 18 months, supply constraints and lengthy project timelines will push much of this new capacity into production in the late 2020s and early 2030s. The power crunch appears most severe through 2028 and 2029, when supply begins to catch up.

For example, PJM’s fast-tracking initiative, completed earlier this year, shows that most new gas capacity will not be in service before 2029, with uprates to existing facilities providing the bulk of near-term additions. Similarly, state-led efforts in Texas to expedite new gas projects are expected to have limited impact until 2029.

Overall, we expect 55 GW to 65 GW of new grid-based gas capacity in the US from 2025 to 2030, roughly double our expectations prior to the data center boom, but still short of incremental needs.

Beyond large gas turbines, utilities and regional power markets have raced to shore up near-term capacity by extending existing resources. Since the start of 2023, plans to retire over 37 GW of coal capacity (one-third of all previously announced coal retirement capacity) have either been delayed or avoided through planned conversions to gas-fired generation — including at least 10 GW since the start of 2025. Deals to restart recently retired nuclear power plants and uprate operating ones are set to deliver around 3 GW of incremental nuclear capacity by 2030. Uprates at existing gas-fired plants will also contribute. Even the restart of recently retired coal plants — likely remade as gas-fired resources — is now under consideration, a scenario unimaginable just a few years ago but revived by tight market conditions and supportive federal actions.

Although grid-connected battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity is poised for significant growth, the data center boom has so far given this technology only a modest 8 GW or 15% uplift through 2030. Faster timelines give BESS an edge relative to other resources, but grid-connected BESS still faces long development queues, while tougher economics persist outside of Texas, California and the Southwest. Still, with scalable near-term capacity in short supply, BESS can enable data centers to capitalize on the potential emergence of new market processes to fast-track grid connections in exchange for self-supplied capacity.

Most incremental near-term capacity will come from new generation capacity and retirement delays, but demand-side strategies — such as deploying enhanced network-utilization technologies, repurposing existing crypto-currency mining facilities into traditional data centers, or adopting advanced chip-cooling techniques to reduce facility peak cooling demand and improve data center energy efficiency — may help avoid some incremental capacity needs. Expanding existing demand-response programs is another option, but it remains uncertain whether market prices can incentivize data center operators to curtail grid consumption, even temporarily, due to operational complexity and the enormous cost of potential service interruptions.

For data centers, load flexibility means dynamically restraining electricity consumption through workload management — such as rescheduling, slowing or re-routing IT tasks to other data centers — or temporarily relying on an on-site power supply during periods of grid stress. If enabled by supportive market rules and processes, flexibility can speed load interconnection by reducing the need for new grid infrastructure.

A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions. These approaches can be tailored to site-specific factors such as commercial requirements, emissions limits or operator expertise. Instead of waiting for new grid upgrades, flexible data centers that assume delivery risk — the risk that electricity will not be deliverable during periods of grid stress — can position themselves for faster grid connection.

However, making IT workloads grid-responsive remains novel in data center operations and design. In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale. Microsoft’s decade-old collaboration with Black Hills Energy used backup diesel generators to help avoid major investment in new generating resources. Future use cases must continue to address emissions limits, refueling logistics, and potential community opposition.

Moreover, although flexibility addresses the key data center bottleneck of grid-based power generation and transmission capacity, most states and markets do not yet offer a faster path to grid connection for flexible loads. Many of the load flexibility options that states, utilities, and operators are developing for large energy consumers remain undefined and do not yet have regulatory approval.

It seems clear, though, that as new load flexibility rules evolve, especially if they impose more stringent availability requirements, they will favor on-site resources and configurations that rely more on gas-based technologies than on energy-limited resources like shorter-duration BESS.

Because load flexibility does not yet offer a clear path to faster grid connections and requirements remain uncertain, many data center operators are looking to deploy more on-site resources to provide a fully independent power supply, at least temporarily until a permanent grid connection is established.

Since late last year, specialists like Crusoe, Frontier Infrastructure, and Enchanted Rock have unveiled plans to colocate over 26 GW of power supply with data centers by the early 2030s, with potential for more. Clusters have emerged in Texas and the Mid Atlantic (PJM), which are strong natural gas producing regions and have the greatest expected grid-capacity deficit.

On-site power often features smaller generators — such as small gas turbines, fuel cells and reciprocating engines — which are currently favored for their speed, scalability, modularity and availability. Many data center operators envision their on-site power assets shifting to backup roles after a grid connection is secured, while others are considering deeper integration of on-site resources with regional markets. For now, while most on-site generation projects remain in development, several gigawatts are already operating, under construction or backed by firm orders for gas resources.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/corp_1120_USPower?$responsive$,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:02.117048

But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems.
Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD).
But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion.
“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.","Greater Peoria Sanitary District (GPSD) treats 20 to 25 million gallons of wastewater each day and uses some of the resulting biogas to heat its boilers while flaring the rest. But now the Illinois utility has other plans for some of the excess and is banking on monetary and environmental returns.

That biogas will be converted to renewable natural gas (RNG), injected into the natural gas pipeline, and sold as transportation fuel—a slow but steady growing trend among water utilities looking to reduce their emissions while capitalizing on their waste byproduct. And they have the ideal feedstock. Their gas is high in methane and low in nitrogen, meaning its energy-rich and requires relatively minimal treatment steps.

Wastewater treatment plants have actually been capturing and digesting their biogas for about a century, though in the early days, the goal wasn’t energy recovery; it was simply to reduce the sludge they needed to manage. Over time, plant operators realized they were sitting on a resource that could power their pumps, aerators, boilers, and other energy-intensive equipment.

While some projects go a step further and upgrade to RNG, only about 4% of these operations currently do so, says Patrick Serfass, executive director, American Biogas Council (ABC). But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems. And if every wastewater facility with enough daily flow installed systems, the sector could capture 171.8 billion cubic feet of biogas each year, producing enough energy to power 1.3 million U.S. households, reports ABC.

What’s holding some operators back is that these projects can be financially risky, especially for small to midsized operations as they come with high capital and operating expenditures. Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD). Only about 5,000 of them see this volume—that’s less than a third of them. But for the utilities that can and choose to make the investment, there are potential payoffs.

With hundreds of millions of gallons of wastewater entering a treatment plant each day, there can be significant environmental and financial reasons to recover these resources, says Cynthia Finley, director of Regulatory Affairs at National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Operators can lower their emissions, generate revenue if the RNG is sold for injection into the grid, and reduce their energy costs and reliance on fossil fuel if it’s used internally. As importantly, using the RNG onsite can improve the resilience of the utility, allowing operations to continue if there is an interruption in other energy sources.

“But since the cost of building and operating these projects is high and the cost of fossil natural gas is low, they really do not pay for themselves without other incentives, such as state green energy programs or the federal Renewable Fuel Standard program for transportation fuels. These incentive programs can provide enough revenue for the utility to tip the balance in favor of a biogas to RNG project,” Finley says.

Now new private-public partnerships are emerging to help make these projects pencil out for more operators—and to tap into tremendous volumes of stranded biogas. In GPSD’s case, project developer Burnham is managing the risks by absorbing costs to build the processing infrastructure and through performance guarantees, namely ensuring that treatment levels are met.

The utility has no upfront costs and gets tax credits and a royalty on the gas it produces.

“Where we can most help is where facilities have a large capital need. For instance, where discharge volumes are out of compliance and more treatment infrastructure is required. By capitalizing on the byproduct of their process, we tend to be able to bring down net treatment costs while helping meet state and federal standards,” says Chris Tynan, founder and CEO, Burnham.

More states are adopting food waste diversion policies; about 11 of them have done so to date. This movement is opening project opportunities for plants that co-digest their biogas and food scraps. They already have the infrastructure to digest the materials and tend to be in close proximity to the generators.

“It’s a win-win: food processors and municipal solid-waste departments get a cost-effective and sustainable disposal option, while the treatment facility generates more biogas—offsetting energy costs and, in some cases, generating revenue,” Serfass says.

New York City’s Newtown Creek Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility is one of a few that now co-digests organics and sludge to help meet a food scrap diversion mandate while generating product. The facility produced nearly 355,000 MMBtu of RNG in just under two years –enough to heat over 7,400 homes annually. And the project has yielded negative greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding the methane release associated with traditional landfill disposal.

But what about the steep upfront cost? That expenditure and payback varies. But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion. But it would save $255 million a year, delivering a return on investment in five to six years.

“These facilities have a long, long lifespan. So, the economics of it really make sense,” Serfass says.

To Brian Johnson, executive director, Greater Peoria Sanitary District, it’s about more. It’s also about helping the public understand what water utilities do.

“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.

“We can show that we are turning a waste byproduct into a renewable fuel that reduces emissions, generates revenue for ratepayers, and strengthens our region’s sustainability. It’s a smart environmental solution built from infrastructure that the community already owns. And we are using energy from something they produce every day.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt53dd34158e663329/692eef3e16c66f4e7aae064e/wastewater_treatment_plant.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:59.728777

The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.","Typically, a utility presents one scenario of future electricity demand and grid investment needs, stakeholders provide input, and then regulators approve how much the utility can spend. This worked fine during the decades when there was slow load growth, but electrification brings two sources of uncertainty that break this framework.

First, timing uncertainty. We know California will eventually host millions of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps. We don't know exactly how much of that will happen in the next 5 to 10 years. California is standing strong by its electrification goals, but recent federal actions are making it harder and more expensive to electrify.

Second, location uncertainty. People and businesses purchase electric cars and trucks when they want to and charge them wherever it is convenient. Mostly, that means predictable locations where vehicles are parked for a long time, like overnight at homes or in depots, where the vast majority of charging needs can be met when there is plenty of spare capacity on the grid. But public charging is more variable and requires more power in a shorter period of time, resulting in hot spots that require power line upgrades.

Timing and location are especially important because whether a part of the grid needs an upgrade or not depends on the capacity of each piece of equipment, how much load it serves today, and how much load it will serve tomorrow.

The number of components that SCE needs to upgrade could vary around 20 percent in either direction from its primary forecast. The old approach—presenting regulators with a single forecast and requesting a fixed budget—no longer works when the range of possible futures is that wide.

Spend too little and the grid is overloaded and unable to reliably serve customers or accommodate electrification. Spend too much and electricity rates increase, which means that fewer people can afford the clean technology that California desperately needs to meet its climate goals.

Our proposal for threading the needle

NRDC recommended that SCE establish a two-way balancing account to fund future grid upgrades to thread the needle between encouraging proactive spending and accommodating uncertainty in how much grid investment is needed. A two-way balancing account provides SCE with an initial reduced budget, allows SCE to collect more money (with limits) if needed, and requires SCE to return unspent money to customers.

There are a couple of ways the CPUC could set the initial approved budget and provide guardrails. For the initial budget, they could go with a conservative approach and approve an amount based on the lower end of future upgrades that are likely needed, or CPUC could approve the amount SCE originally requested, which NRDC found falls in the middle of the range of upgrades we believe are likely necessary.

For both scenarios, SCE would have more rigid limits on the uses of these funds. In past rate cases, SCE would have been given the ability to spend distribution system funding on a wide range of projects. In this case, SCE could only spend that money on distribution grid capacity expansion. Ratepayers are off the hook if these grid upgrade needs don’t materialize. And in either case, CPUC could impose a total spending cap to further protect utility customers, ideally based on the higher end of the likely grid upgrade range.

While other balancing accounts exist, they are a departure from the status quo in California, wherein a utility is approved to spend a set amount for all the near-term investments it can justify; but once this money is approved, the utility can spend it however it wants. Although this model provides utilities with flexibility if investment needs change from the original plan, it can lead to inefficient spending because the utility will aim to spend the full approved budget, even if the projected load growth used to justify the budget does not materialize. The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.

A balancing account, with an upper spending limit restricted to distribution grid upgrades, provides the right amount of flexibility in the face of uncertainty and encourages SCE to spend on necessary grid infrastructure in a timely manner.

The CPUC authorized SCE to spend an initial $532 million on grid upgrades based on a conservative scenario that only includes a fraction of the electrification necessary to meet state policy goals. Additionally, to comply with state law and policy goals, SCE can create a memorandum account through which it can spend up to an additional $100 million on the upgrades necessary to support electric transportation load growth only. SCE could spend even more if it must, but that spending is riskier because SCE will have to spend first and collect the money later—and only if the commission approves of what the utility did.

By guaranteeing some recovery in the typical manner without guardrails and also providing an avenue for additional recovery based on reasonableness review, this well-intentioned proposal has two shortcomings.

First, if SCE thinks it may be denied recovering the money it spends, it may not invest enough to keep the grid reliable, which would affect all electricity use, not just electric cars. It could also pinch pennies today and make smaller upgrades, thereby missing out on long-term savings from economies of scale and leaving ratepayers worse off.

Second, because the $532 million authorized has no guardrails, SCE could spend that money on less important things, knowing that it could always justify additional spending through the memo account as critical needs come up.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:31.838642

The renewable energy industry continues to see downsizing for projects and other initiatives. Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back more than $4.4 billion worth of large-scale renewable energy projects and factories in October, bringing the total cost of projects canceled in the private-sector to more than $28.7 billion in 2025 alone, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of renewable energy projects. The cancellations and scale backs will eliminate nearly 9,000 previously announced and current jobs, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects to nearly 30,000 this year.

October’s cancellations and closures (one project was disclosed on Sept. 30) included nine previously announced battery, storage, solar, and electric vehicle factories in Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio and California. Only a single new large-scale project was announced last month according to E2’s tracking — the lowest number of new projects announced in a month since E2 began tracking.

According to the analysis, cancellations, closures, and downsizes are outpacing new project investments and jobs nearly two to one in 2025. About $11 billion in investments and 17,000 jobs have been announced so far in 2025. At the same time, $28.7 billion and nearly 30,000 jobs have been canceled.

“Cancellations are clearly accelerating,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2. “The abandonment of 51 projects this year alone reflects the long-term uncertainty manufacturers and investors are facing about the long-term future of U.S. energy leadership.”

Republican states suffering most

Republican-held congressional districts continue to lose the most from cancellations. Nearly $17 billion in investments that would have created almost 22,000 jobs have been canceled in Republican districts so far in 2025, compared with almost $10 billion and 13,000 jobs in Democratic districts.

“Companies, including many that had already broken ground, begun hiring, or made major capital commitments, are reversing course at an increasing rate,” Timberlake added. “Communities and their constituents are paying the price through lost job opportunities, lost economic development investments and lost tax revenues.”

According to E2’s tracking, new investments were not enough to offset impact from scaled back and abandoned projects. The only new clean energy project announced in October was Eos Energy Storage’s $352 million plans to relocate its headquarters to Pittsburgh and expand its Pennsylvania-based battery manufacturing operation. The Eos project brings total investments announced since E2 began tracking in August 2022 to $132.2 billion.

Cancellations tracked by E2 include projects that were announced or completed prior to August 2022 that are not added to E2’s announcement tracker. This results in inconsistencies between the jobs and investment totals between the cancellation and announcement trackers since many cancelled and closed projects would not impact E2’s announcement tracker.

COVINGTON COUNTY, AL — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected #Reliant Southwest Alabama Storage LLC’s permit application for the Pine Hills Sequestration Hub as incomplete, according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by local residents.

In an August 14, 2025 Notice of Deficiency, EPA informed the company that critical information is missing from their Class VI permit application, including a complete Area of Review map showing all injection wells, producing wells, abandoned wells, water wells, homes, surface water, springs, mines, and other structures where people live or work.

“The EPA is requiring basic public information that should have been included from the start,” said local landowner and attorney Wes Laird. “Our community has a right to see a complete picture of what’s being proposed before a project of this magnitude moves forward.”

The proposed Pine Hills facility would inject approximately 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (waste) per year into underground formations in Covington County — what would be among the largest carbon sequestration projects in the world. The aquifer that supplies fresh water to Covington County residents also supplies much of the Alabama Wiregrass and Northwest Florida.

However, documents released to the community are heavily redacted, with entire pages marked as “proprietary business information.”

Community members note that the application itself acknowledges the presence of wells in the area that were not properly plugged, raising concerns about potential pathways for CO₂ migration.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.
“The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.
So disappointing.” He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration.
In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.","The Trump administration has renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, now calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, marking an identity shift for the Colorado institution that has been a global leader in wind, solar and other renewable energy research.

“The new name reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director, in a statement.

He did not specify what this “broader vision” would mean for the lab’s programs or its staff of about 4,000.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.

Asked for details, the Department of Energy said in an email that the renaming “reflects the Department’s renewed focus on ‘energy addition,’ rather than the prioritization of specific energy resources.”

A lab spokesman had no additional information about whether there will be changes to programs or headcount at the lab.

Bill Ritter, a Democrat who was governor of Colorado from 2007 to 2011, said it’s reasonable to assume that the name change signals that the federal government is abandoning the lab’s status as a world leader in energy research.

“It’s an iconic research facility,” he said.

Underscoring this point, he recalled a trip to Israel while he was governor.

“The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.

After leaving office, he founded the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, which specializes in energy policy research, and is now a consultant on energy business and policy.

Based on this experience, he thinks that anything the Trump administration does to divert from the lab’s mission is harmful to the United States’ ability to remain a major player in the energy economy of the near future.

“We’ll no longer be competitive in renewables research with China or India or other countries that are still heading toward the renewable energy transition at a very fast pace,” he said.

People with close ties to the lab were not surprised by the name change, given the administration’s broader goals.

“In the early days of DOGE people there were whispering about a name change to avoid the ire of MAGAs,” said Matt Henry, a Montana-based social scientist who worked at the lab from February 2024 to August 2025, in a post on Bluesky. “It pissed me off—prioritizing the preservation of the institution at the expense of its [stated] mission? So disappointing.”

He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration. The term MAGA refers to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and movement.

Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor, said if the name change is a sign of a significant change in the lab’s work, it would be “like losing several major land grant research universities all at once.”

Mulvaney has done projects in partnership with people at the lab. An important part of the institution’s work, he said, is that its research is free and accessible to the public, helping businesses and universities that may not be able to afford the work of private research firms.

The lab’s mission has included consulting to help communities benefit from new energy technologies, and ensure smooth transitions away from fossil fuels.

This work meant that the lab was out of step with an administration that has said it disagrees with the idea of a transition away from fossil fuels and has sought to impede funding and development of renewable energy.

The lab was established in 1974 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, part of a law signed by President Gerald Ford to facilitate alternatives to importing oil from the Middle East, according to a history on the lab’s website. The U.S. was suffering through high gasoline prices amid tensions with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of energy, in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

In 1977, the federal government selected Golden, Colorado, as the location for the lab. In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.

But the lab’s history has also included budget cuts and periods when its work fell out of favor with presidential administrations, including layoffs and funding cuts under President Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump proposed substantial cuts during his first term, but Congress retained much of the funding.

The Trump administration’s budget proposal, issued in May, calls for cuts across non-defense discretionary spending, including on energy research, but the budget process is still underway.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/98079-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:58.312857

Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?
Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.
How do green bond prepayments generate savings?
Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?","Frequently Asked Questions: CCA Green Bond Prepayment Transactions

1. Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?

Prepayment transactions allow CCAs to reduce the cost of long-term renewable energy contracts by using tax-exempt financing, leading directly to lower utility bills for customers.

2. How much money have CCAs saved through CCCFA so far?

CCCFA has issued $23 billion in prepayment bonds, saving CCA customers roughly $150 million every year, totaling about $4.6 billion over the life of these contracts.

3. How do energy prepayment contracts work?

CCAs prepay for a long-term supply of electricity using proceeds from tax-exempt municipal bonds. Because these bonds carry lower interest rates, the resulting energy price is discounted compared to traditional procurement.

4. How do prepayment transactions support clean energy development?

Prepayments help finance the purchase and construction of new renewable energy projects by providing developers with upfront capital and long-term revenue certainty.

5. Why can CCAs use tax-exempt bonds for energy prepayments?

Federal law permits tax-exempt public entities—including CCAs—to finance prepaid energy contracts using municipal bonds. The IRS and Congress codified this framework in the 1990s.

6. Why are green bond prepayments a competitive advantage for CCAs compared to IOUs?

CCAs can access tax-exempt financing, which investor-owned utilities cannot use. This enables CCAs to secure meaningfully lower energy prices—an important competitive advantage in California’s energy landscape.

7. Have prepayment bonds been used before?

Yes. Municipal utilities have long used similar structures to prepay for natural gas. CCCFA is now leveraging this framework for renewable energy purchases on behalf of CCAs.

8. What is the California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA)?

CCCFA is a joint powers authority created by CCAs to issue green bonds that facilitate energy prepayments. By working together, CCAs gain access to lower-cost capital and greater purchasing power.

9. Who participates in a typical prepayment transaction?

A standard transaction includes:

A CCA purchasing electricity

CCCFA, which issues the bonds and coordinates the structure

A taxable energy supplier providing electricity under a prepaid contract

10. What major parties benefit from the prepayment structure?

CCAs benefit from lower-cost renewable energy.

Customers benefit from lower rates.

Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.

Energy suppliers secure long-term revenue from prepaid contracts.

11. Are more CCAs planning to use these structures?

Yes. Several CCAs that are not yet part of CCCFA have expressed interest, and demand from both CCAs and investors suggests more issuances are likely.

12. How do green bond prepayments generate savings?

Savings come from the difference between taxable and tax-exempt interest rates. Investors accept lower, tax-exempt returns; CCAs pass these lower financing costs directly into discounted energy prices.

13. Is the typical 10% savings rate reliable?

Ten percent is a useful benchmark but not guaranteed. Actual savings depend heavily on market conditions at the time of issuance, and some recent transactions have produced lower discounts.

14. Are there additional fees CCAs must pay to participate?

Underwriting fees and other issuance costs are built into the transaction cashflows. The only additional cost to CCAs is minimal internal staff time.

15. What does it mean that CCCFA’s bonds are “non-recourse”?

Non-recourse means CCAs are not financially responsible for repaying the bonds beyond the structured transaction revenues. The bonds are secured only by the contract rights and cashflows within the prepayment deal—not CCA general funds.

16. Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?

Early savings have been substantial, the structures are scalable, and investors continue to show strong demand for tax-exempt, climate-aligned bonds. As a result, future issuances are highly likely.",https://cal-cca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-22-CalCCA_Logo_400x400_Cleaned-Up-Simplified-on-Green.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:40.541916

During the Chairman’s Remarks portion of the meeting, Dare County Board of Commissioners Chairman Bob Woodard provided an update on the county’s ongoing efforts to address the significant challenges occurring on Hatteras Island—particularly persistent flooding and overwash along N.C. Highway 12 and the collapse of 15 homes in Buxton over a six-week period.

Chairman Woodard reported that county officials recently met with NC Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and representatives from Governor Josh Stein's office, the NC Division of Coastal Management, and the North Carolina Board of Transportation to enable state leadership to fully understand the severity of the conditions impacting the island and its critical infrastructure. He emphasized that these meetings are part of a broader effort to allow officials to see firsthand what residents and visitors are experiencing. Woodard also noted that county officials plan to travel to Raleigh after the first of the year—once legislators return to session—to meet individually with lawmakers.

As he continued his remarks, Chairman Woodard shared a letter he recently sent to North Carolina Governor Josh Stein and every member of the General Assembly regarding the escalating erosion and overwash issues. The letter issues an urgent call for statewide support to address rapidly worsening conditions on Hatteras Island. It outlines severe coastal erosion that has led to repeated home collapses, the increasing vulnerability of N.C. Highway 12—the sole transportation link for Hatteras Island—and the mounting strain on local resources despite more than $275 million invested in beach nourishment by Dare County and its five oceanfront towns over the years.

The letter also details several key requests, including funding the long-established but never-capitalized State Beach Nourishment Fund, advancing long-term strategies identified through the N.C. 12 Task Force and reconsidering the state’s ban on hardened shoreline structures in areas where nourishment alone is no longer sufficient. Chairman Woodard further emphasized that protecting N.C. Highway 12 and stabilizing the coastline is critical not only for the safety and well-being of island residents but also for safeguarding the economic engine that benefits the entire state.

Chairman Woodard concluded his remarks by assuring the public that the Dare County Board of Commissioners and Dare County officials are working diligently every day to address and resolve the challenges facing Dare County and its coastal communities.

Earls cited Stevens’ support of abortion restrictions and changes that she sees as reducing North Carolinians’ ability to vote.

Stevens accused Riggs of judicial overreach.

“Anita Earls is a liberal judicial activist who wants our courts, not our duly elected legislature to write the laws,” Stevens said in a statement. “I welcome the opportunity to expose her radical leftist agenda to all North Carolina voters.”

The Democrat also addressed recent pushback to a statement she issued last month criticizing the U.S. Border Patrol’s presence in Charlotte and Raleigh. Republican Supreme Court Justice Phil Berger Jr. called Earls’ statement “irresponsible” and questioned her neutrality.

“Judges are not political commentators and we are not supposed to be advocates,” Berger Jr. wrote. “When we speak as if we are, we blur the boundaries.”

Earls defended her statement, saying she has a First Amendment right and obligation as a statewide candidate to put a spotlight on issues she cares about.

“It’s important not to confuse two different things,” Earls said. “What we do as justices in our opinions is one thing, but voters have the right, I think, to know what our values are and what we stand for. That’s maybe different than in the past.”

Democratic Court of Appeals Judges Toby Hampson and John Arrowood also submitted paperwork for their reelection campaigns. There also will be a competitive Democratic primary for an open Court of Appeals seat between James Whalen and Christine Walczyk.

The Caucus asked Hampson about his involvement in the long-running state Supreme Court election dispute in which Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin sought to overturn his defeat by Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs.

A three-judge panel including Hampson sided with Griffin and ordered the removal of several longtime voters falsely labeled as “never residents.” (The Assembly was first to report that many of those voters actually did live in the state or had in the past.) Hampson dissented, and a federal Trump-appointed judge ultimately ruled in Riggs’ favor.

“There’d never been any evidentiary hearing to determine which of these voters were, in fact, in the right categories or not in the right categories,” Hampson said. “We were just making assumptions about these voters based on their appearance on a list. It just underscores that facts matter.”

Congressional Chaos

Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis announced Monday that he’d seek reelection in the redrawn 1st Congressional District, though he hasn’t yet filed with the State Board of Elections. Republican state lawmakers redrew the northeastern voting lines in an effort to net their party an additional congressional seat. (Punchbowl News first reported on Davis’ plans.)

Davis had debated whether to challenge Republican Rep. Greg Murphy in the 3rd District, since he lives in Snow Hill, which is now in Murphy’s district. Unlike those running for the North Carolina General Assembly, congressional candidates don’t have to live in their districts.

“Many feel Washington, D.C., isn’t serving their needs, and the redistricting battle clearly proves it,” Davis said in a statement. “I’m running in NC-01 to ensure everyone, from the northeast to the coast, has a powerful voice in Congress.”

Republican state Sen. Bobby Hanig filed to run against Davis on Monday. He told reporters he was happy to learn of Davis’ decision to stay in the 1st District.

“We’ll expose Don,” Hanig said. “What he is and what he says he is are two totally different things.”

Hanig must first get through a crowded GOP primary that so far includes Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson, Lenoir County Commissioner Eric Rouse, attorney Ashley Nicole Russell, and Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck.

Thirteen people submitted paperwork to run for Congress on Monday, including GOP incumbents Chuck Edwards and Richard Hudson and Democratic Rep. Val Foushee.

Foushee, who is in a deep blue district, said she’s optimistic about Democrats’ chances next year and hopes the party adopts an affordability-centric message. “For Democrats, we should be most focused on healthcare and returning jobs,” she said.

Hudson, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he’s hopeful voters will reward Republicans for their legislative agenda, which includes the One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending law.

“The American people in the last election returned Donald Trump to the White House with a very specific agenda, and the Congress has delivered on that agenda,” Hudson said. “So I believe the people are going to reward Republicans.”

Edwards is the lone Republican seen as potentially vulnerable. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks Edwards’ district as Likely Republican. Democrats hope voters in Western North Carolina will want a change in congressional leadership over what they see as a slow federal response to Hurricane Helene.

Edwards said he’s pleased more funds have been approved for North Carolina recently, including $155 million in FEMA grants for infrastructure repairs, but has found himself frustrated over the past year over local governments waiting on reimbursements to be approved.

“It’s inaccurate to say that the recovery has been slower than expected,” Edwards said. “The thing that has been slower than expected is the reimbursement to local governments for the investment that they’ve made in the recovery. The recovery continues to operate at breakneck speed.”

Jamie Ager, a farmer and CEO of Hickory Nut Gap Farms in Fairview, is running in the Democratic primary in hopes of challenging Edwards. He said he respects Edwards’ business experience and accessibility to constituents but feels he’s fallen short on supporting recovery efforts.

“He’s not represented our district and gotten the money from Hurricane Helene that we need to get our feet back under us,” Ager said. “He’s been tone deaf to the frustrations around Helene and to just how much the cost of living is. He doesn’t understand the district.”

Legislative Angling

The showdown is officially on between Republican Senate leader Phil Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. Both filed paperwork for what is likely to be the most consequential and intriguing primary race in the state.

In a twist, Democratic Sen. Dan Blue of Wake County also filed for reelection. Blue’s colleagues ousted him from leadership earlier this year, and Blue told me the 2025-2026 legislative session would be his last.

He’s had a change of heart, though. Blue was the most conservative-voting Democrat in his chamber, siding with the GOP on 69% of votes this year. By comparison, new Democratic leader Sydney Batch has voted with the majority 62% of the time. If Democrats break the GOP supermajority in the Senate next year, Blue could become a key swing vote and thorn in the side of the new Democratic caucus leadership.

One other filer of note: Sen. Norman Sanderson of Pamlico County was arrested earlier this year for a DWI and has since apologized to his constituents. He filed Monday to seek reelection.

So far, seven incumbents have primary challengers:

Page aims to unseat Berger, the state’s top Republican.

Harnett County Commissioner William Morris is challenging Republican Rep. Joe Pike.

Holly Ridge Mayor Pro-Tem Joshua Patti is running against Republican Rep. Carson Smith of Pender County.

Former Democratic Rep. Michael Wray will have a rematch with Rep. Rodney Pierce of Halifax County (in the closest legislative primary last year, Pierce defeated Wray by 34 votes, or 0.3 percentage points).

Armstrong Farms manager Darren Armstrong is running against Republican Rep. Keith Kidwell of Beaufort County.

Democratic Rep. Amanda Cook, who was recently tapped to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Cecil Brockman of Guilford County, has a contested primary that so far includes Angie Williams-McMichael of High Point and Joe Alston, a former executive director of the NC NAACP.

Caroline Eason of Lawndale is looking to unseat Republican Rep. Kelly Hastings of Gaston County.

Random Tidbits:

Don Brown, a staunch vaccine critic, and Elizabeth Temple, a former substitute teacher who was accused of making offensive comments to elementary school students, filed for the U.S. Senate primary against Republican Michael Whatley (who hasn’t submitted paperwork yet).

While he may not have a good chance at winning in a strong Republican seat, he was hands-down the tallest candidate I’ve ever seen: At 6 feet, 9.5 inches, Democrat Harry Morley is looking to upset Republican Rep. Pat Harrigan in the 10th Congressional District.

For a moment, the North Carolina State Board of Elections listed Rep. Ray Pickett as a primary challenger to House Speaker Destin Hall. The error was quickly corrected. (They both represent parts of Watauga County.)

Dear Lieutenant General Graham,

We write to respectfully request a 45-day extension of the public comment period for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) regarding operations of the Detroit Dam within Oregon’s Willamette Valley System. The draft SEIS was released on November 14, with the comment period closing on December 29. We urge the Corps to provide a longer and more accessible comment window that will allow meaningful and informed public engagement on this highly impactful document.

The SEIS is both lengthy and technically complex, addressing issues that directly affect drinking water quality, economic stability, and public health across several communities in the Santiam Canyon and Willamette Valley. Recent experience with deep drawdown operations, including those at Green Peter Reservoir, have revealed the potential for extensive turbidity, severe impacts to drinking water systems, and significant economic losses for surrounding communities. These concerns underscore the importance of ensuring that residents, local governments, Tribal governments, utility providers, business owners, and other stakeholders have sufficient time to review and respond to this SEIS.

While a 45-day comment period is already a relatively short timeline for a document like this, the currently scheduled comment window also spans the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah, among others. These weeks are among the most challenging of the year for public participation, as reduced staffing, competing obligations, and widespread travel mean most Oregonians are far more concerned about weather delays and family recipes than comment periods. The combined effect of a shortened timeline and a holiday-dominated review period will significantly hinder the ability of Oregonians to provide thoughtful and informed feedback.

Given the anticipated impacts of potential operational changes at Detroit Dam, including those related to drinking water for more than 200,000 downstream residents, the Kokanee fishery, and economic conditions in the Santiam Canyon, it is essential that the review process maximize transparency and accessibility. A reasonable extension of the comment period would help accomplish this goal and ensure that the Corps receives the robust, substantive input needed to support a well-informed decision.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the USACE extend the comment period by an additional 45-days to provide stakeholders with adequate time to fully assess the SEIS and prepare comprehensive comments. We believe this extension is both necessary and in the public Interest.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to continued collaboration to ensure that the management of the Willamette Valley System supports the recovery of endangered fish species while also meeting the needs, safety, and well-being of Oregonians and the communities they call home.",https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Press-Release-Photo-3.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:13.148770

Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure.
Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state.
Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.","Entergy broke ground Monday on a pair of new electricity plants being built to power Meta's massive AI data center in northeast Louisiana, part of the utility's plan to roll out billions of dollars in new infrastructure for the tech company's historically large project.

The gas-fired plants located near the data center will deliver around 1500 megawatts of power and will begin generating in 2028. A third plant in St. Charles Parish slated to help meet the tech company's energy needs is currently awaiting permits, said Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy Louisiana.

The utility is constructing other resources for Meta as well, including substations and transmission lines, totaling more than $5 billion in new infrastructure.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, president and CEO of Entergy, the state's largest utility.

But while Entergy has described the project as beneficial to ratepayers since much of the new infrastructure will be paid for by Meta, it has come under sharp criticism from environmental groups, consumer advocacy organization and other large industries. Criticism includes concerns that other ratepayers will have to cover project costs and whether the data center's large power demands will affect grid reliability.

Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%.

Savings?

Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure. The tech company will pay for all costs of the new generators over a 15-year contract, as well as storm recovery costs, leading to a projected $650 million in customer savings, according to the utility.

But both environmental advocacy and oil, gas and petrochemical companies disputed Entergy's plan to build the new infrastructure, arguing over the months-long regulation process that the plan risked increased bills for all types of customers.

Of particular concern to opponents is the plants' lifespan of up to 40 years compared to Meta's contract of 15, which could potentially leave other ratepayers on the hook if the tech company leaves. All customers will also pay for a $550 million transmission line.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups opposing the plan have also warned of grid reliability and environmental risks of the new fossil fuel-powered plants, which will produce pollution and climate-warming emissions.

Entergy, meanwhile, says the new generation added to the system will be ""among the most efficient in the state"" and provide long-term reliability benefits to customers. Meta is also planning to build 1500 megawatts of solar power in Louisiana through its deal with Entergy.

The utility also argues that the relatively newer plants will be able to serve all customers if Meta leaves, allowing them to retire older facilities after the 15-year deal.

Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state. Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.

Special Elections Perhaps the most hopeful sign for Democrats right now is their performance in special elections.
Coupled with this year’s election results, this is a signal that Democrats are likely heading into a “blue wave” type of environment next year.
So, currently, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats are underperforming relative to their last big midterm as the out-party.","As 2025 comes to a close, TLP will begin ramping up our coverage of next year’s midterm elections. With just over 11 months to go, all signs point to a favorable environment for Democrats. If the elections were held today, it’s a good bet that they would win back the House of Representatives, as they did the last time Trump was president. They may even flip one or two governor’s seats and a handful of state-legislative chambers.

Currently, however, it’s unclear just how strong a national environment they will enjoy next year, and whether it will be capable of lifting candidates in places that voted for Trump by significant margins in 2024. So today, we’ll take a look at where things stand across several key metrics and determine what we can glean from the data we have.

The 2025 Election Results

One sign of very real optimism for Democrats is the party’s performance in last month’s elections—specifically, in the races for New Jersey and Virginia governor. Yes, both states have voted blue at the top of the ticket for the better part of at least the last decade-and-a-half. But it was the fashion in which Democrats won that impressed:

In both contests, the Democratic candidates won by double digits;

They outperformed the party’s past nominees in both places dating back to 1993 in New Jersey and 1965 in Virginia, and their approximately nine-point over-performance of Kamala Harris was a stronger showing than Democrats enjoyed in 2017 versus Hillary Clinton in these states;

Turnout in each state also surpassed levels seen in the 2022 midterm election, a sign of very real enthusiasm among Democratic voters; and

Especially important: there is evidence in both the exit polls and post-election polling that the Democratic gubernatorial candidates won back small but meaningful shares of 2024 Trump voters.

It’s difficult to extrapolate from these results as we look forward to 2026 to guess what the national House popular vote margin might look like. In 2017, Democrats won the Virginia governor race by nine points and the New Jersey race by 13.5, but the following year they won the House popular vote by a smaller 8.4 points. However, the fact that Democrats’ margins in this year’s contests were larger than they were in 2017 portends a national environment that may well be at least as favorable as the one they experienced in 2018.

Special Elections

Perhaps the most hopeful sign for Democrats right now is their performance in special elections. According to data from election analyst Nathaniel Rakich, the median swing in states and districts with special elections this cycle (relative to the partisan baseline of those places) has been 11 points toward Democrats. In the Trump era, that is the largest swing for either party.

As the above chart shows, Democrats in the Trump era have routinely had an edge in these off-year elections, and yet that has not always translated to success in the subsequent general election. However, the last time the party came close to their current 11-point median swing was a nine-point margin in 2018—when, like now, they were the out-party looking to bounce back in a midterm at a time when Trump was president. Coupled with this year’s election results, this is a signal that Democrats are likely heading into a “blue wave” type of environment next year.

The Generic Ballot

Perhaps the best tool available for gauging how the country is thinking about the midterms outside of actual election results is the generic congressional ballot (or GCB), a poll question asking which party Americans want to see control Congress in the upcoming election. As we have previously noted, these polls in recent midterm cycles have been predictive—as far as 18 months out—of not just which party is likely to have the advantage in the upcoming elections but sometimes even what their margin in the national House popular vote will be.

According to two different trackers, at the time of this year’s November elections the GCB was around three points in favor of Democrats (and their candidates in the most high-profile races far exceeded that). Since then, it has ticked up by a point or two. In another poll conducted by

, likely voters were pushed to pick one party or the other and gave Democrats a 7.6-point edge (53.8 to 46.2).

By comparison, though, around the same time in the 2018 cycle, the GCB already showed an 8.9-point advantage for Democrats. Moreover, the final margin that cycle indeed ended up being an almost identical 8.6 points. So, currently, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats are underperforming relative to their last big midterm as the out-party.

All this also suggests that the GCB has been a better predictor of the midterm picture than the 2025 elections or special elections that precede it. One of these two metrics will have to give come next November. It’s possible the Democrats’ advantages in the GCB will improve before then to match their other performances. But there is a world of difference between a national environment that mirrors this year’s (~D+15) or even 2018’s (D+8.6) versus one that is only D+4.

Trump’s Approval Rating

A quick reminder of how a president’s approval rating affects their party’s midterm prospects:

[One] strong historical predictor of midterm results is the approval rating of the incumbent president, which correlates highly with their party’s seat loss in the House. The only presidents in the polling era whose parties experienced a net seat gain in a midterm election (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) enjoyed approval ratings north of 60 percent (66 percent and 63 percent, respectively). But even a strong approval rating doesn’t guarantee success for a president’s party. […]

In his first term, Trump’s Republicans lost 42 House seats. Given the more constricted House map this time around, it’s very unlikely his party’s losses will be that deep next year, no matter his personal standing. However, a low approval won’t do them any favors…

Indeed, one phenomenon that has remained consistent in politics for decades: a poor approval rating for the president virtually guarantees his party will lose seats.

After a relatively stable period stretching from the beginning of July to mid-October, President Trump’s net approval rating has taken a hit, dropping from -7.6 percent on October 20 to -14.7 as of last week (though it has ticked back up slightly to -13.1 this week). This trend is evident at the issue level as well. On his best issue, immigration, Trump had been holding steady for much of the July to October period, with a net approval rating of around -3 percent. Over the past month, however, that dropped to -8.1 percent, the worst standing of his second term. He is in even worse shape on the economy, as his approval ratings on trade (-17.8), the economy (-21), and especially inflation (-34.1) have all slid.

It is possible that Trump, who has defied political gravity time and again, is now being weighed down by the six-year itch.

Perceptions of the Economy

Much like presidential approval, the state of the economy can have a strong influence on election outcomes. A robust economy isn’t always a guarantee of success for the incumbent party, but a bad one—or at least one that voters believe is bad—almost always creates an unfavorable national environment for them. The problem for Trump and the Republicans is that there are few signs that any metric is better today than it was back in 2018, when they got shellacked, while several key things are worse.

On the surface, the economy today looks somewhat similar to that of 2018. Inflation has come down from its recent surge to just three percent today, though this is still higher than it was seven years ago (2.5). The unemployment rate is around 4.4 percent, up a bit from seven years ago (3.8 percent) but not terribly alarming.

The problem for Republicans, however, is that many voters still do not feel as though things have gotten better under their leadership, and many are worried about the future. According to the University of Michigan, the current consumer sentiment index, which gauges how consumers feel about the state of the economy, is just 53.6. For comparison, that figure was 98.6 in the run-up to the 2018 midterms.

We can see a similar story in a recent (and brutal) Fox News poll. Among the results:

Three-quarters (76 percent) of voters said that economic conditions today are either “only fair” (34 percent) or “poor” (42 percent, a plurality);

A strong plurality (46 percent) said they had been “harmed” by the economic policies of the Trump administration (for context, no more than 43 percent ever said the same about President Biden’s policies in Fox’s polling);

Sixty-two percent blamed Trump rather than Biden (32 percent) for current economic conditions;

A majority (52 percent) said inflation is “not at all” under control;

Majorities said their costs have gone up since one year ago for groceries (85 percent agreed), utilities (78 percent), healthcare (67 percent), housing (66 percent), and gas (54 percent); and

Perhaps worst of all for Republicans: 53 percent of respondents in the poll said they think Democrats have a better plan for making things more affordable than does the GOP (43 percent).

In a September CBS poll, the top words Americans gave to describe the country’s economy were “uncertain” (61 percent) and “struggling” (54 percent). Sixty-seven percent expected prices to go up in the coming months.

These poor economic perceptions have already hurt Republicans in one election. As we discussed in our post-election analysis last month, voters in places like Virginia who believed the economy was not in good shape voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And as we established above, many are souring on Trump’s handling of the economy. According to Nate Silver’s latest aggregates, the president’s net approval on inflation, specifically, is deeply underwater, with just 31.3 percent of Americans approving against fully 65.4 percent disapproving.

If things don’t improve between now and next November, Republicans will likely be in for a world of hurt.

Issue Trust

One of the most important predictors of Trump’s success in last year’s election came in pre-election polling from Gallup, which found that voters saw Republicans as the party “better able to handle the most important problem” facing America. Gallup considered this question to have a strong relationship to past presidential election outcomes—and it turned out to be prescient.

Fast-forward one year and that same indicator has now flipped. Whereas voters before the last election trusted Republicans over Democrats by a margin of 50 to 44 to handle the top issue, they now trust Democrats by four points, 47 to 43.

Polls from David Shor and The Argument have shown a similar reversal in the Democrats’ fortunes. According to the Argument’s Lakshya Jain:

We asked voters about their top two issues and, unsurprisingly, 60 percent of voters ranked “cost of living” as a top-two issue in our survey. But despite Trump’s tariff policy and the continuing frustration with high grocery and consumer-goods prices, Democrats won these cost-of-living voters by just under half a percentage point in our survey.

However, he adds:

Those numbers aren’t good for Republicans, but they’re a lot better than Trump’s nightmarish approvals on those issues are… This suggests that Democrats face real trust problems on the economy that haven’t really gone away yet, despite voters giving Trump exceptionally poor marks for his economic stewardship.

A year from now, Democrats may have a more robust trust advantage over the Republicans on handling the economy, but they still have work to do to restore that trust following four years in with which many voters were left feeling completely dissatisfied with the party’s leadership on this issue.

Overall, the picture looks promising for Democrats ahead of next year. However, we want to end with an obligatory note of caution, specifically, regarding the Senate. In a world in which the national environment mirrors 2018, Democrats can expect to successfully defend all of their Senate seats and likely flip two of Republicans’: Maine and North Carolina. But beyond those, they will be forced to win seats in states that voted for Trump by at least 11 points last year, such as Iowa, Ohio, and Texas. And that means the party will need an even stronger national environment than they had in 2018 to win back the majority.

Jain put together a helpful graphic showing what the outcomes in these types of Senate races would look like if Democrats merely repeat their last “wave” performance:

This is why we at TLP write so often about the need for Democrats to address their structural issues. Winning big in midterm and other off-year elections delivers real benefits for the party—namely, they gain power and subsequently get to wield it. But three of the most important institutions in American politics—the presidency, Senate, and Supreme Court—will become harder to capture over time if they can’t address their longstanding weaknesses and become more competitive in right-leaning places.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yatA!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325a1150-6c29-4557-87d4-e20553adb502_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-12-02 12:03:07.338085

“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.","Maine Blue Dog Democrat Jared Golden is chasing the permitting white whale during his last year in the House, but he doesn’t seem to care if many other Democrats join him.

Golden is the primary co-sponsor of the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776 from Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act review process, including enacting new litigation limits. It could reach the House floor as soon as next week.

But Golden is not necessarily working on convincing lawmakers to his left about the legislation’s merits. In fact, Golden says, he was at times willing to be even more aggressive than Westerman.

It’s that independent streak that has defined his time in the House and helped him secure reelection in a swing district — and that is contributing to his planned departure.

Golden said he would support immediately “deeming projects approved if the government can’t get their ducks in a row in a certain amount of time.”

“I’d rather put the impetus on the government — if you can’t do it in like two years or whatever it is, you move forward,” said the fourth-term lawmaker.

Such thinking has separated Golden from most other Democrats, who want to either preserve NEPA scrutiny of projects or only make modest changes. Golden is not spending too much time on them.

Rep. Adam Gray of California, also a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, was the only other Democrat who voted for the “SPEED Act” in committee during a markup last month. Outside Natural Resources, the bill has a handful of other moderate Democratic co-sponsors.

The day before the markup, wearing blue jeans, a blue flannel shirt and work boots, Golden came across more like a frustrated apolitical outdoorsman than a congressional dealmaker.

Indeed, the 43-year-old Marine veteran’s frustration with Capitol Hill prompted his decision to retire, writing, “Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son.”

Looking ahead at his last year at the Capitol, Golden offered light scorn for just about everyone, from his fellow Democrats who he says don’t understand the NEPA bill to Republican strategists who don’t seem to want Democrats to support the legislation anyway.

“I want to see something get done,” he said. “So I’m going to ignore their political desires and think more about how do we show momentum in the Senate.”

Westerman wants a vote on the NEPA bill before the end of the year. He can probably make it pass the Republican-controlled House with ease. The big negotiations, Golden says, will be in the Senate, where legislation needs a filibuster-proof majority.

“Westerman knows that his bill is not going to become law without working with Democrats, but they’re also not going to negotiate if they feel like Democrats aren’t sincere in wanting to get to ‘yes,'” Golden said.

Golden did help negotiate a bipartisan amendment — passed during the markup — to prevent the president from canceling permitted projects.

Key senators on permitting, like Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), have made similar demands in response to the Trump administration’s attack on renewable energy projects.

Still, many Natural Resources Committee Democrats wanted more guarantees for renewable energy. Some call the legislation a giveaway to fossil fuels. Members like Democrat Scott Peters of California have been working on finding compromise between both camps.

Golden says he’s “not hostile” to renewable energy but thinks some Democrats tend to ignore the fine print, pointing to offshore wind projects’ impacts on fishermen, which he called the “lifeblood of the entire coastline.” He also has concerns about Maine’s rush to build commercial solar energy, including ramifications for farmland.

There could be changes to the legislation when it hits the House floor. But those amendments would probably not be favorable to Democrats.

Golden said that “based on some conversations I’ve had,” Republican leaders will “probably try and pull the bill right.” “Maybe Bruce convinces them not to do that,” Golden said, referring to Westerman.

“I’m usually of the mind, on any given issue, half the people that are toeing the party line in either party, it’s actually not what they fully believe,” Golden said. “If you could remove all the various political pressures, they would be closer to where my head is at.”

Golden said he hasn’t talked about the NEPA bill with the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, ranking member Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.

House Natural Resources ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a progressive, is often on the opposite side of Golden on many energy and environmental issues, but Huffman says the lines of communication are open.

“Obviously Jared Golden and I have different politics. But I have appreciated him as a straight shooter. He doesn’t blindside you. He communicates with me and my staff in a way I appreciate, and that doesn’t always happen,” said Huffman.

Members on both sides — including Huffman — insist they’re open to a broad, bipartisan deal on permitting. They’ve been saying that for years now.

“The R’s are going to have to decide if they want to take credit for getting something done,” Golden said. “And the Dems will have to decide if they want a share of that. Or if it’s just going to be like, ‘Oh no, we’re going to win the House in ’26 and the White House in ’28. But, oh shit, the margins are tight.‘”

Golden added, “You could see how in another world we’re just like sitting here having this conversation in 2030.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/94/33/f3b6d128482eae05de37e0ffcd38/u-s-congress-41832.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 10:02:42.734607

The U.S., the world’s top LNG exporter, shipped 10.9 million metric tonnes last month, up from 10.1 mmt in October despite having one fewer day in the month, according to LSEG data.

Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. LNG exporter, boosted shipments to 4.6 mmt from its two Texas plants, compared with 4.1 mmt in October. Venture Global LNG, the second-largest exporter, held steady at 3 mmt in November, LSEG ship-tracking data showed.

LNG plants typically operate more efficiently in cooler conditions. Average temperatures along the Gulf Coast were about 8 degrees Fahrenheit lower in November than in October, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

Surging LNG exports pushed U.S. natural gas demand for liquefaction to a record 18 billion cubic feet per day in November. Daily demand topped 19 bcfd for the first time last week. Henry Hub gas prices averaged $4.47 per mmBtu in November, up from $3.36 in October.

EUROPE REMAINS KEY MARKET

Europe received 70% of U.S. LNG exports in November, or 7.5 mmt, up from 69% in October. Turkey emerged as a major buyer, taking 12 cargoes totaling 0.9 mmt, compared with just one cargo in October.

Exports to Asia fell to 1.75 mmt, or 16% of the total, from 1.96 mmt in October, as spot demand in Northeast Asia remained weak. Latin America received 0.66 mmt, slightly higher than October, while Egypt bought 0.84 mmt amid domestic supply challenges.

European benchmark Dutch Title Transfer Facility prices averaged $10.40 per million British thermal units in November, down from $10.88 in October. The Japan Korea Marker averaged $11.25, up from $11.11.

“The arbitrage opportunity for U.S. LNG cargoes to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope remains shut, which will lead to a continued influx of flexible U.S. cargoes into Northwest Europe,” LSEG said in a note.

“Environmental Air Systems’ expansion will create high-quality, skilled trade jobs right here in Randolph County and ensure our state remains a top destination for innovative manufacturing.","North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced that Environmental Air Systems, LLC, a leading volumetric modular manufacturer of HVAC infrastructure, will create 300 jobs in Randolph County. The company will invest approximately $20 million to establish a new sub-assembly production operation in Asheboro.

“North Carolina continues to be a leader in advanced manufacturing, and Environmental Air Systems’ expansion to Randolph County reflects the strength and talent of our workforce,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This project will create hundreds of new jobs, support local families, and strengthen our state’s role in innovative industrial solutions.”

Environmental Air Systems (EAS), a subsidiary of Comfort Systems USA, Inc., will expand its operations to meet growing demand for specialized prefabricated equipment for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in critical facilities. Operating in the Triad region of the state since 1953, the company’s new facility will produce sub-assemblies for industries including mission-critical, pharmaceutical, data center, semiconductor, and healthcare. The site will be 300,000 square feet of manufacturing space to serve both regional and national markets.

“EAS is proud to announce the continued expansion of our operations in North Carolina,” said Allen Absher, President of EAS - Manufacturing. “For over 70 years, we have been a dedicated part of the business community in this state and are fortunate to be in a position to generate more local employment opportunities. EAS is steadfast in its commitment to provide our customers with state-of-the-art, complex projects and to build an enduring legacy for our employees.”

“EAS’s decision to expand into Asheboro demonstrates the growing demand for North Carolina’s skilled workforce and business-friendly environment,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “This project will drive economic growth and enhance our state’s competitiveness in advanced modular manufacturing.”

These new jobs could create a potential annual payroll impact of more than $16.5 million for the local economy.

Environmental Air Systems’ expansion in North Carolina will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $732 million. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $3,289,000, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

“This project is a huge win for Randolph County and North Carolina,” said N.C. Senator Dave Craven. “Environmental Air Systems’ expansion will create high-quality, skilled trade jobs right here in Randolph County and ensure our state remains a top destination for innovative manufacturing. Our local high schools and community colleges are already well-equipped to train the next generation of EAS employees, providing those students a clear pathway for success and future employment.”

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
The post The EV Truck Reality Check and Why Edison Motors’ Hybrid Might Be What Actually Works appeared first on FreightWaves.","I’m a diesel guy. Specifically, I’m a CAT guy. That’s not nostalgia talking or resistance to change, it’s 25-plus years of experience knowing what keeps trucks moving and freight delivered when conditions get ugly. Diesel has always given me peace of mind because it works. You can find fuel anywhere. The technology is proven. When something breaks, mechanics know how to fix it. In an industry where downtime means lost revenue and missed commitments, that reliability isn’t optional.

So when the EV conversation started dominating trucking discussions, my initial reaction was skepticism bordering on dismissal. Battery-electric trucks looked like solutions engineered by people who’d never operated in conditions where equipment failure has real consequences. The range limitations, charging infrastructure gaps, and operational disruptions seemed like deal-breakers that no amount of government subsidies or manufacturer marketing could overcome.

Then I started paying attention to what Edison Motors was building in British Columbia, and I realized something important: EVs can work in trucking if you actually engineer them for how trucking operates, rather than forcing trucking to adapt to technology limitations.

But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.

Are renewable energy consultants in demand?

There’s strong evidence that demand for renewable energy consultants, along with related roles within the industry, is rising. Here are some examples showing why these professionals are increasingly in demand:

The global market for renewable energy consulting is expected to reach $1.63 billion in 2026.

With the increasing demand for renewable energy professionals worldwide, many companies are facing a skills shortage due to a lower supply of qualified individuals across the globe. This means that there is higher demand for consultants with the relevant skills.

Governments and companies are pushing towards net zero targets and decarbonisation goals, requiring a larger need for consultants to guide the green energy transition.

The renewable energy industry comprises of many different areas such as solar, wind, biomass and other clean technologies, meaning that specialists are required in several different fields.

Renewable energy consulting now makes up more than 30% of the US energy consulting market, highlighting a major shift in the industry, with businesses increasingly looking beyond basic compliance and focusing on meaningful environmental leadership.

What is the salary of a renewable energy consultant?

The salary of a renewable energy consultant varies widely and one of the biggest factors is experience. At the early stages, such as internships, student roles or entry-level energy positions, salaries typically sit around £24,000-£30,000. After graduation, junior or early-career consultants usually move into the £28,000-£38,000 range, with roles in major cities such as London tending to offer salaries at the upper end.

As consultants gain more experience and begin managing their own projects, salaries rise accordingly. Mid-level consultants with roughly 3-8 years of experience commonly earn between £37,000 and £53,000, depending on their technical skills and responsibilities. Senior and principal consultants, who may oversee teams, deliver high-level client advice or manage large portfolios, typically fall in the £45,000-£60,000 bracket, with some extending into the £70,000+ range based on the size of the firm and complexity of the work.

At the top end, consultants who move into director-level positions, specialist expert roles or even consultancy ownership often earn £80,000 and above. However, salaries at every stage are strongly influenced by location, employer type and specialism – London markets, large engineering or energy firms and high-demand niches (such as offshore wind or energy storage) generally command higher pay.

Certifications, technical expertise and the scope of responsibilities also accelerate progression and earning potential within the sector.

Multistate

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general succeeded in protecting four federal agencies from elimination by Executive Order. The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the coalition’s motion for summary judgement, permanently enjoining the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general announced a suit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in response to new restrictions on Continuum of Care grant programs. Those restrictions will reduce the grant funds available for permanent housing and housing continuity programs. The coalition asserts that HUD’s proposed changes are unlawful because HUD did not engage in the appropriate rulemaking procedures and did not receive congressional approval for the changes.

A multistate coalition of 17 attorneys general filed a comment letter with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) opposing a new rule that would relax the gradual phaseout of HFC use created by the AIM Act. The coalition argued that EPA’s new HFC standards would allow industries to reintroduce an extremely powerful greenhouse gas back into the environment.

A coalition of eight attorneys general entered a settlement with Greystar Management after alleging that Greystar used RealPage’s AI software to raise rent prices in violation of antitrust law. The settlement requires Greystar Management to pay $7 million and stop using any third-party algorithmic pricing models.

California

Attorney General Rob Bonta reached a settlement agreement with Jam City regarding the company’s alleged failure to provide consumers with a method to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The settlement agreement requires Jam City to pay $1.4 million and prohibits Jam City from selling the personal information of consumers aged 13-16 without their express consent.

Colorado

Attorney General Phil Weiser entered into a settlement agreement with Instawork, an app based staffing agency in Colorado. The Attorney General alleged that Instawork misclassified employees as independent contractors and failed to pay required unemployment insurance premiums. The settlement is the first of its kind under the Colorado False Claims Act.

Michigan

Apparently the new Porsche Cayenne Electric has already set a couple of records for the brand.

It is the most powerful Porsche ever built, and over 10,000 people have already registered their interest to buy one.

But there’s also another ‘record’ that Porsche never mentioned before.

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

The one thing Porsche never told us about Cayenne Electric

Porsche has just opened order books for the new Cayenne Electric in the United States and has also launched the online configurator.

According to the German automaker, over 110,000 users made unique builds using the online configurator, which is apparently a record for Porsche.

Furthermore, and let’s face it this is the part that truly matters, a significant percentage of online configurator users are ready to put their money where their online click was, so to speak.

Because they also said 10,500 buyers have registered their interest.

The company added something else that’s interesting, chiefly because it hasn’t exactly been advertised until now.

Apparently, the 1,139-horsepower Cayenne Electric is the most customizable Porsche ever.

The manufacturer never mentioned that before, but this is a bigger deal than people think.

When it comes to luxury vehicles, which is new Porsche Cayenne Electric definitely is, customization is a key selling point.

That’s why customization programs like Mulliner by Bentley and Q by Aston Martin are now as popular as ever.

The EV market keeps sending mixed signals

The EV market is still sending mixed (and inconsistent) signals.

Every time we think we found evidence of one thing, then something that proves the exact opposite happens.

For now, it seems there’s one universal truth: EVs are in demand.

But with a lot of caveats.

One of said caveats is that automakers are struggling to make EVs as profitable as gas cars, and the other is that there are certain segments where EVs don’t really work.

Dodge, for example, is likely doing a 180 on the Charger Daytona and is potentially bringing back an internal combustion version.

But Porsche doesn’t seem to have that problem.

Welcome back from the Thanksgiving holiday (for those of you in the United States). This edition of Projects Weekly highlights RWE’s newly commissioned 200 MW PV + 200 MWh storage Stoneridge Solar project in Texas. Plus, Wisconsin utilities received approval to add solar + storage and other renewables to the state’s energy supply. Additionally, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) in northeastern Washington and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) are collaborating to deploy microgrids across the reservation. Finally, a Minnesota school district is switching to solar energy through a partnership with All Energy Solar.

RWE energizes solar + storage project in Texas

RWE has commissioned its Stoneridge Solar project, delivering 200 MW of PV and 100 MW (200 MWh) of battery storage Milam County, Texas.

“Stoneridge Solar is a great example of the power of local partnership and the positive role energy projects play in economic stimulation,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “We are helping Texas and the nation secure their energy future with scalable, homegrown energy while also delivering meaningful benefits to communities across America’s heartland.”

Cool factor: Stoneridge Solar created more 200 construction jobs and now supports permanent operational roles. The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives. From funding renovations at Thorndale Elementary School to partnering with the local volunteer fire department, RWE is helping communities like Milam County remain resilient and prosperous.

RWE’s energy capacity across the United States has grown to more than 11 GW, reinforcing the company’s leadership in delivering reliable and affordable power to homes and businesses.

MGE adds solar + storage and other renewables to Wisconsin energy supply

Wisconsin utility companies have partnered to add more renewable energy to the state’s energy supply. Madison Gas and Electric (MGE), in partnership with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), subsidiaries of WEC Energy Group, received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to purchase solar capacity, battery storage and wind capacity from four renewable energy projects. MGE will own 35 MW of solar, 5 MW of battery storage and nearly 18 MW of wind in total from the different projects.

“The approval of these projects is another important step in our ongoing effort to reduce carbon emissions, increase our use of cost-effective renewable generation and advance new technologies to benefit all customers,” said Jeff Keebler, chairman, president and CEO of MGE. “With our current plans, by 2030, we will have added more than 40 renewable generation and battery storage projects since 2015, totaling more than 750 MW, propelling us toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050.”

Cool factor: MGE will own a 10% share of four renewable energy projects, including two solar projects, the Saratoga Solar Energy Center and Ursa Solar Park. The Saratoga Solar Energy Center will include a 150 MW solar array and 50 MW battery energy storage system located in Wood County. MGE will own 15 MW of solar capacity and 5 MW of battery storage. The solar array and battery energy storage system are both expected to start serving customers in 2028. The Ursa Solar Park is a 200 MW solar facility that will be located in Columbia County. MGE will own 20 MW of solar capacity. The solar array is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

The company will also own shares in two wind farm projects. The Badger Hollow Wind Farm is a 112 MW project in Iowa and Grant counties. MGE will own 11.2 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027. The Whitetail Wind Farm is a 67 MW wind farm will be located in Grant County. MGE will own 6.7 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

Colville Tribes seek energy sovereignty through microgrids

The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) announced a landmark collaboration to advance tribal energy sovereignty and resilience through the design and deployment of multiple microgrids across the reservation in northeastern Washington. The program represents a significant step toward improving reliability, reducing outages, and providing long-term energy independence for the Colville Tribes. The initiative is backed by federal and state grant awards and addresses vulnerabilities such as winter storm disruptions and wildfire risks.

OATI is delivering professional project design and development services, hardware, and its advanced GridMind platform to support the microgrids through resource management and market integration. Planned sites include:

Nespelem HQ Campus (Lucy F. Covington Government Center): Rooftop solar PV, battery energy storage, EV charging, and microgrid controls, with an expansion to create a full campus resiliency hub.

Paschal Sherman Indian School (PSIS) Community: Microgrid design to support education and community resiliency.

Keller and Inchelium Districts: Additional distributed energy resources and microgrid infrastructure for local resilience.

Cool factor: The Colville Tribes microgrid program is rooted in the principle of energy sovereignty — the right of tribes to produce, deliver, and manage energy on their own lands. With the Colville Reservation served by multiple utilities offering varied levels of service, the ability to self-generate electricity provides resiliency and reliability for vulnerable communities and ensures critical services, including healthcare, commerce, and housing, remain powered during outages. Colville Tribes may also leverage the microgrids to offer additional grid benefits to local utilities and/or engage in energy markets as they evolve and grow.

“Since the Colville Reservation is in a remote location, subject to natural events like winter storms and fires, it has always been difficult for us to sustain a reliable supply of power,” said Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. “Our hope is that this microgrid technology will not only keep our lights on, but will also position us for new economic opportunities.”

Future expansions envision integration with gaming operations and potential data centers, supported by tribal-owned utility and telecom infrastructure. With multiple microgrids underway, Colville Tribes is establishing itself as a leader in tribal energy innovation. The partnership not only secures reliable power but also positions the tribe for new economic opportunities, including data center hosting and advanced commercial development on tribal lands.

Minnesota school district switches to solar energy with All Energy Solar

Earlier this year, Minneota Public Schools made a powerful move to solar energy for its high school’s electricity needs. All Energy Solar, a leading solar installer in the Midwest headquartered in St Paul, Minnesota, helped the school make that transition with assistance from a state program designed for just this type of project.

“The school’s solar energy system has a capacity of 47.56 kW and consists of 82 panels installed on the gymnasium’s rooftop,” said Les Engler, Minneota facilities manager. “The system has been working very well for the school with the help of All Energy Solar.”

In 2021, the Minnesota State Legislature launched the Solar for Schools grant program for all school districts across the state. This program aims to encourage the installation of solar energy systems for educational institutions, while also providing an opportunity to incorporate renewable energy awareness and instruction into the schools’ curriculum.

Cool factor: Minneota Public Schools, a Kindergarten through 12th grade school district located in southwest Minnesota, is a beacon of academic excellence. With impressive rankings, including No. 17 in the state for State Assessment Proficiency and No. 19 in State Assessment Performance, coupled with a remarkable 100% graduation rate, the school’s commitment to educational excellence is unwavering. Upon learning more about the Solar for Schools program in 2024, Minneota Schools pursued a project as a forward-thinking solution that benefits both the environment and their community.

There are currently three science classes that are incorporating solar energy into their curriculum. Each class utilizes an innovative app that enables them to monitor the new array’s solar inverters and even individual solar panel output. This hands-on experience not only enriches their understanding of renewable energy but also empowers them to engage with real-world technology in a meaningful way.

A similar study by the Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.
When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted.
Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, which manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by the Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal employees who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land-health assessments of large parcels to help determine whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM: About 1 in 10 rangeland staffers left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and increasing wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land-health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth.”

TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SHRINKING OVERSIGHT, ProPublica and High Country News toured federal grazing allotments in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state.In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land-health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Each year for the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve habitat health and allow it to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

AFTER A CENTURY OF INTENSE GRAZING WORE DOWN the public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating reviews every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land-management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land-health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded due to livestock, at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than these numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Of the acreage the BLM had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land-management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — integral to healthy ecosystems — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

BLM employees also said that in some permit reviews and land-health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The result, employees said, was watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

SOME RANCHERS ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENVIRONMENTAL impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency. There’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off-limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”

For decades, beef producers have relied on visible performance indicators such as body condition, weight gain, and reproductive success. Yet, one of the biggest drivers of profitability has remained hidden: individual animal methane emissions and what they reveal about feed efficiency.

Agscent Air is changing that. The technology provides real-time, on-farm methane measurement that enables producers to identify their most efficient animals, validate management interventions, and build more profitable, low-emission herds.

At Macka’s Black Angus Beef, producer Robert Mackenzie is proving that methane monitoring is more than an environmental compliance exercise – it is a productivity tool that delivers results directly to the bottom line.

The feed efficiency connection

Methane emissions and feed efficiency are closely linked. Cattle with lower residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of how efficiently an animal uses feed for growth or production, produce 15–25% less methane than their less efficient counterparts.1,2

This is not a coincidence. Methane represents lost feed energy – so animals that emit less methane convert more nutrients into growth. The performance and cost implications are significant.

Cattle with a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 5.4:1 are more efficient — this means they need 5.4 kg of feed to gain 1 kg of body weight. These efficient cattle cost about AUD $115 less to finish and reach market 26 days sooner, saving an extra AUD $143 per head. In dairy systems, efficient cows can also save around AUD $675 per year in feed costs.

The implications extend throughout the operation. As Robert Mackenzie explained, “You eat less, you produce less methane.” This simple principle translates to “better feed conversion, which means lower costs, reduced pasture pressure, faster growth, and improved margins.”

The challenge lies in identifying which animals possess these valuable traits – and that is where methane monitoring becomes essential.

Making measurement practical

So how can producers access this critical data without disrupting their operations? Until recently, accurately measuring livestock methane required expensive respiration chambers or specialist research facilities. Agscent’s technology eliminates those barriers. The Agscent Air GHG systems use portable, sensor-based monitoring that integrates naturally into existing farm infrastructure, providing data on:

• Individual animal methane output

Variation across the herd

Response to feed and management changes

Genetic differences in efficiency

Macka’s Beef has been using the Agscent X Optiweigh system to validate a mineral supplement programme. “We developed a baseline with Himalayan rock salt and we got the animal to go into the Optiweigh X Agscent machine,” Mackenzie explained. The system is measuring methane output before and after introducing his ECO2 Feed mineral supplement. With reliable measurement now possible, the question becomes: what can producers actually do with this data?

Beyond compliance: Data that drives profitability

While sustainability credentials and carbon credits add value, Mackenzie sees the real payoff in productivity insights. Methane data helps producers:

• Identify superior genetics within herds

• Validate feed additives and dietary programmes

• Evaluate pasture species and management decisions

By 2026, Macka’s Black Angus plans to integrate methane measurement into its breeding programme, using verified data to select stud bulls and cows that combine genetic strength with environmental efficiency.

This genetic information has immediate commercial value – enhancing breeding decisions, marketing efficiency-verified genetics, and building long-term herd improvement strategies.

The measurement journey

For producers beginning their methane monitoring journey, Mackenzie recommends starting with the basics:

1. Establish baselines using carbon calculators and existing data

2. Identify priorities for emissions and efficiency improvement

3. Implement measurement with technology partners like Agscent

4. Test interventions such as feed additives or genetic selection

5. Refine and scale successful practices across the herd

Competitive advantage and the future of sustainable beef

Building on this foundation of measurement and improvement, early adopters are positioning themselves for a changing market landscape. As consumer demand for sustainable beef continues to rise and carbon accounting becomes standard, verified low-methane systems will offer a strong competitive edge.

Producers adopting these technologies early gain the ability to:

• Optimise operations before regulation mandates it

• Build premium, data-backed market positions

• Access carbon credit revenue streams

• Operate using insights other producers lack

“Sustainability means leaving the land better than we found it,” Mackenzie said. “But it’s also becoming a licence to produce – we’ll be required to become more sustainable whether we like it or not.”

The bottom line

Macka’s Black Angus Beef experience shows that the technologies reducing emissions are the same ones driving profitability. Methane measurement enables smarter decisions – whether through identifying efficient genetics, validating feed strategies, or refining herd composition.

“You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” Mackenzie concluded. His operation proves the point: methane measurement isn’t just about emissions compliance – it’s about unlocking hidden productivity potential that’s always been there.

The question for beef producers isn’t whether to measure methane. It’s whether they can afford to keep making breeding, feeding, and management decisions without understanding this critical dimension of herd performance. As sustainability requirements tighten and competition intensifies, the answer becomes increasingly clear.

The nickel market in India is expected to grow rapidly, with projections estimated to exceed $33 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.8%. Nickel is a crucial element in stainless steel manufacturing, as it enhances its corrosion resistance and durability, properties vital for infrastructure, construction, chemical processing, and marine applications. Simultaneously, nickel is indispensable in battery manufacturing, especially for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), with its high energy density critical for improving battery life and efficiency.

India’s renewable energy targets — aiming for 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 — and accelerated EV adoption are driving unprecedented demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. Lithium demand alone is projected to increase tenfold by 2030, while copper demand is expected to more than double, highlighting the mineral-rich future ahead for India’s energy transition and industrial modernisation.

Bridging the demand-supply gap:

Despite the promising projections, India produces only a minimal amount of domestic nickel. The country sources most of its nickel from foreign suppliers, including Norway, Japan, Canada, Indonesia, and China. This import dependency exposes the Indian players to risks of global price volatility, geopolitical tensions, a new coalition of countries, and supply chain disruptions. For example, fluctuations in nickel prices or interruptions in supply can increase costs for battery manufacturers, potentially slowing EV production and undermining India’s clean energy transition plans. The projected nickel demand for EV batteries is expected to surge by more than 600% by 2040, intensifying the urgency to secure stable supplies.

The stainless-steel industry in India, which consumes roughly 70% of domestically available nickel, also faces pressures from unstable import prices. These cost fluctuations can negatively impact the competitiveness of Indian stainless-steel products both in domestic and global markets, making it harder for manufacturers to plan and price their goods efficiently. Moreover, environmental regulations and sustainability concerns tied to nickel mining and refining, and its overwhelming control by China, add to the complexity of securing reliable, ethically produced nickel supplies.

To address these multifaceted challenges, the Indian government launched the National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM) in 2025. This program represents a cornerstone effort to increase domestic exploration and production of critical minerals like nickel. More than Rs 34,000 crore of investments through 2031 is expected to boost exploration, downstream processing, and mineral recycling capacities (targeting 270 kilotonnes annually). (4) The mission also seeks to establish technology hubs and Centres of Excellence to foster innovation and development in the sector. To complement domestic production growth, the government is also striving to diversify international sources to mitigate geopolitical risks and ensure continuous supply chains.

Strategic initiatives:

Recent strategic industry moves further underscore efforts to decrease import reliance. After Vedanta Nico acquired Nicomet in 2021, the company entered into a strategic memorandum of understanding (MoU) with AEsir in 2024 to become the preferred supplier of nickel, a vital raw material for AEsir’s advanced battery technology. This collaboration builds on a broader partnership where Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta’s sister company and a leading zinc producer, supports the supply of zinc for these nickel-zinc batteries.

Meanwhile, Odisha is recognised for its substantial nickel reserves estimated at around 175 million tons–Jaipur (140 million tonnes), Mayurbhanj (27 million tonnes), and Keonjhar (8 million tonnes) — positioning it as a key state for future nickel mining and processing growth.

Despite these proactive steps, India’s heavy dependency on nickel imports remains a primary challenge. India imported nearly $1.26 billion during 2024, according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade. Unpredictable pricing, supply security concerns, and the need to comply with ascending environmental standards threaten to slow India’s industrial growth trajectory and delay its ambitious renewable energy and technology modernization goals.

The way forward

As India accelerates its journey towards a sustainable and self-reliant clean future, it will call for a comprehensive and forward-looking policy framework focused on the entire mineral lifecycle. And Vedanta Nico will play a critical role by ensuring a steady, high-quality supply of nickel—an essential metal for advanced battery technologies and green infrastructure, turning the challenges of global supply uncertainties into sustainable opportunities for national progress.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nickel.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:51.684230

The 16 researchers identified by NOTUS who left the EPA for the private sector were on the cutting edge of their field.","The country’s highest-achieving scientists have been leaving the Environmental Protection Agency in droves for the private sector.

It’s exactly what President Donald Trump’s administration said it was going to do: shrink the agency’s scientific research apparatus. It’s also an outcome that could come back to bite the EPA in times of crisis, departing researchers say.

NOTUS identified 16 researchers, all with doctoral or master’s degrees, many of them experts in using machine learning to speed up the identification and analysis of toxic chemicals, who have left the EPA for the private lab UL Research Institutes.

Most of these scientists worked for the EPA’s much-vaunted Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, tasked with developing ways to quickly figure out chemical toxicity.

This was a team that advised crews dispatched to East Palestine, Ohio, where a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in 2023, causing massive environmental damage. One of the departing researchers said that the center had an “on call” scientist for the field teams in East Palestine.

The EPA has said that the agency should only be conducting research that is required by law for it to fulfill its duties. The agency has eliminated its Office of Research and Development, or ORD, and reassigned scientists to other offices focused on regulatory responsibilities.

“The unfortunate reality is that the work many people in ORD were doing was disconnected from our statutory obligations,” the agency said in response to NOTUS’ questions about the loss of the EPA researchers.

Departing scientists say that misses the impact of their work. The team of computational scientists was useful in the immediate aftermath of the East Palestine disaster because it had the tools to very quickly generate safety and toxicity data. The research at the Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure was intended to inform regulatory decision-making “more quickly after a chemical is discovered in the environment,” a former EPA researcher who went to UL said.

UL Research Institutes, a Georgia-based nonprofit lab, is in the process of expanding into a new chemical insights lab in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park — the same place where the EPA’s largest office in the country is located, and where most of these researchers worked previously. It has been hiring almost exclusively former EPA scientists for the last several months, according to a review of their new hire announcements.

The lab is part of a “strategic expansion” intended to “provide additional access to top-tier talent,” a UL spokesperson told NOTUS.

Still, losing the center and so many of its researchers to the private sector may make it harder for the EPA to respond quickly to chemical events, the former EPA researcher at UL said.

Their team at the EPA didn’t just respond to emergencies; it also responded in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of a new mysterious chemical in the environment — like when GenX, an unregulated PFAS chemical, was discovered in the drinking water in eastern North Carolina in 2017, the same researcher said.

Advocates for public research say the public is less likely to benefit from private sector endeavors, no matter how good a lab’s intentions are.

“There’s not as much power, if you will, for research coming from a private lab or an NGO, because the government is the final decider,” said Kyla Bennett, the science policy director at the advocacy organization Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “When EPA does a draft risk assessment and they accept comments, they can and do ignore comments from academia, from NGOs and from private institutions.”

The Trump administration rejects these concerns.

“EPA has the resources it needs and remains well-equipped to respond to emergencies,” an agency spokesperson said. “We have excellent staff throughout the agency who will ensure that this type of science and research supporting our statutory responsibilities continues, and baseless gossip claiming otherwise should not be the source of your reporting.”

For the federal government’s top environmental and chemical researchers, the writing has been on the wall since June, when the EPA announced it would be closing down its independent scientific research arm.

The Trump administration has embraced the privatization of scientific research and pushed to move research out of the federal government wherever possible. The president’s chief science adviser has said that the private sector should take over funding more science, and the government should be doing “basic” research that serves the national interest.

The EPA shut its independent research office — which was its largest arm until now — and began to hand out reassignments to its scientists in September. Many researchers chose to leave the federal government rather than abandon their work.

“What we’re seeing is a drive to fundamentally change what is the role of the federal government in the U.S. and push to no longer have the federal government cover certain functions,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who was the deputy administrator in charge of the Office of Research and Development during the Biden administration and spent 40 years at the EPA.

The EPA continues to insist that, despite the elimination of an independent research arm, it still plans to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” according to its announcement about the shuttering of ORD.

The 16 researchers identified by NOTUS who left the EPA for the private sector were on the cutting edge of their field.

“ORD was the focal point for that, nationally,” said Thomas Burke, a former EPA assistant administrator for ORD during President Barack Obama’s administration. “We’ve lost that, as a resource to the scientific community.”

One of the researchers, Russell Thomas, who led the Center for Computational Toxicology in Exposure, won the American Medical Association’s award for outstanding government service in 2024, for transforming how the health impacts of chemicals are evaluated.

“In the past, using animal testing to evaluate chemicals for endocrine disruption, EPA was only able to evaluate about 70 chemicals over 25 years, at a cost of approximately $1 million per chemical. By contrast, using approaches developed by Thomas’s team, over 2,000 chemicals were evaluated in three years for a cost of just $30,000 per chemical,” the American Medical Association wrote in 2024.

Thomas declined to comment for this story.

NOTUS found that at least four of the 16 researchers now employed by UL were hired or paid under EPA’s Title 42 program, which was designed to incentivize the world’s top researchers to work for the government instead of the private sector.

Although the full list of scientists hired until the Title 42 program is not public, NOTUS also identified at least three other researchers hired under that program who left the EPA in the last three months to work in the private sector.

“We just destroyed the top leadership, we lost the best and the brightest of the emerging stars, and they cut off the pipeline for the future,” Burke said. Last year, Burke, who now works as a professor at Johns Hopkins University, produced a congressionally required report on the benefits of the EPA’s Title 42 program that detailed the groundbreaking scientific talent the agency attracted through the program.

Many of the researchers now working for UL hope that they will be able to continue doing the work they were doing at EPA. UL is investing heavily in expanding its chemical safety research.

“I’m happy they were able to find a job and to be able to do the work that they were trained to do,” said Orme-Zavaleta. “But the bottom line is, who benefits now from this work? The American public is no longer the direct beneficiary.”

AI has been accelerating sustainability and energy goals particularly well over the last few years.

Now, in an effort to prioritise this area, Google has introduced its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT) to help manufacturers improve efficiency while reducing both operational costs and emissions.

The EAT platform is designed to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or expensive on-site support.

The primary function of the EAT is to lower the barriers to entry for energy efficiency projects. While manufacturers can realise considerable cost savings and emissions cuts through such improvements, many are hindered by challenges.

These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for new projects and a lack of in-house energy management knowledge. Such obstacles often mean that straightforward high-impact projects are not implemented.

Breaking down barriers with a self-service energy tool

To address these challenges, Google has developed EAT as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It aims to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress on cost reduction and climate action initiatives.

The tool delivers actionable insights without demanding prior energy management expertise from the user. By inputting basic facility data, users can generate customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers and lighting.

Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Google, explained the motivation behind the project on LinkedIn.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,” she writes.

The tool is intended to foster collaboration and extend positive impacts throughout the value chain. It highlights projects with the highest potential for cost and carbon reduction and enables assessment across multiple facilities to help prioritise investment.

Data-driven audits and collaborative supply chains

Google’s objective with the EAT is to provide an accessible data-driven method for identifying potential energy efficiency projects. The platform offers analyses that are typically found in an ""ASHRAE Level 1"" standard energy audit.

The tool’s calculation methodology and comprehensive data were developed by engineering consulting firms, transforming what is often a complex and costly process into a simple and collaborative solution.

To support its adoption in key manufacturing regions, the platform is available in Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese and English.

Data security and confidentiality are key considerations. The EAT is built and managed by a third-party organisation and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets strict privacy and security standards.

Individual supplier data remains secure and suppliers retain control over which partners they collaborate with and what summary data, such as total potential savings, they choose to share.

Integrating EAT into Google’s wider sustainability strategy

This initiative is part of Google’s broader strategy for sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain. Google, which is one of the world's largest corporate buyers of clean energy, is also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal and grid-enhancing technologies.

In 2020, Google announced its goal to achieve net zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030, supported by an ambition to operate entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy.

Google's own data centres are designed for high efficiency, with its AI chips becoming more power-efficient over time.

Google also focuses on designing out waste, boosting material reuse and pursuing a more sustainable supply chain. This new tool extends that ethos to its partners.

“The journey to a more sustainable future is a shared one,” Google writes.

It adds: “By equipping our partners with the right resources, we can accelerate progress, reduce costs and build a more resilient and sustainable supply chain for everyone. The Energy Assessment tool helps pave the way for our mutual success.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bae9b70651cbbf64a9871f1775abe5c4:c8e7a3964458faf437575d4d84836f20/alphabet-google-cloud.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 04:58:20.286668

German-backed solar factory could shift Ghana from importer to regional producer, anchoring a new industrial base for West Africa’s green economy.

Renewables expand across Africa, but Ghana’s gains remain incremental; governance, tariffs and utility finances will determine the pace of real impact.

Ghana is moving closer to a modest but symbolically important milestone in its transition toward cleaner energy, with roughly 111 GWh of additional solar-based electricity expected by 2026. The projection, drawn from a recent African Development Bank (AfDB) implementation report, stems from the ongoing Ghana Mini Grid and Solar PV Net Metering Project, a US$85 million investment designed to expand rural electrification and reduce the country’s dependence on hydro and thermal generation.

Although the initiative will not significantly alter the national power balance, it represents a calculated effort to ease pressure on a sector long constrained by fuel-price exposure, liquidity stress among state-owned utilities, and the political sensitivity surrounding consumer tariffs.

Ghana’s electricity landscape continues to grapple with structural weaknesses that undermine performance and investor confidence. Chronic cash flow imbalances at the Electricity Company of Ghana, along with the persistent gap between cost-recovery requirements and politically driven tariff decisions, limit utilities' ability to invest sustainably. Technical losses remain high, and the system’s dependence on imported fuel exposes the economy to international market volatility. With electricity demand rising steadily—often by more than 4% per year—the government’s ambition to achieve universal access by 2030 has heightened the urgency to diversify supply sources and strengthen network resilience. Renewables, excluding hydro, currently account for less than 1% of Ghana’s generation mix, leaving the country behind frontrunners such as Kenya and South Africa.

Within this context, the AfDB-backed programme seeks to accelerate supply diversification. It foresees installing 67.8 MW of new solar generation capacity through the deployment of 35 mini-grids targeting lakeside and island communities, as well as 12,000 rooftop systems for households, small businesses, and public facilities. The Bank’s November 2025 review rates progress as satisfactory, though the project faces delays linked to slow tax-exemption approvals and the late release of government counterpart financing.

As of late 2025, only 12.6% of funds had been disbursed. Nevertheless, once completed, the initiative could provide reliable power to more than 84,000 people, generate nearly 3,000 temporary jobs, and reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 718,000 tonnes annually. It also fits within a continental trend that increasingly views mini-grids as an efficient mechanism for electrifying remote areas.

The solar programme also exposes Ghana’s vulnerability to imported components and underdeveloped maintenance ecosystems, both of which risk limiting the long-term viability of off-grid assets. This challenge underscores the importance of an industrial shift that is already taking shape. In late 2025, Germany’s development bank KfW launched an international tender for a solar module assembly facility in Kumasi, with an annual production capacity of 75 MW.

If delivered on schedule between 2026 and 2027, the plant would become the first of its kind in West Africa and anchor Ghana’s emerging green industrialisation strategy. It would also provide a platform for technology transfer, reduce dependence on Asian imports, and position Ghana as a potential supplier to ECOWAS markets. The industrial momentum coincides with a growing pipeline of domestic solar projects, including the 200 MW Norbert Anku Solar Park—expandable to 1 GW by 2032—which signals the country’s intention to strengthen its competitive position in the regional energy landscape.

Ghana’s progress mirrors a broader continental acceleration in renewable energy initiatives. Nigeria is expanding its portfolio of solar mini-grids as part of a clean-energy investment pipeline estimated at US$7.8 billion. Kenya remains a regional leader with more than 400 operational mini-grids and the continent’s largest wind installation at Lake Turkana. Angola is rolling out a 724 MW solar programme supported by Western partners, and Morocco continues to consolidate its large-scale solar and CSP infrastructure with an eye toward future exports to Europe. Africa as a whole could exceed 100 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, up from roughly 10 GW today, provided that financing flows stabilise and supply-chain bottlenecks ease.

In the medium term, Ghana’s additional 111 GWh of annual renewable output will support incremental improvements in energy access and help reduce the carbon intensity of marginal supply. The more strategic development lies in the emergence of a local solar manufacturing base, which—if KfW’s initiative succeeds—could fundamentally shift Ghana’s role within West Africa’s clean-energy ecosystem.

Yet this outcome is far from guaranteed. The public sector will need to improve procurement efficiency, stabilise utilities' financial health, and implement more predictable tariff reforms to attract private investors. Sustaining off-grid systems will also require stronger operation and maintenance frameworks than those typically observed across the region.

For now, Ghana’s renewable expansion remains gradual rather than transformative. However, if industrial plans materialise as intended, the country could evolve into a regional hub for solar technologies, strengthening its competitiveness and reducing long-term energy vulnerability. The following two years, marked by the roll-out of the AfDB-supported systems and the potential commissioning of the German-backed plant, will be decisive in determining whether Ghana can convert momentum into a durable structural advantage.

United States Renewable Energy Industry Overview

In just over a decade, the renewable energy industry has shifted from a niche market to a core pillar of America’s energy infrastructure. Today, renewables—spanning solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and bioenergy—are central to both public and private decarbonization strategies. Businesses across the value chain are fueling growth, including utilities, battery manufacturers, investors, engineering firms, and technology developers.

A powerful mix of incentives—like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Production Tax Credit (PTC), and state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards—has transformed renewables from expensive to economically superior options. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the most significant clean energy laws in U.S. history, further boosts investor confidence by promising long-term tax stability and encouraging domestic manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and wind components.

As solar module improvements, advanced wind turbine designs, and utility-scale storage become more cost-efficient, renewables increasingly compete with, and in many cases, outperform fossil fuel generation. Smart grid technologies and AI-driven energy optimization are improving system reliability, while large infrastructure investments—particularly in offshore wind and utility-scale solar—have pushed renewable capacity to record highs.

Solar is experiencing an extraordinary boom. All market segments—utility-scale, commercial, and residential—continue to expand, resulting in 188 GW of total installed solar capacity nationwide. In 2023 alone, 22.5 GW of new utility-scale solar was added, while nearly 800,000 residential customers installed solar systems on their rooftops. The country plans to add an average of 30 GW of solar annually by 2025, and 60 GW each year from 2025 to 2030. By 2034, cumulative solar capacity is expected to hit 673 GW, enough to power more than 100 million U.S. households.

A landmark example of America’s transition is the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, launched by Terra-Gen and Mortenson in 2024. Spanning 4,600 acres, it features:

1.9 million First Solar panels

875 MWdc solar capacity

3.3 GWh energy storage

1.3 GW interconnection capacity—the largest in the United States

These mega-projects illustrate the scale and sophistication of renewable energy deployment in the country.

Key Factors Driving United States Renewable Energy Market Growth

1. Strong Policy Support and Regulatory Incentives

Public policy remains one of the strongest drivers of renewable energy adoption in the U.S. Federal incentives like the ITC, PTC, and extensive tax credits under the IRA reduce upfront costs and improve project viability. State-level support through Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), clean energy mandates, and net-metering programs reinforces momentum at the local level.

In addition to cutting costs, these incentives enhance long-term revenue certainty—critical for attracting large-scale private investment. States including California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey have enacted aggressive clean energy laws tied to emissions targets, further stimulating deployment.

2. Technological Innovation and Cost Declines

The rapid decline in the cost of solar PV systems, wind turbines, and battery storage is speeding up adoption. Improved materials, automated manufacturing, enhanced turbine aerodynamics, bifacial solar modules, and higher-capacity batteries have reduced the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables to historic lows.

Advanced grid modernization tools—including AI-powered forecasting, virtual power plants (VPPs), real-time monitoring, and energy management software—are strengthening system integration. Economies of scale continue to push renewable energy prices down, making them competitive with natural gas and coal in most regions.

3. Rising Corporate and Consumer Demand for Clean Energy

Corporations are now among the largest purchasers of renewable energy. Major companies are signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), investing in on-site generation, and pursuing net-zero targets. This corporate demand offers reliable revenue streams for developers, accelerating project financing.

Residential customers are adopting rooftop solar and community solar programs at unprecedented rates. Motivations range from cost savings and energy independence to environmental concerns, strengthened by financial incentives and falling equipment costs.

Challenges Facing the United States Renewable Energy Market

1. Grid Infrastructure Limitations

Despite rapid renewable expansion, America’s aging grid remains one of the biggest bottlenecks. Solar and wind intermittency, transmission congestion, lengthy interconnection queues, and permitting hurdles slow down deployment.

Large-scale renewables require robust transmission systems, yet many proposed lines face delays of 5–10 years due to regulatory, land-use, and stakeholder issues. Without significant upgrades in transmission and storage, renewable growth may outpace grid capacity.

2. Complex and Lengthy Permitting Processes

Permitting complexity—especially for utility-scale solar, offshore wind, and interstate transmission—can significantly delay projects. Environmental reviews, zoning regulations, and overlapping state and federal jurisdictions often lead to unpredictable timelines.

Land-use disputes and community opposition add further complications. Developers frequently cite permitting uncertainty as a top investment risk. Simplifying and standardizing regulations could unlock billions in clean energy investment.

United States Renewable Energy Market Overview by States

The U.S. renewable market is far from uniform. Regional variations in policy, geography, consumer engagement, and resource availability help shape state-level performance. Three major states illustrate the spectrum of clean energy activity:

California: America’s Renewable Energy Epicenter

California remains the country's undisputed leader in renewable energy adoption. Abundant sunlight, ambitious climate policies, and an engaged consumer base drive strong growth across residential and utility-scale solar, geothermal, and bioenergy.

Key characteristics:

Target of 100% clean electricity by 2045

Nation’s most advanced cap-and-trade program

Major investments in battery storage to manage solar overgeneration

CAISO plays a central role in balancing supply-demand and integrating renewables

California faces challenges from intermittency and grid strain, but its leadership in policy, innovation, and technology continues to position it at the forefront of America’s energy transition.

Final Thoughts

The United States is standing at the threshold of its most transformative clean energy decade yet. With renewable capacity expected to surpass 1,000 GW by 2033, the next few years will redefine the country’s energy, economic, and environmental trajectory. Strong federal and state support, a rapidly maturing technology ecosystem, and surging corporate sustainability commitments are powering the nationwide pivot toward green energy.

Yet the transition is not without obstacles. Grid congestion, slow permitting, and aging infrastructure all present formidable challenges. But with ongoing investments in storage, transmission, and innovation, the fundamentals of the U.S. renewable energy market remain exceptionally strong.

As global competition intensifies and climate pressures escalate, America’s commitment to renewable energy will not only determine its environmental future—but also shape its economic leadership in the decades ahead.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/692e877cce0795001da2071b.png",N,,2025-12-02 07:58:25.454616

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market.
These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.
“We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.
Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.","A couple of weeks ago we brought you this New York Times report about lead poisoning being caused by factories that produce batteries for automotive use.

These factories are/were producing batteries such as the 12-volt units used for starting your car, and not necessarily the large batteries for electric vehicles.

Near the end of the post, I wrote that it wasn't clear how much automakers knew:

The Times reports that automakers often claim to be using clean recycling processes, even marketing their processes as clean and safe. In reality, at least some of the recycled lead is being sourced from factories that are polluting. Perhaps the OEMs are aware of the dirty conditions at these facilities -- and perhaps they are not. After all, the supply chain is complex and as the Times points out in the piece, it's possible, even likely, that automakers and battery producers don't know where the lead is coming from.

Now the NYT reports that automakers definitely knew -- and have known for a long time.

The outlet leads with the story of an Australian lawyer meeting with Ford executives at the Blue Oval's Dearborn HQ in 2005. The lawyer, Philip Toyne, warned those executives that recycled lead from car batteries was poisoning people, because the factories that did the recycling were putting toxic smoke out into the atmosphere.

He even pitched a program in which inspectors would certify factories as clean, and automakers -- and suppliers who manufactured batteries -- could buy recycled lead only from companies that passed certification. That would allow the companies to claim, in their marketing, that they used only lead that was recycled cleanly.

According to the Times, records and interviews show that OEMs have known for 30 years or more that the factories they purchased recycled lead from were polluting the atmosphere. But they did nothing, and even blocked efforts to address the problem. When the big automakers wrote down environmental policies, they didn't address lead.

Meanwhile, factories in Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania were poisoning local citizens.

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market. Even now, the Times says that lead poisoning is estimated to kill more than 1.5 million people each year, most of whom live in developing countries.

The Times says Ford didn't reply to requests for comment, and it also reports that Ford executives were intrigued by Toyne's pitch, since Ford could then appeal to customers who cared about the environment.

And maybe Ford would've gone ahead had 2006 not happened. For those who don't remember, that was when the Blue Oval suffered what was, at the time, its worst financial loss ever and Bill Ford stepped down as CEO. Ford was generally seen as an advocate for the environment and sustainability.

We all know what happened next -- the Great Recession struck and the Detroit automakers needed bailout loans. Other major automakers had their own struggles.

Meanwhile, battery makers sometimes have a layer between them and the factories. These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.

While Ford didn't talk to the Times, one of the execs who heard Toyne's pitch did. From the NYT:

Addressing lead pollution and other environmental problems proved “financially challenging,” recalled Bernd Gottselig, a retired Ford executive who was involved in talks about Green Lead. “Several ideas would have required setting up completely new and unique supply chains,” he said.

There was another wrinkle, too. Automakers were reluctant to market ""green"" lead since it would imply, correctly, that lead was toxic.

Michael Rae, who was working on a program to certify metals and minerals in the jewelry industry at the time, sat in on a Green Lead meeting. He said it posed a public relations challenge for automakers: By touting their environmental commitment, they’d be calling attention to their reliance on a metal that has been known for centuries to be toxic.

“My recollection is that there was active resistance from the motor vehicle industry to the idea of saying ‘green lead’ because of the implication that there was ‘bad lead,’” Rae said.

Ford wasn't the only OEM that was warned. Motorcycle maker Hero Honda, which in 2007 was co-owned by Honda Motor Company, participated in an Indian pilot program for buying batteries only from battery-makers who had passed certain certifications for reducing emissions from lead.

Most major battery makers in India didn't sign up. Nor did large international automakers like Ford, GM, and what was then DaimlerChrysler.

Japanese OEM Mitsubishi also passed.

Again, from the Times:

“We are aware of lead poisoning, and understand your gist,” Eizo Tabo, the manager of environmental and recycling programs at Mitsubishi, wrote at the time. But the company said its batteries came from Japan, not India. “We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.

In the years that followed, lead from polluting factories has seeped further into the global supply chain. Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.

A Mitsubishi spokesperson said it is working to eliminate lead in its products and that it has not identified serious risks of human rights violations in any of its supply chains.

Africa hasn't been the only part of the world affected by lead pollution from these factories. The Times reports that in 2011, a Mexican factory started recycling lead from old car batteries, and a ""putrid mist"" began to fall from the sky -- townspeople, including infants, got sick.

That Times piece also highlighted a research paper that suggested that as the United States came up with tighter environmental regulations, there was an increase in exports of batteries for recycling to Mexico.

A U.S. government employee, Bob Holcombe, and a group called ATSM International tried to come up with standards for recycling lead from car batteries. First, the U.S. government would need to set up a committee. A simple majority would be needed to form the committee, and anyone who attended the meeting that would decide whether a committee would be formed could vote.

The Times shows that 98 people voted, and 80 represented battery makers. Fifty came from Johnson Controls, then the world's largest maker of automotive batteries. Unsurprisingly, the vote failed.

Johnson Controls later sold its battery business, which changed brands to become Clarios. Clarios wouldn't comment on the meeting to the Times, and only said it was committed to high standards for manufacturing.

Automakers would occasionally get caught doing something unethical and/or immoral and agree to change. The companies agreed to limit the mercury trade in 2013. When child labor was found being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine ore for electric systems, automakers said they'd only use ethical suppliers going forward.

Now all major OEMs talk about harmful sourcing -- except for when it comes to recycled lead.

All major car companies now identify minerals and metals that are known to harm the environment and human health if they are obtained irresponsibly.

Hyundai, for example, keeps a list of minerals that are important to the “future and environment of mankind.” It requires that suppliers obtain those minerals ethically. General Motors has placed six metals under heightened scrutiny. Neither company addresses lead.

Not all companies ignore lead -- Volvo and Mitsubishi do monitor it, and Nissan claims to be phasing lead out ""where technically feasible"".

Ford said nothing about lead in its most recent sustainability report.

Toyne passed away in 2015. A business partner told the Times that Toyne had more success convincing jewelry retailers to ethically source gemstones.

Fresh off a decisive election win, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is promising a sharp turn in Virginia’s energy policy, vowing energy affordability for regular ratepayers, boosting in-state power generation, and forcing data centers to “pay their fair share.”

House Democrats, with their new majority, are making energy efficiency a key priority for the 2026 legislative session. They have filed bills to create an energy efficiency task force and to mandate that utilities give qualified customers efficiency upgrades. This fits nicely with local nonprofit Renew Rocktown’s launch of an Energy Check program for low-income households.

Abigail Spanberger has appointed her energy policy transition team to head up her start of an energy policy shift. The team members have lots of experience in sustainable energy.

Now that Virginia Democrats have won control of state government, they’re faced with the challenge of figuring out how to meet surging power demand from booming data centers and rural opposition to solar farms without abandoning the state’s clean energy mandate.

As Virginia’s data center boom strains the grid, a new proposal from Rewiring America shows that tech giants could free up power by footing the bill for residential energy upgrades and still come out ahead.

Dominion Energy is seeking regulatory approval of its largest slate of solar and battery storage projects yet, at nearly a dozen facilities totaling $2.9 billion.

The Washington Post, owned by the world’s largest data center operator, Jeff Bezos, recently claimed that data centers actually lower power costs. This is disingenuous! While discounted rates for big commercial power users (including data centers) have remained stable or decreased slightly in Virginia, they have risen significantly for everyone else.

The Virginia State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy’s controversial 944-megawatt gas peaker plant in Chesterfield along with higher electricity rates to pay for it.

Our Climate Crisis

Rising global temperatures have made Earth’s atmosphere more waterlogged, providing fuel for wetter and more dangerous storms. Some regions are more susceptible than others. In the past 85 years, the amount of water vapor moving through the atmosphere has increased 12%.

Antarctica’s Hektoria Glacier retreated five miles in two months, 10 times as fast as the previous record. This has implications for the stability of other glaciers and the pace of sea-level rise on a warming planet.

Showing some progress, the UN Paris Agreement has reduced the projected maximum global warming to less than 3°C degrees by the end of the century, which is down from prior projections of about 5°C. Even 2°C of global warming would, however, make many low-lying islands uninhabitable and swamp millions of square miles of coastal regions around the world.

Despite surging renewable energy, global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise to an all-time high this year. Increases are expected to accelerate in the U.S. and the EU but slow in China and India. At this rate the world will blow past the UN climate goal of 1.5°C of global warming in four years.

Politics and Policy

Under intense resistance from fossil fuel interests, the COP30 climate summit in Brazil fell short on drawing up a roadmap for a global transition away from oil, gas and coal. It did agree to launch limited initiatives to strengthen emissions-cutting plans, as well as tripling finance to help poor countries cope with worsening climate change impacts.

The Trump administration is arguing that abandoning fossil fuels is just too expensive and betting that the world will buy American oil and gas for decades to come. Meanwhile, China’s worldwide exports of clean energy technology have more than tripled in the last five years.

The founders of the fledgling Texas nuclear energy startup Fermi America have become billionaires because of its connections to Trump even though it has yet to produce an electron, split an atom, and has little more to show than a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure.

Nations were poised to approve the first fee on pollution from ships. The Trump administration then began threats, including tariffs, sanctions and the revocation of diplomats’ U.S. visas, which effectively killed the agreement.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemned the UN COP30 climate summit as harmful and misguided, saying, “It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.”

This November was a very good election for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide. Voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit — and the people promising to deliver those policies.

At this year’s UN COP30 Climate Summit, the U.S. is out and Europe is struggling. Emerging countries are, however, embracing renewable energy thanks to a glut of cheap equipment from China.

More than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists were present at the COP30 climate negotiations in Brazil. This is 60% more than the delegates from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries.

The environmental group 350.org will temporarily suspend programming due to funding woes. President Trump’s threats to investigate left-leaning organizations and his rapid-fire dismantling of environmental rules have hamstrung green groups.

Gov. Josh Shapiro is pulling Pennsylvania out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, bowing to fossil fuel industry claims that it is leading to higher utility bills. Environmentalists see the decision as ‘shocking reversal’ on fighting global warming.

Parking lots in South Korea with more than 80 spaces will be required to install solar canopies. This new law doesn’t just apply to new construction — existing lots will have to comply as well.

Energy

Nuclear power is back due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, driven by big tech’s hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers. The Trump administration aims to quadruple nuclear output over the next 25 years. This does not address the exorbitant upfront costs of building nuclear plants or the old issue of safely storing radioactive waste.

So much solar power is being generated in the middle of the day in Australia that the federal government will mandate power companies to offer free electricity during those three hours. This provides an incentive to install batteries and to switch electricity use to those hours.

Hyundai still plans to invest $6 billion in a low-carbon steel plant in Louisiana despite the Trump administration’s cuts to tax credits for the green hydrogen needed to produce clean iron and a recent immigration raid on a factory the automaker is building in Georgia.

Germany is investing billions on nuclear fusion for its energy future. Critics say it’s a waste of money as the still unproven technology won’t solve near-term climate and energy problems.

Large manufacturers are increasingly participating in a demand response program in which their industrial facilities agree to power down and switch to local backup sources such as batteries during times of high demand on the grid. They, in turn, receive financial compensation from the grid operator.

People can do a lot to reduce energy use and carbon emissions in their own lives, even in the absence of government action. The recent Energy Smart Home Expo, organized by Electrify Central Ohio, demonstrated what people can do in their own households and communities.

The International Energy Agency forecasts that an oversupply of oil could create a glut of 4 million barrels a day next year. It also forecasts that renewable energy is expected to at least double globally over the next five years.

Global demand for power is growing fast, but hydro plants, the oldest source of clean energy, are struggling because of droughts, floods and other extreme weather linked to climate change.

Tapping energy from “superhot rock” could produce cheap, clean, constant geothermal energy almost anywhere — if drills and wells can survive infernal heat and pressure.

The world’s first highway that can wirelessly charge trucks and other electric vehicles as they drive has been switched on in France.

Land, Food, and Agriculture

In spite of bipartisan agreement on eliminating food waste, the U.S. still squanders roughly a third of its food supply. It’s a huge problem. Globally, if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

While the world continues losing huge areas of forest in the tropics, they are making a comeback in some countries including India, China, the U.S., Canada, Russia, and much of Europe. Leading in this, China has added forest the whopping size of Texas since 1990.

Climate Justice

The world’s response to the climate crisis risks deepening inequality rather than addressing it. Less than 3% of international aid to cut carbon emissions is supporting a “just transition” away from polluting industries.

What does the just energy transition mean for Africa where around 600 million people lack even basic access to electricity? Investment in the continent’s abundant sources of solar, wind and geothermal power could meet most of the continent’s energy needs.

Student and Indigenous activists clashed with UN security when they tried to force their way into the COP30 climate conference venue to protest oil drilling in the Amazon.

Pacific island countries won a landmark case at the International Court of Justice, ruling that every nation on earth has a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Now they want countries to act.

In a groundbreaking initiative, the Brazilian COP30 leadership included the Global Ethical Stocktake, which elevates the spiritual, ethical and cultural dimensions of the climate crisis. It organized regional dialogues of diverse voices to reflect on deeper values that should guide climate action.

Rising home insurance premiums are eating into home values in disaster-prone areas of the U.S. As insurance costs more than doubled in various areas, home values have fallen and many owners are stuck.

Pete Hoekstra served as a Michigan Congressman from 1993 to 2011. He served as chairman of the Michigan Republican Party during the 2024 elections. In April, he became the 26th U.S. Ambassador to Canada.

By Anna Clark

Time is winding down for Howard Miller, the storied furniture company and clockmaker in western Michigan that said this summer it will close after 99 years. It identified the Trump administration’s tariffs as a main culprit.

Howard Miller’s closure will cost about 195 people their jobs, most in Michigan. “Our hopes for a market recovery early in the year were quickly dashed as tariffs rattled the supply chain, sparked recession fears and pushed mortgage rates higher,” the company’s president and CEO said in a July press release.

In November, the company hosted a factory closeout sale. Locals shuffled through makeshift aisles bounded by curio cabinets, wardrobes and home bars styled with faux cocktails for an imaginary party.

And there were, of course, the signature grandfather clocks that made Howard Miller famous, both traditional designs of fluted hardwood and contemporary deconstructions with visible gears. Some sported a red, white and blue “Made in Michigan” sticker on their glassy faces.

For nearly a century, Howard Miller was an American success story. But it struggled when President Donald Trump unleashed aggressive and fast-changing tariffs this year on both specific countries and business sectors. Some countries responded with retaliatory tariffs. Along the way, there were pauses, escalations and reports of progress toward some 14 trade agreements, falling short of the administration’s prediction of 90 deals in 90 days.

Companies like Howard Miller — a domestic manufacturer that imports certain goods and products — were caught in the middle. Tariffs led to rising costs on essential components that were unavailable domestically, according to the company.

Pete Hoekstra saw it coming. Now the U.S. ambassador to Canada, Hoekstra was a nine-term congressman until 2011, representing the Michigan community where Howard Miller is based. He also was a vice president at the modern furnishings company now known as MillerKnoll that was co-founded by Howard Miller’s father, Herman.

In Congress, Hoekstra said tariffs were bad for business and consumers.

“The market should dictate the price of steel, not the government,” Hoekstra testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in 2003 on President George W. Bush’s temporary steel tariffs.

Tariffs drive up costs for furniture-makers and other manufacturers in his district, Hoekstra said at the time, leading to dramatically higher prices, longer lead times for production and lost jobs. “Once lost, the jobs will not come back,” he testified.

Today, though, as ambassador, Hoekstra has been a top defender of the president’s approach — a shift that’s mirrored in the changing attitudes of other Michigan Republican leaders on trade.

Hoekstra’s social media posts as ambassador applaud Trump’s efforts to achieve “balanced and reciprocal trade relationships.” And in October, after Ontario’s government commissioned an ad that aired during the World Series using former President Ronald Reagan’s words to champion free trade, Hoekstra reportedly chastised the province’s trade representative in an “expletive-laced tirade.”

A White House spokesperson said in an email to ProPublica that the Trump administration “has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy.”

Canada is Michigan’s largest international trading partner. In fact, the state sells more goods to Canada than to Michigan’s next four largest foreign markets combined, according to the Canadian consulate general in Detroit.

But Hoekstra seems to have followed Trump’s lead in engaging with Canada. When Trump repeatedly called for it to become “the 51st state,” Hoekstra said the country’s prime minister might see it as a term of endearment.

Meanwhile, other Michigan enterprises are making hard choices. The Michigan Retailers Association, a trade group, found that two-thirds of retailers surveyed in May said they had to raise prices because of tariffs. Agriculture, the state’s second-largest industry, is also taking a hit. Michigan’s agriculture department reported in late August that tariffs, including retaliatory tariffs, led to big drops in exports. Wheat exports fell by 89% compared to last year, fresh cherries by 62% and fresh apples by 58%.

And MillerKnoll, Hoekstra’s former employer, said in a business filing that its first quarter gross margin — a measure of profitability — decreased compared to the same quarter of the prior year, which it attributed primarily to “net tariff-related costs.” MillerKnoll issued a tariff surcharge and increased prices to mitigate costs “based on the current tariff environment,” a company executive said on an earnings call.

At Howard Miller, while demand isn’t what it once was for its clocks, the company had diversified its product line, which helped, said James O’Keefe, vice president of sales and marketing. But a subdued housing market limited sales to the people most likely to buy new furnishings, he said, and tariffs dialed up the cost of certain imported products.

It seemed like the family-owned company was put in a difficult position, said Nelson Vandermeer, a product development engineer. “If the federal government had said, ‘Oh, it’s a 10% tariff, constant, this is what it is,’ they might’ve been able to play the game, adjust margins, set pricing,” he said. “They might’ve worked things out. It might’ve been OK.

“But no. It’s just chaos.”

Vandermeer, who’s been with the company for more than 30 years, is grieving as Howard Miller enters its final days. “I loved my job,” he said. “I love the people I work with. When you love something, it’s tormenting to lose it.”

Intertwined Economies

The tall teal pillars of the Ambassador Bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, mark one of the busiest land borders in North America, symbolizing a profitable and once-dependable partnership. To expand capacity for the two-way flow of trade and traffic, a new span is slated to open next year: the Gordie Howe International Bridge, named for the Canadian hockey legend who spent 25 years with the Detroit Red Wings.

Michigan exports $23.3 billion in goods to Canada annually, according to the Canadian consulate in Detroit. That includes cars and trucks, vehicle parts and furniture, agricultural goods and more. Canada is also the largest source of imports into Michigan.

The standing trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico was negotiated in Trump’s first term. The president later described it as “the best agreement we’ve ever made.”

Trump pursued some tariffs in his first term, but in his second, he played hardball, championing them as a way to grow American manufacturing while bringing a windfall of tariff revenue into the U.S.

Gordon Giffin, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Canada under former President Bill Clinton, said Trump has “fallen in love” with tariffs. And if there’s already a trade agreement in place, Trump will argue that “whatever president that put the agreement in place was an idiot.”

In the case of Canada and Mexico, Giffin said: “The agreement that’s in place is the one he put in place. And somebody needs to remind him of that.”

When Hoekstra landed at the Ottawa embassy in April, tensions were already high. In order to justify new tariffs on Canada, Trump had declared a national emergency over fentanyl trafficking, though the northern border is not a major source of the drug. Trump’s authority to use such emergency declarations to impose tariffs is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

The president also questioned Canada’s sovereignty. “To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,” he said in March. “We don’t need anything they have. As a state, it would be one of the great states.”

Canada responded with “elbows up,” a reference to a defensive posture hockey players take to ward off opponents. Certain stores emptied their shelves of American alcohol. Hockey fans booed during the American anthem. The national and some provincial governments issued retaliatory trade actions. (Many have since been lifted.) Canadian travel to the U.S. cratered. Data from Canada’s statistics office shows 10 consecutive months of reduced travel to its southern neighbor.

Colin Bird, the consul general of Canada in Detroit, told ProPublica that he’s hearing from companies on both sides of the border that are in “wait-and-see” mode or are pulling back on investment, “certainly from Canadian companies investing into Michigan that are being heavily impacted by tariffs.”

“As soon as we’re back onto a steady state relationship, there’s a huge reservoir of goodwill for the United States in Canada, but it’s having a really significant short-term impact,” Bird said.

Hoekstra, a former ambassador to the Netherlands and head of the Michigan Republican Party, made some friendly overtures. In a May video, he discussed his family connection to Canada, as someone born in the Netherlands to parents liberated by Canadian troops during World War II.

“As a Michigander,” Hoekstra said, “you know, a border state, we recognize the close relationship that we have to bring safety, security and prosperity to both of our nations.”

But Hoekstra was also critical of “anti-American” attitudes in Canada and the delay in hammering out a new trade agreement.

Negotiations stalled after Ontario’s ad that featured Reagan saying in 1987 that, in the long term, tariffs “hurt every American worker and consumer.”

An outburst by Hoekstra targeting Ontario’s trade representative at a “state of the relationship” event hosted by the Canadian American Business Council appears to have been provoked by the ad, according to the CBC, Canada’s public broadcaster. At a press conference, Ontario Premier Doug Ford urged Hoekstra to apologize.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the ad campaign used “selective audio and video” to misrepresent the former president’s address. But while some remarks aired in a different order than in the original speech, the meaning didn’t change. Reagan often championed free trade, including the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.

Trump called the ad “FAKE” and threatened to raise Canada’s tariff rate from 35% to 45%.

“Canada burnt the bridges with America,” Hoekstra said on a CTV newscast. “Donald Trump did not slam the door. … Canada slammed that door shut all by itself.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologized to Trump. While Ford defended the ad — “What do they expect me to do? Sit back and roll over like every other person in the world?” he said at the presser — Ontario pulled it from the air.

But trade talks have yet to resume. And Hoekstra has signaled that there is still an abundance of ill will.

“Targeting the president of the United States and his policies 10 days before an election, and a couple weeks before a Supreme Court case is heard before the Supreme Court — I’m sorry, that does not happen in the United States of America,” Hoekstra said of the ad campaign at a recent appearance in Canada.

He added: “I would suggest that you seriously consider whether that is the best way to try to achieve your objectives.”

A New Political Reality

Hoekstra isn’t the only politician who has adjusted his approach to trade. U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, representing the district that’s losing Howard Miller, issued a newsletter in 2018 that pushed back on the first Trump administration’s tariff efforts, particularly tariffs on steel from Canada.

“Any perceived short-term gain from these overly broad tariffs may be quickly blunted by hardworking men and women losing their jobs in West Michigan and communities where manufacturing plays a significant role in the local economy,” he wrote.

This year, Huizenga supported Trump’s tariffs. “Is there going to be some adjustments to that? Absolutely,” he told reporters in March. “Is it going to be easy? Not necessarily. Is it the right thing to do? Absolutely it is.”

In response to ProPublica, a spokesperson for Huizenga said in an email that economic realities before and after the COVID-19 pandemic are dramatically different. The pandemic “exposed the dire need to reshore American manufacturing,” the spokesperson wrote.

“President Trump and Congressman Huizenga are fighting to reshore American jobs, restore affordability, and rebuild Michigan’s economy.”

Some companies and labor organizations have applauded the tariffs or found ways to live with them.

An executive with MillerKnoll said on an earnings call that the company raised prices and that it believes this will offset the impact of tariffs in the second half of the fiscal year. Whirlpool, the appliance manufacturer, recently announced a $300 million investment in U.S. laundry operations. While the company said it’s navigating “the near-term unfavorable effects of tariffs,” it also said that it expects to benefit in the end as it competes against companies that depend more on imports.

The United Auto Workers credited auto tariffs, along with union pressure, for Netherlands-based automaker Stellantis’ October announcement of a massive investment at plants in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. Brands made by Stellantis, one of the world’s largest carmakers, include Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep.

“Wall Street and supposed industry experts said this was impossible,” UAW president Shawn Fain said in a press release. But the “race to the bottom created by free trade is finally coming to an end.”

This move by Stellantis involves shifting production away from Ontario.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer celebrated Stellantis “for betting on Michigan once again.” Her statement didn’t mention Trump’s trade policies.

Whitmer isn’t categorically against tariffs, but she’s said that Trump’s approach hasn’t properly calibrated the costs and consequences. After asking state agencies about the effect of tariffs, she announced that they led to higher grocery prices and housing costs. At a business forum in Canada, Whitmer said: “Swinging the tariff hammer hurts us both, damaging supply chains, slowing production lines, and cutting jobs on both sides of the border.”

Over in western Michigan, Vandermeer, the Howard Miller veteran, is among those who are looking for work. “I got 10 more years,” he said, before he’s ready to retire. “I can work, if I find something.”

Browsers at the Howard Miller factory sale in November came with a lot of questions, said O’Keefe, the vice president of sales and marketing, as he surveyed the improvised sales floor stacked with clocks. Many locals had just learned of the closure of the company, which held a special place in community life. At the public library that’s named for Howard Miller, two majestic grandfather clocks stand watch.

“It is sad,” O’Keefe said. “Especially when you walk through the quiet factory floor. They used to be running three shifts.”

O’Keefe said he doesn’t have his next job lined up yet. But for now, he said, he’s got work to do. There’s the last of the inventory to sell.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_peter_hoekstra_56092.png,N,,2025-12-02 02:58:08.473661

Rising energy costs hinder small business owners in growing and operating their businesses

NFIB stands with small business owners in the pursuit of legislation that will provide options for affordable energy. Several bills under consideration in Congress would help alleviate rising energy costs for small businesses by increasing the production of American energy.

“High energy costs have had a serious impact on my business,” said NFIB member Dee Morgan, Flowers Etc. in Dixon, Illinois. “Costs have significantly increased in recent years, and I have been forced to cut employee raises and reduce earnings. We are no longer hiring and unable to expand our business because of the rising price of electricity. I have sadly resorted to shutting off the lights in my store and only turning them on when a customer enters. In addition, this past summer, I reduced store hours to lower costs.”

Three Congressional Review Acts (CRAs) to lower energy costs recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives to move forward for consideration.

H.J. Res. 124 (Passed 216-209): This resolution would overturn a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule limiting production in the National Petroleum Reserve restricting the development of 23 million acres of land in Alaska. NFIB sent a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives after it passed the Senate 52-45 in October. Repealing this rule would lower energy costs for Americans and allow the infrastructure necessary for production of domestic energy.

H.J. Res. 130 (Passed 214-212): NFIB submitted a letter to members of Congress in support of this resolution, which would repeal the BLM rule restricting coal exploration and energy production on roughly 500,000 acres of land in the Powder River Basin (PRB) in northeast Wyoming. The Senate version of H.J. Res 130 passed 51-43.

NFIB previously supported H.J. Res. 104, which has passed in both chambers of Congress but not yet been signed into law. It repeals a similar rule restricting access to coal exploration on the Montana side of the PRB.

H.J. Res. 131 (Passed 217-209): This resolution would repeal a BLM rule restricting access to 1.15 million acres of land in northeast Alaska for oil and gas production.

In a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives, NFIB wrote in support of this resolution, allowing for the use of this land to lower energy costs for American citizens and businesses. The Senate version of this bill (SJ Res. 91) is currently under consideration.

After 30 years in the Navy, Whited decided to spend his retirement planting cauliflower, broccoli, green peas, potatoes, onions, cabbage and other crops.

He works on a quarter-acre plot of land that costs him $1,600 per year plus the water used.

Others lease smaller tracts and grow everything from avocadoes to blackberries to apples.

The community garden has more than 200 growers who all received eviction notices earlier this year.

“The greater San Diego Resources Conservation District who managed this area for the county for years decided they were no longer going to renew the contract with the County of San Diego.”

However, Whited said another contractor secured the rights and has extended the leases giving everyone a reprieve.

“We were really worried we were going to be evicted, but it looks like we’re going to be here for a while.”

Whited sells his produce to small stores and farmers markets.

One concern is whether the food grown by Whited and the others is safe for consumption, considering the amount of contamination in the area, especially with the heavily-polluted Tijuana River next door.

“Our worst problem here is the flooding,” he said. “The river runs right by here; if a plant is touched by water or potentially touched by water, it’s no longer edible or considered edible and it’s a complete loss.”

Whited says it’s happened to him before, and prior to replanting, soil samples had to be taken and analyzed.

“It’s a lengthy process that took months.”

Still, the Navy Veteran loves spending time growing and planting vegetables.

“Learned everything by listening to others and watching YouTube videos,” he said.

Whited says he’s OK financially as long as he breaks even.

“It’s easier to grow stuff than to sell it.”

Whited, who is 70 years old, says the best part is getting close to nature and being outdoors and that breaking even financially is just fine with him.

“Just getting out here working in the soil is really building your body and mind, and that’s what happens, for me, it keeps me off the couch.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/community-garden.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:32.849108

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Utah state senator Nate Blouin held an event to kick off his campaign for Utah’s first congressional district.

Blouin is the latest candidate in the democratic field for the newly drawn first district. Last week, he joined former Utah state senator Derek Kitchen, state senator Kathleen Riebe, and former Congressman Ben McAdams in the race.

Monday morning, Blouin kicked off his campaign at Sugar House Park, giving him a chance to address constituents within the district. Utah Representative Grant Miller (D-Salt Lake City), Salt Lake County Councilmember Natalie Pinkney, and Canyons School Board Member Jackson Lewis spoke at the event, and the three offered their endorsements for Blouin.

“D-1 is a new opportunity to show off how Democrats can lead the way, and it’s going to take a new generation of leaders to shatter the authoritarian coalition of Trump and the billionaire class that is making life miserable for Americans today,” Blouin said at the event.

This campaign kickoff event came shortly after Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed Blouin. In a post on X.com, Sanders wrote, “We need fighters in Congress who will take on powerful special interests, pass Medicare for All and demand that the billionaire class start paying their fair share of taxes,” adding that Blouin is that fighter and that he is “proud” to endorse him.

This marked a high-profile endorsement from a national figure who is popular among progressives. It could be seen as an indication that this race for the Democratic nominee will become a competition for which candidate can be the most progressive, though of course we are still very early in the campaign.

Remarks made by Pinkney, Miller, and Jackson at the event expressed the idea that this is a progressive district. “This is a progressive district, and we are committed to making sure that we reflect that, not just in our district, not just in our state, but in this country,” Pinkney said.

Derek Kitchen has also presented himself as a progressive candidate, calling himself a “bold progressive fighter for Utah’s new 1st district” on his campaign website. He also previously said that Utah has “the chance to elect a progressive leader who reflects the values of people who live here.”

McAdams and Riebe do not use the word progressive to describe themselves, but they have shown their support for progressive causes like transgender rights and the environment. This is all a reflection of how strongly Democratic this district is, having voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by over 20 points in the 2024 presidential election.

Ben McAdams has also received endorsements from local leaders, including Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and “the majority” of Salt Lake City’s elected officials.

""One of the biggest reasons for buying an electric vehicle has always been you get access to the carpool lane.
""I've never felt the need to assert my use of the carpool lane,"" he said.","On Monday, the ability of solo EV drivers in the Bay Area to ride in the carpool came to an end. The State's ""Clean Air Vehicle Decal Program"" ended at the beginning of October, but the CHP gave a 60-day grace period to allow drivers to get used to the idea, and tickets would now be issued to violators.

""This was something that, under federal law, this program did end,"" said CHP officer Adib Zeid. ""So, our role is not to capitalize on that. It's merely just to enforce the existing HOV laws.""

Zeid said the CHP is not planning any targeted enforcement efforts now that the stickers have become invalid. But they say they will be ticketing solo EV drivers in the carpool lane, just like any other vehicle, with a fine of $490. The Trump administration officially ended the program, as well as the federal tax credit for EV buyers, but the State of California was already winding the sticker program down anyway.

But when it first started in 2014, it was considered a huge incentive to jumpstart the fledgling electric car industry.

""If you go back over 10 years ago when it was launched, it got a lot of attention,"" said Loren McDonald, CEO of an industry research group called Chargeonomics. ""And in those days, EVs were sort of this new thing, right? And people needed a reason, lots of reasons, to buy EVs. And as a benefit, the HOV access was kind of a big deal. it helped put a lot of people over the top, especially if they commuted in a bad commute on a daily basis.""

McDonald said early EVs, with a range of less than 100 miles, were considered an expensive luxury. But he said as time passed the range and quality of the vehicles increased, and the price dropped to the point that driving in the carpool lane was no longer a necessary incentive.

""The reasons for buying or not buying an EV today has very little to do with being able to drive in the occupancy lane by yourself,"" he said.

But that's how it all started for John Stringer. The founder of the group Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley said the sticker on the bumper was a huge deal back in 2018.

""It's a huge bummer at the end of the day, right?"" he said, about the program ending. ""One of the biggest reasons for buying an electric vehicle has always been you get access to the carpool lane. Pre-COVID and even post-COVID now, traffic is just horrible. It's actually worse now. And one of the biggest reasons why I bought my first Tesla, about seven years ago, was because of the carpool lane, to be able to literally shave off 20 minutes each way to work.""

Stringer bought his new Cybertruck, his fourth Tesla, in 2024, knowing that its HOV privileges wouldn't last long. But not every EV owner qualified anyway, with the State limiting the number and duration of decals that could be on the road. So, having the sticker became a status symbol for some and an irritant to others.

""I imagine the other drivers get pissed off that they're in traffic and you have somebody, because of their car, they don't have to be in the same situation as them,"" said Armando Diaz as he sat in his vehicle at a San Jose charging station.

Diaz may be a rare breed. He bought his Tesla for the technology, but never applied for a sticker because he didn't feel right about his ability to gain a carpool advantage over others.

""I've never felt the need to assert my use of the carpool lane,"" he said. ""If I have a passenger in my car, I will drive the carpool. Other than that, I'm just normally driving on the streets, same as everybody else.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/02/1564a2d7-5581-4718-b6e2-3f9e1d6fe739/thumbnail/1200x630/34d9d1e1977d50b4647e3b13056835bf/snapshot-2025-12-01t184617-326.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 02:58:22.041073

Via Docket (EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0443)

Dr. Nancy Beck, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator

Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW (MC-7101M)

Washington, DC 20460

Subject: Request for Extension of the Public Comment Period – Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) Draft Risk Evaluation Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0443

Dear Dr. Beck,

On behalf of National Taxpayers Union (NTU), the nation’s oldest taxpayer advocacy organization, I write to submit the following comments on the EPA’s draft risk evaluation (September 2025) for D4. NTU appreciates the agency’s efforts to assess this chemical under TSCA and to solicit public input. Nonetheless, we must respectfully note our great concern over the preliminary determinations of “unreasonable risk” (or the approach leading to them) on a number of substantive grounds. NTU urges EPA to revise the draft evaluation in multiple respects before moving toward final risk management decisions. Taxpayers have a major stake in ensuring that policies toward D4, as well as the Manufacturer Requested Risk Evaluation (MRRE) process involving D4, are grounded in solid cost-benefit analysis.

As you know, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) is a building block of silicone products, and is the backbone of America’s important silicone industry. As the key intermediate used to produce silicone fluids, elastomers, and resins, D4 anchors a supply chain that reaches virtually every major sector of the modern economy. In fact, D4 is integral in manufacturing electronics, automotive systems, construction materials, all energy technologies, medical devices, aerospace components, and a wide range of everyday consumer products. There are few substitutes that can match silicone’s performance, durability, and versatility at scale.

Because D4 feeds into such a broad production network, it underpins billions of dollars in economic activity and supports America’s manufacturing renaissance. That’s why it is crucial for final rules impacting D4 be thoroughly studied to avoid disruption or overly restrictive regulation that would send ripple effects through industries dependent on silicone-based products. Either of these undesirable outcomes would raise costs for manufacturers and consumers alike.

An unbalanced public policy approach would also weaken U.S. competitiveness in advanced manufacturing, energy development, and high-performance materials, as many cutting-edge technologies rely on stable access to silicone chemistries derived from D4.

Put simply, D4 is not just a chemical intermediate; it is a foundational input that enables high-value industries, supports domestic manufacturing, and strengthens the broader U.S. economy. It has also been safely produced at a commercial scale for over four and a half decades. Yet, for the first time, the agency has concluded that D4 may pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment under certain circumstances.

Aside from the market and economic impacts, taxpayers deserve a prominent voice in this conversation. Silicone-based materials last longer, require fewer replacements, and reduce maintenance needs for public facilities, transportation systems, water infrastructure, and energy grids. Fewer repairs and longer asset lifespans directly translate into savings for taxpayers who ultimately fund these systems.

This taxpayer perspective is incredibly important within the health care conversation, since D4-derived silicones are also essential in medical devices, emergency equipment, and public health technologies. Their reliability and stability help keep procurement costs lower over time and ensure hospitals, first responders, and public agencies have access to materials that work in extreme conditions. D4 is also a vital element in parts for vehicle fleets, structures, and other products that governments at all levels purchase on a daily basis. At a time when federal and state government spending on health care issues reaches record highs year after year, silcones help keep taxpayers costs down.

It is also important that EPA solicit and consider scientific evidence from all stakeholders, no matter who presents it. The decision to rely only sporadically on the data gathered by the MRRE does not seem to have much substantiation. Because this is an important test of how a public-private partnership can work in developing efficient and effective regulation, EPA should be more transparent and comprehensive about how this decision was reached and whether some prudent modifications could be made to ensure that this and other MRREs respect that partnership more fully. Otherwise, time and financial resources will be wasted as EPA simply regulates in the dark.

Under the first Trump Administration, an MRRE for D4 was granted by EPA in the fall of 2020 after the silicones industry formulated—in collaboration with EPA—a carefully overseen environmental monitoring program for numerous sites. The data generated from this program—at full expense of the industry—provided the basis for the MRRE and afforded EPA the information it said it needed for a sound scientific evaluation. Yet, today, what should have been a smoothly progressing MRRE has become threatened by uncertainty, which is inimical to a process whose very success depends on the confidence of its participants in a firmly grounded design and the agency’s commitment to following through with established plans. In several contexts, ranging from local-level Extended Producer Responsibility legislation to a federal proposal for pilot reimbursement methods in the 340B pharmaceutical discount program, NTU has offered the D4 MRRE as a model of how the government and private sector can collaborate on regulation in the public interest. We are hopeful that, with a change of course in EPA’s initial Draft Risk Evaluation, the integrity of this model can be affirmed and upheld.

NTU has previously weighed in on this ever-shifting regulatory landscape. For example, at a June 22, 2022, TSCA oversight hearing before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, EPA’s Assistant Director Michal Freedhoff told the panel, “It is incumbent on the agency to do better.” A subsequent coalition of five organizations led by NTU voiced agreement with that statement, and wrote in a letter to then-EPA Administrator Regan: “We would contend that doing better at EPA should be demonstrated before Congress considers major funding increases in this area of the agency’s responsibility. Otherwise, taxpayer resources will be spent for no constructive purpose.” Those words are as true today as they were three years ago—and certainly applicable to the need for EPA to reconsider its Draft Risk Evaluation for D4.

We agree that making progress on environmental, energy, health care, and other goals in a fiscally and economically sustainable manner will require major contributions from and advances in chemical science. The public policy instruments for achieving this progress require thoughtful calibration. We stand ready to assist EPA in fulfilling this vital task, and we thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2025/12/EPA.jpeg?v=20251201024100,N,,2025-12-02 02:57:59.948052

Trump on buying oil from Venezuela.
Why has the Venezuelan oil industry focused its extraction efforts on the heavy crude extracted from the Orinoco Belt?
Today, the only Venezuelan oil they have is what Chevron exports, which is currently 120,000 barrels per day.
It’s no longer the country of the 20th century which imported enormous amounts of oil and at one point consumed around two million barrels of Venezuelan oil per day.
If US companies can rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry, as María Corina suggests, how feasible is this reconstruction?","An old cliché is gaining traction amid the relentless barrage of content about the Trump administration’s military pressure on the chavista regime: that the United States wants to seize Venezuelan oil. Like all good myths, it has a grain of truth. It is rooted in Latin America’s history with the US, and it fits into the big story told by leftist classics recently discovered by young North American readers, such as Eduardo Galeano’s Open Veins of Latin America, which reduces everything to an eternal spoil in which innocent, peaceful republics are ravaged by white tyrants thirsty for minerals.

As expected, chavismo, which was already claiming that Venezuela was a US colony in the 1990s, before coming to power, denounced to OPEC that Trump is after the oil reserves and that the offensive will destabilize the energy market. Naturally, he omitted the fact that the only oil company truly active in Venezuela is American, Chevron, and that, according to The New York Times, he offered Trump immensely advantageous conditions to exploit Venezuelan oil in exchange for being allowed to remain in power.

“…it’s the dirtiest, worst oil probably anywhere in the world…”

Donald J. Trump on buying oil from Venezuela.

Yes, Trump seems to incarnate in many ways an anti-imperialist caricature, and yes, Venezuela has the largest crude oil reserves, as many commentaries on the country are careful to remind foreign audiences these days. But that has its nuances, and what matters is how much Venezuela can offer, and how much out of that can really be of interest for the US.

What do those Orinoco Oil Belt reserves mean today for Venezuela and for the US? To what extent would the US want to get its hands on them, and why would it need to remove chavismo to do so? In order to answer these questions, we turned to one of the world’s leading experts on Venezuelan oil, Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program of Baker Institute at Rice University.

Why has the Venezuelan oil industry focused its extraction efforts on the heavy crude extracted from the Orinoco Belt?

Venezuela has abundant extra-heavy resources in the Orinoco Belt and relatively limited reserves of medium and light crude oil in the Lake Maracaibo Basin and northern Monagas. The decline in the Monagas fields has been significant, and to compensate for the loss of production, the Orinoco Belt, or Faja Petrolifera del Orinoco, was developed in Southern Venezuela. It has been active since the state oil industry opened to foreign investment in the 1990s, when technology was developed to make extraction costs reasonable given the much lower oil prices of that era, which became far more attractive after the Belt’s rise. Today, almost 60% of Venezuela’s oil production comes from the Orinoco Belt. The challenge with this crude is that it requires additional processing because it is heavy. Only about 8% of it flows to the surface, compared to the 50% flow rate of conventional crude. Once it’s on the surface, you have to do something to move that heavy crude through a pipeline to the Jose Cryogenic Complex or the ports. When you have upgraders that produce diluents, you can create a closed circuit, making it easier to transport such heavy crude; otherwise, you have to bring in diluents from abroad every time you want to export it. These complications can be solved, and the Orinoco Belt could produce much more crude, more than the smaller, declining fields in the rest of Venezuela, which require much more investment. That’s why the Orinoco Belt is the future of a large part of Venezuela’s oil production.

How true do you think it is that, due to geography and the composition of the available crude, the US should be considered a natural partner and the main destination for Venezuelan oil?

Certainly, the refineries in Texas and Louisiana invested heavily in the capacity to process heavy crudes like Maya from Mexico, Hamaca and Merey 16 from Venezuela, and some from Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. But then Mexican, Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Brazilian output fell, and the supply of heavy crude from Latin America became much more complicated. Canadian extra-heavy crude could fill that gap, but since the Keystone XL pipeline, which could carry 800,000 barrels per day, was never built, it can’t reach Texas and Louisiana from the Alberta sands. So refineries are using more light crude, which is more expensive on the market, and part of their installed capacity remains idle. This also means that if heavy crude production in the Orinoco Belt were to increase, those refineries, which previously imported half a million barrels per day of Venezuelan crude, would have an appetite for importing it. Today, the only Venezuelan oil they have is what Chevron exports, which is currently 120,000 barrels per day. One could even imagine that the Orinoco Belt crude could capture even more market share. Besides, Venezuela won’t be able to export all that heavy crude just to the US. In any scenario, it would need to export a significant amount to India and China, but it’s true that exporting to the US is very attractive for Venezuela, given its proximity and demand, and the US’s interest in Venezuela doing so.

So, the idea that the US needs Venezuelan crude is true, in that respect, although only to a certain extent. Currently, the US is a net exporter of crude oil. It’s no longer the country of the 20th century which imported enormous amounts of oil and at one point consumed around two million barrels of Venezuelan oil per day. Since it started to exploit its fields in Texas in 2006, it no longer needs to import as much. In fact, it views the region’s producers partly as competitors, not as sources it must secure as it was in the past.

But even so, when the US needs to import oil, it needs heavy crude. And it is indeed interested in extracting oil in Venezuela, because of the profits this represents for US companies, and because Venezuela, like Canada, can be a more stable and closer source of supply than the Gulf countries, which concentrate so much production and have so much control over the market, are more remote, and experience regional instability. That’s why the US wants more oil produced in Venezuela, not because they need to import it as before.

If US companies can rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry, as María Corina suggests, how feasible is this reconstruction? How long might this take, and what would be reasonable goals over a five-year period?",https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-8.37.51-PM-1024x452.png,N,,2025-12-02 11:08:00.309991

“We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” she wrote.
The National Lab of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” Robertson wrote.
“Solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are the cheapest and most cost-effective resources in Colorado, and they have been for years.","The longtime name of Colorado’s federal clean energy lab is, as of immediately, no longer usable or renewable. At least until a new presidential administration in 2029.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced late Monday that Golden’s storied, half-century-old National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, is no longer to be referred to as such. The new name: National Laboratory of the Rockies, with a complete “energy” outage.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” assistant secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson said, referring to the 1973 oil crisis in a release posted on the website that at least through Monday night still was using the “nrel.gov” web address. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” she wrote.

Work at the lab is diverse, from advanced manufacturing to perfecting efficiency in solar panels and wind turbines, searching for ways to generate, transmit and store energy more efficiently, and looking for new sources for rare earth metals and better ways to recycle.

The Trump administration’s department changes have severely cut clean energy grants and attempted to reopen markets for coal mining and burning, as well as increased drilling for oil and gas.

“Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand. The National Lab of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” Robertson wrote.

The release says the immediate name change for the lab founded in 1973 “reflects the Trump Administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado.”

Clean energy advocates were dismissive of the name change.

“Solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are the cheapest and most cost-effective resources in Colorado, and they have been for years. Changing NREL’s name will not change that fact,” said Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice in the Rocky Mountains. “The reality is that the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy and its attempts to prop up uneconomic coal and gas plants are increasing costs and causing unnecessary energy affordability burdens for millions of Americans.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211101-Colwell-CoSun-NREL-perovskite-solar-A8C9046.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:59:03.323892

The amendments represent the most significant environmental law reforms since the EPBC Act commenced in 2000, heralding “a new era for the environment and productivity in Australia”, according to Prime Minister Albanese.

As summarised in our previous Insight, the reform package to the EPBC Act comprises seven Acts:

Environment Protection Reform Act 2025 (Reform Act);

National Environmental Protection Agency Act 2025 (NEPA Act);

Environment Information Australia Act 2025 (EIA Act);

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Restoration Charge Imposition) Act 2025 (Restoration Charge Act); and

three separate acts concerning the imposition of general, customs and excise charges under the EPBC Act.

The Acts passed on 28 November 2025, with some elements, namely the transitional provisions and the provisions enabling establishment of the National Environmental Standards (NES), to commence following Assent. The NEPA Act and EIA Act will commence on 1 July 2026, together with parts of the Reform Act that relate to the NEPA. The balance of the Reform Act’s provisions will commence upon proclamation or within 12 months.

This insight explores how key parts of the EPBC Act have changed. We unpack key amendments resulting from the deal and in response to submissions received from the business community, and consider the new draft NES that are open for public comment until 30 January 2026.

Key reforms to environmental law

Several key changes have been introduced.

National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA)

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, section 515AAA and Part 17 and NEPA Act

The NEPA Act establishes the National Environment Protection Agency. Its core functions are to undertake compliance and enforcement activities, including undertaking audits, issuing environment protection orders (EPOs) and monitoring and auditing the operation of bilateral agreements and bioregional plans.

In response to concerns from the business community, amendments were passed to limit the duration of EPOs to a maximum of 14 days (which the CEO of NEPA can only extend by an additional 14 further days). The Minister for Environment and Water (Minister) may delegate any functions (including the power to assess and approve projects), other than those specified in section 515(1A), to the CEO of NEPA.

The CEO of NEPA’s enforcement powers are set out by way of amendments to Part 17 (Enforcement) of the EPBC Act, including powers relating to environment protection orders under a new Division 13A.

Head of Environment Information Australia (HEIA)

Relevant legislation: EIA Act

The EIA Act establishes the Head of Environment Information Australia, an independent leadership position responsible for improving the national availability and accessibility of high-quality environmental data and information.

The HEIA will also be responsible for producing State of Environment reports every two years, establishing environmental economic accounts and declaring national environmental information assets (such as a public environment data portal). The first report must be prepared no later than 15 December 2028 (schedule 3, part 2, section 4).

National Environmental Standards (NES)

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 19B Draft NES

The Minister has new powers to make National Environmental Standards in the form of legislative instruments.

The NES are subject to ‘no regression principles’ under section 514YG, which prevent future variations or revocations to NES weakening environmental protections. To date, two draft NES have been released for public consultation:

Matters of National Environmental Significance; and

Offsets.

The NES need to be taken into account in exercising several functions under the EPBC Act, including at the approval stage of a controlled action under section 136B (discussed below). Further details on NES are outlined below.

Assessment pathways for controlled actions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 8, Division 5A and amendments to section 87

A new 30-day ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway is introduced, replacing the following assessment methods for controlled actions: assessment on referral documentation and a public environment report.

‘Fossil fuel actions’ (that involve producing or extracting petroleum or coal) are expressly excluded from streamlined assessment under section 87(5A).

All assessment pathways for a controlled action now require a proponent to disclose estimates for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions under section 33 and Chapter 4, Divisions 4, 5A, 6 and 7. Further details are outlined below.

Approval tests

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 9, sections 136A, 136B and 136C

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that:

Section 136A – the approval is consistent with any prescribed NES;

Section 136B – the action will not have unacceptable impacts on a protected matter, as defined in section 527F; and

Section 136C – the approval passes the net gain test in section 527K.

The Minister may approve an action that does not meet these tests if the action is a national interest proposal as determined by the Minister under Division 2A of Part 11 or where a national interest exemption applies under Division 3 of Part 11. Fossil fuel actions are expressly excluded from being national interest proposals (section 157A).

The exemption for Regional Forest Agreements will be phased out and will no longer be exempt from application of the EPBC Act. Therefore, it must meet these tests. Further details are outlined below.

Unacceptable impacts

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, section 527F

A new definition of ‘unacceptable impacts’ is introduced that is specific to each matter protected by Part 3. For example, an unacceptable impact is a significant impact that seriously impairs the viability of a listed threatened species.

New definitions of ‘seriously impairs’ and ‘viability’ are also introduced in section 528. A significant impact of an action ‘seriously impairs’ something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in an impairment or alteration of the thing that is of a severe nature or extent.

The Minister is required to consider whether an action will have an ‘unacceptable impact’ in the exercise of several functions under the EPBC Act, notably at the referral stage, under existing section 74B, and at the approval stage under section 136B. Further details are outlined below.

Lapsing of not controlled action decisions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 7, Division 4

New section 79F of the EPBC Act provides that a decision that an action is not a controlled action (NCA) or not a controlled action if taken in a particular manner (NCA-PM) will lapse after five years if the action has not substantially commenced before that time. This does not apply to actions which have already secured such decisions before the Reform Act commences. New section 79G, introduced via the latest round of amendments, allows proponents to request the Minister to extend the lapsing date for up to 10 years from the original decision.

Regional planning

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 12A

Bioregional plans may now be created in conjunction with State and Territory governments. The plans will map ‘development zones’ in which certain registered ‘priority actions’ will not need to be referred or approved under Part 9, and ‘conservation zones’ in which listed ‘restricted actions’ will be prohibited unless they benefit from a Ministerial exemption. Further details are outlined below.

Transitional provisions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Reform Act, Schedule 1, Part 3

A general rule will apply where actions that have been referred before the Reform Act commences (regardless of whether they are assessed or approved before that time) will not be subject to the new NES, unacceptable impacts, net gain compensation, or greenhouse gas disclosure requirements (Reform Act, sections 688 and 690).

Actions which have had a decision on assessment approach will not be impacted by the replacement of the referral documentation and public environment report assessment pathways with the streamlined assessment pathway (Reform Act, section 683).

New referrals will be dealt with under the new requirements.

New sections 79F and 79G regarding NCA and NCA-PM decisions lapsing will apply to all actions which have not yet been subject to a NCA or NCA-PM decision (regardless of whether the action was referred prior to the Reform Act commencing) (Reform Act, section 682).

Generally, the amendments made to Part 5 of the EPBC Act in relation to bilateral agreements apply to bilateral agreements entered into or varied after the commencement of the Reform Act (Reform Act, section 677(1)).

Penalties

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 17, Division 15

The EPBC Act now imposes significantly higher penalties for both individuals and corporations.

Section 481A establishes a new civil penalty calculation method. The maximum penalty for corporations will be the higher of:

50,000 penalty units ($16.5m);

three times the total value of benefits derived or detriments avoided from the contravention; or

10% of annual turnover with a maximum of 2.5m penalty units ($825m).

The maximum penalty for individuals will be the higher of:

50,000 penalty units ($1.65m); or

three times the value of benefits or detriments avoided derived from the contravention.

New ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway for controlled actions

A new 30-day ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway in Division 5A of Part 8 and amendments to section 87 of the EPBC Act replaces the following assessment methods for controlled actions: assessment on referral information and a public environment report. This pathway involves the CEO of NEPA or Secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) preparing a report recommending whether the action should be approved, and if so, the conditions of approval. Following negotiations with the Greens, the government determined that ‘fossil fuel actions’ (that involve the production or extraction of petroleum or coal) are excluded from this assessment pathway.

The Minister may only decide to proceed with the streamlined assessment method for an action if satisfied that the approach will allow the Minister to make an informed decision on whether to approve the action. Accordingly, the Minister will need to have all necessary information to decide whether to approve it. This incentivises proponents to provide as much information upfront during the referral stage if seeking the benefits of a quicker streamlined assessment.

After deciding that an action must be assessed by streamlined assessment, the Minister has 30 business days to decide whether to approve the action. Within this 30 day period, the CEO of NEPA or Secretary of DCCEEW must prepare a report to the Minister recommending whether the action should be approved and any conditions of approval. However, requests for further information from the proponent may still ‘stop the clock’ during this period.

All assessment pathways (now comprising accredited assessment, assessment on preliminary documentation, streamlined assessment, environmental impact statement and public inquiry), require proponents to also provide information about their scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, either by disclosing a reasonable estimate of emissions, or stating that their emissions are below a prescribed amount. This information will be publicised on the DCCEEW’s website – whether as part of the action’s referral material, or separately.

New approval tests

Consistency with draft NES

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that, taking into account the conditions to be imposed, the approval is consistent with the new national environmental standards (as applicable) (discussed further below). Amendments were introduced to reverse the test so that the Minister must now be satisfied that an approval is ‘consistent’ rather than ‘not inconsistent’, increasing the standard of the test.

Unacceptable impacts

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that, taking into account the conditions to be imposed, the action will not have unacceptable impacts on protected matters. The Reform Act defines what was previously a discretionary consideration, as to what are ‘unacceptable impacts’.

To respond to concerns from the business community, amendments were introduced in the last round of Bill amendments to clarify the new unacceptable impacts test by removing the reference to ‘likelihood’. In other words, the test no longer considers whether an action is likely to have unacceptable impacts.

The meaning of unacceptable impacts is specific to each particular matter of national environmental significance (MNES) (new section 527F). It includes, for example, a significant impact that seriously impairs the viability of a listed threatened species. The definition of ‘seriously impair’ has also been amended. A significant impact of an action now ‘seriously impairs’ something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in an impairment or alteration of the thing that is of a severe nature or extent. This creates a higher standard (and thus will capture less impacts) than the previously proposed definition, which was where the impact results in the thing being seriously altered for the worse, having regard to the nature, intensity, duration, magnitude, geographic extent and context of the impact.

Part 7, Division 1A of the EPBC Act already empowers the Minister to decide to refuse an action at the referral stage based on the action having clearly unacceptable impacts.

Residual significant impact – net gain test

The Minister must not approve an action that will have or is likely to have a residual significant impact on a MNES unless the Minister is satisfied that, taking into account any conditions to be attached to the approval, the approval passes the net gain test.

New section 527J of the EPBC Act defines ‘residual significant impact’ as a significant impact which cannot be avoided, mitigated or repaired in the course of taking the action or complying with any approval conditions.

The net gain test is defined in new section 527K of the EPBC Act. An approval will pass the net gain test if:

the approval conditions the holder to either compensate for damage to the matter that has been caused by the residual significant impact or pay a restoration contribution charge; and

compliance with the condition(s) results in a net gain for the matter that is at least equivalent to the prescribed net gain for that matter, or that the Minister is satisfied is appropriate.

A draft NES has been released on the topic of offsets which provides a framework for determining the conditions, including to manage residual significant impacts and pass the net gain test (Draft Offsets Standard). Further information about the Draft Offsets Standard is provided below.

The Restoration Charge Imposition Act provides for the imposing of restoration contribution charges on relevant approvals; however, it does not set out the amounts of the charges. Regulations (not yet released) will set out the charge amounts either by prescribing a flat rate or a method to calculate the amount of the charge.

National interest exemption

Pre-reform, the EPBC Act already allowed the Minister to declare that specific actions are exempt from requirements such as assessment or approval if the action is in the national interest (see section 158).

The Reform Act extends the scope of the national interest exemption. The Minister may now:

approve actions that do not meet the new approval criteria regarding inconsistency with NES, unacceptable impacts and the net gain test for actions with residual significant impacts;

require conditions to be attached to an action covered by a national interest exemption and providing for a set period for which such an exemption is granted; and

grant national interest exemptions on its own initiative as well as on application. The aim of this is to allow for quicker responses to national emergencies such as bushfires.

Following concessions, the national interest exemption will not apply to ‘fossil fuel actions’, being actions involving the production or extraction of petroleum or coal.

the Minister must not accredit a framework without being satisfied that it provides for appropriate disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions information (section 46(3)(j)).

the Minister may exclude an action from a bilateral agreement (essentially, having a ‘call-in’ power for actions); and

approval processes for coal seam gas and large coal mining projects that will or are likely to have a significant impact on water resources (known as the ‘water trigger’) will remain with the Commonwealth (sections 29 and 46(1)).

There is a general rule that the amendments made to Part 5 of the EPBC Act in relation to bilateral agreements only apply to bilateral agreements entered into or varied after the commencement of the Reform Act (Reform Act, section 677(1)).

Draft National Environmental Standards

Under the new Part 19B, the Minister has the power to create NES by legislative instrument. Before making an NES, the Minister must be satisfied that the standard will promote the objects of the EPBC Act and align with Australia’s obligations under international agreements specified in the EPBC Act.

DCCEEW has released two draft NES for public consultation until 5pm AEDT on 30 January 2026.

Draft Matters of National Environmental Significance Standard (MNES Standard)

The MNES Standard Policy Position and Legislative Instrument were released for consultation on 5 November 2025. If legislated, the Minister must be satisfied that for actions under Part 9, any decision on whether to approve an action and the conditions to attach to an approval are consistent with the MNES Standard. Principles that apply to the Minister’s decision under the MNES Standards are:

Actions appropriately consider the application of the mitigation hierarchy: a four-step hierarchy to limit the adverse impact of a development on protected matters, being avoidance, mitigation, repair and offsets, in that order;

Actions appropriately consider impacts to protected matters: including direct and indirect impacts to matters of national significance, ‘landscape scale’ impacts and the ‘broader context’ of past, present and reasonably foreseeable events, circumstances or threats affecting a protected matter;

Actions with residual significant impacts to protected matters are compensated: a last resort in the mitigation hierarchy, with requirements further expanded on by the Offsets Standard (see below); and

Actions are supported by evidence.

Draft Environmental Offsets Standard (Offsets Standard)

The Offsets Standard Policy Position and Legislative Instrument were released for consultation on 10 November 2025. The Offsets Standard is intended to be used in determining what conditions to impose on an approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act where there is a residual significant impact to protected matters.

The Offsets Standard can only be considered by the Minister where the impact to a protected matter is not unacceptable and can be compensated for under the EPBC Act. In this case, the following eight principles would be applied collectively to the Minister’s decision:

Feasibility: the delivery of offset activities should be feasible and based on appropriate and suitable data and information that show the activity will likely contribute to recovery or conservation;

Security: offset activities are securely protected and the site of the offset activity is managed to prevent its loss and degradation (such as by legal mechanisms like covenants on land titles);

Direct and tangible: offset activities should provide a direct, tangible and quantifiable benefit by contribution to the overall recovery and conservation of the affected protected matter;

Measurable improvements: offset activities should deliver measurable improvements relative to a baseline;

Additionality: offset activities should deliver benefits that are additional to any existing conversation activities, investment and regulatory obligations;

Like-for-like: offset activities should provide a like-for-like outcome for the affected protected matter (meaning the offset replaces, restores or protects the same kind of environmental feature or habitat that was impacted);

Relevant area: offset activities should be delivered in an area that is ecologically relevant to the affected protected matter and will enhance the effectiveness of conservation and recovery efforts; and

Offsets commenced prior to impact: offsets should be secured and should commence at the offset site prior to the relevant impact starting at the impact site.

Further draft NES

A draft First Nations Standard is set to be released separately, relating to specific engagement with First Nations people. Minister Murray Watt indicated in Parliament that this standard may be released by the end of the year, or in early 2026. He also stated that he expects to create each of the NES recommended by the Samuel Review, with a Community Consultation Standard and Data and Information Standard currently being drafted.

Bioregional Planning

The EPBC Act contains two regional planning mechanisms that facilitate consideration of cumulative impacts at a landscape scale: bioregional plans and strategic assessment. Following the 2021 Samuel Review’s recommendations, the reforms expand the scope for making bioregional plans and enable environmental management at a landscape scale.

Most of the existing provisions pertaining to bioregional plans have been repealed, and a new Part 12A has been introduced. Section 177AA now allows the Minister to make bioregional plans that apply not only to a Commonwealth area (as was historically the case), but also to a State or Territory area. The plans will apply from the date they commence until they are revoked (new section 177AC), must be consistent with any applicable NES, and will map:

Development Zones, or ‘go zones’ in which priority actions that are registered with the Minister can be undertaken without referral or approval under Part 9, and

Conservation Zones, or ‘no go zones’ in which restricted actions will be prohibited unless proponents have obtained an exemption.

Priority actions in development zones

The bioregional plans will specify, for each development zone, a ‘priority class of actions’ that may have a significant impact on a MNES but will not require approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act (new sections 37 and 177AC). Bioregional plans may attach conditions to undertaking a priority action in a development zone (new section 177AG). Fossil fuel actions (that involve the production or extraction of petroleum or coal) cannot be a priority class of actions.

Proponents seeking to take a priority action in a development zone must have their priority action registered by the Minister before undertaking it to avoid committing an offence (new sections 177BN and 177CB). They will not be required to make a referral or seek further approval under the EPBC Act. Proponents must, however, take the priority action in accordance with any relevant conditions imposed by the bioregional plan (new sections 37 and 177BB).

A bioregional plan must specify restoration measures for the region that the Minister is satisfied are necessary or convenient to mitigate, repair or compensate for the impact priority actions cause to protected matters (new section 177AH). This could include a measure requiring the payment of a specified amount (a ‘bioregional plan restoration contribution‘). The new Part 12B establishes a Restoration Contributions Holder, a DCCEEW employee that will be charged with delivering restoration actions and investing funds on behalf of the Commonwealth.

Restricted actions in conservation zones

Conservation zones would prohibit restricted actions, creating ‘no-go’ zones of environmental protection unless the proponent obtains an exemption from the Minister (new section 177AK). To grant an exemption, the Minister must be satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, or that the national interest exemption applies (see new section 177BV). No exemptions can be granted for ‘fossil fuel actions’.

Changes to land clearing arrangements

Changes have also been made to the provisions regulating how land clearing has historically been dealt with under the EPBC Act, specifically:

The Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) exemption will be phased out: RFAs have historically been exempt from the application of Part 3 of the EPBC Act, under section 38. Following negotiations between the government and the Greens, the Reform Act was amended to remove the exemption for high-risk land clearing and RFAs with a sunset period of 12 months beginning on 1 July 2026; and

The ‘continuous use’ exception is removed the day after the Reform Act receives Assent for land clearing located within 50 metres of a watercourse, wetland or drainage lines in a catchment area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and for land that has not been cleared for 15 years (provided the action is not a forestry operation).

The future of environmental protection in Australia

The recent reforms to the EPBC Act represent a comprehensive overhaul of Australia’s environmental regulatory framework, introducing new agencies, higher standards, and more robust mechanisms for assessment, approval, and enforcement. These changes are set to have far-reaching implications for proponents, regulators, and the broader community, particularly in relation to project approvals, environmental offsets, and the management of MNES. As the new regime comes into effect, it is essential for all stakeholders to familiarise themselves with the amended requirements, monitor the development of NES, and actively participate in ongoing consultations. Now is the time for organisations to review their current and proposed activities and assess compliance with the new provisions.",https://www.corrs.com.au/site-uploads/images/banners/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/25_WEBART065_Environment-Protection-and-Biodiversity_1400x450_Web.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 02:58:04.327688

If there were a dictionary entry for Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drill, baby, drill”, it might be accompanied by a photo of Meg O’Neill.

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company’s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana’s history.

The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That’s basically equivalent to Woodside’s combined Australian operations. Trump’s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash “American energy dominance”. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking.

Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is “open for business”, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer.

We are bending the rules of this column: O’Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O’Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O’Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. “I like American-style filtered coffee,” she says. “I brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.”

O’Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh – and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John’s on Newfoundland island.

In 2018, O’Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet – “I had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ approach to who I was at work,” she says – but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company.

This is O’Neill’s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is “drill, baby, drill”, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

That includes an embarrassing 58 per cent of shareholders who voted against the company’s climate report at last year’s annual meeting, and a legal challenge to Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to approve an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG project to 2070. The UN’s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae.

It doesn’t rattle O’Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels.

She says Trump’s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia.

“It’s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,” O’Neill says.

“It’s opening the conversation up to one that’s not just, ‘We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else’, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.”

O’Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy.

In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O’Neill calls “highly ambitious”. “I don’t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,” she says.

How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. “While there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,” she says.

“The question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input – that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry – has not been addressed. You’re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That’s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.”

O’Neill’s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it “very tasty”. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid.

For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found – from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

In the Australian National University’s recent study on the 2025 election, the proportion of voters who ranked climate change as their most important issue fell to 5 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2022.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O’Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby’s bidding.

“In Australia, there’s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,” she says.

“So, I don’t know if it’s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it’s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it’s going to end up being poor for the consumers.” She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. “It’s not good for anyone.”

But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent a year – more than the annual emissions of some countries – despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country’s largest untapped conventional gas resource.

Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.

New laws that passed the federal parliament last week are a mixed bag for gas producers; coal and gas projects are not eligible for new “streamlined” approval pathways following negotiations with the Greens, but they may benefit from moves to eliminate duplication between state and federal assessments.

Part of this is, again, the Trump effect. Australia’s critical minerals deal with the US, agreed in principle during Anthony Albanese’s recent trip to Washington, means getting rare earth projects off the ground quickly. “Drill, baby, drill” is becoming not just a slogan but a policy the US exports to its allies.

O’Neill lays out a stark reality for a global company such as Woodside, which is eyeing a roughly 50-50 revenue split between Australia and the US early next decade. The US has plenty of gas, favourable taxation rates and a relatively quick process for environmental approvals. In Louisiana, the combined state and federal tax rate will be about 25 per cent, she says, compared with an effective all-in rate in Australia of 46 per cent.

“We have to ask ourselves first and foremost: where is the resource? Australia compares quite favourably to the US [on that],” she says.

“Where do we have confidence we can progress investments at a reasonable pace and generate returns for our shareholders? That’s where we’re fighting some headwinds in Australia.”

There has been speculation Woodside could shift its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but O’Neill says that’s not true. “We intend to maintain our primary listing in Australia.”

Before we leave, I ask O’Neill about life in Perth. She lives in City Beach with her wife, Vicky Hayes, and their teen daughter. Despite its isolation, O’Neill enjoys the relaxed pace and what she calls an “entrepreneurial spirit” that seems to imbue west coast cities.

“I like that feel of a city where people are ready to roll up their sleeves and make a difference,” she says. “It’s got a bit of the wild west to it.”

An NFL fan who backs the Houston Texans, O’Neill has been forcibly acquainted with Australian rules football, courtesy of Woodside’s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers. Woodside chairman Richard Goyder is also the outgoing chair of the AFL Commission.

O’Neill says she found the rules “a little fuzzy” and difficult to follow at first, but is now a convert and attends half a dozen matches a year. “I love the game. It’s fast-paced, it’s high scoring, there’s tremendous athleticism. It’s the full package.”

Not that the rules have gotten any easier to understand. “Like, why was this thing a push in the back and that thing was not?”

I could try to explain, but our time is up, and O’Neill is off – more meetings, and more drilling, await.

Texas A&M Forest Service’s Texas Resilient Landscapes Initiative is offering $3.2 million in cost-share funding over the next four years.

The initiative is focused on supporting reforestation efforts in areas vulnerable to risk of loss from disaster or environmental change. The agency is accepting funding applications now through Jan. 23.

“Forested and riparian ecosystems across Texas are increasingly threatened by natural disasters and weather extremes,” said Erin Davis, Texas A&M Forest Service program coordinator. “This cost-share initiative will help landowners replant their properties with native woodland species to establish a more resilient and sustainable forest for the future.”

Landowner eligibility and allowances

Non-federal, non-industrial forest landowners, including tribal and local governments, are eligible. Tracts must be 10-150 acres in size and lost trees to a natural disaster, disease or weather extremes in the past 10 years.

Reimbursable practices include:

Site preparation through shredding or mulching at $168.75 per acre or prescribed fire at $27.50 per acre.

Planting trees through bareroot or containerized seedlings at $5.60 per seedling, riparian live cuttings at $375 per acre and/or direct seeding at $337.50 per acre. Landowners must include one type of planting in the planned practices.

Temporary browse protection or barriers to prevent animal damage at $4.90 per seedling.

“Reforestation is an essential part of sustaining the next generation of trees in our forests and woodlands,” Davis said. “We hope to support the restoration of natural landscapes by providing funding to landowners who may have lost trees to natural causes such as fire, flood, disease and drought.”

The program will prioritize projects in areas with gaps in existing funding opportunities for landscape-scale forest restoration and recovery, such as the woodlands in Central and West Texas.

T Diamond Bar and Montrose Environmental worked closely with the Clean Energy team to complete South Fork facility.","Clean Energy Fuels Corp. has announced it has successfully completed its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility located at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas. The facility is now producing pipeline-quality RNG and has begun injecting into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

Now one of the largest RNG production plants in the country, South Fork is home to a herd of 16,000 dairy cows and has the capability to produce approximately 2.6 million gallons of low-carbon RNG annually. The facility will process up to 300,000 gallons of dairy manure each day utilizing the four anaerobic digesters on-site, along with manure processing and advanced gas conversion equipment. The RNG produced is injected directly into an on-site gas line. Financed entirely by Clean Energy, the project broke ground in July 2024 and totaled $85 million. Clean Energy will receive 100% of the RNG fuel produced at South Fork Dairy.

“The requirements to reach production and injecting milestones were extremely stringent and we are incredibly proud of the team for getting our seventh RNG facility online, on time and on budget. It’s no small feat,” said Clay Corbus SVP at Clean Energy. “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply to ensure we have the volumes needed to meet the growing fleet demand, but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

“Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us,” said Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy. “We’re processing our manure into useful bedding and producing clean, useful fuel for vehicles – it’s pretty amazing stuff. Being a part of something so circular that allows the dairy to reduce its emissions while providing an additional income stream is an added bonus.”

During construction, the project temporarily paused due to a fire that impacted the dairy. South Fork’s owner, Frank Brand, and his team rebuilt the dairy working closely with Clean Energy to navigate this. Today, both the dairy and the RNG facility are fully restored and operating – an outcome that is testament to the determination of the South Fork and Clean Energy teams.

The RNG produced at South Fork Dairy has received full approval from the U.S. EPA to begin generating renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Clean Energy also expects to generate California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits in Q1, 2026. Clean Energy continues to expand its fueling network nationwide with over 600 stations RNG is delivered to.

T Diamond Bar and Montrose Environmental worked closely with the Clean Energy team to complete South Fork facility.

Agriculture accounts for nearly 10% of U.S. GHG emissions and the transportation sector accounts for another 28%, according to the EPA. Capturing methane from farm waste lowers these emissions. RNG, produced by that captured methane and used as a transportation fuel, significantly lowers GHG emissions on a lifecycle basis when compared to diesel. This allows RNG to be one of the only fuels to receive a negative carbon-intensity score based on the reduction of emissions at the source and at the vehicle and costs significantly less than diesel at the pump.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Energy_Dec2025_a44ddbf887.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 22:59:05.947089

The Wayne County Commission unanimously approved a resolution brought by Commissioner Martha Scott Oct. 2 in opposition to a license renewal for US Ecology.
US Ecology has received dozens of state violations for air quality noncompliance at the Frederick Street facility since 2014, as Planet Detroit reported in September.
The company said the source of the “alleged offsite odors” is a facility slightly downwind of US Ecology.","An environmental coalition is calling for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South, a hazardous waste treatment facility on Detroit’s lower east side with a pending license renewal application.

Residents held signs that said “stop odors now,” “we can’t breathe,” and “end the stench, dust, fumes, fires, asthma, waste” at a press conference held Monday by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments.

Neighbors of the hazardous waste facility, elected officials, and environmental activists urged the state to address odor and safety concerns and deny US Ecology’s license renewal.

No permits should be issued for US Ecology until it shows it has followed the law, said state Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips, whose district is located just north of US Ecology’s location at 1923 Frederick St., southeast of the I-75 and I-94 interchange.

“Every family in this room and in our community has the right to breathe clean air,” Myers Phillips said at the press conference, held at the Hamtramck Public Library. “Simply put, US Ecology has to follow the rules like everybody else.”

Resident KT Morelli said that US Ecology should “shut down, at the very least, until the odor problem is resolved.” If the permit for the facility cannot be denied, the state should put a hold on the process, she said.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, “has tolerated serial permit violators for too long,” she said.

The Wayne County Commission unanimously approved a resolution brought by Commissioner Martha Scott Oct. 2 in opposition to a license renewal for US Ecology.

“No one should have to endure what people living near this site have had to endure, in terms of odor, dust, and the outdoor storage of hazardous, flammable, and potentially hazardous materials,” Scott said in a statement.

Kinga Osz-Kemp, who moved to her home a half-mile from US Ecology 18 years ago, said she thought for a long time that the problem in the neighborhood was the trash incinerator.

The notorious Detroit Renewable Power incinerator closed in 2019 after 30 years of operation.

After the trash incinerator’s closure, Osz-Kemp said she “was able to smell the isolated smells from US Ecology,” describing the odors as rotten fish, lime, and “weird chemical smells.”

EGLE, which regulates US Ecology, is still evaluating comments it received during the public comment period for the license renewal, spokesperson Josef Greenberg Stephens told Planet Detroit in an email Monday.

The agency is also awaiting resolution of air quality violations issued to US Ecology, Greenberg Stephens said: “A final decision will not occur until these steps are completed.”

The environmental regular appreciates the engagement of the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments and the Wayne County Commission in the licensing progress, Greenberg Stephens said.

“EGLE is aware of the issues and is working with US Ecology South to identify and implement effective, sustainable solutions.”

Melissa Quillard, a Republic Services spokesperson, said in an emailed statement that US Ecology provides a “safe, essential hazardous waste disposal for hundreds of businesses across Michigan and the Midwest.”

Recent upgrades at the facility include a “state-of-the-art tank system, improved storage processes, enhanced waste handling procedures, and a new on-site lab for material testing,” she said in response to a request for comment on the calls for a shutdown.

“To address community concerns about odor, the facility recently updated its odor management plan, added a fourth air monitoring station and is evaluating additional air pollution controls,” Quillard said, adding that US Ecology hosts quarterly public meetings and has a website where residents can sign up for email updates and connect with the company.

US Ecology has received dozens of state violations for air quality noncompliance at the Frederick Street facility since 2014, as Planet Detroit reported in September.

The most recent violation issued by EGLE, dated Oct. 10, followed the investigation of an odor complaint. The state found “persistent and objectionable fishy/oily/gas odors of moderately strong intensity” that it attributed to US Ecology’s Chem-Fix operations, “impacting residential areas downwind of the facility.”

In its response to the state agency, US Ecology said no odor was identified in its Chem-Fix operations. The company said the source of the “alleged offsite odors” is a facility slightly downwind of US Ecology.

In July 2024, the state and US Ecology reached a consent agreement that redresses multiple violations issued to the facility between 2021 and 2023, including improper storage of hazardous waste, a fire, and a leak that posed a contamination threat to groundwater.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coalition1-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 21:00:33.104652

But the question is whether those costs will reach the residential utility payers on their home electric bills.
Data centers in Port Washington and Mount Pleasant alone will use more energy than the rest of the consumers in the state.
Content explained that it took 120 years for We Energies to grow from 1 kilowatt to a gigawatt to five gigawatts of energy capacity but these two data centers will double that capacity need in a few years with more large-scale data centers coming, like a Meta data center in Beaver Dam.
“We’re in this inflationary environment already and now here come data centers,” Content said.","(The Center Square) – Increased energy use from artificial intelligence data centers in Wisconsin will have a cost.

But the question is whether those costs will reach the residential utility payers on their home electric bills.

“And the tech companies are saying the right things and the utilities are saying the right things,” Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin Executive Director Tom Content said at a recent Wisconsin Technology Council panel on data centers. “All of our commission chairs are saying the right things that the cost causers are meant to pay.”

A big part of the reality is capacity, how much energy data centers need and how much the state’s utilities have to offer.

Alliant Energy’s Becky Valcq explained that utilities have constant infrastructure costs to ensure that the lights turn on when someone flips on a switch at their home or office. Having new large-scale customers like data centers that pay a large portion of infrastructure costs through their payment agreements with utilities can then offset those ongoing costs, which are a large portion of the bill that consumers pay.

“When we talk about growth, from a utility perspective, especially a utility that has a largely rural service territory, growth is good,” said Valcq, Alliant’s assistant vice president of regulatory affairs and data center services. “Why is it good? It’s because of all those fixed costs that we have regardless. The more customers we bring on, the lower those fixed costs are for all of our customers.”

Power capacity, however, is a large issue in the matter. Data centers in Port Washington and Mount Pleasant alone will use more energy than the rest of the consumers in the state.

It’s why Wisconsin leaders are pushing tax breaks for new nuclear plants.

Content explained that it took 120 years for We Energies to grow from 1 kilowatt to a gigawatt to five gigawatts of energy capacity but these two data centers will double that capacity need in a few years with more large-scale data centers coming, like a Meta data center in Beaver Dam.

“We’re in this inflationary environment already and now here come data centers,” Content said. “The utilities do have an obligation to serve and it’s always a question of at what time is the system ready for this project and can the system accommodate it?”

Data centers are expected to lead to the average American’s energy bill increasing from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

The data centers are being brought in and given large-scale tax benefits, such as incentives negating property taxes along with sales taxes on everything from construction to servers to electricity, without the promise of many new employees and question marks on the lifespan of the developments.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/2e/52e491d0-a640-4768-939c-bd8baf7c710a/69025d10eaee7.image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:55.966258

Round 1B offers $50 million of funding to support solar PV manufacturing studies, including feasibility and engineering studies (remains open).","The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has today announced up to $151 million in conditional funding under the Australian Government’s $1 billion Solar Sunshot Program (Solar Sunshot) for the establishment of a 500 MW per annum solar module manufacturing facility in the Hunter Valley, NSW.

The funding will support the development of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry project, an initiative of the Sunman Group (Sunman) founded by solar pioneer and UNSW alumnus Dr Zhengrong Shi. The project will develop a new, advanced manufacturing facility while drawing on Sunman’s pioneering technology and track-record as a lightweight solar innovator.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project is a clear demonstration of Solar Sunshot’s mission to advance solar manufacturing in Australia, reduce reliance on imports and expand Australia’s role in global clean energy supply chains.

“Deployment of solar photovoltaics at scale is central to meeting our long-term emissions goals. Building our manufacturing capabilities will help ensure that our supply chains are resilient and Australian innovations are supported as we accelerate the rollout of solar PV,” Mr Miller said.

“Solar Sunshot is about building on Australia’s world-leading solar research to expand manufacturing capacity, strengthen supply-chain resilience and grow local jobs and skills. The Hunter Valley Solar Foundry project reflects these goals, bringing together advanced technology, local workforce development and long-term economic benefits for regional communities.”

The proposed facility aims to produce a range of solar PV modules for use in domestic and international markets, including Sunman’s proprietary enhanced Architecture Ready Composite (eArc) modules, which replace traditional glass with durable polymers, making them up to 70% lighter, easier to transport and faster to install. Beyond manufacturing eArc modules, the facility aims to produce glass modules, develop a solar innovation hub to support the commercialisation of new solar technologies and operate as a solar manufacturing foundry with the ability to provide production capacity to original equipment manufacturers, further strengthening Australia’s domestic solar supply chain.

This project also marks a homecoming for Dr Shi who began his pioneering solar research in Australia before global ambitions took him abroad to scale-up solar manufacturing. With Solar Sunshot backing, this new facility will bring world-leading solar expertise back to Australian shores, reaffirming Australia’s strength in solar innovation and positioning Australian-made technology to contribute to the global energy transition.

Construction of the facility is expected to create up to 200 jobs, with another 100 ongoing roles once operational. To support long-term workforce development, the project will also partner with an accredited training partner to deliver an advanced manufacturing training program, ensuring local workers can build capability in next-generation solar production.

The project further incorporates a First Nations recruitment strategy and a scholarship program to support students pursuing studies in renewable-energy fields, ensuring the benefits of Solar Sunshot extend across the community.

Dr Shi, Founder of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry, says: “I am proud to establish the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry and bring commercial-scale renewable manufacturing to Australia. Once established, the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry will be the largest manufacturer of solar photovoltaic modules in Australia, and the only one in NSW, delivering world-leading products to residential, commercial and utility customers around the country.

“As a proud Australian and a solar expert trained at the University of NSW, it has been my long-held ambition to establish solar module manufacturing in Australia, and it is my hope that over time the Foundry supports the foundation of a vertically-integrated solar supply chain in Australia. This is an important milestone in Australia’s energy transition.”

At a US starting price of around $50,000, the Optiq is the most affordable Cadillac EV.
This is the smallest and shortest Cadillac, and the front two-thirds of the Optiq largely echo the other EV models in the lineup.
The Optiq also lacks a rear wiper, whereas the Chevrolet Equinox EV that shares its basic understructure has one as standard.
The Cadillac Optiq is probably one of the quietest cars we’ve ever driven, even for an EV.","This largish “compact” crossover SUV is luxurious, quiet, and offers substantial range along with premium features, making it a truly competitive luxury EV—and shoppers are noticing.

The conversion of GM’s luxury brand Cadillac to an all-electric product line has been a quietly seismic event over the last decade. The brand is finding (it says) newer, younger and more tech-forward buyers, versus the aging customers who bought its luxury land barges of yore. But while the Lyriq mid-sized crossover SUV went on sale in July 2022, the electric model that may be Cadillac’s most important EV globally didn’t land in showrooms for more than two years after that.

The Optiq, a largish “compact” crossover SUV, could become the luxury brand’s highest-volume vehicle worldwide. At a US starting price of around $50,000, the Optiq is the most affordable Cadillac EV. But it’s also assembled in Mexico, making it subject to tariffs when or if the ever-shifting landscape of trade policy settles down. Still, by the second quarter of this year, it was Cadillac’s second-best selling electric model in the US after the well-established Lyriq.

The Optiqs we’ve driven have been calm and quiet inside, with elegant fabrics and trim to cosset occupants. Overall, the Optiq is perfect for long-distance travel or around-town use—and perhaps the best environment for GM’s excellent Super Cruise hands-free adaptive cruise control, which now includes automatic lane changes.

Cadillac’s small SUV isn’t perfect: the exterior styling is more of a judgment call, and the rear quarters are downright peculiar. It’s missing a front trunk and a rear wiper, and neither Android Auto nor Apple CarPlay can be included (in the US) no matter how loud buyers scream. Acceleration of the standard versions is deliberate, though we’ve not yet driven the Optiq-V performance model. That one received rave reviews from both buff books and general outlets.

Two thirds handsome?

This is the smallest and shortest Cadillac, and the front two-thirds of the Optiq largely echo the other EV models in the lineup. It’s at the rear where things start to go wrong—perhaps from designers trying too hard to be avant-garde in the brand’s shortest vehicle. The combination of a beltline that kicks up, the very short overhang behind the rear wheels, the signature vertical rear lights running up the side of the tailgate, and a strange pattern on the third side windows that superimposes lines that aren’t actually horizontal is just incoherent.

It offers a little too much visual stimulation in too small a space. The rest of Cadillac’s electric SUVs, as well as the Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan, use the same design cues to better and more pleasing effect.

With a high beltline, only the Optiq’s glass roof gives the interior enough light to prevent a slightly claustrophobic feel. Once you get there, though, the interior is splendid. Fabrics feel like real woven cloth, though they’re auto-interior-grade durable, and Cadillac has pulled off the delicate act of using mild bright-blue accent trim just enough—but not too much. US buyers historically haven’t cared about the sustainability of a car’s interior, but the Optiq uses what it calls PaperWood veneer (ingredients include tulip wood and recycled newspaper) and patterned accent fabrics made of yarn from 100% recycled feedstock.

Deliberate acceleration—until the Optiq-V appears

An 85-kilowatt-hour battery pack powers two drive motors with combined output of 224 kilowatts (300 horsepower) and 354 pound-feet (480 newton-meters) of torque. All-wheel drive is standard.

Acceleration of the standard Optiq can best be termed deliberate. It’s fine for standard use, and—if any Cadillac owner ever uses it—the Sport mode adds some punch. The standard Optiq just doesn’t offer the kind of kick-in-the-back acceleration found in Teslas. That’s left to the recently announced Optiq-V performance model, whose power rises to 382 kW (519 hp) with 650 lb-ft (880 N-m) of torque. Cadillac says the Optiq-V will rocket from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds if drivers use its Velocity Max mode. The Optiq-V goes into production this autumn as the priciest model in the Optiq range, starting at $68,795, with a range that GM estimates at 275 miles.

The compact Cadillac holds the road fine and is easy to drive—the weight and suspension are tuned to make potholes less jarring and smooth bad road surfaces. GM has superbly calibrated regenerative braking and one-pedal driving algorithms, and the Optiq’s learning curve overall shouldn’t be as steep as that for a Tesla or other entirely screen-based EVs.

The Optiq hardly leads the pack on charging speed, however. The difference in fast charging times is only a few minutes, but Cadillac is behind in the specs war against 800-volt EVs like the Genesis GV60, which charges at up to 300 kilowatts. On our Optiq road test, the fastest rate we saw was 107 kW (at a station rated for 150 kW) while taking the battery from a 25 percent to a 60 percent charge—after preconditioning before we arrived at the charging site. Cadillac claims the Optiq can gain up to 79 miles of range in only 10 minutes, though that’s the usual manufacturer statistic achieved under ideal circumstances of battery temperature, ambient temperature and low state of charge. As they say, your mileage may vary. The onboard AC charger is capable of up to 11.5 kW.

Optiqs built through most of 2025 use a CCS fast charging port. However, the upcoming Optiq-V will have a native NACS (SAE J3400) connector built in—the first GM electric vehicle so equipped. The company said in June 2023 that it would adopt NACS across its portfolio. Now, more than two years later, it’s starting to happen; the rest of the Optiq line will likely follow suit.

The combined range rating from the EPA presently sits at 302 miles, which likely means around 260 miles at highway speeds using climate control. Crucially for road trips, that’s still beyond the distance many drivers can comfortably go without a rest stop.

Silent, spacious and Super Cruise

Interior space in the Optiq is ample for four. It’s large enough, even as a so-called compact SUV, to accommodate three people in the rear seat without making them elbow or jostle each other. But like all of GM’s current EV lineup except for the huge trucks, the Optiq has no front trunk—a missed opportunity to underscore an EV advantage that cars with combustion engines simply can’t offer. The Optiq also lacks a rear wiper, whereas the Chevrolet Equinox EV that shares its basic understructure has one as standard. The luxury brand claims airflow through the Optiq’s “rear flow-through spoiler” directs air over the glass at a high enough velocity to keep the rear window clean. After several spring deluges en route, we disagree. Cadillac also suggested that we use the video rear-view mirror function (instead of a rear window we could see through).

The Cadillac Optiq is probably one of the quietest cars we’ve ever driven, even for an EV. The experience of driving or riding in an Optiq is calm, smooth, pleasant, and altogether nice inside. That makes it an easy vehicle in which to cover miles—especially with the Super Cruise hands-off adaptive cruise control. Many analysts view Super Cruise as the best of the small number of hands-off adaptive cruise control systems offered in cars.

For the last year or so, the system has included automatic lane changes: it will check to ensure the overtaking lane is clear, signal, change lanes, pass the other car, then return to the slower lane. (That last step will be particularly appreciated by everyone who’s sat behind a driver going far too slow in the fast, or overtaking, lane.) Cadillac and other GM brands alert the driver to both lane departures and upcoming lane changes by vibrating the driver’s seat bolster on the relevant side. That conveys the message to the driver, without alerting other occupants as audible warning tones do. Drivers appreciate that.

Google Maps in the dash routes the Optiq among charging stations en route once drivers enter a destination into the system that exceeds the car’s range. Anyone who’s used Google Maps before will find that the mapping and routing works predictably enough, though it’s still not quite up to Tesla standards of seamlessness. Nor are the various charging stations among which the Optiq routes itself, operated by multiple networks, nearly as reliable as Superchargers. The system notes a charging site is “slow,” “fast,” or “very fast”—and importantly, it preconditions the battery automatically if it knows it’s headed for a DC fast charging site.

No phone mirroring (for US buyers)

One feature most buyers will likely expect—but not find—is phone mirroring into the central touchscreen via Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid have never offered mirroring, and GM has chosen to remove it from its latest electric vehicles (in the US—it’s still right there in the dash for buyers in at least some other countries).

So, drivers and family members will have to remember their user names and passwords for the dozen or more apps in the dash they use regularly. (Do you remember your Spotify login info?) The Optiq gives access to those apps via its cellular connection. For three years. Then the hammer comes down: owners who want to continue to use their apps must pay Cadillac to continue to receive “App Access” beyond that. The fee is $15 each month, or it can be bundled into plans for OnStar and other features. Note that the App Access fee is on top of the $25-per-month cost to continue Super Cruise, which has its own 36-month free trial period.

Both luxury cars and EVs have higher leasing rates than other models, so we surmise the first buyer won’t have to worry over the three-year lease—and GM doesn’t sell new cars to those who will buy these models used. Except now it can target them as a source of recurring monthly fees. Why did GM do this? It’s one aspect of the “digital services revenue” that carmakers promised the financial world would earn them billions of dollars a year in new revenue. Buyers are the losers here; they must pay a monthly fee for a feature they used to get for free. Or revert to the distraction of a handheld phone, the reason phone mirroring was invented in the first place.

After spending eight days and 840 miles in an Optiq around New York City and environs, including forays into the rural agricultural regions of the state, we think it shows real promise. It’s quiet, comfortable, and well-suited to highway miles. Our few reservations sit with its software, and that has to be a matter for the paying customers to take up with GM.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-cadillac-optiq.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:31.665480

Entergy Corp., the largest investor-owned utility company in the state, announced it broke ground on its Franklin Farms Power Station project in Richland Parish. The company disseminated a photo from the groundbreaking ceremony showing a group of politicians, regulators and corporate executives digging into a box of sand at the construction site.

The facility will power a massive $27 billion data center Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is building. It will feature two natural gas-powered plants able to generate about 1,500 megawatts of electricity, many times more than what the sparsely populated farming community of Richland Parish consumes.

Proposed less than a year ago, the fast-paced power project received expedited approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August. New power plants of similar type typically go through several years of planning and hearings before construction begins.

Construction on Meta’s largest data center brings 600% crash spike, chaos to rural Louisiana

The new power plant complex is being built specifically for the data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers.

Construction on the data center itself is also underway, bringing loads of new workers and traffic to the normally sleepy Richland Parish.

The Franklin Farms project, which is expected to come online in late 2028, is not the only power station Entergy is building for the data center. Entergy plans to build a third plant at its Waterford nuclear power plant site in St. Charles Parish, with an expected operational date by the end of 2029.

Together, all three gas plants will be able to generate approximately 2,200 megawatts of electricity, which is more than twice the capacity of the entire city of New Orleans, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May said in a news release. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ETR2643-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:04:27.582830

As one of California’s most influential climate think tanks, Berkeley Law’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) is actively engaged in shaping state-level decision-making. Working with nonprofit sponsors and legislative staff, its experts provide objective research, data, technical assistance, and drafting language to support key policy advancements across the environmental landscape.

During California’s recently concluded legislative session, CLEE delivered preliminary research and pivotal guidance for multiple bills revolving around housing, greenhouse gas emissions, and cap-and-trade.

Land use and carbon removal

AB 130, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in June, is a broad state housing and climate bill that streamlines housing development and strengthens affordable housing incentives. Among its policies is a measure that allows developers, if they choose, to mitigate transportation impacts by funding transit-oriented affordable housing projects that reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).

The concept builds on work CLEE has developed since the 2013 passage of Senate Bill 743, which created mitigation “banks” to help facilitate VMT reductions when they cannot occur at a project site. The center is now working with the governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation on providing initial technical guidance for the program.

“It’s not about whether it causes traffic at a specific intersection — it’s also about whether it adds more vehicles to the road, because vehicles create air and noise pollution and affect the climate,” says CLEE Associate Director Ted Lamm. “So, the focus isn’t just congestion — it’s emissions.”

The state’s program, Lamm notes, aims to direct all funds for mitigating those impacts into location-efficient affordable housing in walkable areas less reliant on cars, and more reliant on transit.

“It’s about adding development and housing capacity without adding more vehicles to the road,” Lamm says. “The idea is that investment in location-efficient housing offsets the increased VMT from other projects.’

CLEE’s research also helped build the case for SB 79, signed into law earlier this month, which aims to increase housing density by upzoning areas around transit stops.

SB 643, after passing in the State Assembly and State Senate, was vetoed by the governor due to budget limitations. CLEE assisted in drafting the bill, which would have created a $50 million state grant to develop carbon capture pilot projects that decrease atmospheric emissions in the state. It included innovative requirements to ensure these projects provided community benefits in proportion with their design and impact.

“These projects should actually help the communities they’re in,” Lamm explains. “That’s why community benefits were written directly into eligibility criteria.”

However, CLEE Project Climate Director Ken Alex remains optimistic that the center’s proposals will resurface in later legislative sessions.

“It’s unfortunate,” he says. “It would have advanced high-quality carbon removal projects in California, but there’ll be other opportunities.”

Transmission financing and grid reform

Throughout the legislative session, CLEE leaders engaged in discussions and proposals around transmission financing reforms, providing objective analysis on how California can invest in — and lower — the building cost of clean energy transmission infrastructure.

SB 254, signed by Newsom in September, reforms how the state funds and deploys electricity transmission infrastructure by creating a new public-financing mechanism to support large-scale clean energy projects. CLEE produced various provisions and language for the measure.

Alex and Climate Program Director Ethan Elkind also offered significant expertise that informed the state agency participation provisions, and made suggestions to improve financing mechanisms for grid deployment.

“A number of the recommendations that we made ended up in AB 1207 and SB 840, which extended our cap-and-trade program and allocated specific percentages from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund toward targeted areas like wildfire resilience and clean transportation,” Alex says. “The recommendations — particularly around how prices and costs for transmission can be reduced — were adopted pretty directly.”

Looking ahead

CLEE’s team continues to pursue new, innovative approaches to accelerate electric vehicle adoption and expand charging infrastructure.”We’ve been working on approaches around how “California can promote and extend EV purchasing and infrastructure,” says Lamm. “Those efforts will likely be more focused on the next legislative session.”

Meanwhile, notes from CLEE’s latest report on the state’s economic toll caused by the climate crisis are circulating around state legislators’ desks, covering the financial impact of wildfires, extreme weather, and rising insurance premiums, all affecting Californians in real time.

“Usually, the coverage focuses on the cost of climate response — like renewable energy projects — but not on what climate change itself is already costing people,” Alex says. “That’s an important message for legislators to bring back to their constituents.”

Solar set new records in September

EIA’s latest “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through September 30, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity in the US.

In September alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (>1 megawatt (MW)) ballooned by well over 36.1% compared to September 2024, while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.7%. Combined, they grew by 29.9% and provided 9.7% of US electrical output during the month, up from 7.6% a year ago.

Moreover, generation from utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic systems expanded by 35.8%, while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 29.0% and produced a bit over 9.0% (utility-scale: 6.85%; small-scale: 2.16%) of total US electrical generation for January-September, up from 7.2% a year earlier.

And for the third consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than US wind farms: by 4% in July, 15% in August, and 9% in September. Including small-scale systems, solar has outproduced wind for five consecutive months and by over 40% in September.

Wind leads among renewables

Wind turbines across the US produced 9.8% of US electricity in the first nine months of 2025 – an increase of 1.3% compared to the same period a year earlier and 79% more than that produced by US hydropower plants.

During the first nine months of 2025, electrical generation from wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 18.8% of the US total, up from 17.1% during the first three quarters of 2024.

Wind and solar combined provided 15.1% more electricity than did coal during the first nine months of this year, and 9.8% more than the US’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.1%.

Renewables are now only second to natural gas

The mix of all renewables (wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal) produced 8.7% more electricity in January-September than they did a year ago, providing 25.6% of total US electricity production compared to 24.2% 12 months earlier.

Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas, which saw a 3.8% drop in electrical output during the first nine months of 2025.

Solar + storage have dominated 2025

Between October 1, 2024, and September 30, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 31,619.5 MW, while an additional 5,923.5 MW was provided by small-scale solar. EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with an additional 35,210.9 MW of utility–scale solar capacity being added in the next 12 months.

Strong growth was also experienced by battery storage, which grew by 59.4% during the past year, adding 13,808.9 MW of new capacity. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions over the next year total 22,052.9 MW.

Wind also made a strong showing during the past 12 months, adding 4,843.2 MW, while planned capacity additions over the next year total 9,630.0 MW (onshore) plus 800.0 MW (offshore).

On the other hand, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,417.1 MW and nuclear power added 46.0 MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 3,926.1 MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 606.6 MW.

Thus, during the past year, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage, small-scale solar, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, ballooned by 56,019.7 MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 1,095.2 MW.

The EIA expects this trend to continue and accelerate over the next 12 months. Utility-scale renewables plus battery storage are projected to increase by 67,806.1 MW (a forecast for small-scale solar is not provided). Meanwhile, natural gas capacity is expected to increase by only 3,835.8 MW, while coal capacity is projected to decrease by 5,857.0 MW, and oil capacity is anticipated to decrease by 5.8 MW. EIA does not project any new growth for nuclear power in the coming year.

SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said:

The Trump Administration’s efforts to jump-start nuclear power and fossil fuels are not succeeding. Capacity additions from solar, wind, and battery storage continue to dramatically outpace those from gas, coal, and nuclear, and by growing margins.

Dave Stenson, who spent nearly three decades at GM, is now betting his startup, ZMD Motors, can succeed where others have retreated by electrifying medium-duty commercial work trucks. His venture aims to deliver a cab-chassis EV for the Class 5 segment, a category that includes trucks like the Chevy Silverado 5500, which remains without a pure-electric counterpart.

Stenson’s plan hinges on collaboration rather than competition. He is actively pitching Detroit automakers on a licensing deal. Under his proposal, ZMD would take an existing chassis architecture, upfit it with an electric powertrain, and bring a commercial EV to market faster than the OEMs could alone. ""I can offer this platform as a toe in the water,"" Stenson told Crain’s Detroit Business. He argues that this gives a manufacturer a hedge play for faster market entry as EV demand across segments continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than analysts expected.

The business case, he insists, is already evident in California. Strict emissions regulations from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) are forcing municipalities and utilities to electrify their fleets, creating urgent demand. ""These people out here in California are dying for product that would actually work in their fleets,"" said Daryl Trueblood, general manager of vehicle upfitter One Stop Truck & Equipment. He confirms receiving several calls weekly for a product exactly like ZMD’s concept, noting, ""It’s a viable product if someone can bring it to market.""

Stenson’s approach contrasts with his previous venture and other failed startups that attempted ground-up designs. By leveraging proven truck architecture, he aims to avoid the immense cost and complexity associated with full-scale vehicle development.

As a slogan, “energy dominance” evokes images of the United States towering over the rest of the world, with prodigious production, as what Trump calls “a global energy superpower.” But the truth of energy dominance has nothing to do with empowering folks at home.

The administration has been rigging the game in favor of dirty energy — and giving fossil-fuel producers a license to dominate American consumers. In the process, Trump is boxing U.S. households out of cleaner alternatives and leaving Americans with less choice, higher energy bills, and an overheating climate.

Worse, by hobbling America’s green-energy industries, the administration is destroying jobs, even as it clears a path for China to dominate the next generation of energy production.

“He represents the fossil-fuel industry,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a Nov. 20 Capitol press conference, blasting Trump for boycotting international climate talks in Brazil. “He has chosen to represent his crooked billionaire donors.”

A Dirty Deal

Trump campaigned for reelection as a drill-first Republican with a govern-for-the-highest-bidder mentality. During an April 2024 gala at his Mar a Lago estate, Trump nakedly proposed to top oil and gas executives that they spend $1 billion to re-elect him. He promised, in exchange, to reverse president Joe Biden’s green policy agenda boosting renewable power, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles.

It was a preposterously large ask from Trump. And, because dark money floods our political system without names attached to campaign cash, it’s unclear exactly how much these fossil-fuel titans ponied up. (Publicly disclosed donations suggest a minimum of $75 million.) Regardless, Trump has governed like they sealed the deal.

His administration has been on a yearlong blitz, pulling tens of billions of dollars from the clean energy economy. Out of the gates, Trump sought to claw back $20 billion in Biden-era grants for renewables and efficiency. (Despite court challenges, at least $16 billion has been stalled.) More recently, under the cover of the government shutdown, the administration cancelled another $8 billion in funding for green energy projects, targeting blue states for partisan punishment.

Throttling Wind and Solar

Trump’s enmity toward clean energy is infamous. During his first term, he singled out solar panels for his now-signature tariff treatment. The president also harbors a special “hate” for windmills: “They’re ugly. They don’t work. They kill your birds,” he said at a cabinet meeting this summer, adding preposterously: “They’re bad for the environment.”

With the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump axed tax credits that helped Americans afford home solar panels. Similar incentives for utility-scale solar and wind projects are now set to expire next year, instead of the 2030s. By executive order in March, Trump slashed Biden-era federal support for domestic solar manufacturers, blasting it as part of a “Green New Scam.” He has also revoked $7 billion in grants for “community solar,” meant to bring renewable power to disadvantaged communities.

On his first day back in office, Trump blocked all federal waters for offshore wind leasing. His onshore policy is hardly better. In August, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — ex-governor of the petrostate of North Dakota — erected permitting hurdles to block large-scale wind and solar projects on federal lands, alleging they generate insufficient energy “density” per acre. “Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects,” Burgum insisted, “hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance.”

Hobbling Green Industry

America’s renewable energy industries, which had been going gangbusters under Biden, now find themselves staggered. They are still growing, but far more slowly. One forecast of offshore wind capacity expected to come online in the next decade has been slashed by 56 percent — with more than $100 billion in investments reportedly cancelled or delayed. The solar industry is facing a similar 27 percent decline in projected new capacity by 2030.

A study out of Princeton University finds that Trump’s signature “Beautiful Bill” will reduce capital investment in our electrical system and clean fuels by half a trillion dollars over the next decade. It will also slash future solar capacity by about 140 gigawatts and wind capacity by about 160 gigawatts. (The Hoover Dam, by comparison, has a capacity of about 2 gigawatts.)

This Trump offensive is disrupting job markets. In New England alone, Trump’s war on offshore wind has put an estimated 15,000 jobs at risk. Overall, the One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to cost 760,000 jobs by 2030, according to Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank.

“Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to the clean-energy economy,” Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader, told reporters at the November Capitol press conference. “That hurts our ability to deal with the climate crisis, and hurts our ability to drive down costs for everyday Americans.”

Full Speed for Fossil

Trump casts “our crusade” against green power as “ending market distorting subsidies.”

But the American energy market has long been distorted in favor of oil, gas, and coal. Even before Trump regained office, federal subsidies for fossil fuels were running about $30 billion a year. In that context, the historic investments in renewable energy championed by the Biden administration were about leveling the playing field — not giving green energy a leg up.

The passage of Trump’s “Beautiful Bill” has increased federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry by nearly $4 billion a year, according to a report from the environmental nonprofit Oil Change International. The law included a wild list of favors for fossil-fuel producers, ranging from tax breaks for wells and pipelines, to reduced royalty payments from extractors, to opening up the Arctic National Wildlife refuge for drilling. It also cut off tax credits that helped Americans afford electric vehicles.

In late November — in a news cycle dominated by the Epstein Files and Trump’s threats to hang Democratic members of Congress — the administration announced it intends to open the coasts of California and Florida to drilling for the first time in decades. Committing to this retrograde agenda, Trump has even been championing coal power — which has been in steady decline thanks to cheaper, cleaner alternatives.

In October, the administration offered $100 million in federal funds to “modernize and refurbish” existing coal fired power plants. It has also used its authority to force utilities keep coal plants in operation long past their planned decommission dates. Trump even ordered the EPA to exempt many large coal plants from new regulations limiting neurotoxic mercury pollution.

Far from letting the marketplace pick winners and losers, the president himself is becoming the filthy fuel’s biggest booster. “Coal needs a little help, public-relations-wise,” Trump said in a November speech. ‘So we refer to it as ‘clean beautiful coal.’” His Department of Energy has also been giving the dirty rock the rockstar treatment:

Climate Chaos, Consumer Pain

Trump’s agenda — simultaneously slowing clean-energy deployment while providing a new lease on life for fossil fuels — is keeping U.S. climate emissions at dangerous levels.

Upon taking office, Trump immediately withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. And his “Beautiful Bill” ends any pretense of America meeting its emissions targets. The Princeton report finds that Trump’s law locks in large pollution increases of “190 million metric tons per year in 2030” and “470 million tons in 2035” by comparison with the Biden baseline.

Climate denial has become official policy, with the Environmental Protection Agency seeking to abolish the “endangerment finding” that enables the government to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act.

These abrupt changes will expose Americans to more frequent disasters like superstorms and urban wildfires that have already cost the country trillions this century. They also impose concrete costs on consumers and ratepayers. The Princeton study estimates that the “Beautiful Bill” will increase household energy bills by $285 a year by 2035.

Feeding the AI Beast

These higher energy prices are coming in tandem with administration policies backing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency to the hilt. These industries’ data centers and “mining” operations have an insatiable demand for electricity, and are also driving up costs for household customers.

Under Trump, the watchdog EPA is transforming into an industry lapdog. Administrator Lee Zeldin has made “American Energy Dominance” a key “pillar” of his agenda at the agency, which also vows to “Make the United States the Artificial Intelligence Capital of the World.”

The EPA is now turning a blind eye as the AI industry and its politically wired billionaires run roughshod over human health. No surprise, Elon Musk has been at the forefront of this new wave of dirty energy dominance.

Musk has been building out xAI in Memphis, Tennessee, at a fossil-fueled facility called Colossus. This installation’s massive power needs — rivalling those of a mid-size city — have been met by an array of high-pollution, on-site methane gas generators, which have left residents of south Memphis choking on smog.

In June, local environmental groups threatened to file a federal lawsuit over the data center’s pollution, while challenging Musk’s local air permits. “Our health,” said NAACP president Derrick Johnson at the time, “shouldn’t be threatened at the hands of billionaires who circumvent the law.”

A second, much larger Colossus 2 facility is now under construction nearby. Sidestepping Tennessee regulators, Musk’s company is placing the methane generators for this data center just across state lines in Mississippi, where the company will reportedly be able to generate dirty power for 12 months without an air-emissions permit.

Bad Politics. Worse Geopolitics.

If there’s a silver lining to Trump’s war on clean energy, it is that it’s a stinker, politically.

Renewable power is no longer coded as a partisan issue. Eight of the top ten states ranked by solar installations in the first quarter of 2025 were places Trump won in 2024 — including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Idaho. Red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Kansas also dominate in American wind production.

Recent elections, moreover, demonstrate that voters are sensitive to soaring utility rates. Pricey energy bills loomed large in gubernatorial races won by Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia. Democrats also won big in Georgia, flipping two seats on the state’s public utility commission, which sets electric rates.

The geopolitical ramifications of Trump’s fossil-fuel first agenda are also stark. The administration is having some success boosting the sugar high of America’s oil boom. Fracking has unlocked enormous domestic petroleum reserves, and the U.S. is now the world’s leading oil producer.

But this is not sustainable, by any measure. Oil production is expected to peak as soon as 2027, declining thereafter. And by doubling down on the extraction-based economy while pulling back from renewables, the Trump administration is allowing China to dominate the next generation of clean energy and technology.

A recent cover package by The Economist underscored this dangerous trend: “China now makes a lot more from exporting wind turbines, electric cars, solar cells and the like,” it reported, “than drill-baby-drill America makes selling fossil fuels.”

So much for dominance.

Rather than a posture of strength, Trump’s energy agenda is actually a mark of an administration — and a political party — that’s been sold off to the highest bidder. Take it from Sen. Whitehouse, the ranking member of the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee. “Look at what they are having the Trump administration do,” he said at the Capitol press conference. “The depravity of the corruption… and the disinterest in anybody’s wellbeing other than the big donors. That’s the true face of the fossil-fuel industry.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zzfi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67ca3114-8408-4464-9a98-2d262a9b0313_533x800.png",N,,2025-12-01 18:01:37.687838

Cox Automotive projects a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.7 million, slightly ahead of October but below last year’s 16.5 million. Sales volume is forecast to reach 1.27 million units, down 1 per cent from October and nearly 8 per cent year over year. Fewer selling days (25 this month) account for part of the decline.

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Charlie Chesbrough, Senior Economist at Cox Automotive, in a statement. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months.”

Chesbrough added that sales started to surge in the spring as consumers rushed to market to beat what they anticipated would inevitably be higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. “Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

Cox Automotive said the recent pullback in EV demand is playing a central role. After three strong months, October saw a sharp reversal as the federal EV tax credit expired.

“Sales of EVs and PHEVs accelerated in the wake of the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage in early July as buyers rushed to market before the $7,500 tax credits expired at the end of September,” said Chesbrough. “Q3 was the strongest quarter ever for EVs; however, Q4 is a different story.

The facility currently operates at limited capacity producing vehicle-grade cells, but the performance targets attached to this technology have attracted international automotive industry attention.

Solid-state batteries work by replacing the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion cells with solid materials, delivering substantial improvements in thermal stability and safety. The solid components can withstand temperatures reaching 400 degrees Celsius, roughly double the tolerance of liquid-based systems. This thermal advantage proves particularly important for high-capacity batteries powering electric vehicles.

GAC is currently testing battery cells that exceed 60 ampere-hour capacity. Higher ampere-hour ratings enable battery packs to store more energy, directly translating to extended driving range. Research director Qi Hongzhong stated that the new cells deliver energy storage capacity approaching twice the level of traditional battery technology. The areal capacity, measuring energy stored per surface area, reaches 7.7 milliampere-hours per square centimeter compared to under 5 for traditional lithium-ion technology.

Manufacturing these advanced cells requires innovative production techniques. GAC’s dry anode manufacturing approach eliminates traditional wet processing steps, combining what were previously separate operations for material mixing, surface application, and compression into an integrated production sequence. This approach accelerates manufacturing speed while reducing energy consumption during production. Any efficiency gains that lower production costs represent crucial steps toward mainstream electric vehicle adoption.

The company projects that vehicles currently achieving 500-kilometer range on a single charge could exceed 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) with solid-state technology. This performance jump would fundamentally alter electric vehicle user experience by eliminating frequent charging stops. Drivers might only require charging once or twice monthly, making electric vehicles more convenient than gasoline-powered alternatives for typical usage patterns.

However, commercial availability remains years away. GAC will begin prototype vehicle testing in 2026, installing batteries in test vehicles to validate road performance and safety characteristics. Following successful testing, the company expects gradual mass production ramp-up between 2027 and 2030. But transforming laboratory technology into reliable commercial products still presents substantial challenges.

Successful scaling depends on securing adequate investment and establishing dependable supply chains for specialized solid electrolyte materials. The company must validate long-term performance and safety across diverse operating environments and extended usage periods before widespread deployment begins.

In the meantime, GAC’s operational production line positions the company advantageously in this global race to advance solid state battery technology, though ultimate impact on electric vehicle pricing and availability will depend on cost reduction speed for manufacturing these advanced cells.

The production line also represents China’s first industrial-scale capability for large-format solid-state battery manufacturing, a significant technical achievement for a country that already dominates the global electric vehicle segment.

Converting technical capability into market-ready products affordable for mass-market vehicles will be the next major hurdle for China. Supply chain reliability, manufacturing consistency, and long-term durability validation will determine whether this technology reaches widespread commercial adoption or remains confined to premium vehicle segments.

If the technology proves its worth in the field, many auto industry players like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO) will undoubtedly incorporate this superior technology in their future offerings.

At the time, Chattanooga Mayor Tim Kelly released a statement that read in part...

""It's extremely disappointing to see the federal government break a commitment and go back on their agreement to fund this project.""

Now, the non-profit says they are working together with the city to move the project forward.

Lavada Carnes, an Alton Park resident, tells us...

""Our community is growing. There are new homes going up all throughout the community, and I think it's very important for us to be connected.""

Dubbed the Alton Park Connect, the City of Chattanooga is set to vote on approving phase one of the project which would start with construction on Broad Street.

Carnes says while she is happy with the project, it should've come sooner.

""It's just a wonderful little community, and I feel like it gets a bad rap because it is a low income community.""

Full text of the letter is available by clicking here and below:

Dear Lieutenant General Graham,

We write to respectfully request a 45-day extension of the public comment period for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) regarding operations of the Detroit Dam within Oregon’s Willamette Valley System. The draft SEIS was released on November 14, with the comment period closing on December 29. We urge the Corps to provide a longer and more accessible comment window that will allow meaningful and informed public engagement on this highly impactful document.

The SEIS is both lengthy and technically complex, addressing issues that directly affect drinking water quality, economic stability, and public health across several communities in the Santiam Canyon and Willamette Valley. Recent experience with deep drawdown operations, including those at Green Peter Reservoir, have revealed the potential for extensive turbidity, severe impacts to drinking water systems, and significant economic losses for surrounding communities. These concerns underscore the importance of ensuring that residents, local governments, Tribal governments, utility providers, business owners, and other stakeholders have sufficient time to review and respond to this SEIS.

While a 45-day comment period is already a relatively short timeline for a document like this, the currently scheduled comment window also spans the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah, among others. These weeks are among the most challenging of the year for public participation, as reduced staffing, competing obligations, and widespread travel mean most Oregonians are far more concerned about weather delays and family recipes than comment periods. The combined effect of a shortened timeline and a holiday-dominated review period will significantly hinder the ability of Oregonians to provide thoughtful and informed feedback.

Given the anticipated impacts of potential operational changes at Detroit Dam, including those related to drinking water for more than 200,000 downstream residents, the Kokanee fishery, and economic conditions in the Santiam Canyon, it is essential that the review process maximize transparency and accessibility. A reasonable extension of the comment period would help accomplish this goal and ensure that the Corps receives the robust, substantive input needed to support a well-informed decision.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the USACE extend the comment period by an additional 45-days to provide stakeholders with adequate time to fully assess the SEIS and prepare comprehensive comments. We believe this extension is both necessary and in the public Interest.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to continued collaboration to ensure that the management of the Willamette Valley System supports the recovery of endangered fish species while also meeting the needs, safety, and well-being of Oregonians and the communities they call home.",http://bynum.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bynum.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/shutterstock_2346441271_us_capitol_congress-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 18:01:54.021689

But what was unexpected was they announced that they’re going to be doing a study basically to determine the maximum oil production capacity of every country there.
What does that mean if you’re in Texas’ oil industry?
If you’re an everyday Texan, you’re not involved directly in the oil industry and you’re hearing about this.
Well, with oil prices around $60, that translates to about $3 a gallon on the national average.","Two stories, in particular, are making notably rounds on the energy beat coming out of Thanksgiving.

One has to do with ongoing pessimism about oil prices, while another said despite warnings of doom and gloom in the oil industry, a buzz of oil field workers fill the gas stations and trailer parks of the Permian Basin – a sign that industry jobs are aplenty out in the oil fields.

Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, was also seeing some breaking news having to do with one of Texas oil’s biggest energy competitors. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: OPEC met yesterday, I gather, and some big decisions with some implications for Texas. Tell us what they said.

Matt Smith: Well, the the first piece was that it was pausing its production increases for Q1 of next year, which it wasn’t too surprising really, just given that we are seeing a surplus in the market appearing right now.

But what was unexpected was they announced that they’re going to be doing a study basically to determine the maximum oil production capacity of every country there. And so the reason for that is because there’s a lot of opaqueness surrounding that, right? Certain countries will say, “Oh, we have so much spare capacity here” when they may not necessarily have it.

So by doing this measure, that’s going to bring transparency to the market – stability as well, but it also may be bullish as well, because we’ve been expecting or assuming that certain countries have a lot of dry powder on the sidelines that they can bring to market in terms of that production, when in reality this study may show that that isn’t the case.

Just one other piece though: The company that they have picked to do this is actually Dallas-based. It’s a consultant called DeGolyer and MacNaughton Corp. So interestingly, there’s that tie again between OPEC and the U.S. here.

Well let me ask you, what does it mean if you’re gonna pause your production in your OPEC? What does that mean if you’re in Texas’ oil industry? Do you see a connection between what OPEC’s decided to do here and all that activity in the Permian I was referencing earlier?

We could view it as bullish, right? Because if OPEC is going to be hitting pause on their production increases, they’re essentially going to support higher prices. But the reality is that production is strong elsewhere in the world. And so they’re concerned here about an oversupply and that begins with Texas, right?

So on Friday we had a report from the EIA, the Energy Information Administration in the U.S. here. They showed that September’s production in the U.S. of oil was 13.84 million barrels a day. That is a record.

And so you’ve got a lot of supply coming to market outside of OPEC, and so they’re just trying to manage the situation here.

Trying to manage the price situation, I think we should probably underscore, right?

Yes, very true.

Well, what does that mean for prices at the pump? If you’re an everyday Texan, you’re not involved directly in the oil industry and you’re hearing about this. But what does it all add up to?

Well, with oil prices around $60, that translates to about $3 a gallon on the national average. For Texas, it’s just below $2.60 a gallon.

You can obviously get that lower, as well, sort of West Texas there. I had a friend over the weekend send me a picture getting $2.11 for his gas there.

So yeah, there’s always that kind of seesaw, right, of lower prices are bad for production in theory, but it’s great for the consumer.

Seemed like a very busy Thanksgiving weekend on the roads, too. Folks taking advantage of those lower prices.

It really was actually, yeah. So AAA projected that it was at a record. There was like 73 million people traveling by car over the weekend. That’s up 1.3 million people compared to last year.

So lower prices, encouraging people to get on the roads there.

Matt, as we come around the corner at the end of 2025, how are you feeling about the way things have gone this year in the oil industry and what we’re looking at for 2026?

It’s been a very challenging year, but as we’ve seen, the U.S. producer is extremely resilient and that’s reflected through in that record production.

Though we may see a weaker start to next year, which is obviously good for prices at the pump, the reality is that the longer-term picture here is of higher oil prices as we head towards the end of the decade. So that’s positive for U.S. producers.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gas-pump-at-an-exon-gas-station-in-central-austin-on-march-5-2023-alyssa-olverakutx_52730987335_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:18.165434

This problem is not new, but prices have spiked in recent years while many workers’ wages and household incomes have not kept up. New federal policies will raise the prices of essential needs further while cutting programs and services that help Kentuckians get by.

Today, KyPolicy released a report, “Building a Kentucky Workers Can Afford,” containing a range of affordability policies that the state can implement to improve job quality and ease growing kitchen table burdens. Here’s why those priorities are so important.

Household costs are going up

Since 2020, costs have risen substantially for a variety of major household expenses. The Consumer Price Index for all items in the East South Central Region (which includes Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee) shows prices are up 27% since 2020, as shown in the graph below. That includes particularly sharp increases in the cost of transportation, which is up 36%; energy, up 33%; shelter, which consists of housing and related costs including insurance, up 33%; and food, up 28%, including a 37% increase for meat, poultry, fish and eggs.

Inflation in household costs was especially high during the pandemic period from 2021-2023 as supply chain backups, shifts in consumer demand from services to goods, and opportunistic price hikes in monopolized industries resulted in a sudden rise in prices. Since then, the pace of cost growth has slowed, but Kentuckians are left with much higher prices for necessary expenses than five years ago.

Now, across-the-board tariffs threaten to bring new price increases on many goods. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which passed Congress this summer, will end food and healthcare benefits for many and pass higher costs on to others, while its cuts to clean energy investments are expected to further raise the cost of electricity.

Wages are suppressed and incomes are inadequate

For decades , wages for American workers have not kept up with growth in worker productivity. A wide variety of policy decisions have suppressed wages for most workers, including weakened labor laws, inaction to raise the minimum wage, unfair trade policies and a failure to enact fiscal and monetary policies that maintain a consistent economy of full employment.

And in many cases, wages and incomes are not keeping up with the recent growth in costs described above. Median household income is down 4.8% in Kentucky since 2020 after adjusting for inflation, while median wages have fallen 3.3%.

The above chart actually understates the decline in purchasing power Americans have felt over the last few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government provided a variety of aid programs that are not counted in the Census Bureau’s measure of household income, including an expansion of the child tax credit, stimulus payments and food, health care, utility and housing assistance. These benefits increased household economic security but their expiration after the pandemic worsened well-being. For example, the Kentucky child poverty rate measured using a method that takes public benefits into account was cut in half during COVID-19. But as Congress let that aid go away, hardship redoubled.

Federal and state budget cuts have also reduced the help available to Kentuckians. The cuts in SNAP benefits and in Medicaid in the OBBBA will take food benefits and health coverage from hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians, further squeezing already meager incomes. Layoffs and the defunding of federal programs have caused adversity for many of the 23,000 federal employees who live in the commonwealth, and thousands more whose work was funded through federal grants that have been slashed or cancelled.

At the same time, the state has cut cash assistance for tens of thousands of low-income kids and their families in the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP). Other cuts may be on the horizon due to a $305 million state budget shortfall caused by a weakening economy and multiple rounds of individual income tax cuts. Unemployment for young and Black workers is rising, but in 2022 the Kentucky General Assembly eliminated 10 weeks of eligible unemployment benefits for laid-off employees.

Workers and families are struggling

Higher prices on essentials combined with inadequate wages and reduced public support add up to more pain for household budgets. The Economic Policy Institute’s (EPI) Family Budget Calculator estimates the income needed in localities across the country to afford basics like housing, food, health care, childcare and transportation. As shown in the graph below , even median family income is not enough to cover those costs in many cases. For example, the local median is not adequate to pay for a basic family budget for one adult with one child in Knott County, and far less than is needed for two adults and two children. Affordability is a problem that challenges Kentuckians across rural, urban and suburban communities.

Detailed estimates by county and family size can be found in the map below, and full data for every county and metropolitan area is accessible through the calculator: https://www.epi.org/resources/budget/

While even families with median incomes struggle, many Kentucky workers make far less than that. A full 20% of Kentucky workers had wages of $14.95 an hour or less in 2024 according to EPI, the equivalent of $29,900 annually assuming full-time employment (which is not always available). That is less than EPI’s estimate of the cost of a basic family budget for a single adult with no children in every Kentucky county.

These challenges are worsening now due to a weakening economy and federal policy choices. Household debt and delinquencies are rising, while consumer confidence is falling.

Kentuckians need an affordability agenda

Strained living conditions are not inevitable: they are the direct result of public policy. As KyPolicy’s new report outlines, many policy options are available at the state level to directly ease the cost of living and grow good jobs that make life more affordable.

Leaders in the 2026 Kentucky General Assembly can and should prioritize an affordability agenda that meets the moment. Through deliberate action, leaders can help address the job quality and cost of living concerns that strain Kentucky workers and families every day.",https://kypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Affordability-Is-a-Crisis-for-Kentuckians-1024x585.png,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:11.957513
,Louisiana Environment,2025-12-01 21:26:05+00:00,10/12 Industry Report,"Louisiana's energy market is undeniably impactful, but notoriously hard to predict",Sam Barnes,,,,,https://www.1012industryreport.com/energy/louisianas-energy-market-is-undeniably-impactful-but-notoriously-hard-to-predict/,"How a ‘small store in the middle of nowhere’ has ties to the energy industry that take it far behind the southwest Louisiana community it calls home.
Offshore Oil & Natural Gas Save the Day Energy diversification will be a sustaining force in the near and long term.
“Offshore, we continue to go deeper and go further,” says Tommy Faucheux, executive director of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association.
“Oil production in state lands and waters—which are subject to the state severance tax—have been going down due to this decline curve.
“When they talk about deregulating the oil industry, you lower their costs, but that doesn’t change the demand for oil and ultimately the price in the international markets.","The network of businesses that owe their origins, successes and, at times, demises to Louisiana’s upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas market is vast.

For generations, an energy workforce numbering in the hundreds of thousands has risen before the sun to travel to a destination that is one, two or multiple parishes away to earn a living.

Nevertheless, it will always be an unpredictable and at times heartbreaking industry in which to work. The current relaxed regulatory environment notwithstanding, the economics of oil and gas—aka supply and demand—will always be the primary driver.

Louisiana has done a decent job since the oil bust of the early 1980s to separate itself from the rollercoaster effects of the unpredictable market. The state has undergone a transformation since the heady days of oil and gas in the early 1980s, when in FY1982 mineral revenues comprised a whopping 42% share of its overall budget. By FY2024, it comprised just 5.9%.

“It was because of the oil bust that we doubled the corporate franchise tax, then began to bring on gaming revenues in the 1990s. We basically changed our tax structure,” says Greg Albrecht, a former Legislative fiscal officer who continues to develop the state’s revenue forecast.

How a ‘small store in the middle of nowhere’ has ties to the energy industry

that take it far behind the southwest Louisiana community it calls home.

As a result, fluctuations in oil prices don’t have nearly the same impact on state finances as they did 40-plus years ago. “Oil and gas revenues are clearly important,” Albrecht says, “but not nearly as impactful to the budget when you get big fluctuations in price.”

That has become starkly apparent in recent months. In FY2024, the state realized an actual mineral revenue collection of nearly $1 billion, consisting of $828 million in severance taxes and $132 million in royalties. Then, in FY2025, the number dropped precipitously to $445 million, largely due to a significant drop in oil prices.

The revenue drop won’t cripple the state budget, though, as it might have done in the past. That’s fortunate, since Albrecht’s most recent state forecast, released in May (the final numbers won’t be available until October), predicts the current oil price of $65 a barrel will likely be sustained through FY2026 “and could actually be lower depending upon the source,” he says.

Upstream production has also been trending downward for years, although its short-term impact isn’t as severe as a drop in prices. “We’re on a long, long decline path,” he says. “The numbers are what they are. It is just declining and declining and declining. The nonhorizontal natural gas production is doing the same thing.”

For his purposes, though, Albrecht has frozen projected production volumes at a certain minimum level in his long-term forecast models.

Offshore Oil & Natural Gas Save the Day

Energy diversification will be a sustaining force in the near and long term. Even as onshore oil production steadily declines, offshore oil and inshore natural gas (horizontal extraction) are surging; increased investments in LNG, midstream and downstream facilities will play significant roles.

Improving technologies are making much of it possible.

“Offshore, we continue to go deeper and go further,” says Tommy Faucheux, executive director of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “And now that we’re clearly headed back to a place of predictable federal offshore leasing, I think the offshore trajectory over the long term is positive.”

Of course, economic factors will play a bigger role in any future production decisions, with international demand being a significant factor in the coming decades. Faucheux is particularly excited about the growth of the LNG market, and natural gas in general, as it will likely be the “go to” low-carbon fuel in the near term.

“That is going to be where Louisiana will benefit,” he says. “To have more production in the Hayesville Shale, as well as capacity increases and exports along the coast … that will clearly mean good things for Louisiana.”

In LMOGA’s recent 2025 Economic Impact Study, economist Stephen Barnes found that Louisiana’s energy industry—upstream, midstream and downstream—contributes directly and indirectly to some 25% of the state’s economy.

Barnes, director of the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center in Lafayette, asserts that industry accounts for 15% of total state employment, 19% of total earnings and up to 31.3% in local property taxes.

Unlike neighboring Texas, Louisiana’s oil and gas companies don’t benefit from concentrated metro areas such as Houston or Dallas; instead, they’re more regionally focused, Faucheux says.

The LMOGA study identified four energy “super regions” where more than 90% of the industry’s economic impact in Louisiana is concentrated—the River Region (Baton Rouge to New Orleans), Bayou Region (Lafayette to Houma), Southwest Louisiana and Northwest Louisiana.

“Few companies in the industrial sector would be successful if their livelihoods depended upon one community or parish,” Faucheux says. “At a minimum, they need this regional collectivity of parishes and communities to support what they’re doing. Then, in turn, the economic impact goes back to those regions.”

That’s perhaps most evident in the River Region, where industry pays more than $600 million in local property taxes—some 17% of the total received.

“That money supports the school systems, the sheriff’s offices, local emergency services, infrastructure etc.,” Faucheux says. “Imagine what kind of hole that would leave in the community if industry wasn’t there.

“In the Bayou Region, its $119 million in property taxes; then there’s sales taxes too. Those are very reliable, predictable revenue streams for local government.”

That translates into a better quality of life, says Faucheux, a former Dow employ who lives in St. Charles Parish. “It really does lift everything,” he adds. “I see how multiple generations of families are getting stronger because of the opportunities that come from industry. Both my grandfathers were in industry, and my dad retired from industry. I’m the first one to go to college. Hopefully, my kids will get some of the same benefits.”

Supply & Demand Edges Out Regulatory Policy

For inshore Louisiana, at least, it has been a tale of two fossil fuels: Natural gas production has gone up while oil production has gone down.

“And these are long-term trends,” says Greg Upton, executive director of LSU’s Center for Energy Studies and interim director of the LSU Energy Institute. “Oil production in state lands and waters—which are subject to the state severance tax—have been going down due to this decline curve.

“If we talk about total Gulf Coast production, however, which includes federal offshore production, the broader trend is that you have more production.”

But while technology has played an undeniably beneficial role, it’s had an inverse effect on employment.

That’s been somewhat surprising, Upton says. “Just looking at upstream oil and gas, the employment numbers are actually coming in lower than we forecasted them to do,” he adds. “We’ve seen downward revisions in the employment numbers over a year ago.”

Technology, he says, has made it possible to produce more hydrocarbons with fewer workers. “The longer-term trend is for production to increase within the Gulf Coast region as well as the U.S.,” Upton says, “but you need fewer workers to produce that same amount of output. So we’re just not seeing this uptick in employment in those sectors.

“Owners have learned how to perform more detailed geological assessments with 3D seismic capabilities, then drill horizontally into these formations with hydraulic fracturing. Historically, they wouldn’t have been able to efficiently do that.”

That’s led to rapid increases in oil and gas production as companies learn how to extract more for less cost.

“We’re in a longer-term trend right now of efficiency improvements,” he adds. “When offshore companies started learning how to go deeper and deeper, that was a breakthrough technology with significant long-term impacts.”

For the long term, Upton forecasts a rise in international oil and gas demand will buoy the market, with the most significant increases coming from developing countries. “I think we’re going to have oil and gas production for decades and decades to come,” he adds, “and our production forecast reflects that.”

In the near term, however, recent federal efforts to expand offshore oil and gas leasing activity will have little effect. “I’m not saying that those actions don’t matter; they absolutely do,” he says, “but there’s a lengthy lag period between when you go from leasing to drilling those first wells … to building out the infrastructure to bring the products to shore.

“In fact, the production that comes from that is going to lag beyond the timeframe of the current president. Not that policy changes don’t matter, but a new president coming in won’t have an immediate impact. It just doesn’t work that way.”

The Landry administration has been equally supportive of oil and gas, but recent state legislation reducing the severance tax rate from 12.5% to 6.5% on new oil production will have only a measured impact.

Says Upton: “In theory, you’ll get more oil production and more economic activity around that oil production, but I don’t think that the additional amount of activity is going to be large enough to see a true uptick in employment or an uptick in the production numbers. Would it be larger than it would’ve been otherwise? Sure, but I’m not anticipating it to be large enough to see when you look at the data.”

At the end of the day, state economist Albrecht predicts economic factors will have a much larger impact on future production than any new federal or state policy.

“The oil and gas companies drill because of their price projections,” he says. “When they talk about deregulating the oil industry, you lower their costs, but that doesn’t change the demand for oil and ultimately the price in the international markets. That’s what drives production and decisions.

“They don’t produce any more oil when the price is in the mid-$60s, as it is now.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Greg-Upton-quote-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:40.587343

EPA Enforcement in 2025

While the government has scaled back civil environmental enforcement in federal court, EPA’s administrative enforcement remains robust and appears to be accelerating. In the third quarter of calendar year 2025, EPA resolved 198 administrative enforcement actions across the statutes it administers—up from 179 case conclusions in the second quarter—and has assessed over $9 million in penalties. Although many of these cases likely were initiated during the prior administration, the continued settlement approvals reflect EPA’s focus on “core” enforcement work under the current administration.

EPA’s TSCA enforcement and compliance assurance program includes four key focus areas: new and existing chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, and lead-based paint. From time to time, aspects of the TSCA enforcement program have been included amongst EPA’s national focus areas, as reflected in the National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives that EPA selects on four-year cycles. TSCA enforcement largely is, however, part of “core” enforcement work, which Administrator Zeldin has made a priority for the agency.

Since the beginning of the current administration, EPA has pursued 115 new administrative enforcement actions and assessed approximately $4.3 million in penalties for TSCA violations. The vast majority of these cases (about 80 percent) concern lead-based paint regulation noncompliance, which have generally resulted in lower penalty assessments than chemicals enforcement actions. Of the ten largest TSCA penalties assessed this year to date, five were for chemicals enforcement actions. For example, the agency assessed its single largest TSCA penalty in 2025—$700,000—for violations of the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, where the respondent allegedly failed to report 334 imported chemicals for the 2024 reporting cycle. EPA assessed six‑figure penalties in three other CDR rule enforcement actions—$415,000, $393,000, and $112,155—as well as a $100,000 penalty for alleged violations of the methylene chloride risk management rule for paint removers.

NGO Lawsuits to Enforce TSCA CDR Violations

TSCA Section 20 also gives private citizens the authority to bring civil actions against companies in federal court for TSCA violations. TSCA allows private citizens to bring such suits so that a court can restrain the identified TSCA violations or compel EPA to enforce the law. Since 2021, NGOs have filed TSCA Section 20 actions against companies for alleged CDR violations and continue to do so with growing frequency. Two of the most recent lawsuits were filed earlier this fall by the NGO Center for Environmental Health (CEH). CEH alleged that certain chemical companies failed to report imported chemicals to EPA for the 2020 CDR reporting cycle.

The complaints in these cases detail how the NGOs identify potential violations by reviewing information on company imports and manufactured chemicals published in EPA’s CDR public database. NGOs have also asked the courts in these cases to 1) declare the companies violated TSCA, 2) order the companies to file corrected CDR reports with EPA, 3) restrain the companies from ongoing CDR violations, 4) order that the companies audit their manufacturing and import activities to identify other potential CDR violations, and 5) pay the NGO’s attorneys’ fees. Even when penalties are not imposed, responding to TSCA Section 20 claims can be costly and require the diversion of resources away from other business functions.

Companies should be aware of these types of civil actions because they can open the door to NGOs or other private citizens to pressure companies, as part of settlements, to agree to allow them to participate in company-led TSCA CDR (or broader) audits, which could potentially reveal additional TSCA violations.

What Companies Should Do

EPA administrative enforcement and citizen-filed lawsuits represent two significant legal risks for chemical manufacturers and importers subject to TSCA CDR rule requirements. Noncompliance can result in not only steep penalties but also business operational disruption. On the front end, manufacturers and importers should routinely review their own TSCA compliance programs and audit their own TSCA reporting compliance, which can also position companies to take advantage of EPA’s Audit Policy[1] where its conditions are met, potentially mitigating penalties for voluntarily disclosed noncompliance. Companies should also proactively prepare for the next CDR reporting cycle in 2028. Companies should also engage counsel early when responding to EPA inquiries or enforcement activity or notice of citizen lawsuits.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1764629197/206373.png,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:27.692413

Senate Republicans unveiled their fiscal year 2026 funding proposals for the Department of Energy last week. The draft bill seeks to cut the base budget of various energy R&D programs, though it mitigates the impact by repurposing funds originally appropriated through infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021.

For instance, the bill proposes a base budget of $8 billion for the DOE Office of Science, which would represent a 3% cut from last year’s level. However, the bill also would transfer $250 million in unspent infrastructure funds to the office, negating the cut. This dynamic is more pronounced for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, for which the bill proposes a base budget of $2.2 billion and a repurposing of $1 billion in infrastructure funds, amounting to a topline cut of 5% from last year. In any event, the cuts proposed are far less steep than those sought by the Trump administration. For details on the proposals, consult FYI’s Federal Science Budget Tracker.

The bill normally would have been released over the summer but was delayed due to the Senate’s top appropriator for DOE, Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), insisting that it include spending cuts. Kennedy declined to use a higher topline budget given to him by Appropriations Committee leaders “because he believed he could fund these vital programs with more force and efficiency,” according to a press release from his office.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, criticized the bill as partisan but said there are aspects of it that she supports. Among other items, Murray said the bill would provide the DOE Office of Science with “the funding needed to continue their critical, cutting-edge work and prevent devastating layoffs.” She also praised the bill for blocking DOE’s “senseless plan to slash critical research with its indirect cost policy,” through which the department is seeking to cap reimbursement rates at 15%. The bill includes a provision (Sec. 315) that would direct DOE to continue using the same indirect cost rate as it did in fiscal year 2024.

House to examine competition with China in space

The House Science Committee will hold a hearing on Thursday on the growth of China’s space industry and “the risks to U.S. leadership.” The hearing’s charter says it will focus on China’s space strategy, “including the benefits of a consistent political direction, sustained funding, and its military-civil fusion approach.” The charter also discusses China’s ambitions for space science as described in the CCP’s National Mid-Term and Long-Term Plan for Space Science in China. These ambitions include becoming the top-ranked country in key research areas such as black holes and neutron stars. The hearing witnesses will be Dean Cheng, a senior fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies who specializes in U.S.-China relations; Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Patrick Besha, founder of the Global Space Group and a former NASA senior policy adviser, and Michael Griffin, co-president of LogiQ and a former NASA administrator.

The RFI also asks about leveraging and preparing for advances in AI systems and for ways to strengthen research security “while minimizing compliance burdens.” Comments are due by Dec. 26.

Northwestern agrees to pay $75 million to restore federal research funding

Northwestern University is the latest to sign a deal with the Trump administration to restore at least $790 million in federal funding that was first frozen in April. The university agreed to pay $75 million to the federal government over the next three years. The university also agreed to provide the government with anonymized undergraduate admissions data, eliminate any advantages to individuals based on protected characteristics, and continue complying with foreign gift and contract reporting. Northwestern also agreed to reverse all of the policies in the agreement it signed with pro-Palestinian student protesters in 2024. In exchange, the government agreed to “fairly consider all applications for federal funding submitted by Northwestern... without disfavored or favored treatment,” and permanently close all pending investigations regarding Northwestern’s compliance with anti-discrimination laws. The agreement runs until the end of 2028.

One of the key selling points of clean energy, of course, is that it’s renewable. Once the infrastructure is built, nature supplies the fuel for solar and wind energy. The sun shines, the wind blows, and batteries store the surplus. It’s renewable, and it’s basically free. That’s in sharp contrast to fossil fuel power plants, which require constant additions of fuel.

Building that infrastructure for clean energy means most of the cost comes upfront. And that means prevailing interest rates have a big effect on whether new projects get off the ground. Despite strong headwinds, including the shutting down of some projects near completion, recent Federal Reserve rate cuts have been welcome news for renewables.

Storms & Sunshine

Renewables have seen a lot of ups and downs the last half-decade. Solar and wind power generation became cheaper than fossil fuel generation for the first time. The Biden administration supported clean energy and passed policy measures such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act that funded renewable projects.

In March of 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in an effort to tamp down rising inflation. In less than 18 months, rates from close to zero to over 5%, which took a heavy toll on clean energy stocks. The case was the same with central banks worldwide, as post-pandemic inflation soared. The funding from those Biden-era bills didn’t come all at once; it was spread out over several years.

Still, 2024 saw records for clean energy investment. According to the International Energy Agency, $2 trillion went to technology and infrastructure globally over the course of the year. In the U.S., investments in the production and deployment of clean energy hit $265 billion in 2024. There were 49 gigawatts of clean energy deployed in the U.S., accounting for 93% of new energy capacity.

“Private lenders co-led the charge, likely influenced by the more predictable and higher return on investment that renewables offer over traditional S&P 500 stocks. However, public support from clean energy tax credits, government and corporate power-purchase agreements, and low-interest financing from state energy financing institutions and community development financial institutions helped make this clean power and technology more accessible to households and communities,” the Rocky Mountain Institute reported.

The incoming Trump administration made its distaste for clean energy clear with executive orders that defunded and even stopped some projects. Despite the reversal in federal government support, renewables got a jolt in September when the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points after holding steady for the first nine months of the new presidential administration.

Demand Needs Supply

What isn’t stopping, however, is the rise in demand for electricity. With expansion of data center capacity to power AI and EV chargers and utility companies replacing old or damaged grid equipment, demand and electricity bills are going way up. Simply put, grids need more energy, and renewables are the main source of new capacity. NextEra Energy predicts the generation of another 450 GW by 2030, which means it will be demand more than policy that spurs growth in renewables. But lower interest rates will help.

September saw $800 million invested in renewable energy funds, the highest monthly total since April 2022. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF went up 30% from January-September, signaling renewed optimism about clean energy’s future. Bloom Energy, which in July announced a deal with Oracle to provide hydrogen-enabled fuel cells for the latter’s data centers, saw its stock shoot up 300%.

“Bloom’s advanced fuel cell technology gives us the unique capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs. As the world’s largest AI infrastructure investor, this partnership adds a powerful new tool to our global growth strategy, especially in a grid-constrained market environment,” Sikander Rashid, global head of AI infrastructure at Bloom investor Brookfield Asset Management said.

Brookfield announced in October it had raised $20 billion to fund clean energy, and JPMorgan Chase is adding $10 billion to a $1.5 trillion initiative for clean energy projects.

“It’s difficult to conceive of a situation in which they won’t need to tap into those sources of energy,” Chuka Umunna, JPMorgan’s global head of sustainable solutions, told Bloomberg Television.

Blackrock and Robeco report that lower interest rates have investors feeling much better about clean energy’s future than they did a year ago.

As Time’s Justin Worland put it, “In general, lower interest rates benefit growth-oriented, long-horizon investments.”

“Continuous” means “continuous,” “indistinguishable” means “indistinguishable,” and regulatory inventions such as the “wet season” have no place in defining federal power.","When the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2023, which I argued on behalf of Michael and Chantell Sackett, it finally brought clarity and common sense to a part of environmental law that had long baffled courts, agencies and landowners. The Clean Water Act, the court held, regulates “waters of the United States,” or real bodies of water that any ordinary person would recognize as such.

On Monday, the Trump administration proposed a new “Waters of the United States” rule — a welcome effort to restore the law’s focus on real, continuous surface-water connections.

Though the law’s jurisdiction can reach wetlands, Sackett instructs that wetlands are regulated only when they are so physically inseparable from a lake, river or stream that you can’t tell where the water ends and the land begins. Put simply, under the Clean Water Act, the court found a “water” should be obviously water, and if a wetland is to be federally regulated, it must have a continuous surface-water connection to one of those relatively permanent bodies of water.

The 2023 ruling was a long-overdue course correction, but it did not go far enough. For decades, federal agencies had stretched the statute beyond recognition, sweeping in vast areas of private land that bore little resemblance to anything Congress authorized them to regulate. Sackett appeared to bring that era of boundless bureaucratic discretion to a close.

The Trump administration’s new proposal makes genuine progress but risks reintroducing the uncertainty Sackett sought to eliminate.

Under the proposed rule, wetlands would be regulated if they met a two-part test: They must contain surface water during the “wet season,” and they must touch a waterbody that flows during that season. On paper, that might sound consistent with Sackett’s requirement of a continuous surface connection. But Sackett gave only two exceptions to its continuous surface connection requirement: drought and low tides. These exceptions suggest unusual and short interruptions to the normal presence of water. In contrast, the “wet season” concept introduced by the proposed rule implies that surface water might be absent, regularly, for months at a time, and yet the agencies could still regulate it.

If the administration instead tied jurisdiction to truly continuous surface-water connections, regardless of “wet season,” it could align the rule fully with Sackett and give landowners the clarity Congress intended.

Getting the Sackett rule right is not just a question of legal quibbling. Landowners continue to suffer from agencies’ misinterpretation of the decision.

As an example, Rebecca and Caleb Linck, whom I also represent in litigation, own a 4.7-acre parcel in Bonner County, Idaho — the same county where the Sacketts fought their long battle. The Lincks’ land sits about a mile from the nearest perennial stream and two miles from a lake. When they hired a wetlands consultant to ensure they were complying with the Clean Water Act, they assumed they were in the clear.

Yet the Army Corps of Engineers asserted authority anyway, claiming that 1.13 acres of the Lincks’ property were federally regulated wetlands. The Army Corps relied on what it calls a “wetland complex” — a theory that allows regulators to stitch together disconnected parcels of land to create jurisdiction where none exists. In the Lincks’ case, the areas the engineers labeled “wetlands” were separated from the nearest alleged wetland by a 35-foot-wide gravel road with no culverts. But by combining both areas into one imaginary system, the Army Corps then claimed the distant wet area touched a small stream, which eventually fed into a navigable waterway.

This approach is nearly identical to the one used against the Sacketts years earlier, and the Supreme Court rejected it. But bureaucracies resist change. Even as the proposed rule formally recognizes the need for continuous surface water (at least during the “wet season”), agency culture can still undermine the rule’s intended reforming effect.

The Lincks’ case shows how that culture of resistance can nullify even the best-intentioned reforms. Until the Sackett decision is followed in both letter and spirit, landowners will remain trapped in regulatory limbo. The Trump administration’s proposal is a welcome step, and it could bring relief to many landowners now mired in enforcement actions. But the proposal stops short of what the Supreme Court clearly instructed: that wetlands may be regulated only when they are truly indistinguishable from a waterbody itself, regardless of season.

When agencies presume authority beyond what Congress designated, and beyond what the Supreme Court has permitted, they put every landowner at risk. And the Lincks, like the Sacketts before them, should not need a lawyer simply to enjoy their land.

The administration deserves credit for trying to bring the law into line with the Supreme Court’s direction. But it must finish the job and federal agencies must follow the law. “Continuous” means “continuous,” “indistinguishable” means “indistinguishable,” and regulatory inventions such as the “wet season” have no place in defining federal power.

Driving Factors

Government Funding Accelerates Flexible Solar Manufacturing Growth

One major driving factor of the Flexible Solar Cell Market is strong government investment aimed at strengthening domestic solar manufacturing and advanced cell production. When public funding supports manufacturing scale-up, it reduces cost barriers and speeds up commercial adoption of flexible solar technologies.

The U.S. government invested $71 million to boost domestic solar manufacturing, directly supporting production capacity, workforce development, and supply-chain resilience. In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy invested another US$71 million specifically into thin-film and silicon solar manufacturing projects. These investments encourage innovation in lightweight, flexible designs while improving efficiency and durability.

Such funding helps bridge the gap between research and large-scale manufacturing, giving industries more confidence to adopt flexible solar solutions. As funding strengthens production ecosystems, flexible solar cells gain faster acceptance across multiple applications.

Restraining Factors

High Production Costs Slow Flexible Solar Adoption

One major restraining factor in the Flexible Solar Cell Market is the high cost of production and early-stage manufacturing complexity. Flexible solar cells rely on advanced materials and precise fabrication processes, which increase costs compared to conventional rigid panels.

Even though Toledo-area solar companies received $16.1 million in federal funding, such support is often aimed at pilot-scale improvements rather than full cost reduction. This means many producers still face challenges in achieving low-cost, mass production. Higher costs can slow purchasing decisions, especially in price-sensitive applications, and limit wider deployment.

While funding helps improve technology and local manufacturing readiness, scaling flexible solar solutions remains expensive. Until production processes become simpler and more standardized, high costs will continue to restrain faster market expansion.

Growth Opportunity

Advanced Electronics Integration Creates New Solar Opportunities

A major growth opportunity in the Flexible Solar Cell Market lies in integration with advanced electronics and next-generation devices. Flexible solar cells are increasingly suitable for systems that require lightweight, adaptive, and reliable power sources.

A $4.4 million grant to build a prototype of next-generation night vision technology highlights how defense and sensing applications need compact, flexible energy solutions that can operate in dynamic conditions. At the same time, US$850 million in 45X manufacturing credits generated through First Solar sales strengthens domestic production ecosystems and improves material availability for advanced solar technologies.

Together, these developments open new pathways for flexible solar use in electronics, security equipment, and specialized devices. As high-value applications expand, flexible solar cells gain new commercial space beyond traditional energy installations.

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-12-01 20:29:20+00:00,News From The States,New Haven plant now the East Coast's largest producer of biofuels | News From The States,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-haven-plant-now-east-coasts-largest-producer-biofuels,"A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.
Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels.
The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown.
“It’s not like ethanol.” In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025.
Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut.","Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes.

Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.

Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year.

The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor.

“It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,” said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton.

The company’s growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the “many millions of dollars.”

According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks.

New York City passed the nation’s first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Connecticut’s law, Public Act 181 of 2021, required that heating oils contain at least a 5% blend of biodiesel starting in 2022. That amount increased to 10% this year and is set to grow steadily until reaching a minimum 50% blend in 2035. (Roughly 400 million gallons of fuel oil is delivered each year in Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.)

In addition to state incentives, biodiesel fuels were previously eligible for a $1 per gallon federal tax credit. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, those credits were replaced by other tax incentives based on lowering carbon emissions. Despite what he called an “ambiguity” around the changes to federal policy, Teta said that increasing blended fuel ratios in the Northeast has provided stability to the industry.

“When the law got passed, that gave us enough certainty to be able to make the next level of investment,” Teta said.

“The federal program’s certainly still important, because it incentivizes the price, otherwise biodiesel would be more expensive,” he added. “We want to keep the price low. So all put together, it has been a good mix for us to be able to expand.”

A controversial energy source

Not everyone is happy about the push to adopt biofuels. Environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, have argued that biodiesel perpetuates a reliance on fossil fuels and that states should instead seek to transition as rapidly as possible to all-electric options such as heat pumps.

“Electrification is really the answer for reducing emissions from vehicles and from home heating,” said Samantha Dynowski, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club. “We just want to make sure that our emphasis is on the long term solution, not kind of a bridge, because the more we invest in this, the less you can get off of it.”

Supporters of biofuels, however, say they offer a path for states like to Connecticut to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades. Earlier this year, Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law setting a statewide net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said the state’s reliance on natural gas to meet its energy needs, along with the high cost of building out greener technologies such as solar and wind, make the expansion of biofuels essential to meeting to those targets.

“There’s no way to blend [natural gas] down like we can petroleum,” Herb said. “Our industry is the only way we, the state of Connecticut, are going to be able to continue to make gains in carbon dioxide reductions in the fastest, least expensive way.”

But even biodiesel production has faced concerns around environmental pollution. In September, the EPA announced that American GreenFuels will pay $143,000 to settle penalties in the wake of Clean Air Act violations that occurred at the plant between 2020 and 2022. In a press release, the federal agency explained that it “found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants” during maintenance and system repairs.

When asked to respond to questions about the violations and the settlement, Kolmar Americas did not offer a detailed response.

“American GreenFuels, LLC is in compliance with the Clean Air Act,” Teta said in an email.

When it comes to the carbon-reducing benefits of biofuels, it also depends on the kind of feedstock that goes into the production process.

Oils that are processed directly from crops such as soybeans and corn require land clearing and mechanical harvesting that itself produces more emissions than recycled feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Only 36% of the biofuels produced nationally in 2022 came from waste or recycled feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Teta declined to say what percentage of American GreenFuels’ products is recycled, but he said historically the company has sourced most of its feedstock from waste products.

That could change next year, he said, due to the elimination of tax penalties for biofuels derived directly from crops. The change, which was implemented as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July, is likely to result in American GreenFuels using more bean oils in its production.

“We are mindful that we must remain competitive and diffuse the market’s concern that we will be priced out of the market for waste feedstocks and therefore become uncompetitive,” Teta said in an email.

Currently, Teta said the company sources cooking oil from more than 5,000 locations, including restaurants in New York City where it’s shipped to New Haven on trucks or barges. Middlemen who pick up the oil from the restaurants or food manufacturing facilities are supposed to filter it to remove bits of food and other impurities. Still, workers sometimes have to remove those impurities once the feedstock arrives or rejigger their process based on the types of oil used in frying machines.

“Using all these waste streams, all these different types of oil, it makes it harder on ourselves,” said Sean Hayden, the quality lab manager at American GreenFuels. “Luckily, our formulation is flexible.”

A growing business

The biodiesel industry has expanded considerably in recent years, a shift that has helped expand biodiesel applications beyond transportation to include uses like electric power and heating oil, one of the main uses of biodiesel in Connecticut. Those changes have had broader economic effects: Recent research found the biodiesel industry generated nearly $42.5 billion in economic impact nationally in 2024, along with 107,400 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages.

While American GreenFuels is one of a handful of East Coast operations, much of the growth in biofuels — a broader category that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable hydrocarbon fuels— has been concentrated in the Midwest. The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown. That expansion has led to concerns that some crops, like corn, are being diverted to biofuel production rather than the food supply.

The exact impact of corn-based biofuel production on food supplies and prices has been a point of contention between environmental groups and biofuel supporters. Biodiesel industry experts say other production methods, like the use of soybeans and specific operations like American GreenFuels’ use of previously used oils and fats, sidestep those tensions.

“There’s no food-for-fuel issue,” said Stephen Dodge, the director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, the trade organization that represents American GreenFuels and other member organizations. “It’s not like ethanol.”

In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025. Collectively, those plants are capable of producing nearly 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in a year.

And the industry is expected to grow further. Estimates currently suggest that biodiesel use could top 6 billion gallons by 2030 and reach 15 billion gallons by 2050.

But production has faced headwinds in 2025, with biodiesel output falling earlier this year due to uncertainty around the future of federal tax credits and lower-than-expected profit margins.

Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut. The biodiesel industry supports some 1,250 jobs in the region, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America, and brought in some $47 million in revenue, according to Dodge.

Supporters of biofuels argue that the energy source can help serve as a transitional step as the country moves towards electrification.

“It’s really paramount upon private industry and government to do everything they can to start reducing carbon emissions as quickly as they can,” said Dodge. “We think that biomass-based diesel is the way to go.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/greenfuels-771x4341764625406.jpg?h=af608c2c&itok=jxdyMEaO,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:35.524722

The Public News Service Monday afternoon update.

I'm Mike Clifford.

President Donald Trump reportedly gave Nicolas Maduro an ultimatum to relinquish power immediately during their call, but Venezuela's authoritarian leader declined, demanding global amnesty for himself and allies.

That for the Guardian.

The report on Sunday, Trump confirmed the call had taken place, telling reporters, ""I wouldn't say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.""

And from the BBC, Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct vigorous oversight into the U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that a U.S. strike on a boat in September left two survivors, but a second attack was carried out to comply with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's orders to kill everybody on board.

Hegseth denied the report, calling it fake news.

Meantime, unions in Kentucky and New Hampshire say they've made historic gains through coordinating bargaining.

Kayla Collette, the second shift steward for Local 728 in Kentucky, says the union made no concessions during their negotiations.

She says the wage increases in their contract benefit the region as a whole.

The agreements grant workers more freedom in determining work hours and weekly schedules and make other improvements to working conditions.

We've already seen that happen since we first bargained our initial contract in 2020.

It actually caused the wages in the area to have to get more competitive.

The unions represent more than 850 workers who process visa petitions.

This is Nadia Romligon for Kentucky News Connection.

Next, lawmakers in Maryland and clean energy advocates hope to pass legislation in next year's General Assembly session they say would make solar energy more affordable and accessible.

Under state law, utilities must either produce or purchase solar energy credits to prove a certain amount of power is coming from renewable sources or they're subject to a fine.

The proposed bill would also legalize balcony solar panels that can simply be plugged into an outlet.

Supporters of the legislation say those reforms will maximize impact and increase accountability for Maryland's clean energy buildup.

Maryland delegate Lorg Turkutian says the bill could also lower energy costs.

There will be no increase for ratepayers and the increased solar would put downward pressure on energy rates.

The Trump administration takes a hostile position on renewable energy, including solar.

And federal tax credits for making energy saving changes at home are expiring at the end of the year, but some opportunities for Oregonians to save on upgrades remain beyond 2025.

Originally established to last 10 years under the Inflation Reduction Act, these and other climate incentives are ending under the H.R. 1 bill, but Jamie Seymour with Energy Trust of Oregon says it's cash incentives and programs continue regardless of federal changes.

For people who have made these upgrades this year, they can receive both the tax credit and that incentive, really stacking those savings and taking advantage of that opportunity before the end of the year.

The expiring federal energy efficiency credits could save homeowners up to $3,200 on upgrades like heat pumps and insulation.

New data make it clear the housing market is challenging right now for first-time home buyers, but in South Dakota, an industry group says all hope is not lost.

Last month, the National Association of Realtors announced that the share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21 percent. say the numbers underscore how hard it is for younger generations to build wealth through home ownership.

Chas Olson with the South Dakota Housing Development Authority says there's no doubt affordability is a problem right now.

For a first-time home buyer who's primarily going to be looking at existing homes, factors like high interest rates probably have a greater impact on affordability.

He says market woes place pressure on some SDHDA programs, but he says they're also coming off a year in which they were able to help more than 2,000 first-time home buyers.

Olsen says younger working adults who might think the market is out of reach need to look into assistance options and see if they're eligible.

One of his team's programs helps buyers with maximum family incomes of around $120,000.

Next to Maine where officials warn a new federal directive will increase homelessness in the state.

The Trump administration is cutting funding for the Continuum of Care program, which helps move some of the most vulnerable people off the streets and into stable, supportive housing.

Mark Swan with the social service organization Preble Street says some 1,200 Mainers, including seniors, veterans and people with disabilities, are now at risk of losing their homes.

""You know, we don't have shelters that can support that many people and it's just a big step backwards.

I don't get why this is happening.""

Federal officials say the program has encouraged dependence on government handouts and that funding will now be directed toward short-term transitional housing to encourage greater self-sufficiency.

Swan notes the changes come despite a severe housing shortage in the state with emergency shelters already at capacity.

Finally, New Mexico is leaning into its rural roots in providing students with local healthy foods and school cafeterias, and the National Farm to School Network is taking notice.

The advocacy group brings its annual conference to Albuquerque starting today, noting the state's efforts to turn grassroots community-led food justice into policy.

The network's Jian Chan says the conference includes 40 workshops, farm and school field trips, hands-on classes, and presentation of the Golden Chile Awards, celebrating excellence in farm-to-cafeteria work.

I think everyone is familiar with the term farm-to-table and all of the benefits environmentally for the local economy, just the flavor and freshness of the food.

And so we want to bring that same benefits and the same concept to schools.

The Farm to School Network praised the state's universal school meals program adopted in 2023.

National Trends in Immigration Enforcement

As HCCL launches this resource, it operates against a backdrop of increased immigration enforcement actions. Recent ICE and U.S. Border Patrol enforcement activities have included extensive worksite raids.

Over the past year, more than 1,100 arrests have been reported nationwide in connection with over 40 worksite enforcement actions, targeting a variety of sectors, from manufacturing to agriculture. One of the largest raids occurred in Sept. at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, where 475 workers were detained.

These enforcement have resulted in a general sense of instability among employers and workers who may be reluctant to attend work or access public spaces.

Research indicates that these types of enforcement measures can significantly impact local economies. A recent study demonstrated that escalated ICE raids resulted in declines in private sector employment and consumer participation, ultimately affecting economic activity.

RAYVILLE, La., Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits — including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana's commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state's communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a power-first world.

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

""These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana's long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,"" said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. ""By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we're ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.""

""I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.""

""Truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana,"" said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell. ""I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity.""

Powering Louisiana's digital economy

Meta's new, state-of-the-art data center in north Louisiana is one of the largest investments in the region's history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed), and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy's customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana's position as a hub for data-driven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Customer benefits

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta's operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta's contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta's contributions toward Entergy's system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana's system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Investing in communities and economic growth

Beyond powering Louisiana's economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

""Entergy Louisiana's partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,"" said May. ""Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana's energy future—one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.""

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.

Finger, a Dallas partner and leader of the firm’s nationally recognized Private Equity Industry Team, said data center development is expected to sustain momentum into 2026, with traditional power grid sources — especially dispatchable gas-fired generation — continuing to play a critical role in meeting data centers’ substantial, consistent load demands.

As it relates to the broader investing environment, “…[t]he current market is very strong, and I am cautiously optimistic it will continue strong in the coming year,” Finger said. “The strength of the market goes beyond simple supply and demand. The money is there.”

As Finger explained, “Financing is relatively available and competitive, structural tailwinds remain and sell-side closings have accelerated in our practice as well.”

“We’re seeing eight to nine percent growth every year over the next five years,” Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen said in an interview.

Idaho Power is currently in the process of asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for a roughly 13% hike in rates.","Idaho Power is still pursuing its goal of being 100% powered by clean energy by 2045, but the utility’s latest plan shows more reliance on carbon-burning energy than before.

The latest Integrated Resource Plan released by Idaho Power shows the company is under pressure to power up to meet demands from a growing number of customers, as well as large users like data centers in the coming decades. The need to expand infrastructure to keep up with the boom in demand is behind both the company’s ask to increase rates and its rollback to needing more natural gas-powered plants in its portfolio long-term. This is a pivot from earlier plans that involved converting these plants to burning hydrogen in the later decades or powering them down completely.

Idaho Power estimates its customer base will grow from 648,000 at the end of December 2024 to 867,000 in 2045.

“We’re seeing eight to nine percent growth every year over the next five years,” Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen said in an interview. “That’s over 40% of our energy sales. That’s significant for us in every industry, you have lulls and surges and we seem to be in a surge right now. We’re scrambling to meet that.”

In 2019, the utility first announced plans to go coal-free. To meet this goal, Idaho Power said it planned to use 40% of the state’s power coming from hydroelectricity, along with new development of wind, solar, and battery storage to meet demand and take over the 20% of the company’s portfolio powered by coal. Another cornerstone of the company’s strategy to meet this goal is the construction of transmission lines to move power back and forth between Idaho and abundant hydroelectricity in the Pacific Northwest during the summer and the surge of solar power in the American Southwest during the winter.

The Boardman-Hemingway transmission line linking the Treasure Valley with the Pacific Northwest began construction this year and is expected to come online by the end of 2027 after decades of planning.

How have Idaho Power’s plans changed over time?

Idaho Power’s long-range plans, released every two years, show the ebb and flow of how much the company plans to rely on renewable energy as it works to meet the 2045 benchmark.

This latest plan relies more on natural gas than previous plans. In 2021, the company’s integrated resource plan called for converting a 357-megawatt coal-burning power plant to gas in 2024 and closing another 175 megawatts of coal-burning power by 2028. Then, by 2034, the company planned to close the converted gas plant in favor of other renewable sources like wind, battery storage, and solar.

This changed in 2023 when Idaho Power’s plan for that year showed coal plants converted to burn natural gas in 2024, 2026, and 2030. Then, the utility forecasted shutting down 706 megawatts of natural gas-burning power plants in 2038 in favor of burning hydrogen instead.

The 2025 plan once again shakes up the company’s approach with plans to convert two units at Idaho Power’s Bridger power plant in Wyoming from burning coal to natural gas next year. The utility forecasts being done burning coal by 2030. But this plan involves building two new natural gas plants in 2029 and 2030, as well as tentative plans for additional natural gas-burning capacity by 2041 and 2043. There are no plans to scale back natural gas generation in this latest plan or to add hydrogen-powered plants to the mix.

Hansen said Idaho Power needs natural gas, which isn’t subject to the cycles of the weather or the sun, to meet the spike in demand on the state’s power grid. Natural gas is a non-renewable fossil fuel and emits greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, but it does burn less CO2 than coal.

“Going forward, we still need further innovations to get there,” Hansen said, noting Idaho Power could use new technologies like carbon capture or other processes to provide a steady, cleaner power supply than coal. “…To date and where we are today, meeting our loads reliably requires some firm resources that emit carbon dioxide, like natural gas. It’s not a simple answer, and it’s a complex issue, to keep our system affordable and reliable into the future.”

Environmental groups like the Sierra Club say Idaho Power should do more to convert to renewable energy sources. Lisa Young, director of the Idaho chapter of the Sierra Club, called Idaho Power’s plans to build new gas plants “really, really alarming” and said the company can meet its growing needs with renewable energy rather than natural gas. She said this new plan raises questions about Idaho Power’s commitment to its 2045 clean energy goal.

“This is the first time we’re seeing this in their latest plans and should sound alarm bells for a lot of folks,” Young said. “To be investing in these things in the next five years, of course, if they’re going to be building any new infrastructure, any new assets, they’re going to want to use those for as long as they can. It won’t make sense to build a new gas plant and shut it down two years from now. Our concern is they’re going to invest in this new infrastructure, and we’ll be stuck burning gas for another few decades.”

Like its fluctuating plans to burn natural gas, Idaho Power’s plans for how much renewable energy it will add have also changed. Its 2021 plan envisioned adding 3,790 megawatts of wind, solar, and battery storage capacity through 2040. This spiked in 2023’s plan to more than 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy added, including several years of back-to-back investment in solar in the 2040s.

The 2025 plan backs off the amount of renewable energy in the plan down to 3,030 megawatts added through 2045.

Data centers, AI change energy plans

Artificial intelligence wasn’t on the general public’s radar six years ago, when Idaho Power first set out to meet its energy goals.

Data centers, particularly those built to support the extra computing power needed to power AI, are large users of electricity and water. Data centers across the country used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity last year, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency. Around the country, electricity prices are spiking in states like Virginia, where data centers to power the internet are plentiful.

Idaho is relatively new to the data center business. In 2020, the Idaho Legislature passed a tax break aiming to lure data centers to the state. So far, Meta and a 620-acre data center from Diode Ventures have set up shop in Kuna, but have not yet come online. These two projects have since sparked intense debate at the local and state level about their inclusion in urban renewal districts and their strain on the power grid or other resources, with relatively few high-paying jobs in return. Bills limiting the tax exemption for data centers and requiring companies to provide their own electricity were introduced in this year’s legislature session, but failed to get over the finish line.

Idaho Power is currently in the process of asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for a roughly 13% hike in rates. The utility also recently earned PUC approval to cut reimbursement rates to solar panel owners.

Hansen said many customers assume rates are going up due to new data centers coming into the state, but what is largely driving the need for the rate increase is the higher costs of steel, copper, transformers, and other materials needed to maintain and expand the power grid. He said that no data centers are currently online in Idaho, and the utility analyzes the needs of large users before they come online.

“We have in place a no-harm analysis and a study where we look and ensure those customers are paying for the resources they will need and other customers are not harmed,” Hansen said. “We want to make sure that all of our customers are not bearing the weight of those customers coming on, and we study those things with and without those customers to determine what the rates would look like and make sure those customers are bearing their own burdens and carrying the costs of services they’re encurring on the system.”",https://boisedev.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/idaho-power-set-clean-energy-goal-its-shifting-its-plans-including-new-natural-gas-plants-IMG-1608-EDIT.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:02:47.666808

The EPA has proposed significant changes to its 2023 PFAS reporting rule, marking a major shift from what had been one of the most expansive information-collection requirements ever imposed on manufacturers and importers.
In its new proposal, the EPA seeks to narrow the rule’s scope by exempting article importers entirely, as well as PFAS present in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less.
EPA also proposes altering the timing of compliance by delaying and shortening the reporting window, citing delays in developing its electronic reporting system.
Businesses that manufacture PFAS or import PFAS-containing products should consider evaluating how these proposed changes may affect their reporting obligations and whether to submit comments.","On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposal to significantly narrow the scope of its per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), just two years after finalizing the original rule in October 2023. The 2023 rule requires manufacturers, including importers, of PFAS and PFAS-containing products to submit extensive one-time reports to EPA covering any year of manufacture or import between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022.

The EPA has proposed significant changes to its 2023 PFAS reporting rule, marking a major shift from what had been one of the most expansive information-collection requirements ever imposed on manufacturers and importers. The EPA now claims that the rule created substantial and often impractical burdens, particularly for small businesses and article importers attempting to reconstruct decade-old supply-chain information with limited records.

In its new proposal, the EPA seeks to narrow the rule’s scope by exempting article importers entirely, as well as PFAS present in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less. The agency also proposes exemptions for byproducts, impurities, non-isolated intermediates, and certain research and development substances. These changes would remove a large portion of downstream entities from the rule and will allegedly reduce total industry compliance costs by more than $750 million. The EPA describes the revised approach as a practical recalibration that focuses on information most relevant to evaluating PFAS uses and exposures while avoiding what it now characterizes as disproportionate burdens.

Some environmental groups warn that excluding articles and low-concentration PFAS could leave substantial gaps in the national PFAS picture, given the prevalence of PFAS in global supply chains and the toxicity of certain compounds at very low levels. They argue that the exemptions risk obscuring potential PFAS sources at a time when regulators and communities are seeking more visibility into how these chemicals enter commerce.

EPA also proposes altering the timing of compliance by delaying and shortening the reporting window, citing delays in developing its electronic reporting system. Once published in the Federal Register, the proposal will be open for a 45-day comment period, during which regulated entities will have the opportunity to weigh in on whether the narrowed rule appropriately balances EPA’s information needs with practical implementation concerns. Businesses that manufacture PFAS or import PFAS-containing products should consider evaluating how these proposed changes may affect their reporting obligations and whether to submit comments.",https://lgwmlaw.com/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-01 20:00:46.888067

Blue hydrogen also faces some specific headwinds.","Exxon Mobil has pulled the plug on what would have been one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants, the latest setback for the effort to scale production of low-carbon versions of the fuel.

In 2022, the oil giant announced plans to build a facility at its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas, with the capacity to produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of so-called blue hydrogen, which is made using natural gas and carbon-capture equipment. It won a nearly $332 million grant from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy to finance the project.

But the Trump administration yanked that funding this spring. Since blue hydrogen typically costs about one-third more than the ​“gray” version of the fuel made with unmitigated gas, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said the company could not find enough buyers willing to pay the premium.

“There’s been a continued challenge to establish committed customers who are willing to provide contracts for off-take,” Woods said in an interview with Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corp. did not return Canary Media’s call Wednesday requesting comment.

The pullback highlights mounting problems for the clean hydrogen industry. Green hydrogen, the zero-carbon version of the fuel made with clean electricity and water, costs even more than the blue or gray types. In October, the Trump administration terminated federal funding for two regional hydrogen hubs on the West Coast that were meant to help bring down the cost of the green fuel. Blue hydrogen, in theory, was seen as less politically vulnerable since its production ensures a market for gas. But that, too, now appears to be running into similar problems.

“Exxon’s decision reflects a broader reality: Large-scale hydrogen projects depend on long-term market signals, stable policy environments, and customers ready to commit,” said Roxana Bekemohammadi, the founder and executive director of the United States Hydrogen Alliance, an industry group. ​“These dynamics take time to mature.”

But it’s not just the Energy Department’s decision to shutter its Industrial Demonstrations Program, which had given Exxon Mobil the grant, and the cuts to the 45V federal tax credits, which support low-carbon hydrogen production, that have put the industry on shaky ground.

Trump administration moves have also undermined demand for low-carbon hydrogen. In October, the U.S. government thwarted an effort at the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization to put a price on carbon emissions from the shipping sector, pressuring foreign delegates to back off a proposal that would have expanded the market for low-carbon hydrogen.

Blue hydrogen also faces some specific headwinds.

Late last month, the European Parliament passed legislation outlining rules for low-carbon hydrogen that require producers to demonstrate not only that carbon capture equipment catches at least 70% of emissions but also ​“pretty rigorous accounting of upstream methane leakage,” according to Pete Budden of the Natural Resources Defense Council. A study published last year in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy found that carbon-capture equipment could reduce emissions by 60%, below the threshold set in the European Union law.

“Based on the work we’ve done tracking emissions from blue hydrogen, it’s going to be really tough for U.S. hydrogen producers to meet that reduction with fossil fuels and [carbon capture and storage],” said Budden, the lead hydrogen advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ​“It’s a really ambitious emissions reduction because you need a really, really high capture rate, and you need to minimize all your upstream leakage.”

In the U.S., California remains the biggest market for the fuel. While state regulators slashed their 2030 forecast for hydrogen-powered vehicles, a giant power plant in Los Angeles just received approval to convert from gas to hydrogen.

“Yes, there have been significant reductions to federal funding for programs. Yes, we took a hit this year. Yes, it caused uncertainty in the markets. And yes, it caused some projects to pause,” said Katrina Fritz, the chief executive of the California Hydrogen Business Council, the nation’s largest and oldest statewide trade group for the fuel. ​“But in California, we still have offtake markets that are moving forward. There’s still demand. And we still have new production projects moving forward.”

“As he went through his two terms, there were allocations over time, particularly in private equity co-investments.
Then, last year, he was brought back as CIO by the new state treasurer, Brad Briner.
The plan has hovered around a 9 percent IRR across private equity investments over the past two fiscal years.
“Our primary goal though is to improve returns and the risk profile of the plan,” Sigrist said.","In a play to bolster performance, leaders of the North Carolina Retirement Systems are redefining the $139 billion plan’s approach to investments in several ways – beginning by eschewing a long-held fee-reduction focus – even accepting to pay for co-investments with select GPs.

Over nearly a decade, the system traded higher fee managers that boasted strong returns for cost-saving investment vehicles. Now, the plan is looking to swing the pendulum back.

As to why that is – the system’s CIO, Kevin Sigrist, points to a maxim he can recall from his time in graduate school studying economics: Prices push people around. People don’t like to get pushed around.

“The market is what it is, and there are costs associated with investments that are quite reasonable,” he said. “We all want to negotiate better fees, better terms. That’s part of our business. The reality is, if we’re really receiving a good investment and we expect to have good GPs … we have to be comfortable paying market fees.”

The plan’s refresh

There’s more than a change in fee philosophy going on at the pension. Among models it’s leaving in the past, the system is also shifting governance away from giving the North Carolina state treasurer sole discretion over the fund to a more typical five-member board.

The change in direction comes as the portfolio has an abundance of cash reserves. The goal, according to Sigrist, is to put that cash to work. And that’s exactly what the system has done over the past year, tallying up $6 billion in commitments.

Sigrist said that cash was built up as the system endeavored to reduce fees paid to investment managers and maintain a lower risk appetite between 2017 and 2024, when Dale Folwell served as the North Carolina state treasurer.

“[Folwell] was focused on bringing down overall cost structure of the investment program,” he said. “So, there weren’t many commitments made into traditional [private asset] funds.

“As he went through his two terms, there were allocations over time, particularly in private equity co-investments. There were some notable real estate transactions as well. But it wasn’t in the usual fashion you’d see with other public pension funds.”

The system didn’t maintain a pacing plan and a deployment target for its asset mix during that time. Opportunities were mostly reflective of what no-fee, no-carry co-investments were available in the market, Sigrist said.

Sigrist has a storied history with the pension, but wasn’t acting as its CIO at that time. Five years into a previous stay in that post, he resigned in 2017. Then, last year, he was brought back as CIO by the new state treasurer, Brad Briner.

“Since Briner came in as treasurer, he has pushed to restart all the plan’s investment programs and redeploy excess cash,” Sigrist said.

Briner also advocated for the state’s pension system to dispense with a sole-fiduciary model that put the treasurer at the helm of investment decisions, and to replace it with a board of trustees, akin to how peer pensions operate.

Enabled by the passage of a law referred to as the 2025 State Investment Modernization Act, the pension is now in the process of transitioning to a five-person authority chaired by the state treasurer.

Sigrist said the goal of that overhaul was to borrow from best practices in the pension space and insulate the pension’s portfolio from the political cycle.

“Over time, as we’ve had state treasurers turn over, they’d start afresh,” Sigrist said. “They’d revisit the mandates to do alternative investments and new asset classes, as well as the risk appetite – all of that.”

Looking ahead

As the system works to infuse its investment strategy with more flexibility, the hope is this new governance structure helps improve future returns.

“It creates the right environment,” Sigrist said. “It’s not a guarantee we’ll get better results, but what we’ve observed globally among our peers is governance really matters a lot in terms of improving the likelihood you’ll get good returns.”

Over a three-year span ending June 2022, North Carolina’s plan underperformed all state retirement systems with an average return of just 4.9 percent, based on a 2023 Yale University survey.

Performance has picked up in more recent financial reports released by the system. The plan has hovered around a 9 percent IRR across private equity investments over the past two fiscal years.

This December, the system’s new board will potentially reset the plan’s risk appetite and set the stage for further rebalancing the portfolio.

“We will recommend adding some risk, but not much – we’ll probably remain a fairly conservative fund overall compared to other state funds,” he said. “But until we finish that study with the board, it’s hard to know what we’re going to do in terms of what asset classes we might emphasize or de-emphasize.”

A lot of the system’s direction is still in flux. The new board is undergoing its first-ever asset liability study, as well as approving budgets that could allow the investment team to travel more than in the past and conduct due diligence with new and existing GPs.

But Sigrist did suggest that the investment team has identified novel opportunities among private assets today, including in the traditional energy continuation vehicle space.

“We have a rough estimate, based on talking to investment managers, that there’s probably about $150 billion of private equity energy funds that could come to market in the form of CVs or LP secondaries,” he said. “That sector has been neglected by a lot of investors due to ESG concerns. But we invest purely on a fiduciary basis by law. So, we’re looking at that as an attractive sector.”

The system will still be on the hunt for private equity managers willing to engage in discussions about co-investments and SMAs that help bring down the cost of the program, even under its new mandate.

“Our primary goal though is to improve returns and the risk profile of the plan,” Sigrist said. “Our cost structure has been too low, to be frank. We’ve had discussions with GPs – and we’re happy paying for co-investments. As I said before, we’re not looking to just get the cheapest deal flow going forward.”",https://media.buyoutsinsider.com/uploads/2017/03/Avison-Young-in-Raleigh.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:03:06.524178

Ambitious Domestic Targets and Grid Challenge

The export push is underpinned by China's immense domestic climate goals, announced as part of its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). China aims to expand the combined installed capacity of wind and solar power to approximately 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, a goal that is more than six times the 2020 level.

To achieve this goal, China would need to install new wind and solar capacity at a pace of roughly 200 GW per year. While the 3,600 GW target is widely considered ambitious on a global scale—total global capacity was around 1,400 GW at the end of 2024—some analysts argue it is conservative given the country's recent installation pace, which has exceeded 300 GW in some recent years.

The true challenge lies not just in manufacturing the equipment, but in integrating such a massive amount of fluctuating power into the world's largest electricity system. Experts at the University of California San Diego note that this will require major upgrades to grid integration, energy storage, and power market mechanisms to ensure reliability.

China's stated intention is to promote international cooperation in green infrastructure and strategically deploy future-oriented industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as it seeks to modernize its industrial system and maintain global influence in the clean energy sector.

Under the non-binding MOU, Fermi America and MVM EGI will partner on preliminary engineering and feasibility studies for a series of indirect hybrid cooling towers that will support both of Project Matador’s 6 gigawatts of combined-cycle natural gas generation and four AP1000 nuclear units.

Leveraging an existing hybrid cooling design, the partnership will adapt the system for West Texas conditions. Together, the companies will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, assess site and height constraints, and model the water-saving performance that hybrid cooling can deliver at scale.

This early engineering work lays the foundation for the campus’s long-term cooling strategy. The MOU outlines a sequence of milestones—including requirements definition, concept validation, and feasibility assessment—that will lead to a detailed design. Construction of the first cooling tower is scheduled to begin in January 2026, with the full cooling system completed by 2034 to match the phased build-out of the gas and nuclear units.

These hybrid towers represent a major advancement in responsible energy development. By relying primarily on air cooling and circulating water through closed-loop systems, the design sharply reduces evaporative loss, conserving precious water resources. The collaboration also includes evaluation of recycled and reclaimed water, as well as underground reservoirs and solar-covered retention ponds—technologies that further limit evaporation and protect the Ogallala Aquifer.

“Fermi isn’t some out-of-town operation parachuting in. Our leadership is from West Texas — we grew up on this dirt, and we care about the land and its resources,” stated Fermi America Co-Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer. “As promised, we’re working with global innovators like MVM to ensure Project Matador complements the long-term water needs of the region, building something big, but doing it the right way.”

“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” added MVM EGI P.L.C. CEO Péter Kárpáti. “We are pleased to partner with Fermi America, the world’s largest private utility, to ensure efficient and responsible cooling of their gas generation and nuclear power in the panhandle of Texas in line with our motto: Less water, more power.”

The collaboration reflects both companies’ commitment to transparent, community-oriented development. With billions of dollars in investment and a 99-year lease with the Texas Tech University System, Fermi America’s business model is directly tied to the health of the Panhandle and the long-term sustainability of the Ogallala Aquifer. The MOU reinforces that alignment by putting water conservation at the core of the project’s cooling strategy from day one.",https://insidehpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/data-center-generic-compute-hpc-shutterstock-1696920283.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:04:11.915544

As America grows increasingly electric, we will need to find new avenues of energy production and distribution to keep pace with demand. This process is not without challenges, but is necessary to avoid severe consequences.

At first glance, it may seem that energy production in the United States is right where it should be, with production at an all-time high. However, the current pace is still nowhere near enough to match future consumption. In 2050, energy demand is projected to be 50% higher than it is today.

In 2023, power use in the United States was 4,049 terawatt hours (TWh). 37% of the total usage was from transportation, such as cars, buses, aircraft and ships. 35% was from industrial uses, such as manufacturing, agriculture, mining and construction. The rest of the energy use was through residential and commercial avenues. In 2050, we will need at least 5,178 TWh to keep up with demand. To put things into perspective, 1 TWh is enough to power the internet for 15 days, the state of California for 12.5 days or 100 million homes for 1 hour.

For more context on why energy consumption is increasing, it is important to consider new trends in technology. For example, the rise of electric vehicles may add between 100 TWh to 185 TWh to the country’s electricity demand by 2030. AI is another factor, with a single AI server request requiring 8 watt-hours of energy. This is around 23x to 30x the energy used by a normal internet search.

The electrical grid in the United States is not equipped to keep up with such demand. In fact, between 2018 and 2022, 5% of electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States was lost each year. In 2025 numbers, this would be 202.45 TWh, which is enough energy to fully power over 14,000,000 homes.

Transmission lines in the United States are aging, with 70% of these lines measuring in at over 25 years old. This can lead to power outages, higher risk of cyber attacks and the potential for emergencies caused by faulty infrastructure. Power transformers are also in need of an upgrade, with roughly 55% of residential transformers nearing the end of their life.

Additionally, very few substations are staffed in the United States. This leaves important infrastructure more vulnerable to threats. In November 2022 alone, six substations in the Pacific Northwest were attacked. In December 2022, 45,000 homes and businesses lost power after an attack at two substations in North Carolina.

Unfortunately, updating this infrastructure poses challenges of its own. The US electrical grid is massive, stretching across over 470,000 miles. Replacing the entire grid would cost close to $5 trillion. Plus, equipment prices continue to increase; transformers have almost doubled in price since 2019. Another challenge is long interconnection queues. Long queues result in 80% of projects being withdrawn because of delays and costs.

Luckily, there are still viable ways forward. One key strategy will be to explore alternative power sources. This is a main goal of the United States government, which has pledged to quadruple its nuclear energy in the next 25 years.

Improving lead times and quality for equipment is also key. One way to do this is by working with US-based providers, such as ELSCO (Electric Service Company). With ELSCO, there is a 90% item availability and 24-48 hour quick-ship. This increased efficiency can save time and money, which will be important moving forward.

Energy is a vital part of our society. Without it, key services fall apart. As energy demand increases, the United States will need to implement creative solutions, such as tapping into alternative energy and investing in efficient equipment.",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:04:23.576821

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a policy and research organization dedicated to advancing the principles of free markets and limited government. We have a longstanding interest in bringing to light the deleterious consequences of federal regulations, which are often downplayed or ignored by agencies when adopting a regulatory agenda. CEI recently published “Modernizing The EPA: A Blueprint For Congress,”(Modernizing the EPA) which provides an overview of EPA programs under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and other statutes, and it includes a section on the Regional Haze Program at issue here. In it, we conclude that the Regional Haze Program, like most other decades-old programs administered by EPA, is now in need of significant course corrections if not outright repeal. While Modernizing the EPA was written primarily to provide legislative direction to Congress, its overview of the Regional Haze Program and recommendations for reform are relevant to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and are relied upon in this comment.

II. A Brief History of the Regional Haze Program

A. The Original Intent in 1977

The Regional Haze Program was added to the Clean Air Act in 1977. Unlike the primarily health-based measures elsewhere in the CAA, regional haze is purely an aesthetic concern. It largely focuses on emissions from coal-fired power plants that could potentially impair visibility in national parks and other scenic vistas, especially in the Western United States, The statute provides states with wide discretion in determining both the objectives and the compliance strategies to address regional haze, with only minimal EPA oversight.

B. The Federal Takeover of the Regional Haze Program

During the Obama administration, however, the EPA devised a strategy to, in CEI’s view, wrest control of the program from states and impose far more stringent and costlier provisions. Specifically, the agency, in conjunction with environmental organization litigants, used “sue and settle” to create a series of consent decrees, and did so with minimal state input. Although the consent decrees on their face merely imposed timing requirements for the EPA to either approve state implementation plans or issue its own, the agency was then able to bootstrap the deadlines established in these consent decrees to declare state compliance efforts inadequate and impose its own set of federal implementation plans on several states.

C. Turning Regional Haze into a War on Coal

The agency has used this newfound control to take the Regional Haze Program well beyond its original intent. No longer is the focus on improving visibility but rather to mandate the installation of costly control technologies on industrial facilities – and especially on coal-fired power plants whose emissions are not, in EPA’s view, adequately limited under all the health-based programs in the CAA. This has been part of the agency’s sweeping climate change agenda to make coal uneconomic by imposing a costly redundancy of requirements, thereby inducing more shutdowns. Here, the Obama administration’s federal requirements were as much as an order of magnitude costlier on impacted coal-fired facilities than the requirements the states considered sufficient to address visibility concerns.

The litigation strategy, though wisely halted under first Trump administration, was quickly revived under the Biden administration. Most significantly, a 2024 consent decree between several environmental groups and the EPA affects 33 states, requiring these states to either produce a regional haze plan acceptable to the agency or submit to a federal implementation plan. The focus is on the dwindling fleet of coal-fired electric generating units still operating in these states, and will result in additional measures on top of the many other CAA provisions already applicable to such facilities.

III. The Questionable Need for Further Measures in Light of Declining Emissions

With or without the Regional Haze Program, the emissions affecting visibility have been going down and will continue to do so. The use of coal for electricity generation has declined dramatically since peaking in the late 2000s and is now below the usage when the Regional Haze Program was authorized by Congress in 1977. Further, coal plant retirements are expected to continue in the years ahead. At the same time, emissions from the remaining coal-fired facilities (as well as other sources that may impact visibility) are far lower today than likely was anticipated back then. It is important to remember that the Regional Haze Program was designed to address the residual emissions after all the health-based standards in the CAA are implemented, but there is considerable doubt whether there remain any such emissions sufficient to appreciably impact visibility.

One recurring theme throughout Modernizing the EPA is that the agency often ignores the emissions reductions that have already occurred over the decades, no matter how substantial and ongoing, and continues to make the requirements more stringent despite questions about the statutory need for doing more. That is certainly the case with regional haze, where there is, at best, limited evidence of any lingering problem justifying additional emissions controls.

IV. Recommendations

We applaud the agency’s reconsideration of the previous administration’s policy on the Regional Haze Program and welcome this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as a first step in what we hope are substantial program reforms. At a minimum, we urge the EPA to jettison the “sue and settle” model and its preference for federal mandates imposed upon the states. Instead, the agency should restore state primacy over the program as envisioned in the statute – up to and including respecting state determinations that no additional control measures are needed to address visibility. We also urge the agency to fully acknowledge the changed circumstances since 1977, and especially the declining emissions trends that undercut the case for further costly constraints under the program.

The final rules (T.D. 10037), released Nov. 21, eliminate the so-called “funding rule,” which could have triggered the tax when a U.S. subsidiary helps its foreign parent finance a buyback. Commenters argued the rule was vague and could apply to routine transactions, making compliance costly and uncertain.

The regulations also tighten other areas. They remove a proposed “no double benefit” item that would have disregarded certain reorganization and distribution transactions for purposes of the netting rule under Sec. 4501(c)(3). They also clarify the treatment of certain preferred stock, such as excluding “plain vanilla” stock described in Sec. 1504(a)(4) from the definition of stock subject to the tax, treating it as more akin to debt.

Background

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, P.L. 117-169, included a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases by publicly traded corporations under Sec. 4501.

The final regulations cover the fair market value (FMV) of a corporation’s stock that certain corporations repurchase during a tax year (the stock repurchase excise tax). The IRS issued the proposed regulations in April 2024. Then, in July 2024, it issued final regulations that provided rules on the procedure and administration applicable to the reporting and payment of the excise tax.

Relief for M&A transactions

The IRS scaled back the tax’s application to mergers and acquisitions, excluding “take-private transactions” and leveraged buyouts and liquidations under Secs. 331 and 332.

Application

The excise tax applies to repurchases made after Dec. 31, 2022, and is based on the FMV of stock bought back during the tax year.

Expiring federal energy efficiency credits can save homeowners up to $3,200 on upgrades like heat pumps and insulation. Originally established to last 10 years under the Inflation Reduction Act, these and other climate incentives are ending under the One Bill Beautiful Bill Act passed in July.

Jami Seymore, spokesperson for the Energy Trust of Oregon, said its cash incentives and programs will continue regardless of federal changes.

For a full list of signatories, see the original letter from Americans for Prosperity – South Carolina below:","We, the undersigned organizations, urge you to advance and enact the Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act (H. 3021) – a commonsense REINS-style reform that passed the South Carolina House of Representatives unanimously and now awaits action in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

South Carolina’s small businesses are too often burdened by a tangled and ever-expanding web of regulations that often grow without sufficient legislative oversight or accountability. Many of these regulations are outdated or unnecessary, stifling innovation, hindering job creation, and placing a disproportionate burden on the very businesses that drive our communities. Imagine a local bakery struggling to navigate complex labeling requirements that differ from neighboring states, or a local manufacturer delaying expansion because of confusing and inconsistent permitting processes. These real-world examples highlight how excessive regulation can cripple small businesses before they have a chance to grow and thrive.

The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act restores balance, transparency, and accountability to the rulemaking process by ensuring that major new regulations cannot take effect without legislative approval. This key REINS-style safeguard reaffirms that the authority to make laws rests with elected representatives – not unelected bureaucrats.

In addition, H. 3021 includes several critical reforms that strengthen good governance and protect South Carolinians from regulatory overreach:

Judicial Deference Reform: Clarifies that courts shall not automatically defer to an agency’s interpretation of law, ensuring that judges – not regulators – have the final say on what the law means. This change promotes fairness, predictability, and adherence to legislative intent.

Regulatory Review and Sunset: Establishes a systematic review process to identify outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary regulations and provides for automatic expiration dates to prevent obsolete rules from lingering indefinitely.

Economic Impact Analysis: Requires agencies to provide detailed fiscal and economic assessments for proposed regulations, giving lawmakers and the public a clear understanding of costs and consequences before rules take effect.

Small Business Protection: Directs agencies to consider less burdensome alternatives and to justify any regulatory action that imposes significant costs on small employers.

Together, these reforms create a more accountable and transparent regulatory environment – one that strengthens the separation of powers and promotes economic growth across South Carolina.

We respectfully urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to promptly take up H. 3021 and for the full Senate to pass and enact this vital legislation early in the 2026 legislative session. Swift action will ensure timely implementation and deliver long-overdue relief to small businesses across our state.

The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act will reduce unnecessary red tape, promote innovation and, and create a level playing field for entrepreneurs in South Carolina – allowing them to focus on what they do best: creating jobs, innovating, and serving their communities. South Carolina’s job creators deserve a government that it is accountable, responsive, and focused on enabling – not obstructing – opportunity.

How Much Do Americans Need To Live Comfortably?
In Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Tucson, a single adult can live comfortably on less than $87,000 a year.
Hawaii, New York, California, and Massachusetts top the list, with single adults needing over $130,000 per year to live comfortably.","American families are facing a convergence of economic pressures that are redefining what it means to live comfortably. After years of elevated inflation, the cost of essentials — from housing and groceries to transportation and health care — remains persistently high. At the same time, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace is introducing new uncertainty in traditionally stable white-collar industries, adding to financial strain for many middle- and upper-middle-income earners.

In this environment, understanding how much income is needed not just to get by, but to live comfortably, is top of mind for many Americans. This report from Upgraded Points, a company that provides advice on credit card reward programs and other financial products, applies the 50/30/20 budget rule — a widely used framework for balancing needs, wants, and savings — to estimate the income required to maintain a comfortable standard of living across the largest U.S. metro areas and all 50 states.

How Much Do Americans Need To Live Comfortably?

According to the 50/30/20 rule, a well-balanced budget allocates 50% of income to necessities, 30% to discretionary spending, and 20% to savings or debt repayment. When paired with cost-of-living data from the Economic Policy Institute, this framework provides a benchmark for determining the minimum income required to sustain a financially comfortable lifestyle.

Nationally, a single adult with no children in 2025 would need $106,745 per year in pretax income to stay within this budget structure. For 2 adults with no children, the threshold rises to a combined $138,643. Costs increase significantly with the addition of children: a 2-parent household would need $194,038 with 1 child, $233,158 with 2, and $278,252 with 3.

These figures offer a national baseline, but living costs vary dramatically by region. The next section looks at how much income is needed in the country’s largest metro areas, where expenses like housing and child care are often far above the national average.

The Income It Takes To Live Comfortably in America's Largest Cities

Living comfortably in the United States looks very different depending on where you are. Among the country’s largest metropolitan areas, the income needed varies by more than $75,000 for a single adult — and more than $250,000 for a family of 5 — depending on the local cost of necessities such as housing, child care, and taxes.

At the top of the scale are 3 California metro areas: San Jose, San Francisco, and San Diego. In the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a single adult needs to earn $163,045 per year to live comfortably, the highest among the nation’s largest metro areas. For a 2-parent household with 3 children, that figure climbs to $478,630 — over $200,000 more than the national average for the same family type. Similarly, the San Francisco and San Diego MSAs require incomes of $148,441 and $146,080, respectively, for a single adult to stay within the 50/30/20 budget. This high-income requirement reflects the outsized cost of living across coastal California, where housing and taxes are particularly expensive. On the East Coast, Boston and New York are not far behind.

At the other end of the spectrum are cities in the Midwest and South, where living costs are significantly lower. In Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Tucson, a single adult can live comfortably on less than $87,000 a year. For a family of 5, the required income ranges from $240,709 in Pittsburgh to $250,997 in Cleveland — roughly half the income needed in the highest-cost metro areas. These regions tend to have more affordable housing markets and lower daily living costs for everything from gas to groceries.

How Much It Takes To Live Comfortably in Every U.S. State

Similar trends hold at the state level, where the nation’s most expensive states are concentrated along the West Coast and Northeast. Hawaii, New York, California, and Massachusetts top the list, with single adults needing over $130,000 per year to live comfortably. For a 2-parent household with 3 children, the income required exceeds $330,000 in all 4 states. Other high-cost, coastal states include Washington, New Jersey, Maryland, and Connecticut.

Meanwhile, the most affordable states are found in the Midwest and South. In North Dakota, a single adult needs just $83,144 — the lowest among all states. Ohio, Iowa, Arkansas, and Indiana also all fall below $88,000 for individuals, with family income needs far lower than in coastal states.

Here is a summary of the data for Indiana:

Salary needed to live comfortably (1 adult, 0 kids): $87,952

Combined salary needed to live comfortably (2 adults, 0 kids): $119,105

Combined salary needed to live comfortably (2 adults, 1 kid): $165,671

The move is intended to accelerate the low-carbon transition of the nation's vast manufacturing sector.

Li Lecheng, minister of industry and information technology, said in a piece for China Daily, that China's determination to pursue a green transition in manufacturing underscores its drive to foster new quality productive forces and pursue high-quality development. He stressed that this commitment persists even as global climate governance encounters setbacks and some nations potentially backtrack on their pledges.

China will ""encourage competitive Chinese enterprises in photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries and new energy vehicles to expand globally and to invest in and develop green energy projects in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and beyond,"" Li said.

Global Market Impact and Cost Revolution

China's expanding clean technology manufacturing base, which controls more than 70 percent of global capacity in major clean-tech segments, has reshaped the world's energy transition. The sheer volume of Chinese exports has made renewable energy solutions more affordable and accessible globally, particularly for emerging economies.

Over the past decade, solar panel prices have fallen to record lows, a trend largely attributed to the scale and efficiency of Chinese manufacturing, according to data from energy think tanks. For many developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this has facilitated a faster adoption of wind and solar power, enabling a path toward economic growth and emissions reduction.

In the first seven months of 2025, China's exports of the ""new three"" industries—electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries—surged to over $120 billion, an increase that reflects the rising volume of exports despite falling unit prices, according to data from the UK-based energy think tank Ember. This surge is driving a global shift, where 92.5 percent of all newly installed power capacity worldwide in 2024 came from renewable sources.

Geopolitical Friction Over Subsidies

The aggressive expansion, however, is being met with protectionist measures in Western markets. The European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) have raised concerns over what they describe as massive state subsidies that allow Chinese companies to export goods at prices that undercut local manufacturers.

Analysis by groups such as Bruegel and BloombergNEF indicates that extensive state backing, including direct funding and cheap credit, has created an unrivalled cost advantage for Chinese manufacturers. This competitive edge has led to acute global overcapacity in sectors like solar and batteries.

In response, the European Commission has imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports following an investigation into unfair subsidies. Similarly, the U.S. has maintained high tariffs and introduced proposals to prohibit Chinese hardware and software in connected vehicles, citing national security concerns.

Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF, noted that while global clean energy deployment continues to surge, ""overcapacity will define clean technology supply chains for years to come,"" and that ""emerging markets will rapidly step up imports of energy transition products as prices fall further.""

Ambitious Domestic Targets and Grid Challenge

The export push is underpinned by China's immense domestic climate goals, announced as part of its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). China aims to expand the combined installed capacity of wind and solar power to approximately 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, a goal that is more than six times the 2020 level.

To achieve this goal, China would need to install new wind and solar capacity at a pace of roughly 200 GW per year. While the 3,600 GW target is widely considered ambitious on a global scale—total global capacity was around 1,400 GW at the end of 2024—some analysts argue it is conservative given the country's recent installation pace, which has exceeded 300 GW in some recent years.

The true challenge lies not just in manufacturing the equipment, but in integrating such a massive amount of fluctuating power into the world's largest electricity system. Experts at the University of California San Diego note that this will require major upgrades to grid integration, energy storage, and power market mechanisms to ensure reliability.

China's stated intention is to promote international cooperation in green infrastructure and strategically deploy future-oriented industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as it seeks to modernize its industrial system and maintain global influence in the clean energy sector.

As the U.S. debates the future of renewable energy, Connecticut stands at a crossroads. Once seen as a key player in the nation’s offshore wind boom, the state now faces uncertainty following the federal government’s recent pullback on wind energy projects. For Connecticut — where state leaders have invested heavily in ports, transmission infrastructure, and clean energy partnerships to drive both economic growth and emissions reductions — the shift raises urgent questions about what comes next.

YSE News spoke with Daniel Esty, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy, and Kenneth Gillingham, the Grinstein Class of 1954 Professor of Environmental and Energy Economics, about how wind power development has evolved in Connecticut, the state’s strategies for advancing renewable energy in a shifting federal landscape, and what will be needed to sustain momentum .

Q. How has wind power development in Connecticut evolved, and what strategies or policies do you see as most effective for maximizing its benefits while minimizing environmental and social impacts?

Esty: Wind power development in Connecticut, and everywhere else, requires a policy framework that creates incentives for investment and an attractive opportunity for wind generation developers. These incentives can be based on federal laws, regulations, and subsidies or on state programs. Some of the critical rules relate to siting and permit requirements, which need to ensure both that (1) potential environmental and social concerns are addressed and (2) these processes move expeditiously. The second critical policy dimension centers on ensuring that public money and incentives are used to leverage private capital at speed and scale.

Gillingham: Connecticut has very limited onshore wind resources, so for many years, there were only a handful of wind turbines in the state. In fact, one of these is right in New Haven Harbor. But the Long Island Sound is blessed with extensive offshore wind resources. As offshore wind prices have declined over the years, there has been increasing interest in tapping this resource. Offshore wind also came along with the promise to provide jobs in some of the working-class shoreline communities in Connecticut. The state of Connecticut has gone to great lengths to encourage the staging of offshore wind development in cities like Bridgeport and New London, and this is a sensible strategy to try to make sure that offshore wind provides economic benefits to the state.

Maximizing the benefits of offshore wind while minimizing environmental and social impacts generally requires both analysis and deep collaboration with stakeholders, and in particular the fishing community.

Q. With pullback at the federal level, how can CT and other states who have invested in wind projects continue to move them forward?

Gillingham: With the pullback at the federal level, there is only so much that Connecticut and other states can do to continue to move wind projects forward. They can expedite state permitting and provide state support. But if offshore wind is not permitted at the federal level, it will certainly hinder development.

Q. What are the main challenges or disadvantages of wind energy, and how do you see it advancing relative to other renewables?

Esty: Wind power faces a number of challenges — notably, the need to be paired with strategies to promote investment in batteries or other approaches for electricity storage to overcome the reality of the intermittency of wind power. Wind power also requires that projects proceed on a basis that results in cost effective power generation. Success in this regard depends on siting and permitting processes that move forward with speed but also care. The key is to make these projects attractive from a perspective of predictability and cost-effectiveness, thus engaging for those deploying capital in the clean energy arena.

Gillingham: Onshore wind energy is quite cost-effective in many locations and is often more economic than using fossil fuels. Offshore wind is more expensive but is valuable due to the consistency and timing of the winds just offshore. Importantly, the winds often very consistently blow in the evening hours, just after the sun goes down when demand for electricity is commonly the highest. This makes wind an ideal resource to complement solar energy, which is now less expensive but without storage cannot generate electricity once the sun goes down.

There are some other disadvantages of wind power. While new wind turbines are designed to minimize bird loss, some birds do fly into the turbines and perish. In addition, the newest wind turbines are extremely large, which makes them more efficient and cost effective. But some people find them unsightly and prefer unspoiled landscapes. For offshore wind in particular, the construction of the wind turbines can disrupt fishing and breeding grounds. Fishers also will have to be more careful around the turbines.

RAYVILLE, La. –Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits — including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana’s commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state’s communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a power-first world.

This project reinforces what we are seeing across Louisiana: when we modernize our energy infrastructure, we unlock growth for every region of our state,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Under Governor Landry’s leadership, we are strengthening reliability, powering innovation and creating the conditions for long-term economic opportunity. Entergy’s investment demonstrates the value of partnership and the competitive advantage Louisiana brings to a power-first economy.”

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

“I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.”

“Truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana,” said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell. “I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity.”

Powering Louisiana’s digital economy

Meta’s new, state-of-the-art data center in north Louisiana is one of the largest investments in the region’s history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed), and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy’s customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana’s position as a hub for data-driven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Customer benefits

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Investing in communities and economic growth

Beyond powering Louisiana’s economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future—one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.

A new modeling approach that draws data from personal weather stations can more accurately capture air temperatures across U.S. cities, according to researchers in the Division of Translational Toxicology.

Heatwaves have grown more frequent in recent decades and are expected to intensify in the coming years. This trend is especially concerning in cities due to the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon in which urban areas are several degrees warmer than their surrounding rural areas. Exposure to extreme heat can increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney diseases. However, most U.S. cities do not monitor weather patterns in enough detail to generate the data scientists need for epidemiological studies.

To address this limitation, the researchers developed a model that estimates hourly air temperatures to which people are exposed with high spatial resolution — meaning it can detect local phenomena such as overheating neighborhoods and the cooling effect of parks. In doing so, they relied on an extensive network of personal weather stations. This approach resulted in accurate coverage of meteorological events such as heatwaves and snowstorms in Philadelphia, New York City, Phoenix, and the Triangle area in North Carolina.

The method also revealed that densely populated neighborhoods are more likely to experience high temperatures and longer, warmer nights. According to the authors, their model could strengthen future epidemiological studies of heat-related health effects. In addition, the approach could improve heatwave alerts that are tailored to specific regions to protect vulnerable populations. (JW) (See related article.)

Pesticides linked to higher rheumatoid arthritis risk in farm women

Exposure to organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, and other pesticides, may raise the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in farm women, according to NIEHS researchers and collaborators. The study is the largest to examine pesticide exposures in relation to RA in this population, and the first to also consider indirect exposures due to applicators’ use.

Growing evidence shows that farming and pesticide use may contribute to RA. However, few studies have examined the effects of specific pesticides on RA risk among women living on farms, where they may be personally or indirectly exposed to pesticides.

To address this gap, the researchers investigated RA incidence among female spouses of licensed private pesticide applicators/farmers in the Agricultural Health Study. They assessed both personal use of 32 specific pesticides by spouses and indirect exposures based on applicators’ use.

They found that personal use of several insecticides – the organochlorine DDT and lindane, the organophosphates coumaphos and malathion, the carbamate called carbofuran, and permethrin – was associated with higher RA risk. Spouses’ RA risk was also associated with personal use of the use of the herbicide metribuzin, and fungicides captan and metalaxyl. Among women who did not personally apply pesticides, RA risk was also greater in those with indirect exposure to the insecticide carbaryl, the herbicide metribuzin and the fungicides maneb/mancozeb.

These findings suggest that both personal and indirect use of certain pesticides may contribute to RA in women. The authors recommend future studies on the role of contemporary insecticides also widely used for residential and public health purposes. (MD)

How a key protein controls mRNA stability

A protein called tristetraprolin (TTP) promotes the decay of specific mRNAs by interacting with multiple molecular partners, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators at the National Cancer Institute.

TTP is an RNA-binding protein that controls the stability of mRNA in cells. Specifically, TTP promotes the decay of a subset of mRNAs that contain particular target motifs. Many of these mRNAs encode cytokines involved in the inflammatory and innate immune responses. Deficiency of TTP in mice leads to a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome with arthritis, osteopenia, and autoimmunity. TTP expression is frequently down-regulated in human cancers, and this is often correlated with poor patient prognosis and tumor progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which TTP controls mRNA stability and influences disease development have remained unclear.

The researchers show that TTP regulates mRNA stability by interacting directly with the CCR4–NOT complex, a large multiprotein complex that degrades mRNA by promoting the stepwise loss of the polyA tail. TTP also promotes mRNA decay by binding to PABPC1, a protein that typically enhances mRNA stability by binding to the polyA tail. The results highlight the ability of TTP to simultaneously interact with different protein molecules to effectively destabilize mRNA, and thus rapidly affect gene expression in response to environmental cues or stress signals.

Future studies will be needed to determine the structural basis of these interactions, and whether altering these interactions could affect the wide range of diseases linked to disrupted mRNA stability. (JW)

A sugar called hyaluronan can help treat viral infections

Treatment with a natural lung-repairing molecule called hyaluronan improves outcomes in mice and humans infected with viruses, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Viral lung infections such as influenza and COVID-19 are a major cause of illness and deaths worldwide. Many existing treatments do not prevent adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation, tissue damage, and fluid buildup. There is also a critical need for treatments that could be rapidly deployed against a wide range of emerging viral infections.

To address this problem, the researchers examined the potential therapeutic properties of high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWHA), a sugar found in healthy tissue that reduces inflammation and promotes lung repair. Mice were infected with influenza or SARS-Cov2, which causes COVID-19, and treated with either HMWHA or saline control. HMWHA increased survival rates in mice infected with either virus by reducing inflammation and limiting viral movement through mucus.

In humans, inhaled HMWHA improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, shortening ventilator use and hospital stays among older patients with acute respiratory failure. According to the authors, the study lays the foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMWHA as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. (JW)

Simplifying single-cell datasets

A powerful computational tool called GIBOOST enhances the visualization and interpretability of single-cell datasets to provide critical biological insights, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

High-dimensional, single-cell data consists of complex measurements of many features from individual cells, such as gene expression, protein levels, and signaling activity. These datasets are important for characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases. However, these datasets are often challenging to visualize and interpret, limiting insights into disease progression or drug responses.

To address this challenge, the researchers developed a computational framework called GIBOOST, which is driven by artificial intelligence (AI). GIBOOST offers a holistic view of the data by combining the strengths of existing tools while minimizing their limitations. The tool reduces the complexity of the data while preserving essential features, enabling effective visualization and interpretation.

The researchers showed that GIBOOST provides superior visualization of cell-cell communication and cellular transitions during processes such as sperm cell production and placenta development compared with standard methods. This approach could enable researchers to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of complicated, dynamic biological processes across different tissues and disease states. Ultimately, this information could support the development of effective treatments and the promotion of optimal health. (JW)

Chemical health hazards following train derailment identified

A new literature review by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators highlights the potential health consequences of chemical releases following disasters such as train derailments.

In 2023, a Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals released into the air, water, and soil. To prevent an explosion, emergency responders conducted a vent and burn of five rail cars containing a carcinogenic gas called vinyl chloride.

To better understand the disaster’s potential health hazards, the researchers conducted a literature review of studies on 22 chemicals that may have been released after the derailment. Their analysis revealed that eight of these chemicals can irritate the skin, eyes, or respiratory tract, findings consistent with symptoms reported by community members and first responders.

The team also found that five of the chemicals are known to cause cancer, two may damage the immune or nervous system, and one could harm reproductive organs or fetal development. In addition, the researchers identified knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future studies. According to the authors, these insights could inform communication and health-monitoring strategies related to toxic chemical releases during derailments and other disasters.

Improving immunotherapies for allergic asthma

A new study has revealed a specific type of lung immune cell that reduces allergic reactions to inhaled allergens, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Allergic asthma is a common disease triggered by immune reactions to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Currently, there remains an urgent need for immunotherapies that work quickly and improve patient adherence.

Toward this goal, the researchers investigated lung conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which help promote tolerance to allergens. The results revealed that type 2 cDCs (cDC2s) express high levels of a protein called CD301b. These cells strongly activated T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are known to suppress allergic responses. When transferred to mice, these cDC2s induced immunological tolerance to inhaled allergens.

The findings shed light on how cDCs and Treg cells develop and function in the lung, broadening the understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of asthma. According to the authors, future studies focusing on the newly characterized cDC2s may pave the way for improved strategies to prevent or treat allergic asthma. (JW)

Hair straightener/relaxer use may be linked to pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer

Women who use hair straighteners may face a higher risk of developing various types of cancer, according to a new study by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Hair products such as straighteners and chemical relaxers are widely used, despite previous findings linking them to increased risks of reproductive cancers (breast, ovarian, and uterine). Whether these products are associated with other types of cancer has been less clear. To help address this knowledge gap, the researchers analyzed data from 46, 287 women aged 35-74 years, tracking cancer diagnoses over an average follow up period of 13 years.

The results showed that use of hair straighteners and chemical relaxers at the time of enrollment was linked to higher rates of thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer. The study participants were 84% non-Hispanic White women; thus, the authors emphasized the need for future research in more racially and ethnically diverse populations — particularly with more representation of Black and Hispanic women, who tend to use these products more frequently.

According to the authors, the findings broaden the understanding of potential health risks associated with chemical hair products. More research is needed to identify which ingredients contribute to cancer development and to clarify the biological mechanisms that may be involved in this process. (JW)

Airborne phthalates linked with high blood pressure

Exposure to phthalates emitted from industrial sources may increase the risk of high blood pressure, according to an NIEHS researcher and collaborator.

Phthalates are widely used chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. As endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can be released into the air, they interfere with hormones and have been linked to a range of health problems. Although other EDCs have been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the potential relationship between phthalate exposure and high blood pressure, or hypertension, remains unclear.

To investigate this question, the researchers analyzed interview responses and blood pressure measurements from 47,465 women participating in the Sister Study. They estimated exposure to phthalates based on a national air toxin database linked to participants’ home addresses. The results showed that higher levels of airborne phthalates were associated with an increased risk of hypertension, especially among women who were not non-Hispanic White.

Given the widespread presence of phthalates and the growing prevalence of hypertension, the findings have important public health implications. The authors noted that air quality regulations and environmental policies may be needed to reduce phthalate emissions. They also highlighted the importance of future studies to clarify how these chemicals may alter biological pathways that lead to hypertension or related health conditions. (JW)

How air pollution affects breast cancer in the U.S.

A large analysis, U.S.-based study led by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators shows that several air pollutants are linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.

Breast cancer incidence has steadily increased in the U.S. in recent decades. Previous research suggests that exposure to environmental chemicals and pollutants may contribute to this trend. For example, air pollution contains molecules that can act as carcinogens and can disrupt hormones, potentially contributing to the development of breast cancer. Yet limited evidence exists on how these associations may vary by breast tumor subtype or geographically, due to differing sources of pollutants.

The researchers analyzed data from five large U.S. cohorts, including more than 28,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer. The results revealed a positive association between residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide and breast cancer risk, consistent with previous studies. In addition, outdoor levels of fine particulate matter were associated with a higher breast cancer risk among participants living in the Midwest. Exposure to both fine particulate matter and ozone were associated with a higher risk of hormone receptor-negative tumors, which tend to grow more aggressively and respond to fewer treatment options.

According to the authors, air pollution may contribute to a larger number of breast cancer cases than previously recognized, given widespread environmental exposures and high rates of the disease. (JW)

Renewable and low-carbon systems will be at the core as it eyes global leadership in sustainable and inclusive growth, powered by clean energy, sustainable industries, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forests and green urban systems, as per the Telangana Rising 2047 Vision document that is set for launch next week.

Near-zero emissions are to be achieved on the back of large-scale deployment of renewables, retrofitting of existing coal-based capacity with advanced SOₓ and NOₓ emission control systems, fully integrated with storage, smart grids and green hydrogen, providing 24×7 clean, reliable and affordable rates for all citizens, the government said.

The State will formulate robust policies for renewable energy development, grid modernisation and market reforms to ensure affordable, reliable power. Clean and Green Energy Policy 2.0 will facilitate renewable integration, storage, open access, time-of-day pricing and PPP-driven distribution reforms. A State Net Zero Power Council will be set up to coordinate innovation and progress; and industries can directly procure renewables via power exchanges or group captive models.

Estimating power demand to rise from 100 TWh in 2026 to 780 TWh 2047, with peak demand soaring from 19 GW to 139 GW, the government said 90% of capacity by 2047 will be renewables and storage systems. Cleaner and efficient thermal will account for balance 10%.

More than 60% of energy generated by 2047 will be battery and pumped-hydro storage, supported by smart grids and green hydrogen integration. A total of 765 kV green transmission corridors will connect solar and wind generating areas, along with being enabled by IoT and AI-based grid control.

No ICE vehicle sales after 2039

On integrated smart mobility, the government said that a seamless, smart and sustainable transport network is to be developed. Almost 80% of existing and all new urban routes will have aspects of non-motorised transport, ensuring a people-first, low-carbon mobility network State-wide.

Elaborating on the pathways to 100% clean mobility, it said Hyderabad will have the largest electric bus fleet by 2030. By 2047, all passenger transport, from metro, MMTS and buses will be ZEV and 80% of private 2W/3W/4W will be ZEV. Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will not be sold after 2039.

Setting up 6,000 public charging stations by 2030 and establishing fast-charging corridors every 20 km by 2047 besides hydrogen refuelling stations connecting highways and industrial routes form part of the proposals. Telangana Mobility Valley (TMV) will be promoted as a global centre for manufacturing as well as research and development related to EV and energy storage, battery recycling, and hydrogen and fuel-cells.

The State is keen on developing metro rail networks in all cities with populations exceeding 5 lakh and deploy AI-based traffic management and integrated real-time multimodal transport platforms. It will promote walking and cycling infrastructure, implement transit-oriented development (TOD); green tax and vehicle scrappage policy for high EMF (high-emission fossil) vehicle retirements, besides developing elevated corridor to initially operate high-capacity buses, with provisions to convert it into a rail-based transit track as passenger demand grows.

The government also plans to have renewable energy corridors and strategies such as Mahbubnagar — Wanaparthy, Jogulamba-Gadwal, and Nagarkurnool, Narayanpet for solar projects; floating solar in major lakes across the State; rooftop solar-powered metro and e-mobility for Greater Hyderabad, Warangal, and Karimnagar; and harnessing wind power in Narayanpet, Vikarabad and Sangareddy.

For the capital required to drive clean energy growth, the government plans to tap green bonds and blended-finance instrument, while optimising carbon credit trading system and engaging with national and global markets to generate recurring climate finance.

Actions taken by EPA in 2025 to date demonstrate sustained TSCA enforcement, including with respect to chemical regulations and particularly chemical data reporting requirements. Environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also utilizing TSCA’s Section 20 citizen suit authority to bring lawsuits against companies over alleged reporting noncompliance as well. Chemical manufacturers and importers should stay apprised of these enforcement trends and proactively manage their TSCA compliance strategies to reduce enforcement and litigation risk.

EPA Enforcement in 2025

While the government has scaled back civil environmental enforcement in federal court, EPA’s administrative enforcement remains robust and appears to be accelerating. In the third quarter of calendar year 2025, EPA resolved 198 administrative enforcement actions across the statutes it administers—up from 179 case conclusions in the second quarter—and has assessed over $9 million in penalties. Although many of these cases likely were initiated during the prior administration, the continued settlement approvals reflect EPA’s focus on “core” enforcement work under the current administration.

EPA’s TSCA enforcement and compliance assurance program includes four key focus areas: new and existing chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, and lead-based paint. From time to time, aspects of the TSCA enforcement program have been included amongst EPA’s national focus areas, as reflected in the National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives that EPA selects on four-year cycles. TSCA enforcement largely is, however, part of “core” enforcement work, which Administrator Zeldin has made a priority for the agency.

Since the beginning of the current administration, EPA has pursued 115 new administrative enforcement actions and assessed approximately $4.3 million in penalties for TSCA violations. The vast majority of these cases (about 80 percent) concern lead-based paint regulation noncompliance, which have generally resulted in lower penalty assessments than chemicals enforcement actions. Of the ten largest TSCA penalties assessed this year to date, five were for chemicals enforcement actions. For example, the agency assessed its single largest TSCA penalty in 2025—$700,000—for violations of the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, where the respondent allegedly failed to report 334 imported chemicals for the 2024 reporting cycle. EPA assessed six‑figure penalties in three other CDR rule enforcement actions—$415,000, $393,000, and $112,155—as well as a $100,000 penalty for alleged violations of the methylene chloride risk management rule for paint removers.

NGO Lawsuits to Enforce TSCA CDR Violations

TSCA Section 20 also gives private citizens the authority to bring civil actions against companies in federal court for TSCA violations. TSCA allows private citizens to bring such suits so that a court can restrain the identified TSCA violations or compel EPA to enforce the law. Since 2021, NGOs have filed TSCA Section 20 actions against companies for alleged CDR violations and continue to do so with growing frequency. Two of the most recent lawsuits were filed earlier this fall by the NGO Center for Environmental Health (CEH). CEH alleged that certain chemical companies failed to report imported chemicals to EPA for the 2020 CDR reporting cycle.

The complaints in these cases detail how the NGOs identify potential violations by reviewing information on company imports and manufactured chemicals published in EPA’s CDR public database. NGOs have also asked the courts in these cases to 1) declare the companies violated TSCA, 2) order the companies to file corrected CDR reports with EPA, 3) restrain the companies from ongoing CDR violations, 4) order that the companies audit their manufacturing and import activities to identify other potential CDR violations, and 5) pay the NGO’s attorneys’ fees. Even when penalties are not imposed, responding to TSCA Section 20 claims can be costly and require the diversion of resources away from other business functions.

Companies should be aware of these types of civil actions because they can open the door to NGOs or other private citizens to pressure companies, as part of settlements, to agree to allow them to participate in company-led TSCA CDR (or broader) audits, which could potentially reveal additional TSCA violations.

What Companies Should Do

EPA administrative enforcement and citizen-filed lawsuits represent two significant legal risks for chemical manufacturers and importers subject to TSCA CDR rule requirements. Noncompliance can result in not only steep penalties but also business operational disruption. On the front end, manufacturers and importers should routinely review their own TSCA compliance programs and audit their own TSCA reporting compliance, which can also position companies to take advantage of EPA’s Audit Policy[1] where its conditions are met, potentially mitigating penalties for voluntarily disclosed noncompliance. Companies should also proactively prepare for the next CDR reporting cycle in 2028. Companies should also engage counsel early when responding to EPA inquiries or enforcement activity or notice of citizen lawsuits.

The recall covers Qin PLUS DM-i models manufactured between January 2021 and September 2023, according to a notice filed with the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).

The filing states that the problem stems from a “manufacturing consistency issue” in the power-battery packs.

This defect may lower the battery’s output and “potentially” cause the vehicle’s electric-drive mode to shut down in certain situations.

BYD plans to resolve the issue through over-the-air software updates to the affected vehicles’ diagnostic systems.

After the update, if an anomaly is detected in the battery, a warning will appear on the instrument panel instructing drivers to visit authorised service centres.

Under the recall programme, dealers will replace faulty battery packs at no cost to owners.

The action follows a defect probe opened by SAMR, which concluded that consistency problems in battery production could limit power output and, in rare cases, stop the cars from operating in pure electric mode.

The regulator’s move points to increased attention on the uniformity and quality of power-battery manufacturing among major electric vehicle producers in China.

This latest recall comes shortly after BYD initiated another large-scale action involving more than 115,000 vehicles in mid-October, including BYD Tang and BYD Yuan Pro models, over design flaws and battery-related safety concerns.

In September 2024, BYD also recalled close to 97,000 Dolphin and Yuan Plus electric cars due to a production defect in a steering control unit that created a fire hazard.

BYD reported a 12% year-on-year fall in global vehicle sales to 441,706 units in October, down from 502,657 units a year earlier, as the company continued to face sluggish demand for plug-in hybrid vehicles in its domestic market.

M-25-36 does break some new ground in its description of the “important, unique impacts” of deregulation—but that ground is littered with pitfalls.
One would hope that the Trump Administration would have learned that by now.","Last month, Jeffrey Clark, the Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, issued yet another memorandum (M-25-36) describing how the Trump Administration intends to “streamlin[e] the review of deregulatory actions.” If you’re experiencing déjà vu, you’re not alone: M-25-36 follows at least two executive orders, an April presidential memorandum, and two other “M” memos addressing the same subject. Clearly, the administration believes that individual agencies have failed to pursue deregulation with sufficient vigor, and so M-25-36 directs agencies to “redouble their efforts in this area.”

Like many of the administration’s other attempts to run roughshod over the APA’s requirements, however, the approaches that M-25-36 recommends suffer from significant legal vulnerabilities—and are unlikely to achieve the results that the administration wants. Two vulnerabilities merit particular attention. First, the memo reiterates a flawed theory of the APA’s good cause exception that would allow agencies to sidestep notice and comment whenever they believe that a previous rule was unlawful. And second, the memo encourages agencies to consider certain so-called deregulatory “benefits” that will often be insufficient to justify deregulation.

The Administration’s Flimsy Good Cause Theory

M-25-36’s primary focus is to encourage agencies to “fully maximiz[e] their energy” in repealing “facially unlawful regulations ‘without notice and comment’ under the Administrative Procedure Act’s ‘good cause’ exception.” The memo largely reiterates the theory espoused in the April presidential memorandum: that providing notice and comment before rescinding regulations that the administration believes are facially unlawful would be “superfluous” (and therefore “unnecessary”) and serve no purpose other than delay (which would be “contrary to the public interest”). This time, it cites as support two inapposite, decades-old circuit cases recognizing that agencies may invoke the good cause exception where a “stringent” or “tight” congressionally imposed deadline has left insufficient time for notice and comment.

The theory espoused in M-25-36 and the April presidential memorandum might expose an agency to at least three distinct legal challenges, as we at Governing for Impact have repeatedly explained. First, to the extent the agency relies upon an erroneous or overbroad interpretation of Supreme Court precedent as justification for rescission, its action may be set aside; “[a]n order may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law.” Second, even if an existing rule is unlawful in some respects, an agency’s decision to rescind it immediately and in full may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency failed to consider reliance interests or available alternatives to rescission. And third, neither the APA’s plain text, case law interpreting it, nor the Attorney General’s interpretation of the law when it was enacted supports the administration’s good cause theory. To the contrary, the D.C. Circuit has squarely rejected the argument that “notice and comment requirements do not apply to ‘defectively promulgated regulations.’”

But don’t take our word for it. Just a month before OIRA issued M-25-36, Judge Reed O’Connor of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas declined to excuse an agency’s failure to comply with notice-and-comment requirements even though the agency asserted that its regulation was compelled by the statutory text. In his words, the agency “ask[ed] the Court to find that an agency need not comply with the APA’s stringent requirements, as long as the agency’s interpretation of a statute is the best reading.” But the agency did not “cite to a single case” endorsing that proposition, and “the Court c[ould not] find any in which a court considered this argument[,] much less made such a holding.” He therefore “decline[d] to be the first.” By the same token, an agency cannot skip notice and comment simply because it believes that a rule is inconsistent with a statute’s best reading, or with some other legal requirement.

The flimsiness of the Trump Administration’s good cause theory is perhaps why agencies appear to have been reticent to invoke it at scale. But if they have a change of heart, parties who will be harmed by the administration’s deregulatory efforts should not be afraid to hold them accountable.

Flawed Benefit-Cost Analysis

To the extent an agency chooses to make a policy case for rescinding a given rule, which M-25-36 acknowledges would “typically” require the agency to “afford notice and an opportunity to comment,” the memo offers a distorted account of the benefits and costs that the agency should consider. Among other things, the memo omits any discussion of the benefits of regulation, or of the reliance interests that may be jeopardized by rescinding regulations that have been on the books for years or even decades. An agency that fails to consider these “important aspect[s] of the problem” practically invites a finding that its action is arbitrary and capricious.

M-25-36 does break some new ground in its description of the “important, unique impacts” of deregulation—but that ground is littered with pitfalls. There are a few worth emphasizing, in addition to those identified by others in this forum.

First, the memo emphasizes what it describes as “private-conduct liberty benefits,” which it admits can generally “only be assessed qualitatively.” But by directing an agency to regulate in the first place, Congress has necessarily accepted that certain tangible benefits, like environmental protection or safeguards against predatory businesses, are worth the cost of imposing some restrictions on liberty. And if qualitative liberty impacts merit consideration, then so do other qualitative impacts, including interests like dignity, equity, and fairness. It will be difficult for agencies to justify excluding these considerations on the grounds that they are unquantifiable or otherwise irrelevant if they have already predicated a rulemaking on similarly intangible benefits. After all, an agency’s reasoning “cannot be internally inconsistent.”

Second, the memo describes the “aggregated impacts” of deregulation, meaning the downstream effects of deregulation on other aspects of the national economy. Those impacts, however, may well be difficult to discern or measure. To use the memo’s example of the sort of reasoning it envisions, how will agencies identify the remote and attenuated benefits of “deregulating the energy sector” on “increasing AI innovation and improving the development of new cryptocurrency assets,” as well as how those benefits are likely to “further profit consumers in a virtuous cycle”? The APA does not permit agency actions that are “based on speculation,” or on “a factual premise that is unsupported by substantial evidence.”

Third, the memo notes that “[r]egulations are almost always implemented under uncertain conditions,” and that new evidence may demonstrate that “the predictions of costs and benefits it made when it once stood at the door … have not been borne out by experience.” That may be the case, but the APA requires an agency to provide a “more detailed justification” when its decision rests on “factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy.” An agency will need to contend with the evidence or factual findings it cited in promulgating the rule it now wishes to rescind, rather than simply stating that its assessment has changed.

Finally, the memo attempts to analogize deregulation to the codification of a non-enforcement policy, suggesting that deregulatory action should be subject to a more “deferential” standard of review. In that respect, the memo echoes a theory advanced by the former general counsel for the U.S. DOGE Service that “[a] lower standard of judicial review should apply” when an agency rescinds regulatory requirements. But State Farm itself applied the arbitrary-and-capricious standard to deregulatory action, and there is nothing in the APA’s text or precedent to indicate that a different standard should apply outside the motor vehicle safety context. The memo also suggests that a regulation may have been unnecessary if enforcement history shows “few (if any) violations,” but that reasoning is, to use the late Justice Ginsburg’s description, “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”

Conclusion

There’s no “one weird trick” to rush deregulation. One would hope that the Trump Administration would have learned that by now. Perhaps the next deregulatory gambit will involve the use of artificial intelligence to accelerate the notice-and-comment process, an approach that may also encounter serious legal and practical difficulties. But rather than concocting increasingly elaborate theories of how to sidestep regulatory requirements, the administration might be better served by simply buckling down and doing the work.

Policymakers should amend the Carbon Plan law to make carbon neutrality a goal instead of a mandate.
The most important thing for power provision in North Carolina is meeting consumers’ need for reliable and least-cost electricity.","North Carolina energy policy saw big changes in 2025. Many are good for upholding reliability while avoiding unnecessary costs. Others, however, give some cause for concern.

North Carolina is now three years into a Carbon Plan law that seeks to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation in the state by 2050. When the year opened, it included an interim goal of 70% reduction in CO2 emissions (from 2005 levels) by 2030. Incidentally, without a Carbon Plan, state emissions had fallen by more than half by 2023.

Developments concerning intermittent, unreliable generation

President Joe Biden had made “aggressive action” for offshore wind his Day-One priority. His signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), contained open-ended grants and tax credits “on the order of trillions of dollars” for renewable energy sources, while his administration hamstrung natural gas.

President Donald Trump, however, made it a Day-One priority to halt new offshore wind projects and review existing wind projects. His signature legislation, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” limited IRA tax credit eligibility for wind and solar facilities.

Conducted for Duke Energy, an independent evaluation of the state’s three offshore wind energy areas found they all compared unfavorably against a reference price based on solar plus batteries. So, Duke announced that it will not be pursuing offshore wind energy generation here.

In March, a meeting of the state Senate Committee on Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment revealed that the Carbon Plan’s interim goal was having an exaggerated effect on resource modeling by the North Carolina Utility Commission (NCUC). Legislators learned that removing the interim goal would save electricity consumers $13 billion by 2050.

Developments concerning reliable, thermal generation

In July, the General Assembly enacted Senate Bill (SB) 266 over Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, eliminating the Carbon Plan’s interim goal. It also expanded state law allowing utilities to charge ratepayers for construction work in progress while adding key guardrails on its use.

When a summer heat wave threatened to overload the grid, Duke Energy Carolinas obtained an emergency order from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to exceed environmental emissions levels if needed to maintain power provision. With nuclear already at peak production, Duke was able to avoid blackouts primarily by increasing coal generation by 30%, showing its importance to reliability.

In October, Duke filed an updated resource plan proposal with the NCUC as required by the Carbon Plan law. This filing reflected the developments described above. Compared with the previous plan, the new plan would double the planned amount of new natural gas combined-cycle capacity, increase new natural gas combustion-turbine capacity by well over a third, and up new nuclear capacity by about 40%. It would also increase new solar capacity by only about 3%, boost new battery storage by about 58%, and eliminate new wind resources (onshore and off). Finally, Duke would delay retirement of some coal capacity.

The plan represented a significant boost in reliable, thermal generation over the previous plan, a result anticipated by SB 266.

Caution ahead

In July, the DOE published a Resource Adequacy Report warning the nation of high blackout risks by 2030 from closing reliable power plants and replacing them insufficiently (mostly with intermittent renewables). The DOE report estimated the blackout risk in North Carolina to be 27 times worse by 2030 under the planned status quo. Unfortunately, the main changes in Duke’s latest resource plan would take place after 2030, not before.

The sort of problem the DOE report warned of occurred in Spain in April. Days after achieving the “first weekday of 100% renewable power,” the Spanish grid unexpectedly collapsed, causing billions of euros in economic losses. The culprit? Spain’s overreliance on renewables, especially solar generation, leaving very little inertia on the system from the heavy, spinning traditional generators that would allow it to withstand a sudden disturbance.

The Carbon Plan law placed North Carolina on that path. Even though SB 266 forestalls the problem, it still requires “carbon neutrality” by 2050. The new Duke proposal doesn’t add much more new solar than the previous one, but it plans for solar capacity nearly to quadruple. Comparably, it would increase nuclear and natural gas capacity by just 59%. Duke’s filing shows that new solar capacity would be only half as productive as new natural gas capacity and only about a fourth as productive as new nuclear capacity.

Policymakers should amend the Carbon Plan law to make carbon neutrality a goal instead of a mandate. The most important thing for power provision in North Carolina is meeting consumers’ need for reliable and least-cost electricity. Allowing Duke to showcase more natural gas and nuclear capacity in future resource plans would serve North Carolinians’ interests significantly better.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC_4231-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:00.758381

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry.
It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.
""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""
Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.","A controversial plan to store CO2 deep under Lake Maurepas was intended to greatly limit greenhouse gas emissions from a nearby industrial plant, but a new proposal raises the possibility that significantly less will be sequestered.

The company's revised proposal to state regulators has the potential to allow the hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish to become one of the largest industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in Louisiana during its first years of operation.

Air Products, the company behind the project, has battled nearly four years of community opposition over plans to inject and permanently store CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the complex under Lake Maurepas. It says the injection would prevent 95% of those greenhouse gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they would otherwise add to climate change.

But, just months after receiving the state's blessing for air emissions based on that low-carbon vision, Air Products has asked for a do-over.

The proposed change could allow the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to become among the top 25 industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in the state, based on LSU and federal annual emissions tallies since 2012.

The company says the new proposal would merely give the plant the flexibility it needs to operate, adding that its carbon capture goals remain the same.

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry. Louisiana has paused new permit applications in the face of residents' opposition and criticism has grown louder over lucrative federal tax credits for the projects.

Some environmental groups, which have opposed carbon capture projects because they claim they won't live up to the storage rates being promised, speculated the air permit changes indicate the company is trying to hedge its bets.

The company has already delayed the complex's startup by two years to 2028 or 2029 for financial reasons, according to a report from RBN Energy, an industry consulting and analytics firm.

Air Products has said it is trying to ""derisk"" the $4.5 billion complex by finding buyers for its low-carbon products before new spending commitments. It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.

""It's all about making it a more valuable property for them to sell off,"" said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a senior organizer for the Sierra Club's environmental justice program in Louisiana.

Storage three-quarters of the time

In the new permit request filed in late September, Air Products wants permission to emit up to 2.16 million tons of greenhouse gases per year along with increases in some toxic chemicals. The maximum estimate is nearly half of the total that Air Products had planned to inject under Lake Maurepas annually, or more than 5.5 million tons per year.

Depending on the year, the projected maximum greenhouse gas emissions in the air would be on par with the ExxonMobil refinery and chemical complex power plant in Baton Rouge, Entergy's power plant in St. Charles Parish, and Dow Chemical in Plaquemine, the LSU and federal emissions tallies show.

Air Products told the state Department of Environmental Quality that when the company is commissioning the plant, it won't be able to inject CO2 underground for up to 25% of the time and that this inability could last in the first few years. For the other 75% of the time, the company says it will be able to inject under Lake Maurepas, as promised.

In a statement, an Air Products spokeswoman said the permit alterations don't reflect a change in the complex's design. It's an effort to create ""additional operational flexibility for the facility, ensuring a more reliable supply of low-carbon ammonia and low-carbon hydrogen products,"" even in the event ""the offsite carbon capture operation is unavailable.""

""The 25 percent would be the maximum downtime allowed under the new permit for the carbon sequestration operation,"" said Christina Stephens, the company spokeswoman. ""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""

She added the changes would ""also account for the possibility that various aspects of the facility may start up on slightly different schedules.""

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, said he could not comment directly on Air Products, but said such companies often see economic value in ensuring options remain available.

""These large capital investments are made spanning decades, and so because there's uncertainty over lots of factors, companies think of what's called a 'real option.' And a 'real option' is simply the following: I'm going to build into my capital plans the ability to do things in the future, even if I might or might not exercise that option,"" he said.

Air Products juggles options

Despite industry enthusiasm for carbon capture and scientific backing of its safety, the concept has faced resistance from landowners, residents and local leaders.

For Air Products' plans, a mix of environmentalists, Lake Maurepas fishermen and crabbers, residents, legislators and some parish council members have opposed the project for safety, aesthetic and environmental reasons. Those include the visual impact of platforms and well sites on the lake's surface, lake-bottom dredging, wetlands destruction and what they see as groundwater threats.

The company and industry advocates say they are the victims of misinformation, defending carbon capture as safe and effective, with minimal disruption to Lake Maurepas and no real threat to drinking water sources because of the depth of the wells.

In a recent hearing for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state coastal permits, local legislators called for an extensive environmental analysis that would include not only Air Products' plans but also the cumulative impact of other carbon capture projects in the region. The work could take two years.

These officials also pointed to recent Southeastern Louisiana University research showing that lake waters have heavy metal contamination that's likely also in lake sediments. They said that could be stirred up by dredging for the underwater pipeline network.

On land, the lines would also destroy a few hundred acres of high-value cypress and tupelo swamps in the Maurepas Wildlife Management Area.

The company says it has taken steps to minimize the impact of the well and pipeline network through the use of the same right of way for multiple lines and with a curtain to limit the spread of dredged sediments.

Gov. Jeff Landry has also instituted a temporary moratorium on new underground carbon injection permit applications to prioritize a review of existing applications. Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.

Earthjustice senior attorney Lauren Godshall noted that Air Products is having to ""passionately defend the project"" amid these headwinds, while also looking to sell off pieces of the complex. She added that ""it feels like cheating, in a way, to promise blue/clean energy"" and then pursue an air permit that would allow options for so much CO2 emission.

In a Nov. 6 earnings call, Air Products CEO Eduardo Menezes said a permit with the ability to emit CO2 is a key to negotiations to find partners for the carbon capture and ammonia pieces of the complex.

The company's ""potential counterparts asked us to have the flexibility of running the plant on a gray mode if something happens with the CO2 sequestration that we did not expect to do or still do not expect to do because the CO2 is a big contributor for the project,"" Menezes said.

""Gray mode"" means emitting waste carbon dioxide into the air.

Public storage on the block too?

In a October 2021 deal with the state, Air Products gained exclusive rights to nearly 122,500 acres of underground storage beneath Lake Maurepas, the nearby Maurepas Swamp Wildlife Management Area in St. James Parish and Lake Sabine in Cameron Parish.

Patrick Courreges, a spokesman for the state Department of Conservation and Energy, said no company has approached the department or the Mineral Board about such a transfer. A key concern for the state will be who pays what's owed under the deal and who will be responsible if a problem occurs.

""Such transfers have been relatively routine for decades,"" he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/2b/42baac65-830a-50ad-82ae-952fefb515f7/691ca9d701a1e.image.jpg?crop=1143%2C601%2C0%2C79,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:30.454458

The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future Despite the report’s warnings, regional leaders say Lithium Valley’s promise is real and achievable if the right choices are made early.
CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo said the path forward must be guided by the people who call Imperial County home.","BRAWLEY — The future of Lithium Valley could either lift Imperial County into a new era of prosperity or repeat decades of broken promises, according to a sweeping new 129-page workforce analysis released this week by Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) and the University of California San Diego Labor Center.

Imperial County, home to the highest poverty and unemployment rates in California, sits atop one of North America’s largest lithium brine deposits. With global demand for domestically sourced lithium surging, researchers argue that the region is standing at a defining crossroads: embrace “high-road development” that delivers family-supporting wages, safe working conditions, and real career pathways for local residents, or slide into “low-road development” dominated by external interests, low wages, and minimal community benefit.

The report frames Lithium Valley as a once-in-a-generation chance to reverse historic economic inequities. Despite a young and growing bilingual workforce, most Imperial County residents lack access to the kind of education, transportation, childcare, and job information systems necessary to compete for high-quality careers in the clean-energy sector. Many interviewees, 214 adults surveyed across the county, reported deep skepticism, citing decades of outside industries bypassing local workers in favor of non-local hires.

Researchers emphasize that the stakes are unusually high for Imperial County because the region is projected to experience a rare workforce boom over the next several decades, even as the working-age population across the rest of California declines. According to demographic modeling included in the report, thousands of young residents will be entering the labor market just as lithium extraction, geothermal power expansion, and battery manufacturing could scale up. This convergence of workforce growth and industrial investment presents an opening that many rural counties lack, making the timing of policy choices especially urgent.

At the same time, the report points out that Imperial County’s current industrial structure remains heavily concentrated in low-wage, high-risk sectors such as agriculture, retail, fast food, and personal care. These jobs, while essential to the region’s economy, do not provide the family-supporting wages or long-term career ladders needed to stabilize households. By contrast, the projected occupations tied to Lithium Valley — particularly in battery manufacturing — offer substantially higher median wages and far more stability. The question, researchers note, is whether local workers will have the training and support systems necessary to actually access these roles when they arrive.

At the same time, researchers emphasize the scale of potential opportunity. Depending on how fully the lithium battery supply chain takes root in the region, Lithium Valley could create anywhere from several hundred to more than 4,000 high-road jobs, most of them in manufacturing rather than extraction. Battery production presents the largest economic boost — but also demands the most significant expansion of local training capacity, apprenticeship programs, and industry-education partnerships.

To meet future workforce needs, CCV and UCSD highlight the urgency of building a coordinated training ecosystem. Nearly 75 to 85 percent of the projected high-road occupations require apprenticeships or specialized certificates, yet Imperial County’s existing workforce system is too small to meet that level of demand. Without long-term collaborations among employers, unions, community groups, and training providers, the county risks watching high-wage jobs pass local residents by.

A Region Positioned for Opportunity, But Only If Barriers Are Removed

The report stresses that the county’s demographic strengths — its young workforce, bilingual population, and steady supply of upcoming high school graduates — position Imperial County to play a central role in California’s clean-energy future. But deep structural barriers continue to limit access to high-road employment.

Interviewees described consistent challenges with finding job-relevant training close to home, securing adequate English-language instruction, accessing reliable transportation, and affording childcare. Many also voiced longstanding mistrust toward incoming industries after years of low-wage, unstable work that historically favored non-local workers.

These obstacles, researchers argue, are systemic, not personal, and must be addressed through policy changes, investments, and enforceable commitments from companies entering the region.

High-Road vs. Low-Road Development: A Clear Fork in the Road

According to the report, Imperial County’s future hinges on which development path regional partners choose.

High-road development centers on accessible career pathways, family-supporting wages, and meaningful worker voice. Low-road development, by contrast, mirrors global patterns of exploitation, in which companies extract resources while providing minimal benefits to workers or the surrounding communities. Examples in lithium mining regions abroad and at domestic battery plants illustrate what happens when industries prioritize cost-cutting over community benefit.

The authors lay out a comprehensive strategy to ensure the lithium boom benefits Imperial County residents.

They call for expanding training and apprenticeships, improving transportation between cities and the geothermal resource area, and increasing childcare access so workers with caregiving responsibilities can enter and stay in the workforce. They also stress the importance of establishing Community Benefits Agreements to enforce transparency in local hiring and to guarantee that residents participate fully in lithium-related careers.

Finally, they argue that employers, training providers, unions, and community organizations must form long-term partnerships capable of sustaining these commitments through decades of economic growth and industry change.

The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future

These efforts will reduce America’s dependence on foreign sources, strengthen national security, and promote American energy independence.

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign nations for the minerals and materials that power our economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “We have these resources here at home, but years of complacency ceded America’s mining and industrial base to other nations. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing that trend, rebuilding America’s ability to mine, process, and manufacture the materials essential to our energy and economic security.”

This funding opportunity stems from DOE’s Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation’s Rare Earth Demonstration Facility program, which is designed to demonstrate full-scale integrated rare earth extraction and separation facilities within the United States. This NOFO follows the Department’s Notice of Intent released in August.

REEs, such as Praseodymium, Neodymium, Terbium and Dysprosium, are vital components in advanced manufacturing, defense systems, and high-performance magnets used in power generation and electric motors. By investing in domestic REE recovery and processing, DOE is working to secure America’s energy independence, strengthen economic competitiveness, and ensure long-term resilience in the nation’s supply chains.

An injunction, they said, would prevent EPA from “holding hostage certain reimbursements — which EPA has already committed to paying — unless Plaintiffs close out their grants and risk the government arguing their claims are moot.”","EPA is pressing grant recipients of a Biden-era environmental justice program to take steps that would make the termination of their awards irrevocable — even as some of them are suing the agency to recover the funds.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration told all 105 recipients of the Community Change Grant Program that their grants had been canceled because it was a “diversity, equity and inclusion” measure that contradicted the priorities of President Donald Trump.

The program, one of several environmental justice initiatives enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, offered $1.6 billion in grants to help communities cope with risks related to pollution and climate change.

Other IRA programs, such as the $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants and clean energy initiatives like Solar for All, were also canceled over the course of the year. A slew of challenges filed by nonprofits and state and local governments are now winding their way through the courts.

Now EPA has told recipients of Community Change grants that they missed a deadline to formally “close out” their awards and are directing them to do so expeditiously.

“These emails went out to everybody, [saying] that we are already delayed on the closing and that we need to proceed with it as soon as possible. Kind of ignoring the fact that you can’t be late on closing if you are not planning to close,” said Dominika Parry, founding president and CEO of 2C Mississippi, a Jackson nonprofit that received a grant amounting to nearly $20 million last year to offer emergency services, which is challenging the termination.

EPA did not respond to questions. “In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” a spokesperson said in an email.

Closing out a grant would require the awardee to provide EPA with a final financial statement and program reports. That would entitle them to be reimbursed for costs that were incurred before EPA canceled their awards, and for the cost of some closeout activities after that, as long as EPA agrees to it.

But grantees who take those steps would also forfeit their right to challenge the termination in court, or to reopen their programs if challenges by other awardees were ultimately successful.

Parry said her group got the email pushing it to close out the grant soon after the government shutdown ended on Nov. 12. Other grantees received the notice at different times.

“EPA seems to be renewing its request that our clients close out their grants,” said Ben Grillot, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is representing some Community Change Grant Program clients challenging EPA’s cancellations.

Those groups are planning to tell EPA that the deadline doesn’t apply to them because their cancellations are still being litigated.

“Whenever they send us anything, we are saying, ‘No, we are not going to be doing it. We are suing you,’” said Parry.

Grantees were dealt a blow in August when a district court judge sided with EPA in deciding that it had the right to cancel environmental justice grants. The decision means the cases would be heard in federal claims court, a special tribunal that could provide monetary damages to grantees but not restore their grants. Many Community Change Grant Program awardees are appealing that decision, and their attorneys expect a hearing sometime next year.

Recipients who don’t plan to challenge the agency’s grant terminations say EPA is not cooperating with them. They expected to be able to access the government’s grant management portal to file for reimbursement of expenses they incurred during the program. But that isn’t happening.

Keith Matsumoto, program manager for Pacific International Center for High Technology Research, which received $13.8 million to help underserved parts of Oahu, Hawaii, build resilience to wildfires and hurricanes, said he was weighing whether to join the legal challenge.

“We may just close it out, only because we can’t keep paying the kind of attention to this project that we have been,” he said.

But Matsumoto said he’s had trouble accessing funds from the grant to cover expenditures that EPA indicated would be eligible. EPA’s termination letters stated that grantees would be able to seek repayment through a federal portal known as ASAP for “allowable costs incurred up to the date of this memo provided that such costs were contained in the approved workplan.”

“I basically said, ‘Hey, you know, we haven’t gotten paid. You want us to close out? You guys got to pay us.’ And the response was, ‘Well, all the money is gone, so you’re going to have to close out and then we’ll pay you,” he said.

Matsumoto said his organization has only six employees, and the tiny partners it works with couldn’t absorb a loss of tens of thousands of dollars while litigation winds its way through the courts. So, his group paid its partners out of its own coffers.

“So again, it’s a ‘You pay us back, and then we’ll move on,’ kind of thing,” he said. “But they can’t even pay us back. Why should we move on? And the fact that it’s an illegal termination. I would prefer to have to have this whole thing restored, because our partners are hurting.”

Attorneys representing grant recipients who are challenging EPA’s terminations filed a brief in federal court last week arguing that the agency appeared to be withholding close-out funds in order to gain leverage over grantees.

They asked the court to issue an injunction until the grantees’ appeal is decided. An injunction, they said, would prevent EPA from “holding hostage certain reimbursements — which EPA has already committed to paying — unless Plaintiffs close out their grants and risk the government arguing their claims are moot.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/15/bc/3f1846664a9d867d74c8ffdf87fa/hawaii-wildfire-72441.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:03:39.945756

But according to some investors, it’s also a symptom of a sector maturing out of its exuberant teenage years, and learning to pivot and compromise.
Tariq Nanji, a climate investing partner at Boston Consulting Group, describes this shift as moving past the early “climate euphoria” to focus on longer-term market developments over trends.
The co-existence of both thriving and structurally challenged subsectors within the same climate investment category rewards investors with the ability and willingness to pivot.
“A lot of investors look at venture capital as being really hard in the climate sector,” he said.","It’s been a confusing year for those investing in the energy transition.

On the one hand, the policy shifts that followed President Donald Trump’s election have limited growth in the sector — especially in the wake of cuts to Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. Investments in clean manufacturing have been slowing, venture capital funding for climate tech is at its lowest level in years, and investor sentiment has weakened. Just 23% of North American investors now describe climate change as significant to their investment strategy, down from 61% in 2023 and 35% last year, according to a Robeco survey released this summer.

On the other, though, major climate- and energy transition-focused funds have held prominent closes. Brookfield and Blackstone each raised $20 billion and $5.6 billion for their latest transition vehicles, respectively. The artificial intelligence boom — and the resulting load growth — have flooded certain parts of the sector with money, especially in the U.S. And globally, clean energy stocks have been doing particularly well.

The turbulence, for many in the sector, is uncomfortable. But according to some investors, it’s also a symptom of a sector maturing out of its exuberant teenage years, and learning to pivot and compromise. Tariq Nanji, a climate investing partner at Boston Consulting Group, describes this shift as moving past the early “climate euphoria” to focus on longer-term market developments over trends. “This is no longer thought of as a niche momentum play, but a structural demand tailwind that is underwritable,” Nanji told Latitude Media.

‘Shock to the system’

This shift, perhaps inevitably, is coming with growing pains.

According to Matthew Nordan, co-founder of climate investor Azolla Ventures, some clean energy subsectors that were heavily reliant on policy and subsidies support, like alternative fuels and direct air capture, and others subject to the administration’s overt hostility, like pure play wind, “are clearly in danger.”

“The bigger backlash we’re going to see is against things that have any major measure of regulatory or policy dependence,” Nordan said. Recent data by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, for instance, found that industrial decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen, clean fuels, and green cement have been undermined by project cancellations and the termination of hundreds of DOE federal awards.

“It’s a lesson that the finance community — all the way up to the alpha predators of finance and the LPs at the top of the pyramid — relearns every ten to 20 years,” Nordan added. “They get seduced when there is a seemingly unstoppable head of steam around a theme, and then they kick themselves.”

The backlash and uncertainty created by the policy changes, which Nanji describes as a “shock to the system,” is creating some frustration among the investors who have raised money under a friendlier climate environment, and are now being forced to reconsider their strategies.

“Investors who deploy capital in sectors that were heavily linked to many of the policies that were in place via the IRA are now trying to figure out how to safe harbor assets and how to get things moving in the next two years, and get stuff out the door in a way that doesn’t hurt them in the long run,” Nanji said. (In the short term, at least, those efforts have mostly succeeded. A recent report found that 76% of solar projects and 86% of wind projects slated to come online by the end of 2028, accounting for 33 gigawatts of capacity eligible for tax credits, were already safe-harbored as of November.)

The frustration is especially being felt by impact investors who have made their LPs promises that the policy reshuffle is now making difficult to fulfill.

“What do you do if you’re a growth stage investor with a thematic and a private placement memorandum, and one of the things you said you were going to invest in is hydrogen or the transition in fuels?” Nordan said. “That’s a little tough… They might throw their hands up and say, ‘What to do now?’”

The pivot

For investors with dry powder, however, there are still many opportunities to invest.

As Sophie Purdom, founder of VC fund Planeteer Capital and co-founder of market intelligence platform Sightline Climate, put it, there are headwinds pushing investors away from green-premium assets, but there are also new tailwinds. “The climate tech space is lucky that demand growth showed up at a time when demand for green-premium assets fell off,” she said.

The unanticipated AI-related load growth has come with an urgent need for more generation and supporting energy infrastructure — as well as new investors with deep pockets and a willingness to spend. One recent projection found that U.S. peak load growth is now estimated at 166 GW over the next five years, quadruple what was expected just two years ago.

And as a result, sectors providing baseload power, like nuclear and geothermal, — and, to some extent, energy storage — are now Trump administration priorities. That offers an in for investors.

“Renewables may be structurally challenged right now,” Naji added. “But there is a massive opportunity for private capital sponsors to look at the connective tissue that makes the clean economy work.”

This also includes the adaptation and resilience space, which is becoming an increasingly important part of the climate investment landscape, and a crucial area for capital deployment.

The co-existence of both thriving and structurally challenged subsectors within the same climate investment category rewards investors with the ability and willingness to pivot. “Those with broader mandates are rewarded in an environment like this,” Nordan said. “But then comes a question of whether you have the skillset and network to invest in things that are a little different.”

Additionally, investors willing to accept some risk and wait longer for returns might find the market particularly appealing. According to Nanji, if you “have a 10-year view on the market, not a three-year view on the market, maybe you can buy low, and sell high in 10 years.”

Sanjeev Krishnan, managing partner at climate-focused investor S2G, agrees. “A lot of investors look at venture capital as being really hard in the climate sector,” he said. “But if you have long-duration capital and different internal rate of return expectations, you can accrete ownership when others are fearful and finance businesses to become cash flow positive. Then you can do really well.”

Few companies made it through the first internet boom of the early 2000s, but the ones that did — Amazon, Google, and PayPal, to name a few — went on to perform extraordinarily well, he added.

Long term view

This need to pivot reflects the general broadening of what it means to invest in climate and the energy transition. Some “investors are convincing themselves that the opportunity is shifting outside of the core thesis… [of] decarbonization,” Purdom noted.

Superficially, this can mean companies skirting around climate or green language in their branding to appease those who perceive the rhetoric as politically risky — without necessarily changing their strategy. Nordan, for example, knows of at least one company that was asked to drop some climate-friendly language from its name while renewing a federal contract.

But the shift may also signal a real change in perception. Climate investment is increasingly not a specific set of sectors dedicated to the mitigation of the consequences of climate change, but rather a much broader category encompassing the energy, infrastructure, and adaptation solutions needed for society to advance and thrive.

“Our view is that the climate transition is a 10,000 year economic megatrend,” Krishnan said. “It’s taking useful energy and turning it into useful materials — we did it with fire, photosynthesis, fossil fuels, and then whatever comes next. It’s an all-of-the-above approach to whatever comes next, given the current political reality and the current economic reality.”

As we’re already witnessing, this uncertain and at times frustrating evolution is likely going to result in less capital allocated to the U.S. climate sector, at least in the short term.

“We’re going to lose two-thirds of the firms, we’re going to have massive turnover in the LP base, and at least half of the startups are going to disappear from operations in the next two or three years,” Nordan said, adding that it’s a healthy outcome, given that the field had gotten overgrown with “me-too propositions” too dependent on tax credit and the green premium. One example: This fall, Danish manufacturer Topsoe decided to pause work on its $400 million electrolyzer factory in Virginia, partly as a consequence of the sunsetting of a federal tax credit that promised to jumpstart the green hydrogen sector.

But this short-term pessimism may give way to a rosier long-term outlook.

“In areas that are administration priorities, like clean firm power or critical materials, we’re going to have a bunch of billion-dollar companies with long-term contracted offtake… that will mint a new generation of public market leaders and will create the track record for the next cycle of this field,” Nordan said. “Long term, man, this is a good thing.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-01T123029.366.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:03:13.119810

Fortunately, states like Texas and Florida have rejected that approach and have opted for technology-agnostic automated permitting laws instead.

Leila Banijamali is the CEO of permitting software company Symbium and Zachary Millimet is a senior policy advisor to the company.

With federal climate incentives and renewable energy programs facing unprecedented rollbacks, state legislatures have become the last line of defense for clean energy deployment. Surging load growth and the cost of electricity is rising faster than the rate of inflation, and state policy must be laser focused on reducing barriers to deployment and driving down permitting costs.

Right now, several states are considering automated permitting bills that could either accelerate the clean energy transition or lock in years of bureaucratic gridlock and stifled innovation. These bills need to pass, but only if they’re designed correctly. The difference between success and failure hinges on a single critical design choice: whether states mandate specific technology platforms or establish technology-agnostic standards that foster competition and innovation.

The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the lessons from past mistakes are unambiguous. Consider this cautionary tale: California’s SB379 governing residential solar energy system permitting was signed into law in September 2022. The landmark law requires jurisdictions to adopt a permitting platform that accelerates the approvals of certain residential solar permits.

But rather than codifying transparent, objective standards, SB379 mandated the use of a rather limited privately run program called SolarAPP+ or any alternative platform that is capable of issuing permits for certain solar and energy storage systems “that SolarAPP+ is capable of processing,” effectively blessing one solution. This would be equivalent to the government requiring consumers to purchase a particular brand of electric vehicle, EV1, or another car that is defined by EV1’s obscure feature set. By obscuring choice, we stifle innovation and limit the ability of these programs to scale in a meaningful way.

At the time SB379 was passed into law, SolarAPP+ was inapplicable for use in about 60% of all residential solar projects in California. Consequently, it has failed to gain traction in many jurisdictions, with building departments struggling to make it work. What’s worse, this legislation set a precedent for enshrining one technology that was repeated in other states like Maryland, Minnesota, Illinois and New Jersey. Fortunately, states like Texas and Florida have rejected that approach and have opted for technology-agnostic automated permitting laws instead.

The urgent need for technology-neutral state action

In an era marked by the dismantling of federal clean energy incentives and programs, state-level policy has become the critical battlefield for climate progress. Without federal action to streamline permitting or support renewable deployment, states must move quickly — and smartly — to advance automated permitting legislation that can accelerate the clean energy transition. The urgency is unprecedented, and the window for effective state intervention is small.

The imperative is clear: States need to pass technology-agnostic automated permitting bills immediately. Unlike California and Maryland’s approach of mandating specific platforms like SolarAPP+, the new generation of legislation must establish clear, objective standards that any qualified technology provider or building department can meet. This approach doesn’t just avoid picking winners; it creates the competitive environment necessary for rapid innovation and cost reduction at precisely the moment when federal support has evaporated.

So, what can we learn from legislators in Texas and Florida? Rather than bless a specific solution enshrined in state legislation, it is abundantly clear that, if we are to spur innovation and market competition in the absence of federal leadership, states should establish clear goals (i.e., instant permitting) and disclose a circumscribed set of the codes and standards that must be processed to inject more competition into the development and deployment of instant permitting solutions that are directly responsive to the nuanced needs of local jurisdictions and large- or small-scale installers. The goals are to foster innovation, lower costs and produce superior outcomes for governments and the public alike, not to enshrine one player’s set of features.

The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated. With federal programs in retreat, state legislatures have a narrow window to establish the regulatory infrastructure that will either enable or constrain clean energy deployment for the next decade. Technology-agnostic automated permitting bills represent one of the most impactful policy levers available to states right now — streamlining the process for solar, storage, heat pumps, EV chargers and other electrification technologies without the massive price tag of direct subsidies.

The choice is clear: We can either deploy systems that are revolutionizing the permitting experience and serving the public interest through open competition and innovation, or we can hand over the resolution of critical government functions and regulatory bottlenecks — effectively, the hardest problems to solve — to favored private actors. The latter stifles progress, inflates costs and erodes the essential trust between private entities and local governments that real progress demands. The next generation of clean energy and housing development depends on getting this right, and there are precious few opportunities to fix a rigged system once it’s locked in place.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JDmLgpHppJdMWE2ZQ7AGjXjICiGYgMO5FqkObCuskEs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9yb29mdG9wX3NvbGFyX0NhbGlmb3JuaWEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:31.634146

Since 2020, the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in the US has soared from $0.133 to $0.188, a 30% increase in just the past 5 years. In the next few years, many experts fear that the United States will face an electricity crisis (although one can argue it’s already in the early stages of one).

Image Source: FRED

Below are four factors driving higher energy prices:

· An Aging Electrical Grid: The US’s electrical grid is aging. With an already massive fiscal deficit, major grid upgrades are unlikely any time soon. Grid issues have become more prevalent recently and are likely to persist.

· Extreme Weather Events: Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events over the past few years. For instance, a 2021 Texas winter storm left 2 million Texans without electricity.

· Persistent Inflation: Although the inflation rate has slowed since its 2022 peak, inflation is still driving up the costs of the equipment and materials needed to generate electricity.

· EVs & the AI Buildout: As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, the need for charging infrastructure is also increasing. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence buildout is the most significant driver of higher electricity prices. Currently, data centers comprise ~5% of total electricity use in the United States. However, McKinsey & Company expects that data center electricity use will triple by 2030, accounting for 11.7% of total consumption.

Is Nuclear the Solution to the US Electricity Crisis?

Chris Wright, the US Secretary of Energy, had a nuclear energy background prior to joining the Trump Administration, having previously served on the board of directors of Oklo (OKLO). With that in mind, it should be little surprise that the Trump Administration is pro-nuclear. Thursday, news broke that the US plans to buy and own as many as 10 nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration also announced a $1 billion federal loan to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant that is managed by Constellation Energy (CEG).

But can nuclear energy solve US energy issues? Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most reliable, and cheapest forms of energy. However, nuclear energy is unlikely to be the solution to the US power woes in the short-to-intermediate-term because building a plant typically takes a decade. Additionally, nuclear energy companies face regulatory red tape, public opinion issues, and environmental concerns that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon.

Nuclear Stock to Buy: Constellation Energy (CEG)

Although the above-mentioned nuclear challenges hold for most nuclear projects in the United States, Constellation Energy is an exception. Constellation Energy is unique in the nuclear industry because it has already received regulatory approval and funding and has provided an estimate of when its massive nuclear project will launch. CEG’s restoration of the “Three Mile Island” nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, renamed the “Crane Energy Center,” will be online in 2027. Additionally, CEG has landed 20-year power agreements to supply electricity to two big tech juggernauts – Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

Natural Gas & Coal: Fueling the Early Innings of the AI Revolution

Although it’s reasonable for investors to believe that nuclear power will be a long-term power solution for the AI revolution, doing so now is unrealistic. Since the AI buildout is unlikely to slow down any time soon, traditional energy sources such as natural gas are the answer in the short-term due to their practicality and low cost.

Natural Gas Stock to Buy: Bloom Energy (BE)

Bloom Energy has differentiated itself from other energy providers through its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. BE’s technology takes natural gas (and other gases), mixes it with air, and creates electricity. However, unlike other natural gas providers, Bloom’s technology produces electricity without combustion, making its energy “cleaner”. Additionally, Bloom’s technology is self-sufficient and produced on-site, meaning that data center owners are not susceptible to grid outages.

Solar Energy: Another Solution for the AI Energy Glut

Now that solar energy is cheaper than ever, it is poised to be a major winner in the AI-driven energy demand boom. Solar is relatively cheap, clean, renewable, and can scale rapidly.

Solar Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) & Nextpower (NXT)

First Solar is a leading domestic solar provider. FSLR benefits from increasing solar demand. Additionally, the company benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides generous tax credits and shields it from Chinese competition. Wall Street analysts expect FSLR EPS to more than double next quarter.

Meanwhile, Nextpower is another company that will benefit from the electricity super-cycle. Nextpower’s software and services help solar projects run more efficiently.

Bottom Line

Electricity demand in the US is accelerating rapidly, and the early signs of a long-term power crisis are already visible. While nuclear offers a powerful long-term, solution, the urgency of the AI buildout means that natural gas, advanced fuel cell technology, and solar will drive the first wave of investment opportunities.

(P&GJ) — Louisiana’s Office of Coastal Management (OCM) has formally reissued the coastal use permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, clearing the project to move forward following an extensive reassessment of its environmental and community impacts.

The updated decision—issued Nov. 18, 2025, as part of OCM’s Revised Basis of Decision—follows a state court order vacating the previous permit over insufficient review of climate and cumulative impacts. The new analysis concluded that “the project’s social and economic benefits outweigh environmental costs” and that the permitting process satisfied federal environmental justice standards.

According to the report, regulators reviewed environmental justice (EJ) impacts as outlined in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which identified potential effects on wetlands, social patterns, fishing industries, and storm-surge protection in nearby communities.

The decision states that “the public’s contribution has influenced the permitting authority’s decision” and that community concerns were incorporated into the review process. OCM wrote that it sought to ensure no group “bears a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences resulting from the permitted activities due to race, color, national origin, or income.”

The updated permit includes specific conditions for managing stormwater discharge, protecting wetlands, and monitoring endangered species. OCM confirmed it accepted FERC’s assessment that the project would “likely adversely affect” the Eastern Black Rail, but that impacts were not expected to jeopardize the species’ survival. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Biological Opinion supported that conclusion.

The permit also mandates that Commonwealth operate a Water Control Structure (WCS) under a state-monitored adaptive management plan. The company must report marsh hydrology data—including salinity, tidal range, and water elevation—every six months for the first two years of operation. If monitoring indicates damage to local wetlands, OCM can require remediation.

The decision found the project provides “direct benefits to communities in Cameron and Calcasieu parishes,” citing construction employment, long-term operations jobs, and tax revenue. Commonwealth LNG estimates 800 workers per month during construction, peaking at 2,000, with an additional 3,689 secondary jobs supported in the region. The company expects to distribute $234 million in payroll over the 36–38 month construction period, with Louisiana collecting more than $2 million in state sales tax.

The permit requires compliance with air, water, and waste regulations, coordination with cultural and wildlife agencies, and stipulates that all project structures must be removed within 120 days of abandonment. Pipelines must maintain at least three feet of cover below water crossings, and any maintenance that affects that depth will require a new permit.

With the revised permit reinstated, Commonwealth LNG may proceed toward construction pending final regulatory clearances. The project represents one of several LNG export facilities planned along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, underscoring the region’s growing role in global natural gas supply and carbon management.",https://pgjonline.com/media/5071/courthouse-social.jpg?v=1dc1b245f8b2780,N,,2025-12-01 13:02:42.258657

Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy.

Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.

“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.

So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.

In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.

Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes.

Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”

From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

The DER platform is structured around three user groups: entire communities, commercial and industrial clients, and households.
Global research identifies community solar minigrids as the most capital-efficient option to deliver first-time power to around 380 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Husk’s model also aligns with India’s national goal of installing 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel energy capacity by 2030.","Husk has announced an ambitious new roadmap centered on an artificial-intelligence-enabled distributed energy resources (DER) platform designed to deliver dependable, modern electricity to tens of millions of homes, enterprises and community institutions in the Global South by 2030. Introduced as the “Powering Prosperity” platform, the announcement was made at the Africa Investment Forum (AIF), where Husk formally opened its Series E fundraising round. The company is targeting $400 million in combined equity and debt to develop at least 2 gigawatts of distributed solar and battery storage systems across South Asia, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa before the end of the decade. Husk has already raised over $125 million and currently serves more than 2.2 million people in India and Nigeria.

The DER platform is structured around three user groups: entire communities, commercial and industrial clients, and households. Minigrids — both isolated and grid-tied — will continue to power villages and towns, while standalone rooftop or ground-mounted systems will support C&I users and residential customers, delivered either as turnkey EPC projects or under long-term power purchase agreements. Health centers and schools are also prioritized.

“Husk pioneered the community solar minigrid model, and today we’ve evolved into an AI-powered DER provider supporting towns, families and businesses,” said Husk CEO and Co-Founder Manoj Sinha. “This new positioning reflects exactly what we’re scaling across India and Nigeria. Deploying 2 GW by 2030 opens enormous new opportunities, giving us the ability to tailor DER offerings to every market we enter.”

At the core of the platform is a sophisticated digital architecture driven by predictive and agentic AI — the company’s operational “brain.” Husk’s AI capabilities forecast demand at each minigrid with high precision, while agentic models optimize generation assets every 30 minutes to minimize cost, maximize renewable energy use and deliver more reliable customer service. The algorithms are engineered to reduce energy costs, increase clean-energy penetration and improve power availability.

The company’s scale-up strategy supports the World Bank and African Development Bank’s Mission 300 initiative to electrify 300 million people by 2030. Global research identifies community solar minigrids as the most capital-efficient option to deliver first-time power to around 380 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Forbes reviewed thousands of companies and ranked 25 North Carolina firms on a new list.

Charlotte and the Triangle are home to 16 of the state’s 25 best firms.

Many firms are also on Forbes’ best employers and best companies for tech workers lists.

Forbes recently made its first-ever best-in-state list to rank top companies, and 25 firms based in North Carolina are included.

The popular business publication considered “millions of data points” to find companies that are excelling at satisfying customers, keeping their employees and growing.

Thousands of companies were evaluated on factors including size, financial strength and employee and customer satisfaction, Forbes says, but 750 companies made the final list.

Government entities and nonprofits such as colleges and hospitals were not considered for this list. Many North Carolina universities, health systems and municipal governments are included in and rank highly on Forbes’ other business rankings.

Also, companies were only assigned to the states in which they are headquartered. Walmart, for example, could only be included in the list of the best companies in Arkansas.

Here are the top 25 firms in North Carolina.

The U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations (SEWD) released a bill and corresponding report on Nov. 24, 2025, to fund the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for fiscal year (FY) 2026. The bill was posted by the majority, as the committee was unable to come to a bipartisan agreement allowing it to move forward with a markup. SEWD Chair John Kennedy (R-LA) released a statement noting that his bill ""would result in a 1.1% reduction in spending for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, making it the only FY 2026 Senate appropriations bill so far that cuts spending.""

Note: In September, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed its own FY 2026 Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies (HEWD) bill without any Democratic support.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of both SEWD and the full Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed some concerns with the bill, especially its cuts to energy programs. However, she also acknowledged its inclusion of ""important priorities [she] strongly advocated for,"" including 11 earmarks for Washington state, and committed to engaging in negotiations to bring the bill closer to passage. Some Democratic support will be needed as 60 votes are required to advance appropriations bills in the Senate.

The SEWD text and report contain several notable provisions regarding DOE funding programs and propose less aggressive cuts to clean energy programming than both the HEWD FY 2026 bill and the president's FY 2026 Budget Request. Also of note, both chambers' appropriations bills align with the previous DOE organization and leadership structure and do not yet reflect the newly released organization structure. More information about the reorganization is available in a previous Holland & Knight blog post.

Highlights and Notable Language

Grant Termination Guardrails and Indirect Cost Rates

SEWD's bill requires DOE to notify both HEWD and SEWD at least 120 days prior to the effective date of any grant termination. Of those 120 days, no fewer than 90 days shall be provided to work with grantees to restructure or rescope the award to better effectuate program goals or agency priorities. While restructuring or rescoping, recipients shall continue to be reimbursed for work done under the award. If there is no ability to restructure or rescope and, thus, the award is terminated, the bill states that DOE should prioritize those recipients if they apply to a future funding opportunity for the relevant program.

These policies would apply to projects funded by previous appropriations bills and appropriations provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). They exclude Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding and awards announced after Nov. 1, 2024.

The SEWD bill also requires DOE to ""apply the indirect cost rate to the same extent and in the same manner as was applied in fiscal year 2024."" This provision follows DOE initiatives earlier this year to cap the indirect cost rate for FY 2025 awards to institutions of higher education and in certain state government programs, including the State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Reprogramming of Previous Funding

The bill text reprograms unobligated funds from several IIJA provisions to other DOE initiatives or program budgets for FY 2026, including:

$1.059 billion of unobligated funds from the Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hub Program to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), now under the new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI)

$1.5 billion in unobligated funds from the Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program (CIFIA), plus $900 million in unobligated Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) funds, to be reallocated to NE for the Advanced Nuclear Reactor Demonstrations Program (ARDP)

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) to NE

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Fossil Energy (FE), under the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office (HGEO)

$75 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Grid Deployment, now primarily under the Office of Electricity (OE), for programming to enhance the domestic supply chain for grid components

Loan Programs

The Loan Programs Office (LPO), now under the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), has significant loan authority under the Title 17 loan guarantee program from the IRA and $1 billion in credit subsidy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The administration requested $750 million in additional credit subsidy through its FY 2026 budget request to support financing of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors. SEWD's bill does not provide that credit subsidy, and in its report language, the committee calls on DOE to use Title 17 authority ""to support critical minerals development, processing and recycling projects.""

Also within EDF's purview, SEWD's bill does not include the administration's request to rescind unobligated credit subsidy for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (AVTM) Loan Program, while continuing to support the Tribal Energy Financing (TEFP) Program as well.

Additional Highlights

For the first time, the SEWD bill recommends establishing the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) and proposes a funding level of $19 million, primarily for workforce capacity and competitiveness.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was also dissolved during DOE's realignment. Despite the office's statutory authorization, an identical recommendation across SEWD, HEWD and the White House budget request is to provide zero funding to OCED for FY 2026. As outlined above, SEWD recommends reprogramming some of OCED's unobligated balances.

SEWD makes clear its support for the CarbonSAFE program. In its report, the committee directs DOE to issue funding opportunities with remaining IIJA funds for CarbonSAFE projects and continue advancing projects through the program's four phases.

The more than $100 million in congressionally directed spending (also known as earmarks) in the report funds a broadly bipartisan set of projects, indicating further potential for Democratic support of the package.

A major solar panel manufacturer is transferring the assets of its Chinese unit to Canadian ownership, to safeguard sales into the U.S. as Washington steps up scrutiny of imports from the Asian nation.

CSI Solar Co., based in Suzhou, will sell 75.1 per cent of three overseas factories that serve the U.S. market to its parent company, Canadian Solar Inc., the Chinese company said in an exchange filing in Shanghai.

Canadian Solar, which is listed on the Nasdaq, was the world’s seventh-biggest producer of solar panels last year, according to BloombergNEF data, and was an early entrant into the booming energy storage business. It owns 62 per cent of CSI’s shares, and Shawn Qu is chairman of both companies.

CSI Solar shares closed down 6.9 per cent in Shanghai, while Canadian Solar rallied 18 per cent in U.S. premarket trading on Monday.

China’s dominance of the clean energy supply chain has prompted various forms of restrictions from the U.S. These include direct tariffs on Chinese solar panels and batteries, as well as restrictions on tax incentives for Chinese companies investing in the manufacturing of renewable power equipment in the U.S.

The Chinese company didn’t specify in the filing where the three factories whose ownership is being transferred are located. However, it said they comprise a 3 gigawatt-hour energy storage system plant, a 2.9 gigawatt battery factory and an 8 gigawatt solar wafer slicing operation. The three facilities have a combined value of 469 million yuan (US$66 million) and primarily supply the U.S., it said.

The factories will be used to help start two joint ventures focused on solar power and energy storage in the U.S., according to the filing. Canadian Solar will own 75.1 per cent of the JVs, with CSI holding the remaining 24.9 per cent.

CSI is aiming “to address changes in U.S. market laws and regulations, ensure normal business operations, reduce operational risks, and achieve long-term participation in the U.S. market,” it said in the filing.

This move will enable CSI “to remain compliant with potential U.S. foreign entity of concern requirements” for solar and energy-storage systems exports to the U.S., Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said in a note.

Trabish, Robert Walton",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/regulatory-sandbox-dcflex-vpp-pura-pilot-project/806454/,"Utilities are working with their regulators to find pilot project designs that speed innovation, the LBNL study found.
The utility financial disincentive is a key barrier to accelerating innovative utility pilot programs, the LBNL analysis found.
Piloting large load flexibility One key innovation to come out of recent pilots is data center flexibility.
In 2023, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, launched the first cycle of pilots, with new cycles to follow annually, LBNL said.
To reduce deployment barriers and facilitate collaboration, the IES allows pilots led by vendors, utilities or utility-vendor collaborations, LBNL’s paper said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Utility use of innovations to manage challenges like load growth and affordability can be streamlined with smarter pilot project designs, new U.S. Department of Energy research found.

Today’s pilots are often redundant, inconclusive and lack clear pathways to scale, a June Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report on pilot project designs concluded.

“With safety as a top utility priority, utilities are hesitant” about new technologies or methods, but “it is critical that utilities are able to quickly test good ideas,” the LBNL report said.

Some utilities have started to move quickly, faced with the pressure of rising demand, especially from data centers, which threatens to outpace new generation and storage additions.

Salt River Project’s May 3 demonstration of data center load flexibility using Emerald AI software has already led to an announced scale deployment in the PJM Interconnection system. Many utilities are pursuing ways to achieve this type of speed-to-innovation.

“It is more imperative now to take innovative projects and pilots to scale quickly because customer adoption, expectations, and technology are evolving at an exponential pace,” said Chanel Parson, Southern California Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response.

The faster utilities scale solutions, “the faster they can keep up,” she added.

Utilities are working with their regulators to find pilot project designs that speed innovation, the LBNL study found.

To meet its quickly growing electric vehicle penetration, Pacific Gas and Electric’s managed charging program for 1,000 customers, launched in January, is already nearing its next phase, said Marina Donovan, vice president of global marketing for smart meter provider Itron.

“That shows the speed the utility wants to move at,” she said.

Streamlined pilot design frameworks, often called “regulatory sandboxes,” can support speed-to-innovation, LBNL’s study reported. They have validated new value propositions and implementation, operational, planning and investment approaches.

Barriers include financial, regulatory disincentives

Pilots are key to innovation, but utilities tend to under-invest in new technologies and methods compared to more innovative industries, according to a different LBNL analysis from 2022.

Some utilities have seen success with scaling pilots gradually.

Green Mountain Power pilots “laid the foundation to where we are now,” said Kristin Carlson, a spokesperson for the Vermont-based investor-owned utility.

During a June 2025 peak, Green Mountain Power’s distributed energy storage virtual power plant program saved customers “about $3 million in one hour,” she added.

But, like most traditional pilots, the utility’s VPP program grew slowly. It began with 20 customers in 2017 and now has 5,035 participants providing over 75 MW of dispatchable peaking resources, Carlson said.

Southern California Edison has also nurtured its VPP innovation over time, according to utility spokesperson Jeff Monford. Its 5-MW Power Flex solar-plus-storage VPP pilot, launched with Sunrun in 2020, now has multiple vendors and a capacity of 25 MW, with plans to continue growing beyond 2027, Monford said.

The utility financial disincentive is a key barrier to accelerating innovative utility pilot programs, the LBNL analysis found.

To obtain approval for recovery of investment costs, utilities must show regulators their proposed technologies will benefit customers, LBNL’s analysts said. That discourages utility investments in pilots of unproven tools and methods, and favors “the status quo that has historically offered them a stable business environment,” they added.

Also, traditional pilot frameworks often do not clarify specific pilot parameters, the analysts said. That leads to misleading metrics, biased or inconclusive results, redundancies, disputes between participants, delays in approval and implementation and, critically, pilots without clear pathways to scaling, they added.

But these challenges can be overcome with better policy, said Anne Hoskins, a Generac Power Systems executive and former commissioner with the Maryland Public Service Commission.

For example, she said, a pilot framework could include cost limits, timelines, requirements for sharing lessons learned and clear next steps for completed projects.

“Regulators can create frameworks for a ‘sandbox’ to fast-track approval of innovative pilot programs that stay within guidelines,” she said. This can be a low-cost way to test new technologies, tools, or methods, she added.

Piloting large load flexibility

One key innovation to come out of recent pilots is data center flexibility. While the concept is still fairly new, it has already been taken up by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who called on federal regulators to streamline approval of interconnections for flexible data centers.

One key public demonstration of data center flexibility potential came in the May collaboration of Salt River Project with participants in the Electric Power Research Institute’s DCFlex initiative.

The first of a planned series, it showed data center flexibility is achievable without compromising the value proposition of data centers willing to participate, said EPRI Emerging Technologies Executive Anuja Ratnayake.

Unlike the rigorous and repeatable pilot processes described by LBNL, the Arizona demonstration with Emerald AI software was “one specific controlled test,” Ratnayake said. It had predetermined conditions in a planned four-step process that will, by mid-2026, test the software in real-time operations, she added.

Emerald AI’s fourth demonstration, scheduled for mid-2026 at the 96-MW Aurora AI Factory on the PJM system in Virginia, will be under full-scale, real time, real world conditions, Ratnayake said. It will show how much flexibility the software can deliver at scale.

AI companies’ are impatient because the speed of data center interconnections will determine how soon artificial general intelligence is developed, said Emerald AI CEO Varun Sivaram.

But certainty of data center flexibility must be demonstrated before system operators will accept it as the solution for more rapid interconnection of large loads, according to a November PJM market monitor report that questioned flexibility as a feasible solution for the country’s largest grid operator.

Emerald AI’s streamlined four-demonstration process, with escalating challenges, is intended to give utilities the confidence to connect flexible data centers faster, Sivaram said.

He expressed confidence that once flexibility can be successfully demonstrated at scale, “the floodgates will open for this understandably cautious, careful industry to move faster.”

‘I want to see utilities use our sandbox’

State regulators and regulated utilities are also working, with mixed success, on ways to make speed-to-innovation through pilots a reality. Innovation can come faster if policymakers set clear goals and remove regulatory barriers to smarter pilot designs, researchers and stakeholders said.

Policy directives and vision statements can identify a goal “that stakeholders can rally around and drive towards,” LBNL said in its report.

It pointed to examples set by New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan, Hawaii’s 2014 Inclinations on the Future of Hawaii’s Electric Utilities and its 2024 follow-up, and the District of Columbia’s PowerPath DC, all of which drove “ambitious energy objectives.”

To further advance the pace of innovation, the Hawaii commission’s 2020 Innovative Pilot Framework streamlined pilot implementation, LBNL said. Specifically, it limited regulatory review to 45 days and reduced cost recovery uncertainty, it added.

In 2019, with Green Mountain Power’s distributed energy storage program growing, the Vermont Public Utility Commission ordered a multi-year regulation plan with an innovative pilot program framework that has allowed the utility to scale multiple pilots.

VPUC Commissioner Riley Allen said two important features of that plan were that it required early notice to stakeholders and guardrails limiting cost increases to 2%.

“Utilities are reluctant to move off known frameworks, but the industry needs to be responsive to emerging factors like growing electricity demand,” Allen said. The sandbox concept “creates the space to do good things within the regulatory process.”

Michigan’s 2019 Power Grid initiative included an expedited 90-day pilot approval process and incentives for utility-stakeholder collaborations, LBNL said. But under its guidelines, according to Michigan’s pilot database, pilots “have not progressed to full-scale programs,” the researchers added.

Progress continues to come through slower general rate cases, said Michigan Public Service Commissioner Katherine Peretick.

“I want to see utilities use our sandbox,” she said, adding that “the growing electricity demand may create more utility interest in taking advantage of its expedited pilot framework.”

Two other models — New York’s Reforming the Energy Vision and Oregon’s Smart Grid Testbed programs — also represent important efforts at sandbox frameworks, LBNL said.

Randomized Control Trials, or RCTs, are an outside-the-sandbox speed-to-innovation approach championed by customer-owned device aggregator Renew Home. Data from RCTs can approximate the value customers’ smart devices deliver, by-passing the pilot process completely, Renew Home CEO Ben Brown said.

The Connecticut model

Connecticut’s Innovative Energy Solutions, or IES, sandbox framework is attracting attention as a potential model to follow as it prepares to evaluate its completed first cycle of pilots.

In 2023, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, launched the first cycle of pilots, with new cycles to follow annually, LBNL said. The framework requires four phases, with proposals followed by selection, then deployment, and, finally, evaluation, the researchers added.

To reduce deployment barriers and facilitate collaboration, the IES allows pilots led by vendors, utilities or utility-vendor collaborations, LBNL’s paper said.

The IES was designed to get over the regulatory barriers and provide regulatory certainty that the pilot process would “lead to something,” said former PURA Chair Marissa Paslick Gillett, who oversaw that design. It also provides “a regulatory environment for innovation,” she added.

“A fail-fast mentality was built into the process with milestones that must be met to obtain continued funding,” Gillett said.

Scalability is not yet clearly defined, but Connecticut has legislation allowing PURA to compel a utility to scale a pilot project that has produced evidence of viability in a regulated process, she added.

“Regulatory sandboxes accelerate innovation within the existing regulatory framework and the IES program is one of the best examples,” said Matt McDonnell, a co-founding partner of regulatory consultant Current Energy Group and an independent administrator of Connecticut’s program.

IES reduces the typical pilot’s timeline from at least four years to two years, McDonnell said. And its three participation pathways all contain ratepayer protections, he added

Piclo’s grid flexibility marketplace recently completed the first IES cycle in collaboration with Eversource Energy and United Illuminating.

In their final reports, both utilities and Piclo agreed the market launched faster and attracted more flexibility providers than expected.

“But the most important part of building a marketplace is continuity,” said Piclo CEO James Johnston. “If there is a second year and a line of sight for five years of revenue opportunities, participants will grow.”

Connecticut utilities were not convinced, however. The Piclo pilot fell short on provider participation, location specificity, cost efficiencies and operations, Eversource Energy reported.

And because system infrastructure to visualize and control customer-owned resources is lacking, Piclo’s market is premature for Connecticut, both Eversource and United Illuminating concluded. PicIo’s solution might be workable “as market conditions and grid requirements evolve,” United Illuminating said.

But concerns with load growth, reliability and affordability make it important to get more out of the grid, former PURA Chair Gillett said.

“The IES framework gives PURA commissioners the final word on the pilots in its sandbox in only two years,” McDonnell said.

Its ruling on Piclo, and the other projects in each cycle, “will provide guidance for how this type of division between utility and vendor participants should be resolved,” he added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/LMD7E6cgmBiHxDZZHW2SteGAiQgfprZFsDfZJmIiSRM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TQ0UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-01 15:00:49.540019

For the generation and energy storage side, this new entity will oversee both solar module and cell production, as well as the manufacturing and sales of its energy storage systems (ESS), branded as e-STORAGE.

Canadian Solar will hold a controlling 75.1% stake in CS PowerTech, along with acquiring “specific overseas facilities that support US operations,” effectively moving these critical assets out from under the purview of its majority-owned, China-listed subsidiary, CSI Solar, which is based in Suzhou. The transaction is valued at approximately $50 million, determined by “fair market value based on third-party appraisal”, said the release.

CSI will continue to own 24.9% of the CS PowerTech venture. In the press release and associated filings to the Nasdaq stock exchange, the “overseas facilities” were not specified.

Storage

On the battery front, the operational shift supports a sizeable storage portfolio of both product and development. Through its e-STORAGE subsidiary, Canadian Solar reported a $3.1 billion contracted backlog and an 81 GWh global development pipeline as of late 2025. The consolidation allows the company to integrate its manufacturing capabilities directly with its project development arm, Recurrent Energy.

“Launching CS PowerTech and resuming manufacturing directly under the publicly traded parent company reflects Canadian Solar’s commitment to its North American homebase and to building a resilient, transparent and diversified domestic supply chain,” said the company in its press release announcing the moves.

The transaction is subject to board and shareholder approvals. Canadian Solar also said “the company [is] eyeing further joint ventures with American partners to expand its solar and power footprint.”

FEOC/IRA Compliance

The restructuring appears calculated to address Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) guidelines. By transferring control to the Canadian-headquartered parent company and U.S. shareholders, the company positions its battery products to better align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

It also avoids some scrutiny

Similar moves have been undertaken by Trina Solar, which sold its solar manufacturing assets in Dallas, Texas to T1 Energy (which was named Freyr Battery at the time).

Corning acquired JA Solar’s Phoenix solar facility as well, and, closing the circle, T1 Energy and Corning announced an at-scale supply deal within a month.

A slide from Canadian Solar’s most recent financial reporting presentation showed the company’s operations as follows, while noting its 6 GWh ESS facility in Shelbyville, Kentucky, in the US, is under construction.

What’s driving the oil surplus?

Oil demand growth is faltering. The trade policies of US President Donald Trump are weighing on the outlook for the global economy, and China, the second-largest crude consumer, is struggling with a property market downturn and weak consumer spending.

On the supply side, OPEC+, the coalition of producers led by Saudi Arabia, has been unwinding past output cuts. Countries outside this group, in particular those in the Americas, are churning out more barrels, too.

Supply from Russia, the world’s third-biggest producer, remains a wild card. On the one hand, the country faces new US sanctions that threaten to disrupt its exports. But the Trump administration’s renewed effort to secure a deal to end the war in Ukraine has raised the prospect of some international sanctions being unwound, which could ease the flow of Russian barrels into the market.

Who are the winners in a world with an oversupply of oil?

– Oil-importing nations

A low-oil price environment is good for buyers, especially large net importers such as China, which has been filling up its strategic reserves, and India, which has faced US pressure to stop buying Russian crude.

India is the world’s third-biggest consumer of oil. It ramped up its purchases from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Russian exporters offered big discounts to offset the loss of traditional European buyers. A drop in global prices could make it less painful for India to avoid sanctioned Russian barrels and switch to suppliers in the Middle East, whose medium and heavy crude grades are similar to Russia’s Urals export blend.

– Trump

Cheaper oil can translate into lower fuel prices. Trump likes to use the price of gasoline as an economic barometer and during last year’s election pledged to bring it below $2 a gallon.

Just over 10 months into his second term, the national average price of gasoline had dropped by about 12 cents, although had yet to fall beneath $3 a gallon, a level last seen in 2021. Further reductions in fuel prices could be limited by outages at key oil refineries in Asia and Africa, as well as permanent closures across Europe and the US.

Note: Data as of Nov. 29, 2025

Lower oil prices come with a catch for Trump. If they decline too much, crude extraction could become uneconomical in the US, undermining the president’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda and squeezing his political supporters that rely on the oil industry.

– Oil refiners

Cheaper crude can boost the margins that refiners make from turning oil into products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In mid-November, US refiners’ margins hit their highest seasonal level since 2022.

As global refining capacity is relatively constrained, this limits how much extra oil can be processed and means refined product prices are likely to fall less steeply than for crude. Lower oil prices are therefore more beneficial for countries that import and refine crude themselves, rather than relying on inflows of refined products.

Note: WTI refers to West Texas Intermediate. Data is as of Dec. 1, 2025.

– Oil traders

In the run-up to the oil surplus, the “put skew” for the US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate — a measure of how much more traders are willing to pay for bearish put options over bullish calls — reached its highest level in a month. That’s a sign speculators are geared up for a price drop.

Meanwhile, just before the US blacklisted Russian oil giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC in October, money managers were the least bullish on US crude on record, according to the most up-to-date investor positioning data, which was delayed by the government shutdown.

As futures prices finally reflect the somber outlook for the market, many investors see this as vindication of their longstanding bearish view. They point to two things as proof they’ve been on the right side of the trade all along: total US crude stockpiles (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) climbed to their highest level in five months in November, while the volume of crude aboard tankers at sea continues to hit fresh records, suggesting supply is outstripping demand.

Note: Data is as of Nov. 28, 2025

– US strategic oil reserve

Low oil prices offer an opportunity for the US to replenish its store of emergency crude, which was only around 60% full as of mid-November. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve remains diminished after the Biden administration released supply into the market to try to tame the gasoline price spike that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump vowed during his inaugural address to fill the SPR “right to the top.” Taking advantage of low oil prices, the Energy Department awarded contracts worth almost $56 million in November to procure 900,000 barrels for this stockpile.

However, as part of Trump’s sweeping tax-and-spending law passed over the summer, Congress only appropriated $171 million for oil purchases for the SPR between 2025 and 2029 — a limit the government could hit very quickly. That sum equates to less than 3 million barrels at current prices, which is a far cry from the roughly 300 million barrels needed to bring the SPR to full capacity.

Who are the losers when there’s a global excess of oil?

– Petrostates

For fossil-fuel exporters whose economies are heavily dependent on the oil industry, subdued prices could weigh on their revenue and put pressure on their fiscal budgets.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest oil producer after the US, is seeking to diversify its economy through the Vision 2030 program. However, the massive investments being made in mega construction projects, such as the flagship Neom development, as well as other initiatives to build Red Sea tourism resorts, electric-vehicle factories and data centers, have arguably left it even more dependent on oil revenue.

While the kingdom has been rejigging its mega-project spending — delaying and scaling back some developments and accelerating others — it’s still expecting a national budget shortfall for the next few years. Bloomberg Economics estimated in November that the Saudi government needs an oil price of $98 a barrel to balance its budget and $115 when including domestic spending by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. That’s well above this year’s average of $69 a barrel for Brent, the global benchmark, through the start of December.

– Russia

Western sanctions have made Russian oil exporters heavily dependent on buyers in China and India, who have demanded discounts to keep importing this seaborne crude. In the absence of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, the new US sanctions and an oversupplied global market could force Russian producers to cut their prices even further.

As the US ban on dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil started to come into force in November, Russia’s flagship Urals blend was more than $20 a barrel cheaper than Brent, according to data from Argus Media. While that gap is significantly smaller than in the earlier years of the war in Ukraine, it’s still markedly wider than the historical discount of $2 to $4.

Source: Argus Media Ltd, Bloomberg

Note: Data is through Nov. 21, 2025

Taxes from Russia’s oil and gas industry account for about a quarter of the federal budget. Even before the new sanctions were announced, the government expected tax revenue from the sector this year to drop to the lowest level since 2020 due to the global crude price slump and a stronger ruble.

Russian authorities have downplayed the potential economic impact of the fresh US restrictions, saying the country will adapt quickly and find workarounds, allowing discounts on its oil to narrow within a couple of months. In the meantime, the volume of Russian oil aboard tankers has increased, suggesting that buyers are, at least in the short term, less willing to take delivery of these cargoes.

– US shale industry

The US shale industry has been the world’s engine for oil-production growth in recent years but the momentum is now slowing. Many producers need an oil price of around $65 a barrel to turn a profit and have been looking to increase their output at less than 5% annually as crude prices hover near the break-even threshold.

A global oil surplus that knocks prices down to about $50 a barrel would prompt US shale producers to idle their drilling rigs and park their frack fleets as operations become economically unviable.

Their output is holding up for now, but more than 10% of oil-focused rigs have been taken offline since the start of the year, according to data from Baker Hughes Co. The decline will likely accelerate in the coming months if oil prices stay low, which could put pressure on oilfield services companies.

Sustained lower oil prices could prompt more consolidation in the US shale patch. Mid-sized producers could scoop up struggling smaller players to add scale as some of the best drilling spots have already been tapped.

– Big Oil

Low oil prices are bad for producers, although integrated oil majors with refining and trading businesses are less vulnerable than pure upstream companies that focus only on extraction.

The profits of the five Western oil supermajors — Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE and BP Plc — have more than halved from three years ago and are poised to decline further. Still, the current oil price downturn isn’t as bad as in 2014 or 2020. Big Oil executives saw this decline coming and announced plans to cut share buybacks and costs earlier this year.

Some executives are even talking up possible opportunities. Exxon, for example, is on the lookout for potential acquisitions. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said in mid-October that low prices today will deter the investments needed for the future and tighten supply, making her “very bullish” on a price rebound from 2027.

– The energy transition

Road transport is the biggest source of oil demand. Consumers are used to a certain amount of volatility in fuel prices, but a prolonged reduction could make them less inclined to switch to an electric vehicle. That said, in areas where there are high taxes on diesel and gasoline, such as Europe and California, there could be limited relief at the pump from lower oil prices.

The buildout of clean power sources is less likely to be impacted by a crude surplus. In most regions, other than places such as the Middle East, renewables are usually competing against coal and natural gas for utility-scale electricity generation rather than oil.

Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.","When Texas A&M University freshman Carmen Reisdorf ’27 walked into her Fundamentals of Ecology class, she expected to learn about ecosystems — not launch a research project connecting hundreds of people around the world.

Reisdorf, a student in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, built an online citizen science project hosted through Zooniverse, a global citizen science platform where anyone can help scientists analyze data. Her project asks volunteers to identify bird calls from the Edwards Plateau, helping researchers understand how land management practices affect wildlife.

What makes the project remarkable isn’t just its scope, but that Reisdorf created it as an undergraduate from concept to launch.

“It started as a class project,” she said. “I was just a freshman taking Dr. Ben Wu’s Fundamentals of Ecology course, and I needed a small honors project. I walked into his office on a Thursday afternoon and asked if there was something I could do to help with his research. He said, ‘Let’s see what happens.’”

What resulted from that conversation was more than expected. Over the next three years, Reisdorf’s project grew into an international effort that has drawn more than 900 volunteers and produced over 70,000 classifications of bird sounds since launching publicly in June.

“Even though our project features a specialized task, we’ve measured high volunteer accuracy rates so far,” Reisdorf said. “Because they work together to build consensus in our repeated-classifications approach, our volunteers don’t have to be bird experts to be a powerful voice in bird research.”

Turning sound into science

The idea stems from a larger United States Department of Agriculture-funded collaborative effort known as the Prairie Project, which studies rangeland restoration and sustainability across Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. Wu, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology, serves as a co-primary investigator for the project and leads both the ranch-scale studies and its education component.

“Carmen’s work stands out as both excellent and innovative,” Wu said. “By combining AI and crowdsourcing through citizen science, she’s helping us explore how prescribed fire and grazing shape bird communities across savannah landscapes — something that wouldn’t be possible with traditional methods. Her project also enhances our teaching by giving undergraduates a hands-on way to practice scientific inquiry and critical thinking.”

At Texas A&M AgriLife Research’s Martin Ranch in the Edwards Plateau, researchers use 23 audio recorders to monitor bird activity at sunrise and sunset. Those recorders have produced more than 20,000 hours of audio since 2022, far too much for one student to review manually.

“I realized it wasn’t realistic to listen to every minute of every recording,” Reisdorf said. “I looked for ways to combine technology with community involvement.”

She used BirdNET, an open-source artificial intelligence, AI, model created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Chemnitz University of Technology, to generate initial predictions of which bird species were present. The AI is powerful but imperfect as it can sometimes misidentify sounds, so Reisdorf designed a way for human volunteers to verify its results.

Through her Zooniverse project, titled “Savanna Spy: Sound,” users listen to short clips and confirm or reject the AI predictions. Each sound is reviewed by 15 people, allowing researchers to build consensus and refine the model’s accuracy.

“People are helping us separate true positives from false positives,” she said. “It’s a way to improve the data while teaching volunteers about birds, ecosystems and how sound can tell us what’s happening in the environment.”

Leading as a learner

For Reisdorf, the project has been as much about growth as research. A self-taught coder, she learned Python, R and HTML to manage and visualize her data. She also developed the communication skills to recruit volunteers and share her findings with academic and community audiences.

Since starting the project, she has presented her research at conferences, spoken to the local Audubon Society chapter and earned the College’s Dean’s Outstanding Award for Undergraduate Research.

“This project has pushed me to learn things I never thought I’d touch as an undergraduate,” she said. “It’s taught me that I should never be afraid to teach myself something new.”

She credits her success to the support of her mentors, especially Wu, who guided her through the process of turning a class idea into a full-scale study.

“Dr. Wu has been incredibly supportive,” she said. “He trusted me to take the lead and figure things out. I could not have brought it this far without his encouragement and his team’s help.”

Wu said Reisdorf’s independence and creativity stand out among undergraduate researchers.

“Carmen approached this work with the curiosity and drive of a graduate student,” he said. “She took an idea from concept to execution and built something that is making a real contribution to both science and education.”

Listening to the land

Reisdorf’s work helps scientists evaluate how birds respond to pyric herbivory, a land management practice that combines prescribed fire and grazing to restore savanna habitats. The approach aims to maintain open grasslands that support biodiversity and ranching alike.

“Birds are indicators of ecosystem health,” Reisdorf said. “By monitoring their sounds, we can learn how these habitats are changing and whether our management strategies are working.”

For Reisdorf, who grew up in Sharpstown in southwest Houston, the connection between people and nature has always been important to her.

“I grew up seeing this disconnect between people and the natural world,” she said. “That’s part of why I want to make science accessible. Projects like this help close that gap.”

She has already inspired others to join in. Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.

“It’s humbling,” she said. “I see people worldwide helping us understand Texas ecosystems, and it reminds me that conservation is a shared responsibility.”

As she prepares to graduate early next year, Reisdorf plans to stay at Texas A&M to pursue a master’s degree and continue developing her research. She hopes to continue growing the project while keeping community participation at its heart.

“Technology can make research faster, but people keep it meaningful,” she said. “Every person who listens to a recording learns something about the environment, and that connection is what makes conservation a shared endeavor. When I go into the field and hear those same birds in person, I think about all the people who helped identify them in the Zooniverse project. It feels like we’re all listening together.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2025/11/20251114_Carmen_Reisdorf_HH-6.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:01:56.493575

*IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT*

The American Action Forum (AAF) is proud to announce a revamped version of our Regulation Rodeo (or, RegRodeo) project. For those unfamiliar with it, AAF’s RegRodeo database houses information on federal regulations going back to 2005. Launched in 2015, RegRodeo tracks every proposed and final rule published in the Federal Register that includes a quantified economic impact or paperwork burden estimate. This version makes the following improvements to the site:

Clearer graphics and layout;

An updated, more intuitive user interface;

Enhanced ability to share findings across social media platforms;

The opportunity to export selected sets of regulatory cost/savings data; and

Direct links to additional AAF material on regulatory policy matters such as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the HHS final rule regarding “Medicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems; Quality Reporting Programs; Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating; Hospital Price Transparency; and Notice of Closure of a Teaching Hospital and Opportunity To Apply for Available Slots.” As is typical with Medicare payment rules, the main impact comes in the rule’s adjustment to transfer payments. For RegRodeo purposes, however, the more interesting aspect is the changes made to various relevant paperwork requirements. Assessing the new paperwork burden estimates of the dozens of affected forms against the currently available estimates yields roughly 5.1 million hours and $83.1 million in annual paperwork and associated cost reductions, respectively.

The runner-up of the week was the EPA proposed rule regarding “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Extension of an Alternative Closure Requirement Deadline.” As the title suggests, the agency:

Is proposing to extend, by three years, one compliance deadline applicable to certain coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundments operating pursuant to the alternative closure requirements. Specifically, EPA is extending the deadline for owners and operators to complete closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 40 acres from October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031.

In the accompanying Regulatory Impact Analysis, EPA estimates that this extension will afford affected entities between $89.3 million and $146 million in total cost savings (with a mid-point estimate of approximately $117.6 million).

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

Given the holiday week, there were no new major announcements or developments from either the White House or Congress on regulatory policy matters.

The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 69 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

Coal is Old According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal production peaked in the United States in 2008 and has declined in output ever since.
These new projects could add significant capacity to coal production, potentially extending the timeline of coal availability beyond current estimates.
Coal miners face even higher risks, both black lung disease and silicosis are commonly diagnosed in miners after years of inhaling coal dust.
It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.","In 2024, global demand for coal, often called “the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel”, reached a record high, consumption hitting approximately 8.8 billion tons.

Despite the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, a legally binding international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2°C, and ideally 1.5°C, coal emissions continue to rise as part of the world’s stubborn reliance on fossil fuels. To have any chance of meeting the 1.5°C target, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2025 at the latest, and then decline by 43% by 2030. The catch? We are already in 2025. The clock is ticking.

One of the governments still pursuing coal, despite its environmental impacts, is the United States. On September 29th, 2025, the U.S. government revealed a plan to revive the mining of coal in the United States.

The U.S. Department of the Interior said it would open up 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining and lower royalty rates for companies needed to pay to extract coal. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy said it would invest $625 million to upgrade and expand the American coal industry.

These coordinated actions reflect a significant federal push to reinvigorate coal, despite environmental concerns and the ongoing global shift toward cleaner energy sources. The pursuit of coal is a giant step backwards in the fight against climate change, but there is still time to switch to clean energy alternatives.

Coal is Old

According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal production peaked in the United States in 2008 and has declined in output ever since. Output of coal is estimated to decline even further globally in 2026.

According to Global Energy Monitor, there are currently 2,457 coal-fired power plants worldwide, including both operating and mothballed units. To keep global warming below 1.5°C, as targeted by the Paris Climate Agreement, all these plants need to be retired by 2030 in wealthy countries and to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, the equivalent of about two coal plants must be retired per week by 2040.

Coal alone was responsible for approximately 15.4 billion tons of CO2 emissions in 2023, consistently producing more CO2 than any other fossil fuel annually. Despite this, only 12% of coal-fired power plants have been shut down, 11% require accelerated closure plans, and a staggering 77% have no scheduled phaseout or retirement commitment.

Coal is a finite resource with an estimated 134 years left until existing coal mines are considered depleted and when current consumption rates are factored in. Known oil reserves have approximately 51 years left to pump oil on present consumption levels.

But recent reports indicate that globally, there are over 850 new coal mine plans, expansions, and extensions in various stages of development, particularly concentrated in Asia-Pacific regions like China, India, and Australia. These new projects could add significant capacity to coal production, potentially extending the timeline of coal availability beyond current estimates.

So while coal is finite, exploration and new discoveries coupled with expanding mining capacity suggest more coal could still be accessible than previously counted.

Coal is Dirty

During the industrial revolution, coal soot filled the skies of industrial cities, lowering the life expectancy of workers and citizens alike. According to a 2023 joint study from Harvard University, George Mason University, and University of Texas at Austin, exposure to fine particulate matter from coal-fired power plants (coal PM2.5) is associated with a risk of mortality more than double that of exposure to PM2.5 from other sources.

Coal miners face even higher risks, both black lung disease and silicosis are commonly diagnosed in miners after years of inhaling coal dust. It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.

Particularly vulnerable are “young miners”, with an increase in lung diseases affecting miners in their 40s. There is no cure. Additionally, many coal miners suffer from mental health issues such as depression and suicidal thoughts, linked to poor working conditions and the physical toll of mining work. The combination of these health crises highlights ongoing occupational hazards faced by coal miners today.

Citizens around the world who use coal as a primary source of fuel also face health risks. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, is a prime example of this, where frigid winters require people to constantly heat their homes. For many citizens, coal is the only source of affordable fuel available to them.

On top of using coal in their home stoves, locally coal-fired power plants generate the overwhelming majority of the city’s electricity, about 93%. All of this reliance on coal creates smoky skies and rampant health issues. Lung diseases in the capital are common across all ages, while it has been found that Ulaanbaatar’s children have 40% lower lung function than children living in rural Mongolia.

Coal is Killing Wildlife

Coal poses significant environmental risks beyond its impact on human health. It contains toxic unburnable materials such as heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, as well as radioactive elements like uranium, which remain concentrated in coal ash after combustion. This coal ash can contaminate ground and surface water.

Furthermore, coal mining often displaces local populations, destroys terrestrial habitats, and harms wildlife. Surface mining, in particular, causes large-scale land disturbance that alter topography, damage groundwater supplies, promote soil erosion, and reduce biodiversity.

Dump Coal

Globally, the highest demand for coal is concentrated in China, India, and Indonesia. With China alone accounting for more than half of the world’s coal production. Despite coal’s dominance, the energy transition is underway — with renewable energy surpassing coal for the first time to become the largest source of electricity generation worldwide. This shift demonstrates that while coal currently fuels much of the world, a cleaner, more sustainable energy future is achievable.

The United Kingdom, once defined by coal in the era of the industrial revolution, shuttered its last coal-fired power plant in 2024, making itself a coal-free nation for the first time in 142 years. 35 other countries have made similar moves, including Germany and South Korea.

Retired coal plants can be converted into renewable energy plants, as 3D models demonstrate. People power around the world has led a movement to end coal — activists like Jerry Curran, who through relentless activism, and with major public support, helped to close the Merrimack coal-fired power station in New Hampshire. The station was one of the most polluting power stations in the state and a single-point mercury polluter.

However, he is not the only one. In the last 14 years, communities across the United States have mobilized to retire 381 coal plants which has saved over 54,000 lives. It may take many, but when we unite, we have the power to make real change.

Alaska Beacon

Developers’ efforts to overturn the cancellation of a vast gold and copper mine planned for southwest Alaska are getting a boost from national mining and pro-business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

On Nov. 24 and Nov. 25, the Chamber and the National Mining Association filed separate friend-of-the-court briefs in the lawsuit brought by the developers of the proposed Pebble Mine against the Environmental Protection Agency, which vetoed the mine.

Neither group has intervened in the case against the EPA, but the briefs represent the groups’ support for the proposed mine and offer legal arguments that Judge Sharon Gleason could consider as she debates whether to move the project forward.

In 2023, the EPA invoked a rarely used “veto” clause of the Clean Water Act to say that there was no way that the proposed Pebble Mine could be developed without significant harm to the environment. The large mineral deposit is located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, the most abundant sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

The administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which supports the project, and the proposed mine’s developers, filed separate lawsuits in federal court to overturn the rejection, as did two Native corporations that work as contractors for the developers. Those cases have since been combined.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case directly, which has left the issue in front of Judge Sharon Gleason in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.

Another lawsuit filed by the state claims that if the veto is upheld, the federal government will owe Alaska $700 billion, the state’s estimate for the value of the mine if built as planned. That case has been put on hold until the District Court rules.

In July, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it might try to settle the suit and withdraw the veto. If that occurs, it could come before Jan. 2, when the EPA is slated to file a written response to the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.

If the EPA continues to fight the case, the last written arguments are scheduled to be finished by the end of February. Any oral argument would take place afterward.

If the federal government drops the case, it doesn’t mean a free path for Pebble: Several environmental organizations, fishing groups, tribal organizations and Bristol Bay locals have also intervened in the case and intend to fight in court.

The Alaska Legislature is also expected to consider a bill that would block both Pebble and any successor projects that might emerge.

In its brief, the National Mining Association — joined by the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Alaska Miners Association — call the EPA’s veto “overly broad” and say that if it is upheld, the act “will almost certainly chill investment in domestic mining activities” because other proposed mines could also be subject to a veto.

The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed the Pebble Mine project since at least 2022, said that if the veto is upheld, it has the potential of encouraging other vetoes, which would “disrupt important industries in which many of the Chamber’s members participate.”

Years of flat energy demand and relatively stable electricity prices dulled Americans’ understanding of energy economics. Now, new data center demand, the end of cheap natural gas, and President Biden’s policy of replacing baseload nuclear and coal power with wind and solar have screwed up electricity price signals enough to shred household budgets and stun homeowners — just in time for a colder-than-average winter.

The numbers are as stark as a slate-grey November sky. Household spending on electricity for heating is expected to rise 10% this winter to more than $1,200. Utilities requested a $29 billion rate increase in the first half of 2025, double last year’s rate rise. Residential electricity rates rose 6.6% year-on-year as of June 2025, according to Utility Dive, after already rising nearly 30% between 2021 and 2024.

The causes of these electricity increases are multifaceted, yet, as a policy brief from the National Center for Energy Analytics reveals, subsidies to wind and solar are major culprits. Subsidies like the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) distort electricity markets by artificially lowering prices, sometimes into negative territory, forcing otherwise competitive but unsubsidized generation out of the market.

Interestingly, the study found that the argument that increasing demand from the data center buildout is causing increases in average rates is not supported by the facts. The state of Virginia has built the large majority of data centers in the past 2 years, yet Virginia’s ratepayers have experienced below-average price gains and still pay below-average electricity rates.

The Big Beautiful Bill, passed by Congress in July, partially solved some of these market-signal problems by accelerating the phase-out of wind and solar projects to the end of 2027, but that fact can’t heat the homes of families making hard choices every day during the winter of 2025-26.

An extra hundred dollars a month over winter means no sports or academic camps in summer for teenagers. Fifty dollars a month can be the difference between seeking mental health counseling or fighting clinical depression alone. Energy prices don’t play games.

In places like Massachusetts and California where green-energy policy has gone too far, the pain is both real and self-inflicted, raising the question of why voters continue to elect Democrats who prefer self-actualization to public service.

Residential electricity prices in California rose 125% in the last 15 years as subsidies for renewables pushed out existing nuclear and natural gas, all with the support of their ravishing Governor, Gavin Newsom.

In Massachusetts, politicians like Governor Maura Healey show us that grown-ups can still be childish. She and other (nearly all Democrat) politicians in New England don’t want any new pipelines to ship natural gas from the super-cheap Marcellus Shale Formation in Pennsylvania, lest they offend climate-change sensibilities.

Instead, they imported LNG from 3,000 miles away in Norway, which averaged more than $12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) between January and March 2024. Meanwhile, average realized sales prices for Marcellus shale gas, less than 150 miles away during the same period, were between $2.10 and $2.20 per Mcf, only one-sixth the price. Not very smart.

As a result, both states, perhaps taking their cues from the grade-inflating Harvard and Stanford Universities within their borders, now have the highest electricity rates in the country, over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Nice job, Einsteins.

Leaving the energy policy equivalent of a flaming paper bag of poo on the front porch for the Trump administration to stomp out may be good politics for Democrat governors. Still, if the United States is going to win the future, we have to get away from the energy hunger games and put in place permanent policies that a subsequent White House occupant won’t overturned.

And some states do their energy policies better, and not just carbon rich states like Texas or Kentucky that have some geologic largesse. States like Indiana, which imports energy from other states, have slowed coalretirements through legislative action, passing laws requiring utilities to demonstrate grid reliability before replacing coal with renewables.

Even Democrat-run states like Illinois have resisted closing base load nuclear plants despite political pressure from net-zero and anti-nuclear groups.

And some states are doing even more. Republican governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana has signed sweeping legislation aimed at reducing energy costs and unleashing energy affordability to its rate payers across the states and countries that it feeds.

And on the federal level, Congressman Troy Balderson is trying to make Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security the federal standard. If you want to set into law energy sanity that will survive, states need to follow leaders like Governor Landry. And if we as a country have any brains left in our screen-addled heads, we have to put Balderson’s ARC ES bill on the president's desk to sign.

Energy production should be a kitchen-table issue, but with a longer lead time than the current election cycle. We should be able to pay less to get more. The Trump administration is doing more in that regard than any administration in history. Opening Alaska, easing leasing restrictions on federal land, and cutting subsidies for EVs and renewables are nice. In the meantime, states and the federal government must step up.

In the end, we’re all worm food, but until then, people — especially Americans facing the winter season — have things to do, dreams to achieve, and go places where futures can thrive.

Here’s to a more affordable 2026.

You’re not alone, according to the latest Ocean State Poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which found roughly 78% of Rhode Islanders feel the same way about their upcoming winter heating bills.

Unease over heating prices has risen since last November, when UNH researchers found 70% of residents were worried about their winter energy bills. Among the anxious, 40% said they were “very worried,” while 37% were “worried.”

And that worry was expressed across each of the three voter affiliations used in the survey released Nov. 25 — Democrat, Republican and independent — expressed being “worried” or “very worried.” That included 88% of independents, 83% of Democrats, and 61% of Republicans.

Independents, or unaffiliated voters, comprised the overall survey’s largest share at about 51% of the total of 711 residents surveyed. The survey was conducted online between Nov. 13 and 17.

The worries are not abstract, as evidenced by Federal Energy Information Administration data which shows Rhode Island home heating oil prices at about $3.88 a gallon in the last week of November 2025. That’s up from the same time last year, when a gallon of oil cost about $3.52. It’s also significantly above pandemic-era November 2020, when heating oil cost about $2.31 a gallon in Rhode Island.

Heating oil is, however, still below the heights achieved in the fall of 2022, when October and November oil prices regularly soared above $5 a gallon, almost reaching $5.89 in the last week of October 2022.

Propane has been similarly expensive in recent years, with federal data showing residential propane averages about $3.56 a gallon on Nov. 24, 2025, comparable to the $3.61 per gallon recorded in the same time period in November 2024, but still above the high-$2.80s of late 2020. Like oil, propane prices spiked in fall 2022, regularly reaching the $3.80s in October and November of that year.

The day after the poll was released, Rhode Island Energy submitted a request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in an application submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. If approved, the proposed new distribution rates which would take effect in September 2026 would increase the average residential electric bill by about $7.78 a month, while a typical gas customer would pay $343.53 more annually, a 20.6% jump.

Gloomy on the economy

Rhode Islanders’ concerns about heating bills are embedded in a larger pessimism about the economy at large, with only 13% of the 711 respondents surveyed saying their household is financially better off than it was a year ago.

“Rhode Islanders are generally downbeat on the state and national economies, as a majority feel that the economy is getting worse,” the survey’s introduction states.

Another 40% of respondents said their household was financially worse off than a year ago, while 47% did not discern any substantial change in their household finances over the previous 12 months. Half of respondents who identified as Democrats felt their households were worse off, while only 24% of Republicans did.

“The fact that they were so close together, was surprising to me,” Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, said after she looked over the poll results. ”Normally I would say, ‘Oh, it’s a partisan thing,’ but clearly this is something that is impacting all people.”

Tanzi, known as a strong advocate for energy affordability, noted that in Washington County, which includes the district she represents, just under half of people were “very worried” about energy costs, higher than any other county in the state.

“I certainly hear it from my neighbors,” Tanzi said.

The poll found about 40% of households making under $75,000 a year and 54% of households making under $45,000 annually said they were worse off financially than last year.

The sample’s largest of six income demographics — households making over $150,000 annually, which accounted for 135 respondents — said they had stayed the same since last year at 56%, although equal amounts of 22% thought they were better or worse off from last year.

The survey does show that broader pessimism about the macroeconomic picture has shrunk somewhat in the past six months, slightly more so when looking toward the future. When the survey center asked the same questions of Rhode Islanders back in May, 45% of respondents expected to be financially worse off a year from now. In the new survey, that number has fallen to 35%, and an additional 21% of respondents think they will be better off in a year. The other 45% expect to be in roughly the same place financially.

Affordability concerns are more than a seasonal trend, said Camilo Viveiros, executive director of the George Wiley Center in Pawtucket, a nonprofit which advocates for low-income Rhode Islanders.

Viveiros pointed to percentage of income payment plans (PIPP), which would cap bills according to a fixed percentage of a customer’s income. A bill to institute PIPP in Rhode Island was submitted by Democratic Rep. Scott Slater of Providence early in the 2025 legislative session, but it failed to move out of committee.

“The George Wiley Center urges public officials to listen to our calls to restructure rates for long term affordability,” Viveiros said in an email Friday, adding that “it is time” for state officials “who profess to care about affordability to lend their support for the PIPP proposal.”

He also pointed to a policy brief recently published Nov. 20 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which pointed to PIPP as a means to “restructure rates for long term affordability.”

The brief noted that a broader Federal Poverty Line benchmark would apply to PIPP eligibility and could be optimized if paired with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which is a federal program.

In fiscal year 2025, Rhode Island received nearly $27 million in LIHEAP funding, which helps low-income families with a one-time seasonal payment they can put toward heating bills. The minimum benefit was $64 and the maximum was $1,148, with higher allowances up to $1,500 during a winter crisis.

In fiscal year 2024, 28,234 Rhode Island households got help from the LIHEAP program.

Tanzi said she’s worried about the program in 2026 due to changes in federal policy. A shutdown-induced delay concluded Friday when $3.6 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally was finally released to states. If LIHEAP suffers any cuts, Tanzi said, “we’re really in a crisis for people.” She pointed to lower-income survey respondents who answered the question, “Do you worry about winter energy costs?”

Such respondents might be “basing their assumptions and their response to this on the availability of LIHEAP money,” Tanzi said. “If we did this poll again in two months, or three months, I have a feeling that things would be incredibly different in the responses.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80416/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dsc02165-1024x6831764585361.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=H9QSdHfH,N,,2025-12-01 15:01:55.109669

OCOchem CEO Todd Brix likes to say that green chemistry runs in his family. His father, Terry Brix, was a green chemistry “serial entrepreneur” long before the phrase was common. Terry started 18 companies in Washington, all focused on creating sustainable chemicals from waste biomass. After earning a chemical engineering degree from the University of Washington, Todd went to work at Chevron Research and Technology Company, where he worked in oil refineries and dealt with early forms of green hydrogen.

Growing up in that environment, Todd recognized hydrogen’s potential as an awesome chemical with a variety of uses. But he also understood its biggest challenge: storing and transporting it safely, since it’s a highly explosive gas. That problem sparked his curiosity, and eventually his own research and development.

Todd spent six months digging through global research at the UW library, tracking down innovative processes, licensing intellectual property, assembling a team, and developing a business model in his Woodinville garage. The core invention was small-scale CO₂ electrolyzers — machines that convert carbon dioxide into a valuable chemical called formate.

In 2020, after completing their planning and prototype work, Todd and his father launched OCOchem. From there, Todd opened a full-scale lab, securing early funding, and expanded the vision that started in a garage.

The domino effect of early funding

That’s when the Department of Commerce stepped in. Early funding from Commerce’s Clean Energy Fund, a $1.5 million award that matched the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen EarthShot initiative, was pivotal. This initial boost drew additional support from U.S. Department of Energy and the Centralia Coal Transition Fund, as well as private investors from around the world.

Todd Brix stressed that without strong investment in research and development, true innovation just can’t happen. “I’m grateful to be in Washington state and have my state support me,” said Brix. “It certainly helped to advance this technology.”

From a lab to a large scale

By January 2024, OCOchem had built the world’s largest CO₂ electrolyzer cell, a 1.5-square-meter unit about the size of a dinner table. It works by using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen on one side of the cell, then mixing the hydrogen with CO₂ on the other side to create formate, a process known as CO₂ electrolysis. The system started small in 2020 and was scaled up three times to reach its current size.

“Think of an electrolyzer like a kitchen appliance that works in reverse of a battery,” Brix explained. “A battery stores electricity and gives it back when you need it. A CO₂ electrolyzer uses electricity to take water apart into hydrogen and oxygen and then uses that hydrogen to combine with CO₂ to make formate in a single step.”

Doing this in one step means OCOchem doesn’t have to produce and store hydrogen gas separately or run it through high-temperature, high-pressure systems. That makes the process safer and less expensive. And because the formate is made from CO₂, releasing hydrogen from it later is carbon-neutral.

Impact on communities

OCOchem’s innovation could transform how we power vehicles, produce chemicals, and manage carbon emissions. Instead of releasing CO₂ into the air, OCOchem’s process makes it valuable to capture that resource, helping industries decarbonize, displacing products made from and by fossil fuels, while creating jobs and building new markets.

OCOchem is scaling up its technology to show how carbon emissions can be turned into solutions. Its principal research and development laboratories are in Richland, and in August 2025 the company announced a partnership with ADM to build a demonstration plant in Decatur, Illinois. The plant will turn 10,000 tons of CO₂ from ethanol production into formate each year, cutting emissions equal to taking about 16,000 cars off the road.

At the same time, OCOchem is developing portable “green” generators, which are quiet, nonpolluting alternatives to diesel engines that run on formate fuel and could power events, construction sites, and even food trucks.

Building the hydrogen economy

From garage experiments to global partnerships, OCOchem’s journey highlights the power of innovation in addressing climate change for Washington communities and beyond. With reformer technology on the horizon to produce hydrogen for vehicles, buildings and backup power, the company is positioning itself at the center of the hydrogen economy.

Brix is dedicated to transforming waste carbon dioxide into useful products and making green hydrogen easier to use. And he’s succeeding at flipping the incentives so society stops rewarding fossil fuel extraction and instead treats CO₂ as a resource for building a cleaner, more efficient future.

His family legacy in clean fuel is ongoing, too: Todd’s daughter is also a chemical engineer, picking up the knowledge of her father and grandfather and the things she learned watching them turn a family experiment in green chemistry into a technology powerhouse.",https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OCOchem.png,N,,2025-12-01 13:00:50.749552

Since 2020, the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in the US has soared from $0.133 to $0.188, a 30% increase in just the past 5 years. In the next few years, many experts fear that the United States will face an electricity crisis (although one can argue it’s already in the early stages of one).

Image Source: FRED

Below are four factors driving higher energy prices:

· An Aging Electrical Grid: The US’s electrical grid is aging. With an already massive fiscal deficit, major grid upgrades are unlikely any time soon. Grid issues have become more prevalent recently and are likely to persist.

· Extreme Weather Events: Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events over the past few years. For instance, a 2021 Texas winter storm left 2 million Texans without electricity.

· Persistent Inflation: Although the inflation rate has slowed since its 2022 peak, inflation is still driving up the costs of the equipment and materials needed to generate electricity.

· EVs & the AI Buildout: As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, the need for charging infrastructure is also increasing. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence buildout is the most significant driver of higher electricity prices. Currently, data centers comprise ~5% of total electricity use in the United States. However, McKinsey & Company expects that data center electricity use will triple by 2030, accounting for 11.7% of total consumption.

Is Nuclear the Solution to the US Electricity Crisis?

Chris Wright, the US Secretary of Energy, had a nuclear energy background prior to joining the Trump Administration, having previously served on the board of directors of Oklo (OKLO). With that in mind, it should be little surprise that the Trump Administration is pro-nuclear. Thursday, news broke that the US plans to buy and own as many as 10 nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration also announced a $1 billion federal loan to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant that is managed by Constellation Energy (CEG).

But can nuclear energy solve US energy issues? Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most reliable, and cheapest forms of energy. However, nuclear energy is unlikely to be the solution to the US power woes in the short-to-intermediate-term because building a plant typically takes a decade. Additionally, nuclear energy companies face regulatory red tape, public opinion issues, and environmental concerns that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon.

Nuclear Stock to Buy: Constellation Energy (CEG)

Although the above-mentioned nuclear challenges hold for most nuclear projects in the United States, Constellation Energy is an exception. Constellation Energy is unique in the nuclear industry because it has already received regulatory approval and funding and has provided an estimate of when its massive nuclear project will launch. CEG’s restoration of the “Three Mile Island” nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, renamed the “Crane Energy Center,” will be online in 2027. Additionally, CEG has landed 20-year power agreements to supply electricity to two big tech juggernauts – Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

Natural Gas & Coal: Fueling the Early Innings of the AI Revolution

Although it’s reasonable for investors to believe that nuclear power will be a long-term power solution for the AI revolution, doing so now is unrealistic. Since the AI buildout is unlikely to slow down any time soon, traditional energy sources such as natural gas are the answer in the short-term due to their practicality and low cost.

Natural Gas Stock to Buy: Bloom Energy (BE)

Bloom Energy has differentiated itself from other energy providers through its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. BE’s technology takes natural gas (and other gases), mixes it with air, and creates electricity. However, unlike other natural gas providers, Bloom’s technology produces electricity without combustion, making its energy “cleaner”. Additionally, Bloom’s technology is self-sufficient and produced on-site, meaning that data center owners are not susceptible to grid outages.

Solar Energy: Another Solution for the AI Energy Glut

Now that solar energy is cheaper than ever, it is poised to be a major winner in the AI-driven energy demand boom. Solar is relatively cheap, clean, renewable, and can scale rapidly.

Solar Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) & Nextpower (NXT)

First Solar is a leading domestic solar provider. FSLR benefits from increasing solar demand. Additionally, the company benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides generous tax credits and shields it from Chinese competition. Wall Street analysts expect FSLR EPS to more than double next quarter.

Meanwhile, Nextpower is another company that will benefit from the electricity super-cycle. Nextpower’s software and services help solar projects run more efficiently.

Bottom Line

Electricity demand in the US is accelerating rapidly, and the early signs of a long-term power crisis are already visible. While nuclear offers a powerful long-term, solution, the urgency of the AI buildout means that natural gas, advanced fuel cell technology, and solar will drive the first wave of investment opportunities.

In past administrations, farmers, ranchers, home builders, and other small businesses with water on their property have faced overreach from the federal government, as it used WOTUS to claim jurisdiction over private lands.

Background

The Clean Water Act (CWA) gives the federal government authority over certain “navigable waters,” which the Act defines as “waters of the United States” or WOTUS. The CWA charges EPA and the Army Corps with enforcement, and these agencies have issued regulations defining which waters or wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction. If a water or wetland is a WOTUS, then a landowner must obtain a permit before improving and altering the area, even though he or she owns the land.

After longstanding confusion and conflicting interpretations about what waters are WOTUS, the Supreme Court decided Sackett v. EPA in 2023. In Sackett, the Court struck down a vague test that the agencies had long used to claim jurisdiction. Thus, the Court restricted when the agencies could do so going forward. NFIB urged the Court to reach this outcome and applauded the decision benefiting landowners.

But the Biden Administration pushed forward. It responded to the Sackett decision by issuing a new WOTUS rule that further expanded federal government jurisdiction, leaving small businesses with extreme uncertainty. NFIB expressed disappointment that the federal government failed to head the Supreme Court’s mandate and continued to complicate WOTUS.

Newly Proposed Rule

On November 20, 2025, EPA and the Army Corps proposed a new WOTUS rule. Small businesses reacted to the new rule with appreciation and optimism for a better WOTUS future.

Among the changes in the new rule, a few will have a significant impact on small businesses and landowners.

Clearer Definitions

Relatively Permanent

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that “waters” in WOTUS included “only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographical features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.”

The proposed rule defines relatively permanent waters as those that are “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.”

Continuous Surface Connection

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that wetlands are subject to the CWA and federal authority only if they are “adjacent” to a WOTUS, and the wetland has a “continuous surface connection” with that WOTUS, “making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

Under the proposed rule, a water with a “continuous surface connection” to a WOTUS means: 1) the water in question is abutting (touching) an already jurisdictional WOTUS, and 2) the water in question has surface water at least during the wet season.

“At least during the wet season” is a temporal requirement that will make it easier for a landowner or consultant to determine what areas satisfy the continuous surface connection test.

Restrictions of Wetland Jurisdiction

The proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” reduces the number of wetlands that will be jurisdictional and subject to federal authority.

Combined with the instructions of the Supreme Court in Sackett, the proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” will mean that a wetland is not jurisdictional unless it meets all three of these requirements:

The area in question meets the definition of a wetland; and

A “wetland” is defined as an area that is “inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation.” Examples are swamps, marshes, bogs, etc.

It is abutting (touching) that WOTUS; and

It has surface water at least during the wet season.

Unlike previous WOTUS rules, the proposed rule makes clear that only the portion of a wetland that satisfies the two-part continuous surface connection test will be a jurisdictional WOTUS. For example, if only one part of the wetland has surface water throughout the wet season, but other portions of the wetland do not, then EPA will split up the wetland for determining jurisdiction. This is a stark contrast to previous agency practices, which would include the entire wetland as jurisdictional if any portion of it was.

Exclusion of Most Ditches

Although ditches are generally excluded from the definition of WOTUS, previous administrations have treated the ditch exclusion differently so that many ditches would be jurisdictional.

To address and clarify this confusion, the proposed rule excludes all ditches “that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.”

The clarity of the proposed rule means that the jurisdictional reach of ditches will depend solely on where the specific ditch was constructed. Ditches constructed in wetlands or tributaries will still be jurisdictional, and in rare cases, a ditch constructed in dry land may meet an independent basis for federal jurisdiction, such as a ditch being navigable (like a canal) or qualifying as a “point source” for pollutant discharge. All other ditches should be excluded from WOTUS under the proposed rule.

Absolute Certainty on Ephemeral Waters

Ephemeral waters are those that are normally dry but may have surface or standing water flow temporarily only due to precipitation events like rain or snow fall.

The proposed rule makes clear that “ephemeral waters . . . are not jurisdictional.”

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public electric vehicle charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel, it says.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time.

The American Clean Power Association and the Advanced Power Alliance — clean energy trade groups — supported the priority process proposal, saying it was narrowly tailored and non-discriminatory.
One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites.
SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

In a three-part decision, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week approved the Southwest Power Pool’s proposal allowing power plant owners to expand their generating facilities by up to 20% under a temporary priority review process.

However, FERC on Nov. 28 rejected SPP’s proposal to allow the owners of retired power plants to use the fast-track review process, as well as a proposal to give “priority projects” an advantage in an upcoming interconnection study process.

SPP’s proposals are part of a push by U.S. grid operators to create pathways for bringing power supplies online more quickly to meet rising demand for electricity. SPP contends it is onthe brink of a resource adequacy crisis, with its demand forecasts rising and power plant retirements accelerating, according to its “priority process” application at FERC.

Under the proposal, filed in late September, eligible shovel-ready expansion projects would receive an accelerated study process.

SPP says that its “priority process” to add capacity at existing generating facilities will complement its FERC-approved Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process for new power plants to help meet near-term capacity needs.

Under the priority process, a power plant owner can seek to add up to 20% of a generating facility’s capacity at its existing interconnection point. A power plant owner can use the process once per facility.

Priority project developers must meet eligibility requirements, including showing the project can be online within five years, that they have ordered all major equipment for their expansion project and that the manufacturer has indicated it can deliver the equipment by the planned commercial operation date. Also, all financing for the project must be secured.

Priority projects must also make heightened financial commitments compared to SPP’s standard financial requirements for interconnection requests.

The owners of priority projects must pay all of the cost of the Priority System Impact Study and all the cost of substation network upgrades and system network upgrades needed for their projects.

The American Clean Power Association and the Advanced Power Alliance — clean energy trade groups — supported the priority process proposal, saying it was narrowly tailored and non-discriminatory.

“The Priority Process will improve the efficient interconnection of new generating facility capacity by allowing incremental additions to existing generating facilities to come online in an expedited manner without impacting existing interconnection customers,” FERC said in its decision.

The priority process will be effective from Dec. 1, 2025, to March 1, when SPP’s recently proposed Consolidated Planning Process will take effect, if approved.

However, FERC rejected two related proposals that SPP filed separately. One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites. Another would allow priority projects to be queued ahead of other interconnection requests in a Definitive Interconnection System Impact Study cluster if the review’s first phase hasn’t started.

FERC ruled that SPP’s proposal for allowing retired power plants to take advantage of the priority process lacked key details, including whether the new project could be 120% the size of the old one or just 20% of its size.

SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.

“SPP offers several conclusory statements in its filing but does not provide sufficient evidence in the record to support a determination that the Queue Priority Revision is just and reasonable,” FERC said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e8aVfByOkZnqgtFNC6j258vrTLq242a_miskwi3z_Ik/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HUkVDLVVuaXQtMy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-01 13:01:16.686709

Indian blogger Amit Kumar raised his phone to livestream the scene to his followers overseas, enthusiastically explaining the advanced technology on display.

""This expo is amazing! It showcases cutting-edge green technologies while offering a chance to sample eco-friendly cuisine from around the world,"" Kumar said.

The event, held from Nov. 27 to 30 in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, brought together more than 2,500 exhibitors from over 60 countries and regions.

The event showcased the latest green technologies across various industries such as new energy, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence and low-altitude economy, as well as green food products from around the world. According to organizers, more than 60 projects worth 45 billion yuan (about 6.36 billion U.S. dollars) were signed.

In recent years, China has actively advanced green energy transition through concrete actions, establishing the world's largest clean energy supply system.

According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China has helped reduce global wind and photovoltaic power generation costs by over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, and accounts for 46 percent of the world's renewable energy jobs.

By 2024, China's exports of wind and solar products had helped other countries cumulatively reduce carbon emissions by over 1 billion tonnes.

""China is actively seeking deeper cooperation in the global green industry and working toward its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals,"" said Jia Kang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences.

Seah Shoo Chin, Malaysian State Executive Councillor for Malacca, welcomed Chinese enterprises to explore green industry cooperation in Malaysia.

Malacca is advancing green projects such as waste-to-energy initiatives while offering industrial parks for investment and high-quality halal food certification. ""We hope to deepen China-Malaysia cooperation in green manufacturing, clean energy, and the circular economy, creating both inclusive and replicable projects,"" Seah said.

The exhibition also attracted buyers from across the globe, many of whom were impressed with the innovative products on display. Souley Flhadji Adamou from the Republic of Niger, who has been engaged in China-Africa trade for a decade, was seen testing a rideable electric suitcase.

""This suitcase can run up to 13 kilometers on a single charge. It's smooth and convenient to ride, and it holds significant market potential,"" he said.

At the Jiangxi Godfrey Technology Co., Ltd. booth, Immaculée Agbaka showcased the company's chargers, speakers and other products to international buyers.

The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard.
Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve.
“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press.
The Big Question What’s the best new car deal in your area?","The so-called ‘Magic Week’ is the time of the year when dealers are so desperate to get rid of cars that they’ll sell them for a loss. Is this a real thing? It can be, although there are all sorts of variables at play this year. Inventory is up, and sales are down, which is usually the perfect recipe for scoring a great deal.

There’s always a catch, right? The Internet loves a catch-y headline, and this time, for this Morning Dump, I’m going to go through all the catches. There’s the obvious one, which is that the best way to get a good deal is to have a lot of money in the first place. There’s more to it, though, as I’ll explore today.

You know who is super-reliant on China? The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard. Germany has a plan, though, and it’s to walk back the 2035 EV mandate, which seems to play into the hands of Chinese automakers that want to sell EVs there.

It’s not just Europe that’s looking askance at Chinese automakers, as BYD just launched a much cheaper alternative to the popular plug-in hybrids in Japan.

The Good Deals And Not-So-Good Deals Will Depend A Lot On Where And What You Shop

While no rational person should expect to suddenly get a great deal everywhere on a super popular car like a Toyota Sienna or Honda CR-V, there’s some logic behind the idea that from December 26th to January 1st, you might be able to get your lowest price/best incentives on a new car.

Some of this is the market overall, as the year is expected to end with a thud, as Cox Automotive points out:

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months. Sales began surging in the spring as buyers rushed to market to beat expected higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

As the Detroit Free Press reports, there is logic behind ‘magic week’ as well:

Overall, most car shopping experts and car dealers expect automakers to offer sizable incentives to move metal in December. General Motors has already started offering big discounts on Chevrolet Silverado pickups.

Likewise, many car dealers will negotiate more aggressively to get sales over the finish line to hit year-end targets. In fact, Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve. He calls it the “magic week” for car buying. Eric Frehsee, president of Tamaroff Auto Group, confirmed Jominy’s prediction.

“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press. “There’s all kinds of goals and targets to hit and no one wants to fall short.”

You probably can’t just call up your local dealer and ask them how close they are to their yearly target, so you’ll have to look a little closer at what you want. As referenced above, Chevy is putting a lot of might behind Silverado this year, and for good reason. Not only is it a high-margin, profitable vehicle, but Ford is in trouble.

Specifically, it may not be the best time to get an F-150 because the plant that processes the aluminum for F-150 production keeps catching on fire for some reason. This means deals for the Ford truck might be harder to come by, whereas Chevy wants the killshot of outselling the F-Series for a quarter, or at least the company wants to make Ford sweat a little.

As mentioned, the ongoing affordability catch is also there. While lending is loosening up a little bit, your best way to get a deal is to have great credit in order to negotiate lower financing on shorter terms. If you can afford a 48-month repayment and can put a lot of money down, you’ll ultimately pay less over the course of the loan than someone who has a higher interest rate and can only afford a much longer term.

Is there any upside here for buyers? Sure, if you’re a Costco member and have been for a while, there are a bunch of $1,250 incentives on GM or Polestar products.

As you can see in the chart above, there are also deals to be had in certain segments. Do you want a mid-size sedan? Sales are down, so maybe a deal on a Camry or Accord isn’t so far out there as a concept. Do you want a Nissan Altima? No. No one wants a Nissan Altima. However, the deals for those are probably going to be excellent depending on where you live.

The other place to look is for vehicles and automakers impacted by tariffs. This is probably a bad time to score a good deal on a European-built car, as European brands are looking to protect profitability.

So, yeah, deals are out there, but it’s going to depend more than usual on the brand, the vehicle, and the geography.

European Automakers And Suppliers Looking At Supply Chain Disruptions

The un-flattening of the world is starting to continue apace, especially with China’s Ministry of Commerce putting stricter export controls on its rare earth minerals and magnets. These materials are key to making all sorts of advanced goods, and the Chinese government is fully aware of this dependence. After a year of governments questioning their reliance on China and implementing trade barriers, China is responding by increasing bureaucratic hurdles.

A new survey by the European Chamber of Commerce points out just how tough this is:

Delivery times for impacted goods have been disrupted, with 40% of respondents indicating that export control approval processes have added upwards of two months to delivery times. A similar proportion (38%) expect ‘significant’ disruptions to their supply chains, or production stoppages or slowdowns, if all of China’s announced export controls are fully implemented.

[…]

“China’s export controls have increased the uncertainty felt by European businesses operating in the country, with companies facing risks of production slowdowns or even stoppages,” said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They have also prompted strong responses from China’s trading partners, which has added more pressure to a global trade system that was already under a great deal of stress.”

The EU recently passed high tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, over the protest of the German government.

Germany: Let’s Maybe Chill On Those EV-Only Mandates

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would very much like it if the European Union didn’t keep its 2035 EV-only mandate, reports Bloomberg:

“Our goal should be a technology-neutral, flexible, and realistic CO2 regulation that meets the EU’s climate protection targets without jeopardizing innovation and industrial value creation,” Merz wrote in the letter, which reached von der Leyen’s office on Friday and was seen by Bloomberg.

Merz’s letter demands far-reaching changes to von der Leyen’s original plan to ban combustion engine vehicles by 2035. “We must consider the emissions of the entire passenger car fleet — that is, new registrations and existing vehicles,” Merz, the leader of Germany’s conservative CDU party, wrote.

The European Union is adoping EVs at a way faster rate than the United States, and even there the idea of getting rid of all combustion-powered cars without some sort of huge advancement seems difficult. I mean, one way could be lowering tariffs on Chinese cars and allowing that country’s automakers to sell a bunch of cheap EVs in Europe, but that’s even worse for German automakers.

Merz himself got elected partially on a promise to kick the economy back into gear which, in Germany, requires selling and building more cars.

BYD’s Sealion 6 Is Going To Challenge Japan’s Best

The BYD Sealion 6 is, visually, one of the least interesting vehicles for sale right now. From a technological and geopolitical standpoint, however, it’s fascinating. The BYD plan, besides selling EVs outside of China, seems to hinge on selling plug-in hybrids.

While tame, visually, the Sealion 6 is competitive on range and features with both the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV in Japan. On price? It’s not even close. The Sealion 6 will sell in Japan for about $25,600 for the FWD model, compared to $36,500 for a RAV4 and $34,100 for the Outlander. Even the AWD Sealion 6 is just $28,900 or so.

Will Japanese buyers go for it? There’s a reason why they may not, as Nikkei Asia reports:

The debut takes place with relations between Japan and China worsening. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in parliament that an armed attack on Taiwan could become “a survival-threatening situation” for Japan. In response, Beijing has taken a series of measures, including urging its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.

In a group interview on Monday, Tofukuji said there has been no significant increase in canceled orders. “We have not received requests to cancel from customers awaiting delivery. Customers are observing the situation calmly.”

He also said the company has not received any requests to cancel Monday’s news conference from either the Japanese or Chinese governments.

“We cannot predict how bilateral relations will develop, going forward, and there is no major impact at this time,” he said. “But if such a relationship persists into the future, it is natural that concerns will arise.”

If the People’s Republic of China invades the Republic of China (Taiwan) it’s a scary moment for Japan, but the quesiton is how much Japanese buyers are influenced by geopolitics.

The changes Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available.
In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.
The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added.
Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.","Ohio lawmakers introduced tweaks last month to a bill effectively prohibiting many immigrants from owning land in the state. Those changes include carveouts for green card holders and those who have served in the armed forces. But opponents don’t see the changes as much of an improvement.

The restrictions apply to people from countries designated as foreign adversaries. That list, compiled by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

As part of Ohio’s 2023 state operating budget, Gov. DeWine allowed restrictions on foreign farmland ownership but refused to apply the same prohibitions to land within 25 miles of military installations. Ohio House Bill 1 revives those vetoed provisions and expands them to include critical infrastructure.

The sponsors’ stated concern is that allowing foreign governments, businesses, and agents to buy land nearby leaves the U.S. vulnerable to spying or sabotage.

“As legislators,” state Rep. Angie King, R-Celina, said when she introduced the bill, “we have a responsibility to protect Ohio from those who seek to undermine and destroy our American values and way of life.”

But critics, including civil rights groups and scores of immigrants from targeted countries, contend the bill is exceptionally harsh. The measure relies on a definition of critical infrastructure that includes large, discrete facilities like power plants, dams, and refineries, but it also extends to vast power and communication networks. For instance, every telephone and utility pole, the lines that run between them, and every cell tower fit squarely within that definition.

The changes

Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available. The amendment in the Ohio House reduced that limitation to 10 miles. But opponents say, with such an expansive list, even a one-mile ban “would render significant portions of Ohio inaccessible for families and businesses.”

In addition to reducing the radius of the bill’s exclusion zone, the amendment provides exemptions for legal permanent residents and people who have served or are serving in the military.

The changes also provide protection for property willed to someone, as well as property used to retire outstanding debts.

County prosecutors raised concerns early on about taking on potentially complex cases. “Without additional resources these cases will take time away from the core responsibilities of county prosecutors,” Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin said. The amendment includes a provision giving county prosecutors the ability to hand cases off to the state attorney general if they don’t have the resources to pursue them.

The bill grandfathers land already owned by individuals who would otherwise be prohibiting from ownership, but bars them from acquiring any other property. Should the measure take effect, anyone who becomes subject to the bill in the future would have to sell their property within two years.

In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.

The bill continues to discriminate against people in the U.S. lawfully, the groups said, based solely on their national origin — one of the seven protected characteristics laid out in the federal Fair Housing Act.

The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added. Not only does the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution require equal protection, but Article 1 Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution includes “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property” among all individuals’ inalienable rights.

The groups noted as well that the prohibitions would discourage legitimate investment in the state.

“At a moment when Ohio is striving to attract advanced manufacturing, strengthen its workforce, and deepen international partnerships, H.B. 1 sends a damaging and counterproductive message,” they wrote.

As for the newly proposed 10-mile exclusion radius, the groups said, “no evidence has been presented that these sweeping geographic bans improve national security or public safety.”

After the amendment was introduced, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, pressed supporters to provide a map of the state showing what property is and isn’t excluded. The chair, state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, made no promises, but said she’d ask the sponsors if they have one.

Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.

“Obviously, it’s discriminatory, in my opinion, on its face,” he said of the bill.

“In my opinion, this particular bill will weaken Ohio’s economy and competitiveness, basically creating an environment that certain individuals or businesses from certain origins of the world are not welcome,” he said. “This bill would clearly create a potential for racial profiling and create a question of equal protection under the law.”

Clean Energy Regulator data shows the government agency expects 2.5GW of industry-scale renewable energy capacity to reach a final investment decision this year, down from 4GW last year. The 12-month average for investment commitments on new developments is at its lowest since early 2017.

While the share of electricity from renewable energy has increased to more than 40% after years of growth, experts have warned that the construction of solar and wind farms needs to accelerate substantially if the Albanese government is to meet a target of 82% of electricity coming from clean sources by 2030.

The regulator said there was “real potential” that much more could win financial backing next year, in part due to its expanded capacity investment scheme, an underwriting program for the solar, wind and batteries needed to replace ageing and dirty coal-fired power stations.

But the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”.

“The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said.

Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments.

“The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said.

Renewable energy that has previously had private financial signoff continues to be added to the grid. The Clean Energy Regulator said it anticipated nearly 7GW of large-scale generation and rooftop solar systems could be connected this year.

But the Climate Change Authority last week warned more would be needed if the government was to meet its targets. It said the pace of growth in large-scale renewable energy generation would need to more than double over the next five years.

Frankie Muskovic, executive director of policy for the Investment Group on Climate Change, said the reduced investment decisions this year were “a concerning trend” and needed to accelerate to meet renewable energy and climate targets. The latter includes a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 and at least a 62% cut by 2035, compared with 2005 levels.

She said some state planning changes and an ongoing review of the National Electricity Market could be causing uncertainty, but that large-scale renewable energy developments were often marginal investments and the underwriting program needed to offer more support for each project that received a contract.

Muskovic said the scheme should also run past its scheduled closure date of 2027. This would give investors greater confidence to back renewables projects, she said.

“Maybe we need more data to confirm if this is a blip, but everything we are hearing suggests this is not. We need to be ready and able to put more support into bolstering the [scheme],” she said. “We need to be shoulder to the wheel on this, and state governments need to be along for the ride.”

Giving an annual climate statement to parliament last week, the climate change minister Chris Bowen said the government had more than 16GW of renewable energy projects under contract or in negotiations through the capacity investment scheme so far, with up to 10 tender rounds remaining.

He said he expected about 11GW of capacity to have reached financial close by the end of 2026.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb353b80336d5be2f8d66ca112a27cf0a1d6b95/516_0_1213_971/master/1213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=384a3a480b2b3818baacd104e05e6324",N,,2025-12-01 12:02:45.773890

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Experts in energy, fuels, and emissions policy believe that unleashing American energy and pursuing decarbonization are not mutually exclusive objectives. These and related topics were the subject of a recent webinar by the Engine Technology Forum, ""Seeking Solutions for Sustainable Energy and Technology to Power a Resilient Economy"" which is now available to watch here.

After four years focused on decarbonization, there is now a realization that the aspirations of some past policy goals were out of sync with market realities and the desire to achieve greater energy security, both for the transportation and industrial sectors. At the same time, experts emphasized it is important that we make continued progress in achieving goals of cleaner air and greater energy security, along with access to affordable energy.

""Realizing the goals of both unleashing American energy and reducing emissions demands more advanced engines and renewable fuels, along with more electricity to power key sectors of the economy,"" said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Engine Technology Forum, the organizer of this session.

In his keynote presentation, Dr. Graham Conway, director at Pickering Energy Partners, outlined the framework of current U.S. policy and explained how the growing demand for electric power for artificial intelligence now dominates energy policy. He also compared global policies on electricity production and demand, highlighting the variable mix of power generation sources from coal to renewables across the globe, with a focus on the U.S.

As for transportation, progress toward achieving previously established national goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions was compared among the U.S., the European Union, and China. Over the next five years, there will likely be a continued need for policy measures that promote greener technologies, provide incentives for their adoption, and create carve-outs for sectors or circumstances that fall short of meeting these goals. The significance of life-cycle analysis as a true accounting of emissions was reviewed, and it was recognized that it should have a more central role in policymaking. Some analyses show that, over the life of a passenger vehicle, a hybrid vehicle using renewable fuels could achieve the same reduction in GHG emissions as a battery-electric vehicle, depending on the composition of electricity generating fuels from the grid.

Tammy Klein, founder and CEO of Transport Energy Strategies, reflected on the policy issues impacting fuel and technology choices in 2025. She expressed optimism about the EPA proposal for expanded renewable fuels volumes, while noting the challenges presented by other trade and tariff policies that affect fuel producers. She emphasized that consumers and energy prices are driving the national agenda today – a shift from the last four years. Overall, the U.S. is adding energy resources to meet increasing demand, decarbonizing where possible, and emphasizing true sustainability – a consideration of the social, environmental, and economic aspects of technology and fuels decisions. The ""all-of-the-above"" market-based approach best meets the demands of multiple use cases for various fuels and is preferred over a command-and-control approach, which in the past has established unachievable goals.

Dr. Ameya Joshi, founder of Mobility Notes, recognized the need for strong policies to drive technology development but also stressed the importance of incentives to encourage their adoption. He emphasized that reducing urban air pollution remains an equally important goal, one that is sometimes overshadowed by GHG policy. Dr. Joshi also noted that other countries are watching shifts in U.S. policy and considering how those changes will influence global emissions standards and overall decision-making.

""In one way or another, advanced engines and fuels are at the forefront of achieving the goals of economic prosperity, energy dominance, and lower emissions,"" noted Schaeffer. The panel concurred about the key role of internal combustion engines in the future and the need for continued progress in lowering emissions and improving efficiency.

It also said, “The exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns.” In a written reply in Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Environment, Kirti Vardhan Singh, said the letter dated September 12 requested the withdrawal of the office memorandum issued on September 8.

The memorandum exempted these mining projects from the requirement of public consultation under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.

The Minister said the communication from Tamil Nadu was examined in detail. The Environment Ministry informed the State Government that the exemption was issued under an already existing provision of the EIA Notification, Clause 7(III)(i)(f), which allows projects relating to national defence, security or other strategic considerations to be exempted from public consultation.

According to the reply, the Ministry clarified that the exemption was linked to the strategic importance of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals for India's energy transition, defence preparedness, space research and nuclear power programme.

It also stated that the exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns, which would continue to be addressed through the existing EIA mechanism, including an environment management plan, appraisal by an expert committee, and post-environmental clearance monitoring.

“The solar power ramps up and down with the sunlight,” says Josh Underberg, plant manager at Redfield Energy in Redfield, South Dakota.
Solar Support Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024.
“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.
“It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own.","As its 65-acre solar field hums along providing half of its power needs, Redfield Energy operates business as usual. The system, situated next to the plant, is seamless, with no flickers or interruptions.

“The solar power ramps up and down with the sunlight,” says Josh Underberg, plant manager at Redfield Energy in Redfield, South Dakota. “Nothing changes here, we don’t have any power flickers, we don’t have any issues whatsoever.”

The solar field, designed, installed, operated and maintained by All Energy Solar Inc., has been in service for about one year and is not the only upgrade Redfield implemented in the past two years. Installation of a Whitefox ICE Plus system has improved efficiency and is poised to boost production from 65 MMgy to at least 72 MMgy, says Eric Baukol, Redfield Energy CEO.

“From a company standpoint, we’re growing, and we certainly want to grow, but right now our focus is making our gallons that we have better from a CI standpoint more so than just expanding to expand,” Baukol says.

Solar Support

Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024. The capital investment amounted to about $20 million and installation took about one year, Baukol says.

The first six months showed some standard startup hiccups, but the second have shown the expected results. “So far, we have seen what we expected to see, which is a couple point reduction in our CI score by producing approximately half of our electricity,” Baukol says. “The investment was based off a model of a 2.2-point reduction in our CI score, and what we’re seeing in the second half of the year lines up with that expectation.”

“I’ve learned from others in the solar industry that you typically see some hiccups right away and then they run really well, and so far, that’s what we’ve seen,” Underberg says.

When Redfield committed to the investment, the 45Z Production Tax Credit had not yet been announced, but the benefits in cost savings and access to West Coast markets still incentivized the project.

“It was still a great option for our gallons that are heading west, California, Oregon, Washington,” Baukol says. “So if your gallons are spread that way, it’s a good investment.”

The solar array at Redfield operates on a pivoting system, east to west as the sun travels across the sky each day, according to Michael Thalhimer, director of business development for All Energy Solar, adding that not all solar fields have panels that pivot, but the option does “get more juice out of the lemon.”

All Energy Solar is focused on being an end-to-end solution provider, working in collaboration with customers for optimal success, Thalhimer says. “That’s what sets us up to be successful in this space—we are really collaborative. We tend to codevelop the project with the client instead of saying, ‘We’ll let you know when we need to come install this system on your acreage.’

“We support development, which is a big part of the timeline for these projects, typically much longer than the construction phase.”

While the process to get the project developed, up and running can be measured in years not months, the systems are designed to operate long-term, Thalhimer notes. “These are 30- to 40-year systems, so our capabilities don’t stop after the install.”

The project runway is several years, he says, so conversations need to start early. “It’s a thorough and long process to get these developed from initial discussions. It’s not plug and play. It requires design and engineering.”

All Energy handles operations and maintenance as well as warranty management and other elements of its clients’ projects, ideally without out-sourcing. “We are just now in the first year of supporting the Redfield project with operations and maintenance support, and we aim to stay connected with that project as long as they’ll have us,” he says.

“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.

Year-over-year energy price increases are now resembling a hockey stick, Thalhimer adds. “It is not a steady uptick anymore.” The ethanol industry is laden with high energy consumers, he says, with adjacent land available for solar fields.

“So we provide an alternative solution to providing power for the facility, big or small, and if all the stars align, you end up with the type of project we have with Redfield, where they are producing 10 megawatts of electricity for their facility every day.”

The long-term benefit of a solar field helps curtail those ever-increasing costs, he says. “The energy avoidance of delivered power from the grid is a really long tail benefit. That’s the part of this we’re really proud of—we’re not just giving a system that gets ripped up and replaced when there’s something different in the next four or five years. These are really tested and built to last and to be really multi-decade operating systems for the customers.

“That’s why we’re really suited for these projects, because we’re in it for the long haul.”

Solar Incentives

Thalhimer outlines two main financial incentives for investments in renewable energy such as solar fields. The first is the federal 48E Clean Electricity Investment tax credit. It’s measured as a percentage of the total project cost that the investor can receive back within the first year of the project being in service. For most industrial and commercial-scale renewable power projects as of late, this is 30% of the project cost, Thalhimer says.

“That is set up to be able to come directly back to the owner/investor of the project, based on the tax year the project is put in service,” he says.

Second is the depreciation of the asset. Right now, investments like this qualify for 100% bonus depreciation, which means they can get the full benefit of that particular incentive in the first year. In most cases, the depreciation value is quite similar to the investment tax credit—30%. “That means, together, 60-plus percent of the project cost can be returned within a year of that investment being made in full through two levers,” Thalhimer emphasizes.

“They really accelerate return on investment when almost two-thirds of that project investment comes back within that first year, before you’re even talking about the energy sales.”

Thalhimer notes that for ethanol producers, 45Z is the “extra icing on the cake,” potentially to the tune of a seven-figure credit.

“Solar is absolutely a qualifying investment to earn that credit, as long as you eclipse the necessary CI point improvements to qualify,” he says. “That is another huge potential credit to leverage in addition to the federal tax credit and the depreciation.”

But the policy landscape is changing, with new standards for 48E coming this year. A new set of restrictions prohibits materials from certain foreign entities. “That does affect our industry and supply chain globally because a lot of solar electric equipment has been manufactured for decades in the far east and that is one of the main areas coming under more scrutiny for imports,” Thalhimer says.

For those who have commenced their project close to or at construction phase, the prior set of rules and policy still fully applies. For those starting efforts in the shorter term, an investment by July 4, 2026 can safe harbor the tax credit.

“While we still have some time to leverage, the rules are changing and starting those conversations sooner will give you the most amount of time to fully develop a concept and see if we can execute it,” Thalhimer says.

Distillation Efficiency

In tandem with sourcing half of its power needs from an on-site solar field, Redfield is also reducing the energy required for operations, according to Gillian Harrison, CEO of Whitefox. The plant started up its new Whitefox ICE Plus membrane-based dehydration system in October 2025.

“So it’s that combination,” Harrison explains. “They’re shrinking their demand to start with in the production process by doing ICE Plus, and then they’re greening their energy source for the energy that they need.”

ICE Plus was developed as a stepping stone from ICE—adding Whitefox’s proprietary membrane dehydration solution to operate complementary to molecular sieves by taking regen and other streams from distillation—to ICE XL—a full replacement of all molecular sieves with membrane technology. ICE Plus leaves the molecular sieve infrastructure in place but operating at reduced capacity while the membranes work alongside them to debottleneck.

“So we’re effectively extending the lifetime by taking load off the sieves, but enabling them in the future to think about replacing those molecular sieves with membranes in a staged approach,” Harrison says. “You can add more membranes in a modular way rather than doing it all in one.”

The ICE systems are designed to increase efficiency and throughput with a CI score reduction. Baukol says the setup at Redfield aims to knock 3.5 points off of the plant’s CI score.

“They are getting used to a different way of running their plant quite quickly, which is brilliant, really,” Harrison says. “They have found the membrane piece relatively straight forward to run. I think they’re finding that easier than the molecular sieve. That’s a testament to their team and ours, and how our respective teams have worked together to do the training and get familiar with a different way of running their facility.”

Decarbonizing energy sources and reducing energy demand go hand-in-hand, she adds. “It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own. The combination works very well.”

Large projects like solar installations require a core of advocates in an organization to champion the changes, Thalhimer says. “This took a village,” he says of Redfield’s solar field. “This was not a quick yes.

“Redfield’s board really got behind this project as a smart, long-term initiative for them. This wasn’t a box-checker. This adds a lot of value to their organization.”

Since the passage of Act 12 of 2016, a statewide framework for utility sales, the state has seen even more local water systems acquired by private companies.
Because they’re not charging the cost of service.” Glass half-full Harrisburg lawmakers have sought to reform Act 12, but to no avail.
And now, as they revisit Act 12, lawmakers are expected to wade into the debate over repealing or reforming the statute.
While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.","Corporate mergers are nothing new; neither is the privatization of public utilities. But thanks to last month’s $40 billion merger announcement of American Water and Essential Utilities (also known as Aqua), the two largest municipal water and wastewater management companies in the U.S., Pennsylvanians are being confronted with what it means to be on the front lines of both trends – at the same time.

Municipalities across the commonwealth, already treading water financially while overseeing aging water and sewer systems, are now fertile ground for private-sector utility companies to acquire local systems in exchange for cash up front.

And while the details of the merger have yet to be determined, according to the press release, the move will allow both companies to “maintain an average customer water bill that is affordable (and support) the economic prosperity of the more than 2,000 communities in which the combined company will operate.”

Consumer advocates, on the other hand, worry what the merger will mean for ratepayers.

“We just don’t know the impact that this acquisition is going to have on utility rates yet, but I would say it doesn’t particularly bode well for consumers to have one mega-utility serving most of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Patrick Cicero, of counsel to the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project and a former state consumer advocate, told City & State.

Private eyes

Pennsylvania – one of 15 states to have enacted “fair market value” laws to boost the sale price of water systems, according to the National Association of Water Companies – was already known among water companies and their shareholders as being industry-friendly. Since the passage of Act 12 of 2016, a statewide framework for utility sales, the state has seen even more local water systems acquired by private companies.

According to the Public Utility Commission, 31 privatization cases have been filed since Act 12 took effect, with 25 acquisitions getting approval, three still pending, and three others either withdrawn, rejected or denied. Prior to Act 12’s passage, acquisitions of municipal utilities were relatively infrequent because systems were only allowed to be sold for their depreciated book value, which was not financially attractive to the utility companies and municipalities.

Act 12 mandates that the seller and prospective buyer each select an independent consultant from a group vetted by the state Public Utility Commission – the entity responsible for overseeing more than 150 water utilities statewide, most of which are privately owned.

Consultants for each side have six months to calculate an estimated value of the water system based on its infrastructure, anticipated revenue, and costs for maintenance and improvements necessary to maintain compliance with health and safety regulations.

The acquisition price is then determined by averaging the two estimates, unless the parties agree to a lower price, creating a pathway for higher figures than in deals prior to the passage of Act 12.

With Act 12, the standard deduction for grants and other subsidies used on the systems over the years has been eliminated. At the same time, the system assessments can include income, which wasn’t the case before.

Kimberly Barrow, vice chair of the PUC, said that prior to Act 12, the commission’s review of a potential acquisition was “pretty straightforward,” relying on depreciated original cost – the original cost of the assets minus the total accumulated depreciation – which, she said, is a “tenet of rate-making, historically.”

“Now, instead of looking at the original cost, we’re looking at two figures,” Barrow told City & State. “It’s going to be the negotiated purchase price or it’s going to be the fair market value – the lesser of those two things … That can be completely divorced from the original cost minus depreciation.”

The end result is higher numbers for acquisitions, meaning more cash for municipalities seeking to sell off their assets and address long-term budget and debt obligations. But with higher agreements of sale comes the need for increasing usage rates, which are ultimately paid by residents who rely on the utility.

“By allowing these kinds of valuations to be above original depreciated costs, it’s like (dangling) a carrot,” Barrow said. “It’s a way of getting the investor-owned utilities to actually want to buy them and put the money in.”

While acknowledging the importance of incentivizing prospective buyers to acquire failing or stressed municipal systems, Barrow said Act 12’s unintended consequences could result in rate spikes for low-income communities.

Industry advocates argue that the statute benefits both the municipalities and potential buyers by presenting a more accurate picture of the utility’s value. They say that the previous framework’s valuations resulted in a lower probability that potential buyers would achieve an adequate return on investment.

“For someone to suggest that purchase prices of acquisitions are the main driver of the costs associated with water and wastewater in Pennsylvania is not true,” Thom Chiomento, vice president of business development, government and external affairs at Pennsylvania American Water, told City & State.

Pennsylvania American Water filed a rate adjustment request with the PUC on Nov. 14, saying it will help fund over $1.2 billion in critical infrastructure upgrades through June 2027. The planned upgrades, according to the press release, include eliminating lead service lines by 2037 and replacing 117 miles of aging water mains and 32 miles of aging wastewater mains.

The proposed statewide rate increases would cost around $10 more per month for sewer, $14 more per month for water and $20 per month more for customers of both. If approved, it would be the second increase for the utility’s residential customers this year.

Chiomento added that the large-scale customer service, material procurement and capital a private company can provide are necessary in many municipalities whose water systems are running out of capital.

“It’s not cheap to run these systems and to invest in them and to get them to where they need to be from a compliance and an operational reliability perspective,” Chiomento told City & State. “So in order to do that, we have to invest dollars – and that is reflected in rates.”

Cicero, who pushed back against some water system acquisitions during his time as consumer advocate, argues that the statute “ties the hands” of the Public Utility Commission and leaves little wiggle room for debate over what he calls the “affirmative public benefit” that a sale is supposed to entail.

“We made a mistake with Act 12,” Cicero said. “All that it’s done is inflate the value of systems for these private companies.

“Even if (utility companies) are being magnanimous about going in and trying to make a system better, the rates are going to go up. And although they have modest rate assistance programs, they’re fundamentally inadequate to ensure affordability,” Cicero added, noting that since 2016, water bills – which have risen as much as 166% – have cost commonwealth ratepayers an additional $100 million a year.

Flood gates

Years of pushing infrastructure improvements and repairs down the line has led to many municipal or family-owned water systems developing regulatory and environmental problems, from leaks to chemical exposures that lead to boil-water advisories.

Pennsylvania received a “C-” grade on the 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers report card, with its wastewater management score at the bottom with a “D-.” According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey, Pennsylvania is projected to require a $24.3 billion investment over the next two decades to modernize and maintain its drinking water systems.

In some cases, private utility companies needed to step in via receivership to ensure that services continued in local systems, even before an acquisition process began. Companies like American Water or Essential can utilize their existing resources to support the system by providing necessary infrastructure investments.

“Their local governments didn’t have the resources to properly invest in those systems. There was mismanagement on top of that, and those people suffered,” Chiomento told City & State. “People in poor communities tend to suffer when their governments don’t have the ability to invest in them.”

And for many municipally operated systems, the years of neglect coincide with artificially depressed rates because politically unpopular rate increases were also put off.

The combination of these crumbling systems and the regulatory environment created by Act 12 has led to more privatization and, in turn, private investment in struggling systems. For example, Pennsylvania American Water has plans to acquire six different systems in 2025 alone.

“What we bring to the table is, no matter who our customers are or what communities they live in, they get the benefit of our ability to invest,” Chiomento said. “We’re investing in those communities because we’re not bound by their local government’s budget.”

A municipality “may want to simply not (hold on to) the water and wastewater business. They may have municipal debt that they want to retire. They have other needs they want to pursue – all of that makes abundant sense for municipalities,” Cicero said. “The question is whether or not it makes sense at all for the ratepayers of the acquiring utility to pay an excessive cost.”

Chiomento argued that the rate increases are just a sign of the times, pointing out the dire situations many systems are in and the artificially depressed rates municipalities have been charging utility customers over the years.

“When people talk about these big rate increases because of acquisitions, what they’re talking about is the price they were paying before,” he said.

“When we’re acquiring (a municipality’s) customers, rates typically are going up. Why are they in that situation to begin with? Because they’re not charging the cost of service.”

Glass half-full

Harrisburg lawmakers have sought to reform Act 12, but to no avail. Some legislative proposals, including ones to put guardrails on private acquisitions and to cap the acquisition amount at 125% of the depreciated original cost, have been considered in the Capitol and have support from those who say consumers shouldn’t bear the brunt of the infrastructure investments.

State Rep. Robert Matzie, who in 2023 introduced a legislative package during the previous legislative session aimed at reforming Act 12, said the results of the statute have “run far afield of that original intent.”

“(In) almost every instance to date, the municipalities or municipal authorities have exercised the provisions of the Act to sell healthy systems at amounts much greater than their current value,” Matzie said at the time in the co-sponsorship memo. “This has resulted in taxpayers and ratepayers being hit with exorbitant rate increases, with no discernible difference or improvement of service.”

Chiomento said industry stakeholders are “open to any modifications” to the statute, “as long as they improve the process, have a fair evaluation of these systems and they promote public input, transparency, and allow sufficient time for regulatory review.”

He also argued that the PUC – tasked with overseeing these deals and rate cases – exists to ensure that acquisitions like those by Pennsylvania American Water are prudent and reasonable.

Barrow agreed, stating that she’s not worried about “utilities consolidating,” as long as the PUC “is doing its job” and ensuring that customer service remains affordable.

Cicero argues that the PUC needs to do more to ensure rates are equitable across communities and that ratepayers aren’t taking on more of the financial burden than necessary post-acquisition.

“One of the main criticisms I have of the Public Utility Commission is they do not particularly hold utilities accountable on things like returns on equity, which seems problematic to me,” Cicero said, adding that “there has to be an affirmative public benefit” for an acquisition to be approved.

The future of both public and private utilities in the commonwealth will continue to revolve around how water systems can be maintained and invested in while keeping rates reasonable for those using the water services. And now, as they revisit Act 12, lawmakers are expected to wade into the debate over repealing or reforming the statute.

While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.

“There’s a need for something like Act 12, but there’s also a need for some control on it as well,” she said, adding that a cap on the acquisition amount is a possibility. “Some form of a cap (may be necessary) because at the end of the day, it’s ratepayer-supported funds that are being used to buy these systems.”

“It really is a balancing act, and Act 12 has the potential to help a lot of customers, like tens of thousands of customers throughout this commonwealth – it really does,” she told City & State. “We’re trying to do what we can (as the PUC), but we can’t change the act on our own.”",https://cdn.cityandstatepa.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/01/GettyImages_1216844681_Cwieders_headline/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 12:03:05.782632

The rules, issued just as Americans gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving, expand the loopholes that the EPA announced when it first suspended deadlines without any prior public notice or chance to comment.

Methane is a greenhouse gas 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over 20 years. These standards are a critical part of cutting the pollution causing climate change, as well as the volatile organic compounds that lead to smog and local air pollution.

The following is a comment from David Doniger, senior strategist at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“The EPA is giving the worst actors a free pass to pollute.

“Methane leaks are the dumbest kind of pollution because the industry is losing the very product it wants to sell. That’s what made the standards so cost effective: Checking for leaks means the industry has more gas to sell, which is why established companies started plugging their leaks before the EPA mandated it.

“But a few rogue actors refused to get on board, and the Trump administration is catering to them. Those companies get some short-term profits, but neighboring communities will see more smog, more cancer-causing pollutants, and more climate risks.

“Nuclear energy-related expenditures” were added to the latest revision of the government’s framework, published last week, which defines “green projects” eligible for financing. This means funds raised by issuing green gilts or green saving bonds from November 27 this year can be allocated to the development of the controversial technology, which enjoys mixed support among banks.

The move is likely to prove “controversial among environmentalists”, investment bank Jefferies said in a research note.

Historically, most multilateral development banks and other lenders have not included nuclear power generation in the energy projects they finance due to concerns regarding nuclear waste management, inexperience in financing such projects, or high investment costs.

However, the World Nuclear Association maintains that nuclear energy offers a “proven, reliable and low-carbon” solution that complements renewables and strengthens energy security.

At COP28 in 2023, several countries from Europe, the Middle East, the US and Asia endorsed the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy. Last year at the Climate Week NYC conference held in New York, 14 financial institutions, including Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, expressed support for calls to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050, according to the World Nuclear Association.

However, in a research note published in June, Washington DC think-tank the Atlantic Council argued that prolonged construction timelines and high capital costs for nuclear energy projects “may eventually deter” commercial banks from maintaining their support for the technology.

Attitudes towards the controversial technology also appear to be shifting in Europe. In November, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development told The Banker it is open to financing small modular nuclear projects if there is sufficient demand from countries.

Historically the EBRD only focused on nuclear safety and the decommissioning of former Soviet nuclear power plants. However, Odile Renaud-Basso said it is “actively monitoring” private sector demand for small nuclear or modular reactors, which are viewed as a safer and more cost-effective way of generating nuclear energy.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s board reversed a 60-year-old ban on financing nuclear power, opting instead for an “all of the above” approach to energy projects in poorer countries, including lending for natural gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, wind and nuclear power. The change in policy is said to have come after the US political administration applied pressure on the MDB to review its policies.

Announcing its re-entry into the nuclear energy financing space back in June, World Bank president Ajay Banga said “we must help countries deliver reliable, affordable power. That’s why we’re embracing nuclear energy as part of the solution — and re-embracing it as part of the mix the World Bank Group can offer developing countries to achieve their ambitions.”

While some EU countries have opposed the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU’s flagship green taxonomy, which defines activities considered to be environmentally sustainable, the economic bloc’s General Court recently dismissed a challenge by Austria against the inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the taxonomy.

The court action followed action taken by the European Commission in 2022 to include “certain activities” in the nuclear energy and gas sectors as contributing substantially to reducing the effects of climate change.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/9bd9e905-8850-4d4e-87ca-7ee0455d11d8.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:02:03.769150

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public EV charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time.

(P&GJ) — Clean Energy Fuels Corp. has begun injecting renewable natural gas (RNG) into the interstate pipeline from its newly completed South Fork Dairy facility in Dimmitt, Texas—one of the largest RNG projects in the country.

The $85 million facility, financed entirely by Clean Energy, processes manure from a herd of 17,500 dairy cows to produce about 2.6 million gallons of RNG annually. It uses four anaerobic digesters and advanced gas conversion systems to process up to 300,000 gallons of manure per day, generating pipeline-quality gas for direct injection.

“The requirements to reach production and injecting milestones were extremely stringent and we are incredibly proud of the team for getting our seventh RNG facility online, on time and on budget,” said Clay Corbus, senior vice president at Clean Energy. “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply to ensure we have the volumes needed to meet the growing fleet demand, but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

“Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us,” said Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy. “We’re processing our manure into useful bedding and producing clean, useful fuel for vehicles – it’s pretty amazing stuff.”

Construction of the facility was briefly interrupted by a fire at the dairy, but both the farm and RNG operations have since been rebuilt and are fully operational.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments for consideration by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) for the Request for Comments on the Section 301 Investigation of China’s Implementation of Commitments under the Phase One Agreement. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

China has failed to meet its commitments under the U.S.-China Phase One Agreement (POA).[1] This agreement sought to address long-standing U.S. concerns about China’s predatory practices by pairing existing tariffs with commitments from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, foreign investment, and currency practices. It also included a two-year, $200 billion purchase pledge.[2] This filing shows that China failed to meet its commitments across all of these aspects.

China is not a reliable trade partner, as potential commitments to reverse its predatory practices are antithetical to its long-term techno-economic project. This filing first provides evidence of ITIF’s work on Chinese non-market practices by detailing a 2021 ITIF report on China’s failure to meet its commitments under its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Then, it succinctly shows ITIF’s work assessing China’s global power project and its playbook of predatory, non-market practices to achieve it. This section concludes with examples of how this project gets translated into building critical sectors and boosting Chinese companies and industries.

The following section details how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments and summarizes ITIF’s recent work on China’s economic espionage and its role in facilitating the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

Finally, the document concludes with recommendations to USTR. First, the current Section 301 investigation will allow the U.S. government to impose tariffs on Chinese manufacturers that continue to benefit from innovation mercantilist practices. Second, ITIF proposes using Section 301 authorities to impose import controls on goods from Entity List companies, exclude IP-infringing companies from the U.S. market, and impose “immediate reciprocity” in sectors where mercantilist practices forcefully limit the U.S. presence in the Chinese market.

Overview: China Is Not a Reliable Partner and It Does Not Intend to Change Its Nonmarket Approach

The Chinese government has a long record of broken promises, promoting nominally fair policies while aggressively imposing nonmarket interventions to support its local industries. The list of deceptive promises and statements is long. For example, in September 2015, in Seattle, Washington, Xi Jinping stated that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”[3] In July 2018, the PRC’s State Council released a statement indicating that “China has never had a policy of forcing technology transfers from foreign companies.”[4] Most recently, in April 2025, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China would protect the “legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with the law, and actively promote the resolution of foreign-funded enterprises.”[5] These promises are misleading because they commit to doing things (i.e., implementing market-based policies) that are antithetical to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) project. Indeed, China has clearly failed to fulfill the commitments it made to peer nations as a condition for joining the WTO, especially the promise to manage its trade and economic activities in line with the core WTO principles of national treatment, non-discrimination, and reciprocity.

China’s State-Led Economic Model Stands at Odds With Market Economy Principles

China’s economic success represents a tale of mercantilism and state-driven non-market interventions (including subsidizing overproduction, stealing IP, and forcing technology transfer or foreign direct investment from companies) on the one hand, and complacency and naivety from Western policymakers on the other hand. ITIF’s 2021 report “False Promises II: The Continuing Gap Between China’s WTO Commitments and Its Practices” enumerated 12 high-level examples of how China has systematically and consistently failed to meet its WTO commitments:[6]

▪ Rejecting the WTO’s market orientation. China has never truly embraced the WTO’s core premise of open, market-oriented policies guided by commercial, rather than political, considerations. Instead, Beijing operates a “China Inc.” system in which the party-state routinely intervenes to steer outcomes, undercutting the basic assumption that market forces drive competition.

▪ Defying WTO norms through state-led industrial planning. China’s industrial strategies—exemplified by “Made in China 2025” and a lattice of sectoral plans—explicitly seek absolute advantage in advanced industries by displacing foreign firms at home and expanding Chinese firms’ global market share abroad. These state-directed schemes violate the spirit of WTO rules, which presume that governments will not use industrial planning to rig competitive outcomes in favor of domestic champions.

▪ Continuing prevalence of and preferences for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Contrary to its commitments, China has not reduced the role of state-owned enterprises or ensured that they operate on a purely commercial basis. SOEs continue to receive privileged financing, regulatory forbearance, and preferential access to public procurement and key inputs, distorting competition in both China’s domestic market and global markets.

▪ Massively subsidizing its industries, often leading to overcapacity. Beijing deploys extensive, often opaque subsidies—grants, tax breaks, cheap land, and below-market finance—to accelerate capacity growth in targeted sectors such as steel, aluminum, solar, shipbuilding, autos, semiconductors, and many other sectors. The result is chronic overcapacity that depresses global prices, displaces more efficient producers in market economies, and undermines the WTO’s goal of fair, rules-based competition.

▪ Failing to make timely and transparent notifications of subsidies. China has systematically failed to provide full, timely, and accurate notifications of its subsidy programs, despite clear obligations to do so under WTO rules. This lack of transparency makes it exceedingly difficult for other members to assess the scale and impact of China’s support measures or to challenge them effectively through WTO processes.

▪ Forcing technology transfer and joint venture requirements. Beijing continues to use a mix of formal and informal tools—joint-venture requirements, equity caps, licensing demands, administrative reviews, and regulatory approvals—to coerce foreign firms into transferring technology as the price of market access. These practices violate both the letter and spirit of China’s WTO commitments to refrain from conditioning investment or trade on technology transfer requirements.

▪ Failing to respect foreign IP rights. While China has improved its IP laws on paper, enforcement remains weak, selective, and often politicized, leaving foreign firms exposed to theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights. Persistent large-scale IP infringement and limited effective remedies demonstrate that China has not delivered on its obligation to provide robust, non-discriminatory protection for foreign IP.

▪ Abusing antitrust rules. Chinese competition authorities have frequently wielded antitrust law as an industrial-policy tool, targeting foreign firms for investigations, remedies, and fines that appear designed to force technology transfer, lower royalty rates, or advantage domestic rivals. Rather than applying competition rules on a neutral basis, China often uses them to pursue strategic industrial goals inconsistent with WTO expectations.

▪ Imposing discriminatory technology standards. China’s standards system remains heavily state-managed and is frequently used to advance domestic technologies and firms at the expense of foreign competitors. Standards are often developed in closed processes, embed design choices that favor Chinese products, and can be tied to mandatory certification schemes, contravening WTO principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and open participation.

▪ Closing its government procurement to foreign actors. Despite longstanding commitments, China has neither acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement nor provided equivalent market access to foreign competitors. Chinese authorities continue to favor domestic firms—especially SOEs��in procurement decisions, using public purchasing as another lever to bolster national champions and restrict reciprocal opportunities for foreign companies.

▪ Continuing use of service-market access restrictions. China maintains extensive barriers to foreign participation in key service sectors—including finance, telecommunications, cloud computing, audiovisual services, and digital platforms—through equity caps, licensing hurdles, and other entry restrictions. These measures fall far short of the openness implied by China’s WTO commitments and deny foreign providers meaningful, non-discriminatory access.

▪ Using retaliatory trade remedies. Beijing has repeatedly used antidumping, countervailing duty, and other trade-remedy investigations in ways that appear retaliatory rather than grounded in objective economic analysis. Such actions are aimed at pressuring trading partners and deterring legitimate complaints about Chinese practices, further eroding confidence in the WTO’s rules-based system.

China’s Development Playbook Is at Odds With What It Committed to Under the Phase One Agreement

ITIF’s November 2025 report “Marshaling National Power Industries to Preserve America’s Strength and Thwart China’s Bid for Global Dominance,” among other topics, outlines China’s strategy for techno-economic dominance.[7] The PRC is executing a coordinated, state-directed campaign across “national power industries”—advanced, traded sectors that underpin military strength and geostrategic leverage—to attempt to attain hegemony over Western democracies. This scheme is inseparable from a durable, non-market playbook built around heavy subsidization and systematic distortion of competition. China follows a predictable strategy across industries: attract foreign investment, coerce tech transfer and steal foreign IP, provide massive subsidies, close domestic markets, and then capture global market share.[8]

The report succinctly outlines the Chinese Communist Party’s playbook:

The first step is to attract foreign investment. (...) China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries, seeking, for example, to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China. China’s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. (...) The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. (...) The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators. (...) The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms. We have seen this an array of industries, including chemicals, telecom equipment, heavy construction equipment, high-speed rail, and renewable energy.[9]

In addition, the CCP integrates technological security into the PRC’s broader national security framework, blurring the line between economic and military statecraft. ITIF’s February 2025 report, “A Policymaker’s Guide to China’s Technology Security Strategy,” describes China’s three-tiered approach to achieve technology security.[10] First, China aims to preserve and fortify its existing competitive advantages, using industrial upgrading, its dense supply chains, and non-market interventions to lock-in global leadership in advanced manufacturing sectors such as electronics, solar, and electric vehicle (EV) batteries Secondly, the PRC is focused on rapidly closing critical technology gaps, especially in chokepoint inputs such as semiconductors, by pouring state resources into import substitution and self-reliance. Third, the Chinese government uses unrestricted access to large pools of data from its population to achieve dominance in emerging technologies, such as AI and other frontier technologies, to shape global standards and outpace competitors over the long term.[11]

How the PRC Uses Non-Market Policies to Gain an Advantage in Strategic Sectors

ITIF’s work since 2020, the year of the POA’s signing, has accumulated substantial evidence of China’s non-market approach to gain an advantage in strategic industries—at the detriment of U.S. and Western companies.

China Supports Its EV Producers to Underprice Competitors in Global Markets

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “Don’t Let Chinese EV Makers Manufacture in the United States,” shows China’s aggressive use of a range of mercantilist practices to advance in the EV market.[12] These non-market interventions include:

▪ Subsidies, totaling over $230 billion between 2009 and 2023, with an estimated $120 billion across 2021–2023 alone.

▪ Forced technology transfer and IP theft. For example, GM’s Volt model could qualify for subsidies only if the company was willing to “transfer the engineering secrets for one of the Volt’s three main technologies to a joint venture in China with a Chinese automaker.”[13] Other examples include forcing the hiring of Chinese engineers to establish a Ford research and development (R&D) facility in China, and Tesla suing a Chinese chip designer for infringing on its IP and stealing its trade secrets, both related to the integrated circuits it uses in its vehicles.[14]

▪ Favoring domestic companies. For example, Made in China 2025 included a local market share target for local producers, and most recently, local authorities have instructed Chinese automakers to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible.[15]

China Is Supporting the Overproduction of Polysilicon to Secure Global Dominance

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “China Plans to Dominate a Key Semiconductor Material,” describes the mechanisms by which the PRC’s government incentives, support, and massive overcapacity are flooding the global polysilicon market—a critical chipmaking material.[16] China’s interventions include financial subsidies and incentives, infrastructure and land support, and strategic national plans. China supports polysilicon overproduction and simultaneously helps producers offset the low prices it drives.[17]

The artificial decline in global prices created by the Chinese government’s intervention undermines the viability of U.S. polysilicon producers. While some estimates set the fair market price for polysilicon at $24/kg, Chinese firms are selling at approximately $5/kg, about $1 below their production cost.[18] This dumping cost Chinese producers $40 billion in 2024. This directly impacts U.S. producers. For example, Wolfspeed—a silicon carbide producer headquartered in North Carolina—closed two facilities in the United States in 2024 and postponed an expansion in Germany.

China Helped Huawei to Subsist Despite U.S. Sanctions

ITIF’s October 2025 report, “Backfire: Export Controls Helped Huawei and Hurt U.S. Firms,” describes how Huawei received support from the Chinese government to offset the export controls the United States imposed on the company since 2019.[19] Before these restrictions, Huawei had already received $75 billion in state support since its establishment. After the export controls, the Chinese government’s support for the company was manifested in three main ways:

▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls, such as the $15 billion acquisition of Honor, a budget-brand maker and former Huawei subsidiary, by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. This sale provided liquidity to Huawei and helped Honor avoid U.S. export controls.

▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, for example, the 2021 announcement that the Chinese state-owned China Mobile would acquire 60 percent of 5G network station contracts from Huawei.

▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives, such as receiving an R&D tax incentive for semiconductors, which acts as a de facto subsidy by allowing a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. (Tax incentives are appropriate tools to facilitate semiconductor-industry competitiveness, but they should be made available equally to any foreign company competing in a country’s marketplace; yet, the subsidies extended to Huawei and other Chinese national champions were unique and exclusive.)

China Confers an Unfair Advantage to Its E-commerce Platforms

China has expanded globally through its international-facing e-commerce platforms, especially Temu, SHEIN, AliExpress, and TikTok Shop. As documented in ITIF’s April 2025 report “How China’s State-Backed E-Commerce Platforms Threaten American Consumers and U.S. Technology Leadership,” China’s government uses a coordinated industrial policy architecture to benefit these platforms through subsidized logistics, tax exemptions, talent recruitment programs, and state-directed financing through cross-border e-commerce pilot zones.[20] These industrial policies are not widely available to foreign competitors and sharply reduce Chinese platforms’ marginal costs of shipping, warehousing, marketing, and customer acquisition. China also deploys regulatory shields that suppress compliance obligations at home, enabling its national champions to achieve lower operating costs than any U.S. or allied-market platform could legally achieve.

These state-backed cost advantages translate into aggressive, predatory penetration of the U.S. market at prices that no market-based firm can realistically match. China’s industrial policy, which aims (as in many other industries) to gain global market share in e-commerce, also pushes its platforms to exploit gaps in U.S. regulations to reduce costs relative to domestic competitors. This raises consumer protection concerns by externalizing product-safety, data-security, and compliance risks onto American consumers, as seen with Temu’s September 2025 penalty for violating the INFORM Consumers Act.[21]

China Failed to Meet Its Commitments Under the Phase One Agreement

The POA included essential commitments by the PRC, as well as provisions related to IP, technology transfer, foreign investment and acquisitions, and currency.[22] The Chinese government has failed to fulfill any of these commitments. This section will outline how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States and present further evidence of the PRC’s tolerance for IP infringement. While the previous section explained how the PRC permits technology transfer and manipulates foreign investments to benefit its EV companies, this section will provide further examples of forced technology transfer. Finally, regarding China’s currency commitments, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has consistently reported that “China provides very limited transparency regarding key features of its exchange rate mechanism, including the policy objectives of its exchange rate management regime and its activities in the offshore RMB market.”[23]

China Failed to Meet Its Purchasing Commitments

China agreed to purchase at least $200 billion worth of goods above a 2017 sectoral baseline across 2020 and 2021, but it only procured a fraction of that amount.[24] The purchasing commitments implied that China should have purchased $32 billion more in agricultural products, $52.4 billion in energy, $77.7 billion in manufactured goods, and $37.9 billion more in services.[25] However, China failed to meet its own purchasing commitments. By 2020, it had already fallen short of this commitment by 40 percent, and by 2021, it had met only 58 percent of the overall target.[26]

Figure 1 shows U.S. exports to China based on the POA purchasing commitments by sector. China focused on expanding its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, but reached only 83 percent of the agreed amount. Additionally, U.S. exports to China declined by 6 percent during 2020–2021 for goods not covered under the POA.

China Continues to Infringe Upon American Intellectual Property

The PRC’s commitments regarding improving IP protection mechanisms include reforming internal mechanisms to address the U.S. government’s concerns regarding trade secrets, pharmaceutical-related IP, geographical indications, trademarks, and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods.[28] However, the PRC’s attempts to steal U.S. technologies persist unabated. In addition to the cases of IP infringement in EV markets described in the previous section, USTR has consistently reported China’s lack of IP enforcement, including Chinese companies and markets in the Notorious Markets List report, classifying China as part of the Priority Watch List in its 2025 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement, and describing China’s predatory, non-market practices in its annual Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance.[29]

China’s IP protection system still lacks transparency and fair treatment for foreign actors in courts. It is inherently difficult to quantify potential bias against foreign-owned firms in China’s IP system due to limited transparency and weak accountability—in many cases, the quality and performance of China’s IP-related institutions cannot be independently verified.[30] China’s refusal to publish a complete record of relevant cases appears intended to impede independent analysis and monitoring of its implementation of IP-related commitments, including those under the POA and other bilateral and multilateral accords.[31]

China treats IP protection as a tool to advance its techno-economic objectives. For example, global anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) in China—which uniquely target foreign companies—help local companies to reduce the cost of foreign technology and patents in support of its industrial policy goals.[32] These ASIs aim to bar foreign courts from hearing disputes that could affect a Chinese court’s ability to set a global licensing rate for patented technologies. In many instances, they have been issued without notice to the affected party and without a subsequent publication, exacerbating already serious transparency concerns—and the Chinese law provides no effective mechanisms to challenge the courts’ assertion of jurisdiction.[33]

In addition, there exists a long history of inequitable patent-granting practices between domestic and foreign filers in China, and allegations that official data is biased because it omits unpublished cases.[34] While, on the surface, Chinese and foreign patent litigants in China have, on average, a similar win rate in court, there are clear differences in win rates regarding strategic technologies. For instance, between 2015 and 2019, foreign pharmaceutical patentees prevailed in only 36 percent of China Patent Reexamination Board (PRB) validity challenges, compared with 59 percent for Chinese applicants.[35] Similar gaps appear across other technology fields, including biotechnology (21 percent for foreign versus 48 percent for Chinese applicants) and environmental technologies (25 percent versus 40 percent, respectively).[36]

In addition to outlining existing evidence, this sub-section presents ITIF’s work on China’s economic espionage and on how Chinese digital platforms facilitate the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

China Deploys Economic Espionage Campaigns Against the United States

In November 2025, ITIF’s report “From Outside Assaults to Insider Threats: Chinese Economic Espionage” outlined China’s campaign of economic espionage against the United States and American companies.[37] The report describes how China’s espionage ecosystem—from state intelligence agencies to nominally private firms—coordinated to steal U.S. industrial and defense technologies. This study highlights how Chinese companies (and academic researchers) operating in the United States serve as knowledge-collection platforms and how China turns engineers and researchers within U.S. firms into conduits for trade secrets.

Chinese actors have used a variety of methods to steal information from American companies.[38] As the report explains, “several Chinese economic espionage cases have involved the persistent penetrations of U.S. companies, rather than individuals’ illegally facilitated changes in career, which are uniquely damaging. They provide opportunities for PRC entities to remain current on developments within the U.S. industry rather than simply acquire increasingly stale stolen material.”[39] Another mechanism used by Chinese actors includes “breaking and entering” techniques, such as China’s use of academic institutions as cover for intelligence activities; active campaigns to hire individuals working for U.S. companies to transfer information from their private sector employers to Chinese entities; and using U.S.-based organizations to recruit expertise from which it then siphons trade secrets and other protected information.[40]

China Facilitates the Flow of Counterfeits Into the United States

As detailed in ITIF’s August 2025 report “How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits,” Chinese e-commerce platforms are a primary vector for counterfeit, unsafe, and IP-infringing goods entering the United States.[41] These platforms’ business models—and the industrial policy environment they operate in—fail to effectively enforce counterfeit sales by not adequately identifying and suspending probable counterfeits, allowing them to remain listed and accumulate significant sales. Coupled with China’s reluctance to pursue enforcement against counterfeiters serving foreign markets, this has created a pipeline through which counterfeit cosmetics, apparel, pharmaceuticals, and children’s products enter the United States at scale.[42]

This means that U.S. and other rights holders face widespread infringement with almost no recourse, while U.S. consumers are exposed to serious product safety hazards.[43] China’s government has failed to implement the Phase One IP commitments it made on enforcement against counterfeit goods, namely to “take effective action against e-commerce platforms that fail to take necessary measures against infringement” and to “significantly increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety risks.”[44]

China Continues to Force Technology Transfer on Foreign Investors

The POA did not change the direction or intention of the Chinese government’s treatment of foreign investors, as forced technology transfer remains a common practice in advanced industries investing in the Chinese market. USTR’s report “Four-Year Review of China Tech Transfer Section 301” already provides exhaustive evidence that Chinese forced technology transfer and pressures to force joint ventures with local companies persist after signing the POA.[45] This has also been reported by ITIF—in addition with the cases of technology transfer in the EV sector aforementioned.

For example, a 2022 ITIF testimony to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission documented how China requires cloud-computing operations to be locally controlled.[46] As a result, providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft must operate through Chinese partners, sell services under the Chinese partner’s brand, and share technology and operational know-how as part of these arrangements.[47] By contrast, Chinese cloud providers such as Aliyun—the cloud-services arm of Alibaba—are free to establish data centers in the United States without facing comparable ownership or technology-transfer requirements.

Policy Recommendations

ITIF will soon be releasing a major report that details a comprehensive policy response to China’s ongoing innovation mercantilisma and efforts to expand its global presenence in national power industries. Here, ITIF offers several policy recommendations pertinent to addresing China’s non-compliance with the POA.

The U.S. government should expand its authority to impose Section 301-related tariffs on Chinese goods that continue to benefit from the use of innovation mercantilist practices. USTR already has broad authority, under the ongoing Section 301 action on China’s technology-transfer and IP practices, to maintain and modify tariffs in response to China’s continued non-market behavior.[48] The current Section 301 investigation into China’s commitments under the POA would allow the U.S. government to impose a broader set of tariffs, including all the manufacturing products that are detailed in the agreement’s purchasing commitments. The scope of the current investigation should allow expanding the authority to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports beneffiting from unfair trade practices—which would be critical to improving the U.S. government’s negotiating position for future revisions to the trade deal with China.

Regarding controls on imports of Chinese goods benefitting from unfair trade practices, the U.S. government should seek to expand its authority through executive and Congressional action to:

▪ Ban importing goods from Chinese companies on the Entity List. Today, it is possible to purchase goods from the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei via resellers, including telecommunication equipment for private use, despite the company being listed in the Entity List since 2019. The presence of a company on the Entity List reflects the U.S. government’s view that it has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, and exporting goods or technologies to the company is restricted. USTR should close this loophole and fully ban these companies from the U.S. market.

▪ Ban all imports and U.S. presence of companies that have been involved in systematic or deliberate theft of American IP. While legislative action is needed to strengthen Section 337 of the Tariff Act—so the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) can more systematically exclude imports from China that benefit from unfair practices, including IP theft and other innovation mercantilist tools—the U.S. government already has other levers it can use against offending firms, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases that raise tariffs on unfairly traded goods and, in appropriate circumstances, financial sanctions administered by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that can cut off access to U.S. dollar transactions. Where warranted, he U.S. government should explore using Section 301 authorities to impose broader import restrictions.

▪ Collaborate with like-minded allied nations to craft “a bill of particulars” that comprehensively enumerates China’s unfair trade practices impacting especially allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.[49]

▪ Expand efforts to forge a “Seven Eyes”-like alliance among key allies to exchange information about China’s industrial espionage activities impacting allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.

▪ Work with allied countries to have them implement Section 337-like legislation that would likewise permit them to wholesale block imports from Chinese companies that consistently use unfair trade practices.

▪ Use Section 301 authorities to enforce “immediate reciprocity.” USTR should consider using the 301 import control powers to address Chinese sectors that restrict or limit access for foreign competitors. A clear example of this is digital platforms for social media, where U.S. companies are barred from entering the Chinese market. If there are clear instances where U.S. firms are being wholesale blocked from competing in China’s market, then the United States should impose the same conditions on Chinese firms that would compete in the U.S. market.

▪ Utilize existing Treasury Department authorities to sanction Chinese companies benefitting from stolen IP or coerced technology transfer. Chinese firms that are stealing IP should be banned from accessing the U.S. banking and financial system.[50]

Additional policy measures for consideration.

▪ Ramp up efforts to limit Chinese cyber-IP theft and espionage. More needs to be done to limit Chinese IP theft. The next administration should work with Congress to pass legislation increasing criminal penalties for such actions. Its next budget should include a sizeable increase for the FBI’s Office of Commercial Counterintelligence.[51]

▪ Increase federal efforts to disrupt the global flow of counterfeits. Chinese counterfeit goods jeopardize U.S. consumer safety, erode public confidence, reduce U.S. jobs, and unfairly support Chinese economic growth. The government unfortunately struggles to stop many counterfeit shipments. To address this problem, the next administration should increase the Customs and Border Protection budget and appoint a director who will collaborate with private-sector stakeholders, including brand sellers, online marketplaces, and shippers, to establish real-time information sharing and analytics about potential counterfeit shipments that would allow them to better detect and seize more imported counterfeits.

▪ Increase criminal penalties for techno-economic espionage committed against U.S. firms. For too long, economic espionage has been treated as simply a commercial crime as opposed to a national security crime. With China laser focused on stealing as much core advanced technology information and knowledge as possible from the United States in order to gain global leadership and use in its civil-military fusion, it’s time for that to end.[52]

▪ Better prosecute trade crime, especially transshipment and misclassification. Chinese companies are masters at getting around trade rules, including exporting products to a country for transshipment to the United States as a way to circumvent U.S. tariffs. Often the amount of value added contributed in the third country is de minimis. Yet, this is seldom prosecuted. Congress should pass and fully fund the Protecting American Industry and International Trade Crimes Act that, among other elements, expands DOJ resources to prosecute trade crime.[53]

▪ Assess the impact of foreign unfair trade practices, especially China’s, on the long-term health of the U.S. industrial base. China’s mercantilist trade practices have contributed substantially to a hollowing out of the U.S. manufacturing base, including the U.S. defense industrial base. For this reason, ITIF supports the “America First Trade Policy’s” call for the secretaries of Commerce and Defense to “conduct a full economic and security review of the United States’ industrial and manufacturing base to assess whether it is necessary to initiate investigations to adjust imports that threaten the national security of the United States.”[54]

In a marketplace where range is one of the most significant factors influencing consumers, battery health is a major concern.

The battery is the single most valuable component in the vehicle, often representing 30-40% of the total manufacturing cost. That makes its long-term health an important part of the ownership equation. Where internal-combustion components tend to degrade gradually and predictably, lithium-ion cells follow chemical aging pathways that are heavily influenced by a myriad of variables. Considerations like charging habits, thermal exposure, cell chemistry, and vehicle-level energy management all influence cell capacity retention, and, therefore, car value.

High-voltage fast charging, for example, exposes cells to elevated temperatures and higher current densities, which can cause wear in some chemistries. Conversely, vehicles with conservative charging algorithms and liquid cooling tend to preserve capacity far more effectively over time.

User behavior and environment also impact cell life. That’s why two vehicles with the same odometer reading can have dramatically different states of health. A pack that has spent years in a mild climate, routinely charged between 20% and 80%, will age very differently from one that is repeatedly fast-charged to 100% in extreme heat or cold.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt85bc1d52d5beda31/674fc18c351f9a3c9ba42086/22478_2025_Niro_EV.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:11.134787

Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Director of Industry Insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new US car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want electric vehicles, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla Inc. still dominates the US market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors Co., in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the US with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

Emily Almaer, a mother of three in Boulder, Colo, is paying $250 a month for the Volkswagen ID.4 she picked up in August. At least three of her friends also recently ponied up for EVs: another Volkswagen, a Nissan Leaf and a Hyundai Ioniq 9.

“You look at some of these [monthly payments],” her husband, Dion Almaer, said, “and it’s like ‘Wait, this is like one family meal out.’”

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

Meanwhile, the market for used EVs is booming and more affordable EV models are heading to production. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

Volvo Car AB Chief Executive Officer and President Hakan Samuelsson said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

“The industry will be electric — there’s no turning back,” he told Bloomberg recently. “It may take a bit longer in some regions, but the direction is clear.”

U.S. Department of Agriculture (2025), Documentation of literature, data, and modeling analysis to support the treatment of CSA practices that reduce agricultural soil carbon dioxide emissions and increase carbon storage, Off.","Since the first agricultural revolution, circa 10,000 BCE, humanity has adapted its farming practices to meet climatic variation. The genesis of early farming is even thought to have resulted from a shift in seasonal conditions that favored regular planting and harvesting intervals after the last ice age.

In the modern era, the necessity to adapt has led to expansive land use, fertilization, irrigation, and other agricultural routines—powered primarily by combusted carbon and freshwater extractions—to suit local environmental conditions and meet demands of growing populations. These practices have been a boon to food supplies, but they have also contributed to many of today’s climatic and environmental challenges.

Recognition of global crises with respect to climate change and biodiversity has motivated landmark international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework. The Paris Agreement legally binds participating nations to implement land use methods that mitigate emissions and actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.

One such set of modified land management practices, known collectively as climate-smart agriculture [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025], is lauded as a pragmatic, low-barrier pathway to manage climate change through nature-based atmospheric carbon removal and avoided emissions (related to both land use and livestock). However, these practices have primarily been studied in small, controlled experiments, not at the extent needed to verify their effectiveness—and help motivate their adoption—on a large scale.

Recently, soil carbon experts explored the utility of applying causal approaches to quantify soil carbon accrual and avoided emissions from large-scale land management interventions and to address concerns and uncertainties that are slowing their uptake [Bradford et al., 2025a]. Such approaches have long been applied in other contexts to measure and verify treatment efficacy. In particular, methods in medical science for studying vaccine efficacy broadly offer important insights for assessing climate-smart applications.

Accounting for Carbon

Climate-smart agriculture includes a variety of management practices such as cover cropping (planting noncash crops on otherwise fallow land), reducing or eliminating soil tilling, and diversifying crops. These applications can offer various cobenefits, including increased yields; greater soil water holding capacity; improved soil microbiomes; reduced erosion and runoff; enhanced control of pests, disease, and weeds; and greater soil nutrient availability that reduces the need for chemical fertilizers [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Such benefits are linked to the idea that the applications either avoid losses or improve gains in soil organic matter. But can we measure how much they really help?

To account for carbon lost, gained, or stored in agricultural land, soil organic matter is typically measured by elemental analysis of soil samples in a laboratory. Amounts of carbon stored are determined by tracking changes in soil carbon stocks over time. Comparing results following the application of climate-smart agriculture approaches with those following business-as-usual practices provides a measure of the approaches’ effectiveness for carbon management.

Assuming this carbon accounting reveals increased soil carbon stocks, agricultural projects implementing these approaches can be considered natural climate solutions, which are valued in the voluntary carbon market for their carbon offset and removal power. For example, one project developer selling carbon credits since 2022 recently reported that their efforts have so far stored nearly 1 million tons of soil carbon in U.S. farmlands. Further, across farms in four U.S. states, the combined use of three climate-smart agriculture techniques—no tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation of corn and soybeans—is claimed to have resulted in a shift to carbon gains from soil carbon loss using conventional practices [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Limited Evidence, Low Adoption

Despite claims about the successes of climate-smart agricultural practices, adoption remains low. Although no-till and reduced-till methods have been implemented on more than half of all U.S. soybean, corn, and sorghum fields, cover cropping is used across less than 5% of the country’s agricultural lands.

A multitude of social, cultural, and economic factors—along with questions about the viability for meaningful climate change mitigation—contribute to the limited adoption of some climate-smart practices [Prokopy et al., 2019; Eagle et al., 2022]. However, if robust data showing that they lead to widespread yield increases, cost reductions, and climate benefits were available, they might be more widely adopted by growers.

Presently, most evidence supporting the benefits of climate-smart agriculture for carbon management relies on a limited set of small-plot experimental trials and projected outcomes derived from applying process-based biogeochemical models. Public and private investment in studies aimed at quantifying the practices’ efficacy through measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) at scales of real-world commercial agriculture has been inhibited by the assumption that soils vary too much to measure treatment effects feasibly [Poeplau et al., 2022].

This assumption is driven by the fact that regional and national soil carbon inventories reveal substantial variation in soil carbon contents at scales within individual fields (meters to tens of meters) and between fields (kilometers to tens of kilometers)—variation that is thought to preclude detections of how agricultural practices affect carbon stocks [Bradford et al., 2023]. Yet this variability can be overcome by scaling up field-level data to multifield scales focused on understanding the average effect of interventions.

What could this scaling look like, and what cues from other fields can we use to make progress?

Adapting Methods from Medical Research

Causal approaches are used regularly in health sciences, including in vaccine trials. In later-stage trials, vaccine efficacy is quantified under conditions approximating real-world delivery by measuring the differences in the health responses of people who receive the vaccine and those who do not.

Importantly, such real-world trials occur only after there is enough experimental evidence—typically from controlled laboratory experiments and small-scale clinical trials—of underlying mechanisms indicating the likelihood of broad, meaningful positive effects and minimal negative effects of the vaccine. Public health scientists use these large-scale clinical intervention-style experiments (or observational studies) to account for factors such as varied exposure risks and preexisting conditions that can modify real-world vaccine efficacy compared with efficacy under controlled conditions.

Earth scientists can take direction from such trials. Adapting this experiment structure for soil science research would allow project developers, scientists, land managers, and policymakers to assess the ability of climate-smart agricultural practices to store carbon and reduce emissions across real fields and farms. It would also better inform meaningful climate action policy initiatives.

A base of highly controlled small-scale experiments—typically conducted in plots operated by researchers—already exists that suggests the carbon benefits of improved agricultural practices under highly controlled conditions. What is missing are the large-scale intervention studies sampling soil carbon in fields that receive a climate-smart treatment (e.g., no till or reduced till, crop rotation, cover cropping) versus those that are conventionally managed [Bradford et al., 2025b].

Such studies must be undertaken with appropriate design principles to confirm whether treatment interventions cause measured carbon gains and to focus on the external validity of the experiments. In the case of climate-smart agriculture, “external validity” refers to the extent to which a study’s results are applicable to other fields receiving similar management interventions. Achieving external validity necessitates sustained observation of realistic intervention behaviors on working commercial farms and on well-defined and preserved control fields, repetition of experiments at a variety of sites, and quantification of average outcomes from interventions across fields rather than for individual fields.

New research suggests that empirical measure-and-remeasure projects are scientifically feasible at regional agricultural scales using current best practices for soil sampling and carbon analysis [Potash et al., 2025; Bradford et al., 2023]. Potash et al. [2025], for example, simulated a randomized-controlled trial for intervention projects across hundreds to thousands of fields, incorporating known variations in soil carbon stocks and measurement errors. The results showed that such projects can reliably estimate the effects of the treatments applied.

Using causal empirical approaches can complement, rather than compete with, the development of other approaches for MMRV of carbon storage and emissions. Approaches using satellite and airborne remote sensing may, for example, enable more efficient scaling of climate mitigation projects, albeit only if they are first validated against causal empirical data.

Empirical causal studies at the regional scales of commercial agricultural practices should thus be the gold standard of evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of climate-smart approaches. Data from these experiments will provide a rigorous basis for independent validation of established and emerging digital- and model-based approaches for soil carbon MMRV. They will also build confidence that adopting climate-smart practices really does result in mitigation of carbon emissions and climate change under real-world conditions.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.","Texas Roadhouse founder Kent Taylor had a flair for testing those he believed in. He was a factfinder. He’d share books, poll employees on their contemporaries, and drop hints about what he might be considering. But what Taylor concluded was often a mystery.

Before his passing in March 2021, when Taylor took his own life following a battle with post-COVID-19 symptoms, including severe tinnitus, he had started to read books on founders and their leadership transitions. Namely, three in particular—the stories behind Home Depot, Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, and “My Father’s Business,” which gets into the change at Dollar General.

Travis Doster, Texas Roadhouse’s chief communications officer, recalls Taylor one day asking him to send these books to a rising executive in Jerry Morgan, who was named president in mid-December 2020. He didn’t want Morgan to know why he was receiving them or be tipped off his boss might be paying attention. “Because when I come to town,” Doster says of Taylor’s instructions, “I’m going to switch books with him.”

“I immediately called Jerry and told him to buy a highlighter and write in the book,” Doster adds with a laugh.

Taylor loved to jot notes in pencil and blue erasable pen on graph paper. If you’re wondering if those relic pens are still easily found, his longtime assistant, Shelly McGowen, purchased “like 10,000 of them” years ago, Doster says. Employees often bantered of Taylor’s preference, “nothing says permanent decisions like an erasable pen.”

What Taylor was hoping to uncover, though, was how Morgan would process information and how much he’d study. He had inclinations the company’s 2001 Managing Partner of the Year, who rose to regional market partner in 2015, overseeing more than 120 Texas Roadhouses in 14 states, was the right person for a weighty job—his successor.

It’ll soon be coming on five years since Morgan became just that. Like others, he had a feeling Taylor was trying to telegraph the plan without fully saying it. The conversation was going on, in one respect or another, Morgan says, for a few years. He knew the store side. There was little doubt there, and Taylor understood operators were comfortable with that kind of hands-on resume.

Morgan was one of Taylor’s famed “crazies,” or store leaders who broke convention at times to make sales happen. Taylor boasted a rebellious spirit himself, going back to Bennigan’s in the 1980s and even KFC, where he used to tell stories of tweaking recipes and selling bottled water when his bosses asked him not to.

Morgan worked at Texas Roadhouse for 25 years and was known to spend hours weighing his store’s steaks and tasting each menu item.

He landed in Louisville, Kentucky, on December 17, 2020, and was announced publicly as president, donning a baseball cap and a three-quarter Texas Roadhouse zip-up.

Taylor didn’t offer Morgan any timeline or assurances. He was there to learn how corporate connected with unit-level performance; to host one-on-ones, and get to know leaders through various functions.

“I knew how to make a restaurant open, operate, and close quality shifts, and to hire great people and partners,” Morgan says. “But how did the other side work? I had made numerous trips over the years, but I didn’t know how it all came together.”

The learning period lasted four months. When Taylor passed, there was a memorial service, a Founder’s Day to ideate, museum to plan, statue to erect, and other theater-of-grief tasks that have a way of pausing time. Taylor had led Texas Roadhouse for 28-and-a-half years. Morgan says many folks, himself included, saw Taylor as the Norman Brinker of our time. “The one guy who could really get a chain to be highly successful and was still leading it,” he says. “And so, we just saw Kent and revered him in that manner.”

Naturally, there was a stretch of days and weeks trying to digest events and, for Morgan, accept responsibility. On this end, Taylor made his instructions clearer than usual.

He tore out a legal sheet piece of paper and wrote, in blue ink, Jerry Morgan (CEO). Taylor, 65 years old at the time, signed and dated it 3-18-2021—the day he died.

McGowen had the sheet framed and, to this day, Morgan keeps it in his office as a reminder of his stewardship.

He recalls sitting in meetings during emotionally charged days and leaders asking, “is a decision made?”

“OK, well, now who’s going to present it to Kent?”

Morgan realized everyone needed time. The process at Texas Roadhouse was so ingrained that habits had to unwind. So Morgan asked Doster to help him draft a “promise letter.”

The company-wide communication was, Morgan says, him “really accepting the job” and assuming the task of leading one of the world’s most successful casual-dining chains.

“When I looked at that whole piece of it, he gave me the job, but the day I wrote the letter and made a promise to the company was when I accepted the responsibility to be their leader,” he says. “And from that moment, I just moved forward.”

A leader in the making, and learning on the job

Growing up in Sarasota, Florida, Morgan was a 6-foot, 145-pound tight end/defensive lineman who learned a couple of early lessons before he reached his 20s: One, he was more interested in football than anything else, and, secondly, he also needed half a foot and another 50 pounds to compete. So, he was realistic.

One thing Morgan didn’t want to do, however, was get into restaurants or grocery stores. He felt the sectors didn’t garner the respect they deserved, and he wouldn’t, either, if he made it a career. Morgan received his first taste of retail and customer service in the garden center of now-defunct discount department store Woolco. After, he moved to Houston, Texas, to join his dad and uncle. He worked for Telesphere, a company installing long-distance dialers in hotels across America. Morgan did so for a couple of years until his uncle, a local lawyer, told him a story. He was doing legal work for an operator who owned 10 McDonald’s and “couldn’t believe how much money this guy was making.” He went and got a franchise partnership and bought two Burger Kings in Waco, Texas, and asked Morgan to come along. Morgan cleared the idea with his dad.

What he found was restaurants didn’t feel all that different from sports. He enjoyed the frenetic shifts, teamwork, and reality silver spoons aren’t handed out for free in this business. The ladder to success is accessible to anybody willing to work hard enough and grab it.

Restaurants fit the way Morgan viewed success and how he’d eventually frame his plans for Texas Roadhouse.

He talks today about “running one store, one market, one region, one company.” The philosophies don’t change all that much stop-to-stop. You gather information. You make a decision. And you try to get buy-in along the way.

It’s “been a heck of a journey” honing that mindset at Texas Roadhouse.

“Our sales have been incredible. The respect that we’ve received as an organization has just been unbelievable,” Morgan says. “When people say to me Kent Taylor would be very proud of not only what I’ve done, but what this company has done in the last five years, it does make it worth it to me.”

How Morgan kept Texas Roadhouse rolling and built on Taylor’s legacy unfolded quite differently in approach. That, too, is something Taylor appeared to recognize as a strength in Morgan and knew operators would respect beyond his sales record.

Morgan refers to himself not as a CEO, but as a “head coach.” He sees his job as ensuring the layers of Texas Roadhouse function at a high level through collaboration and communication.

Taylor, in his way, never specifically told Morgan why he thought he had the makeup to be his successor. He did share with Morgan he was a likeable leader and someone who worked well with others. Taylor, on the other hand, was an enigmatic, introverted CEO who kept colleagues on their toes. He was brilliant and steadfast, and always consumer and operator centric. Taylor would wait in line to eat at Texas Roadhouse and drove Chevy Suburbans stuffed with clutter, from architectural plans to a Santa suit.

But he admittedly had to develop a persona, “Bubba,” to play a certain character when it came to front-facing duties. He’d wear costumes, wigs, cowboy hats—all to put on a mask and do the things he was least comfortable doing.

Morgan says pundits and fans liked to say, “Kent Taylor is Texas Roadhouse.” Yet if you asked Taylor, he’d tell you it was about partners and “the Roadie nation,” a term the company uses to describe fanatics.

Morgan himself was a “Roadie” and somebody who could bridge the external and operational corners of running the company. He was respected because he got results, but also outward and more of a people-person than Taylor, who enjoyed yearly three-month skiing trips and was often on the road, growing the company and making deals.

Morgan managed the first Texas Roadhouse in Texas—Grand Prairie—that opened in 1997 and historically was one of the chain’s top performers. Morgan was recruited by Steve Ortiz, who knew Taylor from Bennigan’s and later rose to COO. Morgan asked Ortiz if Taylor was, indeed, someone you wanted to get into business with. Ortiz didn’t hesitate, and this path began.

“At each level, the results that you get create respect,” Morgan says. “And then, what do you do with that respect? Do you get arrogant, or do you get humble and go back to work?”

Taylor had begun to observe a sturdiness in Morgan and, sort of, trickled out hints. The day Ortiz retired, Taylor called Morgan and informed him there was a name and envelope in his desk. He told him, “The name changed that day.” Taylor didn’t say it was now “Jerry Morgan;” he just let him know it could be. About eight years later when then-president Scott Colosi retired, Morgan received another call.

“And he said, ‘the name in that desk is different.’ So, he was telling me that maybe he saw me as that kind of leader,” Morgan says. “And I responded, ‘that’s really cool. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. And I’m going to go back to work.’”

In the months ahead, Taylor rang “every single person in the company” and asked them what it was like working for Morgan. He’d pose another question—“give me three names who should replace me.” Once more, Taylor never shared with anybody what he heard back. “At one point, he did say, it was a pretty obvious choice,” Morgan says.

For the reticent Taylor, it was a resounding endorsement.

Texas Roadhouse’s next era

Morgan has adjusted over the years from accepting Taylor’s torch to carrying it to understanding how he might do so in his own style.

It comes back to Morgan’s “coaching mentality.” He made sure he understood people’s jobs, whether it was training, marketing, or legal. Morgan says his position has always been about trusting and inspiring people and holding them accountable. The latter is a place, he notes, where high-leadership executives often struggle. It’s the difference between executing in the trenches and holding others to that standard.

Firstly, though, not a morning arrives where Morgan doesn’t consider the mission, values, and purpose of Texas Roadhouse. Everything the company does today builds on what Taylor worked to nurture. Morgan seeks out leaders who are in it for Texas Roadhouse.

His first assessment came with certified counselor G. Dan Lumpkin. The coaching expert provided a predictive index with a 17-page report. Morgan had to answer 2,000 questions and Lumpkin evaluated his results against other CEOs.

It claimed Morgan was “bold, aggressive, and decisive.”

“I said, I’m good with that,” Morgan says.

“The bottom line is, Kent always told me, you’re never going to make everybody happy. Make the decision and move forward. And if it’s wrong, change it,” Morgan adds.

Texas Roadhouse lives through a “MVP” lens: “Mission. Values. Purpose.”

Morgan, illustrating how the operator gene never quite leaves you, says the company owes its employees a quality shift, every day. It owes guests top-end experience and value they can trust. And it owes shareholders the ability to run a solid business.

On that final point, Morgan took over a chain that took its pandemic lumps and came out firing.

In the week ending March 3, Texas Roadhouse units averaged weekly sales of $118,512. Of that, only $9,115 came outside the four walls. By March 24, those numbers were $29,432 and $25,938, respectively. And then, Texas Roadhouse figured things out, leveraging ideas of managing partners and serving a grateful customer.

Within a week, Texas Roadhouse jolted to-go sales to $41,892, a number that would rise into the high $50,000, low $60,000 range by late April.

In Q2 of 2025, as things have settled and continued to widen, Texas Roadhouse posted same-store sales of 5.8 percent for a two-year stack of 15.1 percent during a time when many restaurant peers are scratching to stay above the line. Average weekly sales were $167,350, of which $22,243 stemmed from to-go sales.

Morgan in October 2024 rang the closing bell to mark the brand’s 20th anniversary as a publicly traded company. It was a reflective moment remembering when Taylor and the chain’s mascot, Andy the Armadillo, opened the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on October 5, 2004. Texas Roadhouse had roughly 174 stores and 10,000 employees.

When Morgan got up there, the company had swelled to nearly 775 stores (there were 797 this past quarter) and 100,000 workers spread across three concepts—fast casual Jaggers and burger and pizza brand Bubba’s 33 included. It generated more than $5.373 billion in revenue in 2024, up 16 percent, year-over-year.

And regarding its stock, Texas Roadhouse traded for $11.50 on October 8 of that opening run. More recently, it was at $173 in mid-October 2025.

The company was a $2 billion enterprise in 2017, doubled to $4.014 billion over the next five years, and is well on its way to $8 billion over the next decade, as Morgan outlined last year.

All that success, he adds, has led to a lot of back-patting for Texas Roadhouse. Among his duties, he considers ensuring the brand never gets comfortable a key one.

Morgan believes Texas Roadhouse will avoid complacency as long as it remains committed to a larger vision. He’s regularly faced with decisions that affect 100,000 employees or 250 million guests. “When you look at it, you ask, are you making a decision that’s great for your employees? Are you making a decision that’s great for your guests? Or are you making a decision that’s great for the organization? If you can get all three of those boxes checked, then you’re in great shape,” Morgan says.

Embracing the “rowdy” and staying ahead

It’s likely Taylor saw in Morgan somebody who would never let the brand drift. One thing about Texas Roadhouse is it hasn’t suffered for identity, no matter what’s going on macro-wise. Taylor liked to rail against norms on earnings calls and answer complicated investor questions with short and direct quips. Why is the brand winning? Perhaps it has something to do with having fully staffed restaurants. Why aren’t you getting into delivery? Let other chains serve guests cold steaks.

Morgan, of course, lived this mantra each shift as an operator. The music is loud. There’s energy in restaurants. Morgan says the No. 1 thing guests tell Texas Roadhouse is to turn the volume down. But those who intimately know the brand also understand it’s a non-negotiable and a reason the whole thing works. Being able to separate the vocal minority from what matters is something that takes a Texas Roadhouse lifer to grasp.

Or, in Morgan’s words, “we have to believe that’s something that’s really important to our business.”

The same is true of free peanuts and the basket of bread and cinnamon butter. Morgan remarks, even before steak, customers talk about those two traits. Everywhere he goes, he says, on a plane, for instance, if Morgan is wearing a Texas Roadhouse logo somebody will tell him to bring the rolls before he gets onboard.

“We love that,” Morgan says.

The secret to Texas Roadhouse, so to speak, has never been difficult to place. It stays true to its principles—“Legendary Food and Legendary Service” —and compounds those hallmarks with running great restaurants. The managing partner model was one Taylor implemented because he thought operators would compete for success and hold to his ideals (he also needed the financial uplift). Operators spend $25,000—the first forked up $30,000—sign a multi-year contract, and get 10 percent of the store’s bottom line in addition to their salary.

These partners provide the foundation for Texas Roadhouse. Morgan and management conduct a fall tour to tap their ingenuity and check in. They help with pricing decisions, market observations, and, as Morgan proved, help build the pipeline from the inside out, with leaders who breathe Texas Roadhouse’s ethos. Doster says Morgan has a superpower for “listening to learn, not listening to respond.”

Operators have an hour to ask any question they want. “I just don’t think you can underestimate the power of that partnership with our operators,” Doster says.

Morgan says he’s proud of how the company and organization came together following Taylor’s passing and what’s unfurled since. “When you go through a tragic loss, you can either heal as a company or you can break apart,” he says. “You can start pointing fingers at each other. For us to all come together and heal and continue to focus on providing Legendary Food and Legendary Service, running great restaurants, and living our mission and our values and our purpose, and growing as a company, it’s meant everything.”

Staying the course and charting a new one

The first thing Texas Roadhouse did when it started to climb out of the pandemic was get staffed. It spent time investing in headcount, store wise and management, and Morgan feels it’s paid dividends as sales slope upward.

Texas Roadhouse has steadied the rampant turnover of post-COVID life and produced churn rates, Morgan says, at industry lows. That’s leading to more productive employees who, when they stay, signal they’re making money and having fun, he explains.

Guests in turn receive the experience and consistency expected of Texas Roadhouse. Even as prices hiked industry-wide, the brand never skimped on portions or service. “If I’m charging you more, wouldn’t you expect a little bit better food or better service?” Morgan says.

“We’ve never changed any of our recipes. We’re just trying to continue to deliver a great experience at a value price,” he adds. “You can spend a lot of money at Texas Roadhouse. But there’s also a value portion of the menu that’s always been there that I think protects us. We want to be very careful about that.”

Plainly, through all the industry’s value turmoil, Texas Roadhouse’s top-line growth confirms to Morgan people view the brand as a “good deal.” And that boils down to the aforementioned levers of trust, service, consistency, and never losing sight of what customers need—answers that come from managing partners making decisions on the ground level.

Along these lines, however, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse wants to talk about staying true to itself while also evolving. Even going back a decade, the chain was considering pay-at-the-table, for example. It eventually tried to let diners use phones or Apple Pay, etc., yet it never took hold.

Then, in 2022, the company partnered with Ziosk on “Roadhouse Pay” tablets that allow customers to check out when they’re ready. Immediately, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse saw an 80 percent response. Nearly 90 percent of guests use them today. Customers can’t reorder apps or drinks—it’s strictly a convenience play so people can pay on their own terms.

The industry in those days was sorting through a torrent of post-COVID technology. Brands hurried to open access and had begun to try and decode the options. A side effect was employees and leaders gained exposure.

Morgan says Texas Roadhouse started to have people come over from other chains who had used a lot of the options at hand. One was digital kitchen technology, or KDS. The company tried it first at Jaggers and Bubba’s. Texas Roadhouse was a more difficult concept because it was so oriented, Morgan says, onto tickets and the old style. And it was successful doing so.

“But we also knew we had to try to evolve,” he says.

Texas Roadhouse customized an option and put it in a restaurant. It was a success. The next 10 worked as well. And soon, the word got out and operators wanted in. So, the company laid out a three-year plan to update every restaurant, which should happen by year’s end.

While still relatively early, Morgan said learnings stem from being more organized. The kitchen is calmer since cooks don’t have to hear paper being pulled and see tickets everywhere. The bump screen allows them to focus on orders in front of them versus watching the rail of dozens of tickets stack up, which can be intimidating at times.

“It’s been a huge win for us,” Morgan says.

Texas Roadhouse has gotten better at takeout (still no delivery). It’s installed bump outs where sensible and improved its approach. It’s also worked on the mobile app and integrated a waitlist where customers can put their name down. That, Morgan says, has been a game-changer.

The brand has begun to consider handheld tablet ordering versus a server running over to a point-of-sale as well.

But overall, Texas Roadhouse wants technology to complement experience and help it become more efficient. It won’t replace or change the company’s DNA, Morgan says.

And that brings him back to what’s still to come. There’s growth on several fronts going into 2026, whether it’s the core Texas Roadhouse brand, Jaggers, or Bubba’s 33—the latter of which has 200-store ambitions (there were 53 in Q2). Jaggers touted 15 units and is ramping up franchising. It’s a fast casual, employees like to picture, created from Taylor driving one day with his grandchildren and getting annoyed they wanted to eat different things. The result being a mashup of burgers, chicken, salads, shakes, and more. A Jaggers in Lexington, Kentucky, earlier this year marked the 800th systemwide opening for the company.

As Texas Roadhouse debuts stores, across the portfolio, Morgan says he won’t lose sight of the soul the brand was founded on. Restaurants get to teach people soft skills and show them how to lead in ways other sectors simply cannot, he notes. Plus, you get to run a business and control your destiny, just as Taylor did. “And I think that’s the part when you think about this generation that’s coming up that’s very entrepreneurial driven, our company is built off that entrepreneurial spirit,” Morgan says. “You get to be an owner-operator, but you have responsibilities to the company. But to me, it’s always been about how do we create an environment where our employees love to work? That is what defines you as a leader.”

So what kind of leader has Morgan grown into, five years in? Doster says Taylor was not a “rah-rah” guy or someone who was overly approachable. He was quiet and earned respect through vision and action. Morgan does that, too, but he has a knack for bringing folks together.

He sits in the café and dines with employees. And one of the first things Morgan did was start a softball team. “Imagine another company right now where you just started at Roadhouse and you may work in IT or you work in purchasing, and you’re on the team with the CEO,” Doster says.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.

“I’m a part of Roadie Nation, too,” Morgan says. “And I’ve got a job to do.”",https://www.fsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TexasRoadhouseJerry.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:57.303755

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way.
“There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added.
At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits.
“I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said.","Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, true enough, while a gas-fired power plant can generate electricity any time. That supposed precarity of renewables will get even shakier, critics argue, as Americans ditch conventional vehicles for electric ones, which will draw ever more power from an already strained grid.

Luckily, that’s not a realistic scenario because of what renewables and EVs have in common: giant batteries. Solar and wind farms are plugging into huge banks of them to store energy to use as needed, fixing their intermittency challenge, Grist reports. (Engineers are turning Earth itself into an even bigger battery.) And a growing number of cars with cords feature vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, also known as bidirectional charging. They can draw clean power when renewables are humming on the grid, and their owners get paid to send some back to a utility to meet growing demand — creating a vast distributed network that could make the electrical system more reliable, not less. Research has found that globally, less than a third of EV owners would have to opt into such a system to meet the rising need for energy storage.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project.

“This is the first time there are actual customers who are off-boarding power from their electric vehicles to the grid, and we’re doing it at peak times in the evening,” said Chris Rauscher, vice president of grid services at Sunrun, referring to the periods of greatest need for electricity. “So we’re actually reducing the stress and the demand on the grid — crushing the curve, crushing the peak — which helps lower costs for everyone.”

To understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles and more like immense batteries on wheels. In fact, the Lightning’s battery is 10 times bigger than a residential pack, Rauscher said. “There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added. “This is a massive resource.” And it’s only getting more massive: The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that if California V2G’ed all of the 14 million EVs it’s expected to have by 2035, it could power every home in the state for three days.

In these early days of the tech, though, only a handful of models sport V2G capabilities, but the number is growing. The hardware and software aren’t wildly complicated. A special charger juices up the vehicle’s battery, then draws from the car to power a house, in the case of vehicle-to-home systems, or sends it back to the utility, in the case of vehicle-to-grid.

Utilities will have to communicate with anyone participating in such a program, for instance, with an app that allows a customer to, say, ask that their vehicle never be discharged below a certain percentage. Each utility will also need to figure out how much to compensate people for their power in order to incentivize them to join in. That might mean paying for the amount of energy provided, the same principle behind net metering, in which residential solar customers are reimbursed for the energy they give to the grid. “We’re still in a bit of an early stage here,” said Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. “There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, particularly on the customer-experience side.”

That battery power need not go all the way back to the grid, though, to help utilities. For years now, owners have been using their Ford Lightning trucks to power their homes. These batteries are mammoth — the extended-range version can go 300-plus miles — and powering a home with one uses just five or six miles of that range per hour.

So say an owner returns home at 6 p.m., when demand on the grid is skyrocketing as everyone else is knocking off work and switching on air conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances. Because consumption is rising, so too is the price of electricity. But a Lightning owner doesn’t have to pay that if they’re using their battery to power their home for five hours until they go to bed, using 25 to 30 miles of range on their battery. “It basically makes the house disappear, effectively, from the grid,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s business lead for vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home.

Then the owner can charge again when demand, and electricity prices, are lower. If they work from home, for example, they can charge during the day, when lots of solar power is coursing through the grid.

More homes tapping EV batteries also eases demand on the grid, which is especially welcome during a heatwave when everyone’s running their AC units. Those heat waves will only get worse from here — a growing challenge for utilities to provide the power that keeps people cool and safe. At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits. That infrastructure also must accommodate other forms of decarbonization, like heat pumps and induction stoves, that are essential for weaning us off fossil fuels.

Instead of sitting idly in a garage depreciating, V2G turns an EV into an asset for bolstering the grid and powering the home cheaply. “Cars are parked more than 22 hours a day,” O’Gorman said. “When we look at the advantages of an EV, now that vehicle can provide savings and potentially revenue flows for the customer.” (Interestingly, even electric trains can now send juice back to the grid and generate revenue, thanks to what they gain from regenerative braking: In the Bay Area, the Caltrain system is now being compensated for that energy, slashing its estimated annual power cost from $19.5 million to $16.5 million.)

The residential V2G program in Baltimore follows other experiments across the nation with larger vehicles. In Oakland, California, for instance, the utility Pacific Gas & Electric worked with the electric bus provider Zum to deploy vehicles that take kids home in the afternoon, return to the lot, and plug back into the grid. Because their batteries are so large, they have ample power left over, sending that extra energy to the grid just as demand is spiking. They charge overnight, take kids to school, and plug in again to charge.

This kind of predictability could make commercial fleets even more powerful for V2G than residential vehicles, experts say. A school bus is on a schedule a utility can rely on — it’s parked and available at certain times of day and making the rounds at others. Plus, in the summer, they would be available almost constantly. Other fleets, like delivery and government vehicles, follow regular timetables as well.

Fleet managers can also procure large numbers of the appropriate chargers, buying into the system en masse, compared to a homeowner shelling out for just one. “In the short term, we see commercial-level V2G applications as more viable due to infrastructure costs, but we expect affordable domestic units to emerge as the market matures and demand grows,” said a spokesperson for Nissan, which has long included bidirectional charging in its electric Leaf.

Utilities are still figuring out how to coordinate this ballet between vehicle, charger, and grid on a citywide scale. But the payoff could be big, because all those EVs are existing infrastructure that could help reduce the need to build dedicated battery plants to store renewable energy. The less a utility has to build, the fewer costs it has to pass on to ratepayers. And with more V2G, a utility that has to import lots of electricity from a neighboring state can now store power locally.

Thus, this technology could reduce energy bills. And for participants, their vehicles now provide transportation and energy storage. “It would seem pretty easy to imagine that that’s going to be cheaper than building just stationary battery storage facilities that do nothing but support the grid in times of need,” said Rudi Halbright, product manager of VGI pilot implementation at Pacific Gas & Electric. “Because you’re not getting that secondary use with those batteries. They’re kind of sitting around a lot of the time.”

People are more complicated than battery banks, though. Folks with busy lives want the convenience of charging their cars whenever they like and might not even realize how much prices fluctuate throughout the day, said David Victor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the behavior of EV drivers. Many like the peace of mind of having a fully charged vehicle ready at all times. “I take from that that V2G is going to be really, really hard for fleets outside of professionally managed fleets,” Victor said, “that we know reliably are going to be available at the time that the V2G asset is going to be needed.”

Still, given the number of EVs out there, only a fraction of owners need to participate to make a sizable impact. And residential and commercial V2G can complement each other — and in turn, complement a utility’s larger battery facilities — a widescale diversification of energy storage that could accelerate the adoption of renewables. “I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said. “Once we have enough customers enrolled and deployed out there, some percent of customers not plugging in and performing doesn’t really matter.”",https://static.stacker.com/s3fs-public/images/stories/2025/11/07/grist-how-evs-can-fix.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:00:32.384297

This is according to a review of the data by the SUN DAY Campaign.

For the third consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than the nation’s wind farms — by 4% in July, by 15% in August, and by 9% in September. Including residential systems, solar has out-produced wind five months in a row and by over 40% during September.

Similarly, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed — by almost 65% — the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.5% of total generation). In September alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of the nation’s hydropower plants. In fact, in both September and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

During the first nine months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 18.8% of the U.S. total, up from 17.1% during the first three-quarters of 2024. Further, the combination of wind and solar provided 15.1% more electricity than did coal during the first nine months of this year, and 9.8% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.1%.

The mix of all renewables produced 8.7% more electricity in January-September than they did a year ago and provided 25.6% of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.2% one year earlier. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by 3.8% during the first nine months of 2025.

Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, and Erin Houchin, a Salem Republican, want to finance a federal program to do widespread ecological restoration of the Ohio River and the network of waterways that comprise its basin.

The pair’s proposed legislation comes as local and national groups push an ambitious plan to address what they say are serious threats to the 204,000 square mile basin that spreads across 14 states and brings drinking water to more than 30 million people.

McGarvey is optimistic.

“The momentum’s there, the partnerships are there — across party lines, across regional lines — to hopefully start bringing the resources we need to protect the Ohio River,” he said.

The Ohio River Restoration Program Act would create a team within the Environmental Protection Agency to guide efforts to restore and protect the basin’s rivers, streams and wetlands.

The bill seeks $350 million in annual funding for five consecutive fiscal years. Money that could be used to help clean up toxic pollution, improve drinking water quality, repair fish and wildlife habitats or root out invasive species. The new team would need to create an action plan to begin addressing restoration efforts within the first two years.

The federal government would have a roadmap to follow in deciding what projects to finance: The Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan, developed by the University of Louisville’s Envirome Institute, the Ohio River Basin Alliance and the National Wildlife Federation, with input from scientific experts, community leaders and residents.

Houchin, who represents a Southern Indiana district that stretches downriver from Lawrenceburg to New Amsterdam, said she found common ground with McGarvey on this issue during discussions the two had on flights to and from Washington D.C.

The pair reinvigorated a congressional caucus for the Ohio River Basin and, with McGarvey’s leadership, got legislation to create a federal restoration program off the ground in 2024.

“We're going to try as hard as we can to take this as far as we can while the momentum is on our side, and continue to build and grow this coalition that cares about the Ohio River Basin and wants to see it funded,” Houchin said.

She said her interest in working on legislation like this stemmed from the disastrous 2023 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.

“It was at that time that we were monitoring with ORSANCO, every day, the particulates that were traveling down the river. Because we do have people that rely on the Ohio River for their source of water,” she said. “And we discovered in those efforts that the Ohio River Basin is … the largest river basin without any dedicated federal funding, and it is also the second-most endangered river basin.”

Houchin said the river is a vital economic thoroughfare on which more than a third of America’s maritime commerce travels.

Bipartisan support

The legislation is co-sponsored by a Republican and two Democrats on the House of Representatives’ Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

U.S. Rep. Emilia Strong Sykes, a Democrat from Akron, Ohio and committee member, said she’s concerned about water quality, water safety, accessibility and affordability.

Sykes said the abundance of water in the Ohio River Basin, compared to the droughts facing western U.S. states, is worth protecting.

“It is much more important for us now to protect our water sources and devote the attention and resources to it now, before it's too late,” she said.

Sykes pointed to Ohio’s Cuyahoga River, which notoriously caught fire decades ago because of rampant pollution and helped inspire Congress to create the EPA, as an example of what it can look like when large bodies of water are neglected.

“Sometimes we get things right, and we learn from our mistakes,” she said. “That's what's happening here, and this is why the timeliness is just so high.”

Sykes said she’s hopeful the bill will get a committee hearing soon.

“This is, fortunately, one of the more bipartisan committees … so the likelihood is more reasonable than maybe others,” Sykes said.

Why federal involvement?

McGarvey said establishing a federal program makes sense when the goal is to rehabilitate waterways across a broad swath of the country.

“This is when it is appropriate for the federal government to get involved, to coordinate people at every single level to clean up the river all the way through,” he said. “To make sure that it's there for future generations.”

Their plan is modeled after similar federal restoration programs that have supported other historic American waters, like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.

Across the country, town and city governments are embedding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into routine planning, public services, and community development, demonstrating a model of localized action that is drawing attention across Europe and Central Asia. What began as targeted support from the Joint SDG Fund has evolved into a coordinated municipal movement focused on measurable progress, institutional accountability, and inclusive growth.

A National Shift Toward Measurable Local Action

The joint program—implemented by UNDP, UNICEF, and FAO—has equipped Georgia’s local governments with practical tools to convert high-level SDG commitments into actionable policy. This work includes new planning methodologies, inter-sector partnerships, and systems for tracking progress across social, environmental, and governance priorities.

One of the most significant outcomes has been the adoption of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). These action-oriented assessments allow municipalities to benchmark their progress, prioritize interventions, and collaborate with neighboring regions. Georgia’s VLR model is increasingly referenced in international development discussions as a replicable approach to SDG localization, particularly in countries with diverse municipal capacities.

To date, more than 500 national and local officials, civil society members, and sector partners have been trained to align local development plans with SDG targets. This has improved coordination across government levels, resulting in more transparent planning cycles and clearer lines of accountability.

Data Systems Designed for People, Not Paperwork

A key feature of Georgia’s approach is the emphasis on evidence-based decision-making. The introduction of the Digital Needs Assessment Portal (social.nala.ge) enables municipalities to identify the needs of children and vulnerable families with greater precision. Developed with the National Association of Local Authorities of Georgia (NALAG) and the International School of Economics (ISET), the portal centralizes data to support targeted social services.

Complementing this system is a Child-Centered Budget Analysis (CCBA) framework that helps municipalities track how local budgets influence child welfare outcomes. Together, these tools shift municipal planning from reactive spending to proactive policy design—ensuring that children and families benefit from equitable and inclusive services.

Preliminary findings shared by program partners indicate that municipalities using the portal are better able to map service gaps, evaluate program effectiveness, and align local priorities with national social protection strategies.

Building Sustainable Systems from the Ground Up

Environmental sustainability is another core pillar of the program. Municipalities have updated their Waste Management Plans (2023–2027) to incorporate Georgia’s first structured five-level food waste hierarchy, supported by the country’s new Law on Food Loss and Waste Reduction. This hierarchy prioritizes prevention, redistribution, composting, and recovery before disposal.

More than 100 municipal officials, entrepreneurs, educators, and youth leaders have participated in community initiatives focused on reducing food waste, promoting composting practices, and supporting food donation programs. These interventions not only improve waste outcomes but also strengthen public awareness around responsible consumption—an area where local action directly influences national environmental goals.

Youth as Catalysts for Community Transformation

The program has also invested in emerging leaders. Over **100 young people—70% of them girls—**have been trained as SDG ambassadors, leading community projects, local awareness campaigns, and peer-to-peer education initiatives. Their participation demonstrates how youth-centered engagement can accelerate policy adoption and foster social innovation at the local level.

Georgia’s municipal leaders have highlighted youth involvement as a key factor in sustaining momentum, reinforcing that long-term SDG progress depends on generational continuity and civic participation.

From Local Lessons to Global Platforms

Georgia’s experience is increasingly recognized in international forums. At the Regional Forum for Sustainable Development, municipal representatives shared insights into how cross-sector partnerships are modernizing governance structures. A recent study tour with UN-Habitat in Portugal further strengthened Georgia’s ability to replicate and adapt international best practices, particularly in urban governance and community-centered planning.

These engagements underscore how locally driven progress can inform global SDG implementation, contributing to broader regional and international learning.

The next phase of the “Planning for Change with the SDGs” program aims to deepen the systems already in place. Priority areas include expanding municipal data capacity, integrating SDGs into routine policy cycles, strengthening civil society engagement, and extending support to more rural municipalities.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251130-111009-23e-Youth%20and%20local%20officials%20collaborating%20on%20community%20sustainability%20planning%20outdoors..jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:29.098826

President Donald Trump is no fan of renewable energy, deriding efforts to expand wind and solar power as a “joke.” “They don't work. They're too expensive. They're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great,” he told the United Nations General Assembly in September.

And certainly his administration has worked hard all year to eliminate incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles in favor of boosting U.S. production and consumption of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the country’s investment in those areas is on track to set an annual record in 2025 – though the pace of expansion shows signs of slowing, according to data compiled by Rhodium Group and the MIT-CEEPR Clean Investment Monitor.

In the third quarter, spending on clean energy and transportation jumped 8% from a year ago to $75 billion, the highest quarterly amount ever. And so far this year, such investments are running 6% ahead of the first three quarters of 2024, according to the report. A big driver for the third-quarter increase was Trump’s phaseout of $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles on Sept. 30, which triggered a rush in buying. Retail purchases of heat pumps and battery-storage systems for residential solar customers also rose significantly.

Increased demand for electricity, driven by the rapid growth of AI data centers, likely helped boost spending on utility-scale renewable power projects and industrial decarbonization technologies, which rose 15% from the year-earlier quarter. Unfortunately, investments in manufacturing projects for clean energy technology – such as battery plants – fell for a fourth consecutive quarter and were down 26% from a year ago.

Pressure on utilities to quickly add more power-generation capacity may continue to aid the expansion of renewables, but announcements by companies related to spending on industrial decarbonization projects in the third quarter plunged 56% from a year earlier, the report said. And the loss of federal incentives to buy EVs is expected to sharply lower the growth in that segment both in 2025’s final quarter and next year. So while full-year U.S. investment in cleantech should top last year’s $267 billion tally, even with some slowing, things may not be so rosy in 2026.

The Big Read

How AI Is Ushering In A New Nuclear Age

At Aalo Atomics’ 40,000-square-foot factory on the south side of Austin, Texas, workers move five-eighths-inch-thick steel plates onto machines that slowly bend and roll them into 12-foot-wide cylinders, which they then weld into 25-foot-tall vessels. These could be made cheaper by outside contractors. But Aalo cofounder and CEO Matt Loszak wants to do this work in-house, since each vessel will eventually contain the guts of a ten-megawatt (MW) nuclear fission reactor. Five of these Aalo-1 reactor units, working in tandem, will power a single 50 MW electric turbine—enough juice to run a large data-processing center or 45,000 homes.

“It’s not a paper reactor; it’s getting built,” declares Loszak, a 35-year-old Canadian engineer now on his third startup. In August, Aalo broke ground on a two-acre site at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, where it aims to achieve “criticality” by July 4, 2026—America’s 250th birthday and the deadline President Donald Trump has set for at least three U.S. startups to prove that their advanced nuclear reactor designs work. To achieve criticality, Aalo will load a vessel with off-the-shelf nuclear fuel rod assemblies and then initiate a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction.

Producing electricity? That comes later. Even after achieving criticality, Aalo will still need to build out manufacturing and a supply chain of vendors, sign data center customers and get final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “We’ll get the factory set up, come down the cost curve and have this Holy Grail product,’’ vows Loszak, who is shopping for up to 1 million square feet for a gigafactory and recently hired Bryson Gentile, who headed Falcon 9 manufacturing at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to set up Aalo’s mass production operation. “What Elon did [with electric cars and rockets] was kind of like running the four-minute mile. When that happens, everyone’s like, ‘Wait, this is possible,’ ” Loszak says. He hopes to produce electricity in 2027.

Demand for electricity is soaring, largely because of the power-sucking data centers undergirding the artificial intelligence boom, and Loszak isn’t the only nuclear entrepreneur aiming to ride the wave of AI dollars. A dozen ventures with names like Valar Atomics, Oklo, Kairos Power and X-energy are racing to perfect, permit and deploy a new generation of small, prefabricated reactors that could power individual data centers or even feed the larger electrical grid.

Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen founder & CEO, on investing in the developing world amid a pullback in U.S. aid and private funding

You've been in this space for 24 years. In that time, how many startups and companies have you funded in Africa and elsewhere?

About 220, roughly – maybe 240. And some of them have gone on to create whole new industries.

How has funding your investments changed over the past year, given that there’s a bit less emphasis on ESG among institutional investors?

I think that with the end of aid from the United States and the massive decline around the world, we saw both enormous disruption and destruction of lives, of people's health, and of the environment. I don't want to make an excuse for the way it was done.

At the same time, I started Acumen 24 years ago because I didn't think aid was going to solve problems in poverty. That was our beginning. I'm not nostalgic for the old age, but you can't just kill a system overnight. I think a lot of people feel that way. And now the world is looking for post-aid investment structures that go into those underdeveloped markets where people are overlooked and underestimated, and have been for as long as I've been alive. I actually find a great opportunity in this moment for these kinds of structures.

What are some examples of successes Acumen has had in funding startups in parts of the world that don't have electricity or distribution or logistics?

Probably our best example is in electrification. In 2007, 1.5 billion people on the planet had no access to electricity – 1.5 billion. We invested in one of the first off-grid solar lighting companies. It was just a box, a light. I would say irreverently that the entrepreneur didn't really know what they were doing. Neither did we. But over the next 10 years, we learned with them as they understood their customers and how to build distribution and how to finance and how to market, and how to build trust. And 10 years later, they were ready for growth capital. That was our first growth fund. Along the way, we started investing in other companies in that off-grid solar sector. And a few years ago, we realized that we, a nonprofit investor in 40 companies, had brought off-grid light and electricity to 300 million low-income people.

At that point, the world was looking at what's left: 600 million people, mostly in Africa, still have no access to off-grid light and electricity. So we asked ourselves, alright, if Acumen is going to go in and participate in what is a moral imperative as well as a productivity imperative, what's our role?

So we created a facility that is called the hardest to reach, which is unapologetically blended to take on the 16 most challenging markets in Africa that include Benin, Somalia, Chad, DRC, South Sudan, Malawi, and I could go on. We would take $60 million of philanthropy so that we could do those early-stage investments. We recently made our first loan in Somalia. Then, side by side, would be a $200 million blended debt facility so that we had enough working capital to keep companies in the countries in which they were operating. Twenty-three different stakeholders, from philanthropists to Shinhan Bank, which is a commercial bank in Korea, are coming together to make this change happen. I think this is the future if we are going to build markets for people that we have overlooked.

Since you have some of the riskiest startups out there, the understanding is that some of your portfolio companies aren’t going to make it. How do you handle that?

First of all, if you're not willing to fail, you will not succeed. Second, I think too many investors always focus on the downside. What could go wrong? In our markets, a lot could go wrong. Macroeconomic and exogenous influences, I could go on. But what we also have to ask ourselves is what is the cost of not daring? What is the cost of not trying? If you're looking at bringing off-grid solar electricity to, in our case, 70 million low-income people in very challenging markets, the risk of not daring is rising emissions. That is raising instability, and it’s raising migration. We have to start thinking more holistically about how we use the tools of investment to solve problems, recognizing that if we're careful and smart enough, we can provide returns based on the expectations of different investor classes.

The EPA and the Department of Justice have announced a nationwide settlement with Lowe’s Home Centers, LLC, requiring the company to pay a $12.5 million civil penalty for violations of the federal Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule.

According to the agencies, Lowe’s failed to ensure that renovation work performed in homes built before 1978 complied with lead-safe practices. EPA’s investigation found widespread noncompliance across more than 250 renovation jobs in 23 states between 2019 and 2021. The agency cited failures such as the use of uncertified contractors, inadequate containment of dust and paint debris, and the company’s failure to provide residents with required lead-hazard information prior to beginning renovation work.

Lead-based paint, banned in the United States in 1978, remains a major source of childhood lead exposure in older housing. Renovation activities that disturb lead paint can release hazardous dust and chips that pose significant health risks, particularly to children. EPA officials emphasized that improper renovation practices can result in exposure levels known to cause neurological damage, developmental delays, and other long-term health effects.

Under the terms of the settlement, Lowe’s must implement a comprehensive, corporate-wide compliance program designed to prevent future violations. The program requires Lowe’s to use only certified renovation firms and certified renovators, verify the age of every property before beginning work, and maintain an electronic compliance system that documents all lead-safe procedures. Lowe’s is also required to conduct at least 4,000 jobsite inspections and submit regular compliance reports to the EPA for the next three years.

This settlement builds on a 2014 consent decree in which Lowe’s agreed to comply with the RRP Rule after earlier violations. EPA and DOJ officials noted that improved oversight and stronger compliance systems are essential to preventing harmful lead exposures during home renovations.

The agencies said the enforcement action underscores the continued risk of legacy lead paint in U.S. housing and reaffirms the government’s commitment to ensuring companies follow federally mandated lead-safe work practices.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/1201EPLowes.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:42.796321

Programmes include data centre technician training, fibre optic fusion splicing workshops and cloud computing pre-apprenticeships.
Ivy Tech has integrated new AWS-certified modules into its curriculum and the Amazon Community Workforce Accelerator continues to offer hands-on training aligned with data centre operations.
Initiatives for schools include We Build it Better, which introduces middle and high school students to practical STEM learning with industry-grade tools.","Amazon has confirmed a US$15bn investment to build new data centre campuses in Northern Indiana, expanding its infrastructure for AI and cloud computing.

The project will add 2.4GW of capacity and create 1,100 high-skilled jobs, with thousands more supported across the supply chain.

The expansion builds on Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) previous US$11bn commitment in St Joseph County, bringing advanced cloud and AI infrastructure to new sites across the state.

The new campuses will feature AWS-designed chips, servers and networking systems optimised for performance, reliability and energy efficiency, supporting workloads such as machine learning and next-generation cloud applications.

David Zapolsky, Amazon’s Chief Global Affairs and Legal Officer, says: “Indiana has long been an important partner for Amazon and today we are proud to reaffirm our commitment to long-term investment and growth, underscoring our dedication to fuelling AI innovation while generating meaningful economic impact throughout the state.

“By expanding our advanced cloud infrastructure in Indiana, we are investing in Indiana's technological future through job creation, skills training initiatives and community engagement programmes.

“We're excited to help power the next wave of technological advancement while delivering tangible benefits that will enhance the lives of Indiana residents for years to come.”

Infrastructure and energy to support growth

The data centre expansion is supported by a new energy agreement between Amazon and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO).

The partnership includes the creation of NIPSCO Generation (GenCo), which will manage infrastructure to supply power to the facilities.

Amazon will fund the required plants, lines and equipment without passing costs to local residents or businesses.

NIPSCO expects the agreement to generate US$1bn in cost savings for current electric customers over 15 years.

This surplus will also improve energy reliability during peak demand, such as extreme weather, by increasing total generation capacity beyond Amazon’s own 2.4GW needs.

Vince Parisi, NIPSCO President and COO, says: “This agreement structure with Amazon represents approximately US$1bn in cost savings over 15 years to our existing NIPSCO electric customers while strengthening our regional grid and economic future.

“By structuring this agreement thoughtfully, we're ensuring our current customers are protected, without increasing their rates, while we expand our capacity to meet growing demands.

“This project isn't just about powering data centres, it's about powering possibilities for our communities through thousands of new jobs, an expanded tax base and building a skilled workforce in Northern Indiana for long-term growth and prosperity.""

Governor Mike Braun adds: “This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers. This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers.

“Amazon’s historic investment shows that Indiana’s business-friendly climate continues to attract world-class employers and drive growth in our state.

“This project will create more than a thousand jobs while supporting thousands more across the region, further strengthening Indiana’s position in energy dominance and economic leadership.”

Training, education and long-term investment

Amazon is also committing to training the future workforce of the region.

Programmes include data centre technician training, fibre optic fusion splicing workshops and cloud computing pre-apprenticeships.

Ivy Tech has integrated new AWS-certified modules into its curriculum and the Amazon Community Workforce Accelerator continues to offer hands-on training aligned with data centre operations.

Initiatives for schools include We Build it Better, which introduces middle and high school students to practical STEM learning with industry-grade tools. Career awareness programmes are also offered to younger students.

Additional support for educators includes infrastructure donations, curriculum materials and professional training to ensure Indiana’s institutions can develop local talent for cloud and infrastructure careers.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7958e122572adb7abf68c6c2cd878ec3:a320a7c7b55da8ed674cd8a5275d91cd/vince-parisi-nipsco-president-and-coo.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:07:50.498804

The IRA also created a new category of projects eligible for funding under Section 1706 of Title XVII named the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing program (EIRF).
A New Mandate: Financing Energy Dominance The new Trump Administration hassignificantly shifted US energy policy, rejecting the concept of climate change, and emphasizing instead fossil fuels as the means to achieving energy security and dominance.
Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program.
And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.","On October 15, 2025, AEP Transmission LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric Power Company (AEP), closed a $1.6 billion term-loan financing guaranteed by the US Department of Energy (DOE), marking the first DOE loan guaranteed financing to close since President Trump’s inauguration in January. AEP operates the nation’s largest electric transmission system, spanning more than 40,000 miles and serving over five million customers. The company sought DOE financing to rebuild and reconductor approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states – Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia – modernizing grid infrastructure and improving reliability for millions of consumers.

The credit facility was structured as a low-interest term loan advanced by the Federal Financing Bank and fully guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment authority. The federal financing backed by DOE’s guarantee will significantly reduce borrowing costs and allow AEP to accelerate capital deployment at a time when private financing for large-scale transmission upgrades may be constrained.

The AEP transaction may very well serve as an early model for subsequent electric power infrastructure financings under the DOE’s newly branded Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment and Energy Dominance Financing Programs.

A Program Built to Bridge Innovation and Capital

The DOE’s loan guarantee program was created under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (then called “Incentives for Innovative Technologies”) to help finance innovative energy technologies that, at time of financing, wouldn’t meet market norms for “commercial technology.” By providing federal guarantees for loans provided by the Federal Financing Bank, or potentially private lenders, the program aimed to close the financing gap between innovative technology and market-tested (i.e., bankable) deployment.

Over the years, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), created to administer the loan guarantee program, financed projects that redefined the US energy landscape: utility-scale solar farms, advanced vehicle manufacturing, and more recently, next-generation carbon-capture facilities among them. Through these investments, DOE has been perhaps the principal actor in the US helping to move new-generation clean energy technologies from the margin to the mainstream.

Following the inauguration of President Biden, the loan guarantee program received a boost from both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which among other things increased the funds authorized for the program. The IRA also created a new category of projects eligible for funding under Section 1706 of Title XVII named the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing program (EIRF). In its guidance, the Biden era LPOdescribed the new funding as aiming to provide a “bridge to bankability,” especially for new projects that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution that may have trouble arranging financing from commercial lenders.

A New Mandate: Financing Energy Dominance

The new Trump Administration hassignificantly shifted US energy policy, rejecting the concept of climate change, and emphasizing instead fossil fuels as the means to achieving energy security and dominance.

The new Congress reflected President Trump’s pivot in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA revised Section 1706, rebranding it as the “Energy Dominance Program” and changing its emphasis from promoting clean energy generation to facilitating projects using fossil resources, as well as mining projects, for the sake of national security. The OBBBA rescinded the unobligated funds inked by the IRA for Section 1706 but at the same time appropriated $1 billion to DOE to “carry out activities” under section 1706 (of which not more than 3 percent is to be used for administrative expenses) and authorized $250 billion in new loan guarantees for the revised Energy Dominance program through September 30, 2028.

Consistent with the policy shift to encompass fossil resources, Section 50403 of the OBBBA removed a Section 1706 eligibility criterion that a project must “avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions.” Additionally, program eligibility is expanded to include projects that will “increase capacity or output” or “support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.” The OBBBA also revised the definition of “Energy Infrastructure” to become a facility (and associated equipment), used to enable “production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.”

On October 28, DOE published an Interim Final Rule which amends the DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA. Among other provisions it will add a requirement that an electricity utility infrastructure project applying for funding from the 1706 program demonstrate that the financial benefits from a DOE guarantee will be shared with its customers, or the associated community served by it. Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program. While it is “effective” as of October 28, the period for public comment on the Interim Final Rule expires on December 29, 2025. The text of he rule and information on how to provide comments can be found here.

The above notwithstanding, Title XVII survived mostly unchanged, except for the revised Section 1706. As an important example, the OBBB did not change Section 1706 (a)(1) under which the AEP financing was closed, and which contemplates guarantees for projects to “retool, repower, repurpose or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations.” Moreover, the OBBBA did not amend Section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act, which authorizes DOE loan guarantees for projects that “avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued”, including, among others, Renewable Energy Systems, carbon capture projects and those projects that increase the domestically produced supply of critical minerals. However, the OBBBA in practice defunded the innovative energy program (among other programs) for future projects.

The AEP Transmission Financing: A Case Study in Transition

Bracewell’s representation of AEP in this transaction provides some unique insights into how DOE’s pre-existing loan guarantee framework will evolve to operate effectively within the new energy-dominance policy environment. AEP, like several utilities in the DOE queue, applied for funding and executed a preliminary term sheet before President Trump’s second inauguration in January.

The AEP deal advanced under challenging conditions – not only the change in administration after term sheet signing, but also the longest ever federal government shutdown that halted some agency operations. Despite these challenges, the transaction closed smoothly in October, aided by a pragmatic and flexible approach implemented by both the AEP and DOE teams to navigate the DOE’s existing procedural complexities, while balancing the policies and interests of DOE in following governmental norms with the commercial interests of AEP in achieving a resilient and administratively manageable financing structure under its 30-year tenure.

The willingness of both parties to overcome challenges within existing statutory and policy constraints was essential. The transaction helped establish a working model for balancing regulatory compliance with project-level realities. It provides a roadmap for future DOE-guaranteed financings, not only for the small group of forthcoming utility-oriented financings already in the queue, but also for new projects under the OBBBA’s expanded eligibility scope.

Looking Forward

Under the energy-dominance framework and its expanded reach, the DOE loan guarantee program is poised to continue to be a strategic financing platform encompassing the full spectrum of US energy infrastructure, with an emphasis on innovation, reliability, security and independence, and agnostic on type of fuel or feedstock. To prove this point, in late October DOE closed a second loan, a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources to finance the restart and repurposing of a coal to ammonia fertilizer facility in Indiana that was idled since 2016. The revamped facility will produce 500,000 mtpy of anhydrous ammonia from coal from a nearby mine and pet coke as feedstock. And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.

For utilities and other project investors, the lesson is clear: US federal credit support remains one of the most powerful tools for accelerating capital into a changing environment for the energy infrastructure that underpins US economic strength.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9762_2059.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:47.881521

The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory.
This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says.
Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively.","One of Germany’s key business institutions, the chambers of industry and commerce, has called for an overhaul of climate policies to take pressure off companies.

“The current path of the energy transition in Germany is characterised by numerous, sometimes contradictory goals, detailed government control, insufficient European and international integration, and a lack of international coordination,” the organisation said in a climate policy paper adopted by its general assembly. “This has resulted in high costs and competitive disadvantages for the economy.”

German industry is struggling on many fronts, including with US tariffs, Chinese competition, red tape, and pressure to decarbonise. In particular, industries with a heavy use of energy in their processes such as steelmakers or chemicals have been under additional pressure due to price increases mainly for natural gas, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory. Unlike business associations such as industry association BDI, the DIHK is not a conventional lobby group, but a public body with a legal mandate. The DIHK is the umbrella organisation for 79 regional chambers, which are expected to represent the entire business landscape, not the interests of particular sectors.

The paper notes that DIHK “has long been observing closures and relocations, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany.”

“With its goal of becoming climate neutral by 2045, Germany has set itself a more ambitious target than the majority of industrialised and emerging countries. This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says. To avoid competitive disadvantages, DIHK proposes “that German and European reduction targets should be aligned with the climate protection efforts of the most important economic competitors.”

DIHK calls for replacing strict annual climate targets

DIHK also said it opposed the strict annual climate targets laid out in Germany’s Climate Action Law, instead advocating a system that stipulates an overall budget of permissible emissions for a certain duration, but allows flexibility within that period.

Companies in Germany not only have to adhere to national regulation, but operate under a framework of EU rules. Adapting national targets would have to be complemented by changes at the European level. The EU-wide Emissions Trading Systems (EU ETS 1&2) set annually declining caps on emissions, which limits the flexibility for companies to emit more in the early years and less later.

Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively. However, this could change, as the EU and member states have begun talks to reform both systems and reached initial agreements.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:24.310995

CATL and Stellantis aim to have the new gigafactory in Zaragoza, located in Aragon, up and running by the end of 2026 and, with a joint investment of over 4 billion euros. The facility will run entirely on renewable energy. It is expected to deliver up to 50 GWh of lithium-iron phosphate batteries a year for electric vehicles.

CATL is the world's biggest and best-selling electric vehicle battery maker, and Stellantis is a global car manufacturer that has Jeep, Fiat, Chrysler, Dodge, Peugeot, and Vauxhall under its umbrella - among others.

These two multinational powerhouses have teamed up to build an EV battery plant with a clear aim.

""To accelerate the transition towards affordable, accessible, sustainable mobility for all,"" said Wu Qi, CEO of Contemporary Star Energy - the joint venture set up by CATL and Stellantis, in his speech at the ceremony.

Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Jordi Hereu said the groundbreaking ceremony represents a strategic milestone in Spain's new-energy transition and industrial modernization, as well as Europe's strategic independence on the world stage.

""Today we are laying the first stone, the fruit of cooperation and of a vision of what an independent European strategy needs to be - open to cooperation, to dialogue, to work with all of the countries in the world, and especially with a country like China,"" he said.

During the ceremony, representatives from both sides sealed copies of Spain's Heraldo de Aragon and China's People's Daily into a time capsule to be placed at the factory's entrance as a symbol of long-term commitment to the project's future.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000.
Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths.
“Even outside of campus, he’s so personable.
The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.” The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work.","In his 36-year career, Steven Bridges’ résumé lists just two employers: Sureway grocery store in Henderson, Kentucky, and the University of Southern Indiana. He’d have it no other way.

Bridges, 59, was celebrated Oct. 16 as USI’s fifth president and first alumni leader. Sentimentally, he was invested by prior presidents H. Ray Hoops, Linda Bennett, and Ronald Rochon, all of whom he served under. Long an accounting and financial officer, his dedication to his alma mater led Bridges to be named interim president in 2024 when Rochon left for California State University in Fullerton after seven years helming USI. After a national search, USI’s board of trustees recognized Bridges’ longtime skills and devotion to USI and in April offered him the full-time presidency.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000. “His commitment to the university, its students, and its faculty and staff inspires the same commitment from others and creates a great environment in which to learn and work.”

Across campus, Bridges’ appointment has been morale boosting. “He consistently keeps students at the center of every decision,” says Michael Solliday, a junior computer science major who in July was appointed to a two-year student trustee term. “He cares so much for students because he’s been there himself. … Through his presence and integrity, students feel seen and valued, and that sets the tone for the culture he’s building at USI.”

Humble Roots

Bridges’ mother and father — who were one of 11 and nine children, respectively — did not give their only child an option about attending college: “From day one, they said, ‘We need you to get an education, to do the things we didn’t get to do,” he says. They used their savings to help fund his studies. Bridges spent much of his childhood helping his father on their Henderson County farm, opening seed bags on a flatbed truck and climbing around tractors. After graduating from Henderson County High School in 1984, he helped pay for his college studies by working at Sureway. Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths. “That’s when I started feeling the community of people here,” he says. “You felt like you were home.”

After he completed his studies in fall 1988, then-director of USI’s Career Services Office Marilyn Schmidt recommended Bridges for his first post-graduation job as a staff accountant in April 1989. Impressed by his work ethic, attention to detail and priorities, and commitment to his future career, Schmidt remarked at his inauguration, “Steve Bridges was the perfect candidate for that job 30-plus years ago, and he’s the perfect candidate now.”

“It was like a full circle,” Solliday says. “Seeing him on campus, but then knowing his background with USI, it honestly impacts my thoughts on my own career. (This) is exactly what it looks like to build a career in purpose, service, and long-term commitment, and seeing him model it so well has really encouraged me to think bigger about my own impact.”

As he joined USI as an employee in 1989, Bridges and new wife Rosemary were expecting their first of three children, all of whom have followed their father’s footsteps in attaining higher education — and two literally: His daughters both are USI graduates. Cory, Abby, and Emma grew up rooting for the Screaming Eagles, with Cory even serving as a ball boy for Bruce Pearl during the basketball coach’s nine-season tenure at USI. “We grew up on this campus,” Cory, a commercial loan officer at Field and Main Bank, said at his father’s inauguration. “… To see our father lead the university he loves is a real pleasure.”

Known for his humble, everyman nature, Bridges’ approachability has led to a deep connection with members of the university community. “I’d see him all the time as he made his way around campus, being very interactive with students and just in general,” says Solliday, a Switz City, Indiana, native who got to know Bridges while Solliday served as a student ambassador. “Even outside of campus, he’s so personable. He always asked how I’m doing, whether with classes or anything else. A few months ago, I was in a car accident back home, and he was one of the first people to ask how I was doing.”

Helping Bridges balance the rigors of the presidency is a loving home life. His family now has grown to include five grandchildren. Like his alma mater, Bridges is intimately connected to the Tri-State: Born in Kentucky, he owns a home on Lake Barkley in honor of his father, a native of nearby Cadiz. Bridges’ mother’s family — including his 81 first cousins: Son Cory joked that “every family reunion was a public speaking event” — is based in rural Southeastern Illinois at a farm Bridges frequently visits. And his professional life has been rooted in Southwestern Indiana, and soon his personal life will follow: Longtime residents of Henderson, Kentucky, Bridges and wife Rosemary will move into the president’s residence, a Colonial Revival with 8,552 square feet just off McDowell Road near campus, when renovations are finished.

His daily routine includes a coffee date with Rosemary, an office assistant at Henderson’s Holy Name of Jesus Catholic School. “Each morning, we have ‘coffee clique,’ and it’s our time together to relax, see what’s going on, talk about our day, what we have coming up,” he says. “The ‘coffee clique’ is the foundation of my day. It’s a bit of a zen and relaxation for me before I come in and life gets busy.”

Bridges is a long-time volunteer with the Girl Scouts of Southwest Indiana, where he’s often worked on community projects alongside new CEO Mary Fee. “His leadership shines not only through his professional achievements, but in all he does,” Fee says. “He shares his expertise, wisdom, and discernment to help strengthen our mission and expand our impact. But above all, we are grateful for his steadfast commitment to this community and for the genuine friendship he extends to those he serves.”

The avid sports fan rests and recharges through fishing and quiet everyday pursuits like mowing the lawn or throwing meat on his beloved Oklahoma Joe’s smoker. “I do it the old way with wood. I don’t have the digital things where I can go do something else. I sit down and smoke the meat. And I enjoy that time with my smoker and make a point to relax and let things run through my mind,” he says. “It’s my opportunity to get away, and things come to my mind without me even trying.”

Meeting Successes and Challenges

Rising through the ranks, his work ethic has impressed many. “He has worked hard in every role that he has held,” Sickman says of Bridges, who in 1995 completed his Master of Business Administration from USI. “He adapts and rises to the occasion in whatever role he serves, and he applies what he has learned both as a student and through his various jobs to meet the needs of the university.”

Sickman notes his admiration for Bridges’ adaptability, especially as the university weathered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “USI did not experience layoffs as many others did, and we never missed a paycheck because his fiscal management ensured that we had enough reserves to weather any storm,” says Sickman, who served as Bridges’ Assistant Vice President for Finance and Administration. “USI remained financially healthy during that turbulent time due to his sound financial management.”

Displaying a leadership style that prioritizes teamwork, Bridges says he prefers to guide people toward results he would like to see while giving them the freedom to make it happen. “His empathy and vision, his ability to truly listen … it creates trust and fosters collaboration. He balances compassion with strategic thinking and planning for the university,” Solliday says.

Bridges gives credit to his alma mater for creating leaders, including himself. “We had lots of people that learned about the things that they needed to, to be ready for the next position,” he says. “Just like when I went to interview for those jobs — this put me in a position to be ready.” But staying out of the trenches has been tough. “One of the hardest things is not to be in the details,” he says, but he relishes having “faith in the people who do the detailed work. That’s been a culture for us, to prepare for the future.”

Bridges’ continued employment by USI means the colleagues he’s now leading have witnessed his professional milestones and missteps, a humbling position for any president. He remembers with pride a software installation that impacted record keeping from financial aid to registration. Bridges had to step away from his position as Controller and Assistant Director of the Business Office for the three-year transition. “It was a huge hit for our office to lose Steve, but in hindsight, it was for the good of the campus,” says Sickman, who as manager of payment services reported to Bridges. “It was a campuswide initiative, and they needed someone who could unify everyone, and that’s exactly why he was tapped. It showed what he could do.”

“I never took for granted the sacrifices people made and the way we went about it,” Bridges says. “It connected me to alumni, to financial aid, to payroll, to students, to finance — literally, they’re still helping me today.”

Conversely, Bridges learned a valuable lesson from an at-first bungled attempt to streamline students getting their books. He was put in charge of building the procedure, and he’s blunt about his initial missteps. “I screwed that thing up. I made it so accountant-oriented. It was a backroom disaster,” he says. “I could’ve just abandoned it because I was frustrated and embarrassed by it. But people stayed with me, and they fought through my mistakes. We came up with a better way to do it, and we achieved what we wanted to. But I had to fail. I had to figure out where I messed up to come back, let people who really did the work tell me where I was wrong. The next semester was night and day. The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.”

The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work. It doesn’t matter where they are in the organizational chart. Listen to them,” Bridges says. “You have to learn to be able to not give up on what you’re trying to do, to listen to the people that can help you make it better, and to adjust that path as needed.”

Has Bridges ever been tempted to leave USI? The software migration project Bridges led caught the attention of a company that wanted to hire him, but he stayed rooted to campus. “Why would I leave a place that I love? Where is it better than here?” he says. “And so, never did I seriously entertain it, but like anyone, it’s nice to want to feel wanted. But I felt wanted here, most of all.”

His appreciation for USI’s environment and his relaxed, humble nature are why long-time colleagues still grab Bridges’ ear as he walks through campus — “They’re like, ‘What do I call you now?’ and I’m like, ‘Steve,’’ he laughs — and he appreciated having that background as he assumed the presidency. “I think they would tell you that I’m a straight shooter, I’m transparent, and I think that’s maybe why there’s a comfort with me in this role. I hope that’s the case. I would consider that the biggest compliment.”

“People trust Steve Bridges and follow him because he is authentic,” Sickman says. “People do not always agree with him, but he is the most universally respected person that I have ever met. The positivity at USI is palpable, and it is a direct result of the hope that President Bridges has injected that USI’s best days are ahead.”",https://d2u6ap06x2kfex.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/USI-President-Steven-Bridges-201596-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:59:04.553473

The owners are selling 30 acres that include the Pedroland amusement park, the ""SOB Convention Center,"" a motel building, a mini-golf course, vacant land and a former casino. The price is listed at $2.85 million.

Those parts of the attraction have closed, but South of the Border is keeping its unusual sombrero observation tower, reptile lagoon, souvenir stores and restaurants. The main motel and campground are also still in operation.

Real-estate agent Ken Jackson says he anticipates the buyer will redevelop the site to take advantage of I-95 traffic. The only condition is that the new owner can't sell fireworks, because that's already part of South of the Border.

""We've had a lot of interest from people wanting to do that, but that's the only thing that wouldn't be allowed,"" he told WUNC.

Jackson says the property for sale could be redeveloped as a hotel or other travel-oriented business. He says while South of the Border has new competition from a Buc-ee's truck stop a few exits deeper into South Carolina near Florence, the location still gets heavy traffic.

""Buc-ee's is the new shiny toy, and it is attractive to travelers as well, but there are plenty of people traveling up and down the interstate, and enough for both businesses,"" Jackson said.

But he says it's unlikely the new owner would reopen the amusement park. ""I'm not sure there's much demand for amusement parks of that size anymore, but it's a great opportunity for someone to go in and build a modern hotel,"" Jackson said.

As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.
Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?
Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded.
To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.","From the agrarian ideals of Thomas Jefferson to the emergence of the military-industrial complex of post-World War II, the bee has remained an essential figure of American progress and democracy.

As our country expanded westward and established our government, the honey bee has long been a marker of the past, present and future of the United States of America. Yet today, the downfall of the honey bee at the expense of American progress has raised concerns about the future of our nation.

Arriving to the American colonies during the early 17th century, the honey bee quickly became acclimated to the ecosystems of North America. Although the modern species of Apis melliferia is native to Europe, an extinct species of honey bees once pollinated the landscapes of North America 14 million years ago.

Bees, native and nonnative, have become an essential part of American ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. As major pollinators, bees boost the food crops of the United States and work to reduce the impacts of climate change across the globe.

Yet today, the modern bee faces the same threat it once faced 14 million years ago in North America: extinction. As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.

Regardless of origin, species of bees and pollinators are threatened today under American lifestyles, consumption and policy, facing up to a 70% colony loss in 2025, the highest in U.S. history. Bees pollinate 75% of U.S. food and agricultural crops, contributing $15 billion to the U.S. economy every year.

The urgency hasn’t been placed on reducing bee habitat fragmentation or curbing the use of agricultural pesticides that have sparked a huge loss in colonies. Instead, the United States has taken a technological approach to curb pollinator losses and avoid changing lifestyle habits altogether.

An insulting mark of bees as infrastructure and replaceable technology has shifted the importance of bees from one of ensuring food security to agricultural profit, underscoring the profit-driven mindset amid an environmental crisis.

This leads us to question whether potential solutions exist to protect bees for pollination or to ensure monopolies have cheap, ready-to-use pesticides at their disposal. As the Environmental Protection Agency reports, “certain pesticides are harmful to bees,” further stating their measures and guidelines for “protecting bees” on product labels.

Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?

Here’s my answer: profit and influence.

As agribusiness attempts to maximize yields while cutting costs, cheap pesticides will continue to be used alongside monetary incentives towards the EPA to turn a blind eye to the scope of the problem. Under the current presidential administration, we see a reversal of any progress made when deregulation is placed in their hands.

Recently, institutions and research labs, in attempts to address growing colony losses, have begun developing artificial pollinator technologies to tackle the growing strain on pollination.

Under the status quo, can we expect the needed changes to occur? Here’s the short answer: no. As development and research ramp up through robot bees and artificial replacements to native pollinators, we are going in the wrong direction.

What this does is move the use and importance of bees away from their environmental importance, crucial during a time when more emphasis on environmental protection is needed.

What is so appalling about the development of pollinator technologies is the lack of actual credibility or accountability towards anthropogenic causes of bee habitat losses and colony decline. Instead of changing consumption patterns, the United States has encouraged technological advancements that have no long-term stability.

The effectiveness of artificial intelligence replacements or modified bees is dependent on specific environmental conditions and infrastructure. Natural bees are far more efficient and effective in saving and preventing gaps in pollination. In simple terms, protecting bee habitats or changing pesticide usage is far easier than developing and pouring countless dollars into artificial replacements.

To achieve true environmental sustainability and ecological solvency, actual bees need to be prioritized, and all parties must be held accountable for degrading actions. The solvency of the American agricultural industry and food security across the globe rely on the pollination of bees.

A reality that most farmers can not afford new technologies only furthers the dominance of agricultural monopolies, creating inequalities that could be avoided by simply preserving natural resources and bee populations.

To protect our crops from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and consumption, the U.S. needs to prioritize the ecosystems of pollinators over human demands to avoid the same fate as 14 million years ago.

Without the honey bee, our democracy and values shift from one of the American dream of freedom and prosperity, to a reality of scarcity, degradation and denial.

Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded. To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.

As the first year of working under this new strategy wraps up, growers may still have questions about how these changes will affect their operations. Here is an update and overview to help growers prepare for 2026.

Strategy Overview

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in place since the 1970s; but in April 2022, the EPA began outlining its plan to meet ESA requirements. The primary focus has been on managing spray drift and runoff to reduce the risk of exposure to endangered species. The draft Herbicide Strategy was released in 2023 and finalized in 2024.

The new ESA language must now be included on labels beginning with new active ingredients and as actives are re-registered.

According to the EPA, the final strategy uses the most updated information and processes to determine whether an herbicide will impact a listed species and identify protections to address any impacts. Over time, all crop protection products will carry this language. The Insecticide Strategy was finalized this spring, and the Fungicide Strategy is still in development.

WinField® United has worked closely with industry associations, scientific organizations and our retail partners to advocate that the EPA’s decisions were grounded in sound science and that practical, workable solutions made it to the field.

Impacts on Growers

While there may be implications, this isn’t a fire drill. Not all product labels are immediately subject to the ESA or have the ESA language. It’s an ongoing integration process tied to new products and re-registration.

There are only a couple of labels that currently show the ESA language; and more than likely, it is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the risk bucket and the characteristics of the product, growers may see different mitigations for drift and runoff as well as varying buffer lengths. How it is executed on each label may also be a little bit different.

As new products come out, growers should make sure to read the label and familiarize themselves with the new language ahead of the growing season.

Growers also may have to implement additional mitigation measures, such as spray buffers or conservation practices, to minimize environmental impact. They can get ahead of this by characterizing fields and identifying any existing practices that qualify as mitigations. We assume, for many growers, their fields may already check most of the boxes for the points needed.

A Simple Solution to Help Boost Herbicide Performance

If growers need a drift mitigation option for herbicides affected by the ESA, the new SuperLock™ adjuvant from WinField United fits the bill. This novel, single formulation combines a high surfactant crop oil concentrate with proprietary drift reduction technology. It is one of the only products on the market with this combination.

One of our goals was to provide another product that meets label requirements while effectively tackling the challenge of drift management. From an ESA standpoint, SuperLock adjuvant fits in the oil emulsion category, which is a drift-reducing adjuvant category currently approved under the Herbicide Strategy. This makes it a valuable tank-mix tool to help manage drift for many growers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt55544e1947d08b8e/690c47f6b95521970fd20835/25-WIN-1273_CP-SuperLock-13_FEATURE_1920x1080.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 09:00:55.525336

Treatment plants often use a process called nitrification-denitrification in order to limit the amount of excess nitrogen getting into bodies of water.
With the world population continuing to grow and public sanitary services expanding, reducing the emissions from wastewater treatment plants is an increasingly important necessity for reaching climate targets.","Wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. clean trillions of gallons of water each year. Whatever water gets drained down sinks or flushed down toilets goes through these plants to be rendered clean enough to return to the environment.

A study by researchers from Northwestern University and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign analyzed data from more than 15,000 wastewater treatment facilities – the great majority of all such facilities in the country – to understand the climate costs associated with all this cleaning.

The study estimates that American wastewater treatment plants emit the equivalent of over 50 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. This is expressed as CO2 equivalents because in fact the majority of emissions are in the form of methane and nitrous oxide, which are both powerful greenhouse gases.

Wastewater treatment plants commonly break down solids – like sewage sludge – via anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestors often leak, emitting methane. Treatment plants often use a process called nitrification-denitrification in order to limit the amount of excess nitrogen getting into bodies of water. That process releases nitrous oxide.

The study suggested ways to reduce the emissions from wastewater treatment plants including such actions as identifying and repairing leaks in anaerobic digesters and harvesting nitrogen directly from wastewater for use in products such as fertilizer.

With the world population continuing to grow and public sanitary services expanding, reducing the emissions from wastewater treatment plants is an increasingly important necessity for reaching climate targets.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eb031dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x420+0+57/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F69%2Fbf6df7da40d4b7b9cec77b52fc6c%2Fwater-treatment.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:17.259309

Only 50 kilometres away, in another community, another big automaker has suspended production at a once-revolutionary factory amid weak sales of its only product built for another revolution. The future of 1,100 workers there has been cast into limbo.

Booming St. Thomas, buoyed by Volkswagen’s arrival, and gloomy Ingersoll, a town where General Motors has pulled in its horns, are a relative stone’s throw apart. Yet the two are worlds apart in the anxiety about the future – both excitement and worry – that’s sweeping Southwestern Ontario’s auto belt, a backbone of one of the province’s most important industries.

Article content

Much of the uncertainty stems from President Donald Trump’s push to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S. from abroad, potentially disrupting a Canadian industry tightly integrated with the U.S. and Mexico. Before Trump’s return to the White House, and the trade tensions that followed his tariffs and threatened tariffs against American trading partners, Ontario built about 1.3 million vehicles a year mainly for export to the U.S.

Article content

Another source of uncertainty, and anticipation, one that pre-dates Trump 2.0, is the billions being invested by Big Auto for a shift to electric vehicles and the supply chain they’ll need. It’s a move already reshaping the Southwestern Ontario auto belt that runs from Guelph, Cambridge and Woodstock in the east to Windsor in the west, taking in four auto plants and dozens of parts makers along the Hwy. 401 corridor.

""After decades of dominance by lithium-ion, 2025 is potentially the turning point for long-duration energy storage (LDES), and iron-air batteries are leading the charge,"" Mark says.
The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.
By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.
Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.","“The most exciting clean tech innovation of 2025? It might just be rust.”

That is the assessment of Mark Loveridge, Commercial Director of Renewable Exchange. But Mark’s enthusiasm doesn’t have anything to do with old bike chains or an oven in need of a deep clean.

Instead, people like Mark are getting very excited about the role that rust could play in mitigating climate change.

The problem with renewable energy systems as things stand is, unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies like solar and wind are difficult to store in the quantities we need.

This means that when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, energy supplies run low.

The renewable energy storage problem

For decades, the energy storage conversation has been ruled by the lithium-ion cell, a technology that powers everything from our mobile phones to electric vehicles.

But with 2025 drawing to a close, a chemically distinct contender has emerged from the laboratory to the electrical grid.

""After decades of dominance by lithium-ion, 2025 is potentially the turning point for long-duration energy storage (LDES), and iron-air batteries are leading the charge,"" Mark says.

The premise is elegantly simple, in the way that the world’s best inventions often are. These batteries harness the process of reversible rusting.

During discharge, the battery ""breathes"" in oxygen from the air which converts iron pellets into rust and releases energy.

To charge, an electrical current turns the rust back into metallic iron and the battery ""exhales"" oxygen.

The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries

The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.

While excellent for short bursts of power lasting two to four hours, lithium-ion becomes prohibitively expensive when trying to bridge multi-day gaps in renewable generation.

This is where iron-air technology finds its niche.

""They're capable of storing energy for 100+ hours - enabling wind and solar to keep the lights on, even when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow,"" Mark explains.

By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.

""Ideal for grid-scale decarbonisation, especially during multi-day renewable lulls,"" Mark adds.

From theory to practice

The technology has moved rapidly from theoretical models to concrete infrastructure this year.

""This year, Ore Energy in the Netherlands delivered the world’s first grid-connected iron-air battery, and Form Energy in the US raised over US$400m to bring this tech to commercial scale,"" Mark says.

The Ore Energy pilot, connected to the grid in Delft in July 2025, represents a crucial proof of concept for the European market.

It demonstrates that these systems can be integrated safely into dense urban environments.

Across the Atlantic, Form Energy has operationalised its commercial-scale factory in Weirton, West Virginia, on the site of a former steel mill.

The company is currently fulfilling orders for major utilities, including Xcel Energy and Georgia Power, with projects expected to come online in late 2025 and 2026.

The geopolitics of abundance

Beyond the technical specifications, the iron-air battery offers a significant geopolitical advantage.

The transition to clean energy has often meant trading a dependency on fossil fuels for a dependency on rare earth minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel – all of which are growing scarcer and more contested.

Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.

This abundance translates to stability and security for national energy strategies, reducing conflict and streamlining supply chains.

What’s more, the environmental profile of these batteries aligns closely with circular economy principles simply because their active materials are non-toxic and easily recyclable at the end of the system's life.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/924f9c4aec2cbdefa276e5955b807c30:de82df3e099ad2a5a538121a8fe9b10e/iron-air-battery-arrays-can-be-built-at-huge-scales.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:28.422173

Average administrative costs were €85,000 per application, it said, even higher than the average €32,000 spent to access the EU’s research grant scheme, Horizon Europe.
Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation.
Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”.
The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.","The EU has only paid out a fraction of the money it says it has committed for green technologies, as companies spend up to 3,000 hours and an average €85,000 to access funds from a flagship programme.

Of €7.1bn awarded from the bloc’s Innovation Fund since it was established in 2021, only 4.7% has been paid out to companies because of the red tape required to access the money, according to European Commission figures.

The application process is also extremely lengthy and bureaucratic. In an internal presentation this month, seen by the Financial Times, the commission said that 77% of those seeking funding had to subcontract parts of the application process to consultants because of the “high burden”.

Average administrative costs were €85,000 per application, it said, even higher than the average €32,000 spent to access the EU’s research grant scheme, Horizon Europe.

Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation. Of the projects that had been awarded grants, only 6% were operational, while 15 to 20% face delays.

The hold-ups in disbursing the funds are the latest example of how bureaucracy is stifling the EU’s competitiveness. In a major report last year, the former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi said that administrative burdens were one of the main reasons for Europe’s “static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines”.

The Innovation Fund, which uses revenues generated from the bloc’s emissions trading system, is one of the world’s largest financing programmes “for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies”, the commission claims.

It was touted as one of the main funding platforms to help the bloc compete with the US after former president Joe Biden announced $369bn of funding and tax credits for green technologies through the Inflation Reduction Act.

‘Very low success rate’

Victor van Hoorn, director of trade body Cleantech for Europe, said some businesses have reported spending 3,000 hours on applications to the Innovation Fund — if carried out by one person alone this would be equivalent to more than a year and a half based on the EU’s 36-hour average working week.

“The biggest challenge [we hear] is the amount of resources, the amount of documentation and all of that for a frankly very low success rate,” said van Hoorn.

Eoin Condren, executive director for corporate development at cement company Ecocem, said for its last application to the fund, it had an entire team dedicated to it for five months “costing hundreds of thousands of euros”.

“Large companies can absorb that, but smaller firms developing breakthrough technologies can’t,” he added.

Condren also noted that much of the money went to “big umbrella technologies like [carbon capture and storage] and green hydrogen . . . yet these large, often lossmaking projects are notoriously hard to finance, causing long delays in actually deploying funds”.

An EU official said the low payment rate reflected “the normal or expected implementation milestones for Innovation Fund projects”, adding that “first-of-a-kind projects generally also need more time to reach financial close, be built and enter into operation compared to, for example, research projects”.

“While the application process is demanding, it is also an opportunity to improve the project and the effort is commensurate with the size of the support that is offered,” the official added.

Difficult market conditions

Another issue with the fund is that market conditions in Europe make it difficult even for companies that receive grants to establish themselves and turn a profit.

Vianode, a company making low-carbon synthetic graphite for electric vehicle batteries, was awarded a €90mn grant in 2023 but decided not to go through with its European facility because of the flood of cheap Chinese graphite into the market. It instead set up in Canada, where it secured an offtake agreement with General Motors.

“In the end it comes down to what price you can compete for and with the Chinese dominance, the European market is very, very challenging for us now. It’s different in North America: there the battery producers have an incentive to choose non-Chinese,” said Andreas Forfang, vice-president for sustainability and public affairs at Vianode.

Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”. Its application rounds were often several times subscribed, he said, adding that “the way the money is currently given is not fit for purpose”.

The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.

But van Hoorn said the small proportion that had so far been paid out showed that “most money is just sitting there due to complex milestones” resulting in a “huge opportunity cost” for the EU.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/3yre6k-2025-chevrolet-equinox-ev-front-left-4.26.25.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/2025_Chevrolet_Equinox_EV_front_left_4.26.25.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:53.746728

As President Donald Trump nears the end of his second term’s first year, policies he’s implemented will affect how that plays out.

“They're really just taking a fine-tooth comb and looking at every single thing — whether that be justifiable, whether that be a knee-jerk reaction to, ‘Well this came out of the previous administration, so we want to see it,’” an EPA employee who works on water issues said while discussing how the Trump administration oversees the department.

Radio IQ is not identifying the federal employee — who’s been with the agency for more than 20 years — to protect them from potential retribution for speaking with media.

During the recent government shutdown, the employee said all functions of the department critical to public health remained in operation. They added that EPA leadership has been clear that the department will “be doing things that we are statutorily required to do.”

That doesn’t mean the tenor of the office hasn’t changed.

“Let's say, we've got a proposal or a project that is focused on providing resources and information related to climate change effects,” they said. “Instead of focusing on ‘climate change,’ let's talk about ‘extreme weather events.’ We've been talking [about] ‘sunny day flooding.’ … It's climate-change effects, but we don't just say the blanket term, ‘climate change.’”

Dozens of executive orders and federal policy changes have impacted funding for environmental initiatives, but the EPA employee said it’s going to take more time to see the real effects of those adjustments.

The changes are still being assessed in Virginia, too.

“We don't yet have that full picture of how all of the programs we rely on will be impacted,” said Adrienne Kotula, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, while discussing the impact of changing federal funding on cleanup measures. “We're certainly keeping track of it at the federal level on a case-by-case basis. But the full scope of everything is yet to be seen.”

Another unknown is the availability and accuracy of federal data; Kotula pointed specifically to information from the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She said the annual release of pertinent data is just beginning and she’d “start taking the longer view of what's available to us, and how we need to adjust moving forward — and whether or not that's necessary.”

In that vacuum, state lawmakers have begun prefiling proposed legislation for the upcoming General Assembly session that begins on Jan. 14. Among those bills are a few introduced by Democrats focused on energy efficiency and home weatherization, as well as allowing solar canopy requirements in some nonresidential parking developments.

In contrast, Republican lawmakers are aiming to repeal some restrictions on single-use polystyrene food containers and ease penalties on utilities if they’re unable to meet renewable energy portfolio standards.

Trump has maintained his policies will bring down utility bills, though recent data refutes that. The administration also has asserted lower gasoline prices are the result of its “commitment to American energy production.”

A former advisor to President George W. Bush recently told Politico that Trump “could claim an assist, not a total responsibility, for lower oil prices.”

“The actions that this administration is taking [has] set us back decades,” said Lee Francis, chief program and communications officer at the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. “The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ reversed almost entirely the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest piece of climate legislation ever passed in our nation's history. And in doing so, it undermined … investment in Virginia, set us back years on our climate goals and is going to raise energy costs.”

Francis interpreted November’s election results to mean voters were concerned about affordability and energy costs, swinging control of state government to Democrats after four years under Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.
Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).
Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.
For additional information: Navigating supply chain carbon risks in South Korea","Scope 1 emissions are associated with direct inputs to a production process and are under the control of a manufacturing company. Scope 2 emissions arise indirectly from purchased energy and inputs needed to produce a product, and Scope 3 emissions represent the embedded carbon from Scope 1 and 2 activities that were required to manufacture finished goods.

“The inclusion of indirect GHG emissions, such as Scope 2 and 3, could substantially increase supply chain carbon risks, including investment aversion, higher carbon cost exposure, and counterparty and reputational risks” said report author Michelle (Chaewon) Kim, IEEFA’s Energy Finance Specialist, South Korea.

IEEFA’s analysis shows that South Korea’s leading chip maker, Samsung Device Solutions (DS), recorded Scope 1–3 emissions of approximately 41 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2024 - the highest among seven major global tech companies — with a carbon intensity of 539 tCO2e per USD million of revenue.

Another South Korean chip manufacturer, SK Hynix, recorded a carbon intensity of around 246 tCO2e/USD million.

These emission levels compare unfavourably with those of the global Big Tech companies purchasing these chips. For example, Apple has a carbon intensity of around 37 tCO2e/USD million, while Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have carbon intensities of 67 tCO2e/USD million and 107 tCO2e/USD million, respectively.

These reflect their global strategies to maximise clean energy use and minimise GHG intensity across complete supply chains.

South Korea’s economy is highly dependent on international trade, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Intensifying supply chain carbon risks could significantly impact national economic viability.

The report examines how carbon regulations, including carbon taxes, emissions trading systems (ETSs), the European Union’s (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and voluntary carbon management initiatives, could undermine South Korea’s export competitiveness by increasing domestic carbon costs.

Although semiconductors are currently exempt from the EU CBAM, and Scope 2 and 3 are omitted, their inclusion in the future could impose significant expense.

IEEFA estimates that South Korean chip importers could face approximately $588 million (KRW847 billion) in CBAM certificate expenses between 2026 and 2034.

“The sharp increase in CBAM costs may prompt European importers to switch their chip suppliers from high-emission South Korean producers to low-carbon suppliers” added Ms Kim.

IEEFA conducted a scenario-based case study, assuming the inclusion of semiconductors in the EU CBAM’s scope.

The analysis estimates the CBAM certificate costs using an Embedded Emission Factor (EEF) that covers the entire supply chain (Scope 1–3). It applies an embedded carbon intensity based on value rather than mass, using annual GHG emissions and revenues to determine the value-based EEF, reflecting the lightweight and high-value characteristics of semiconductors.

“An estimated $162 million (KRW233 billion) of CBAM certificate expenses could be incurred in 2034 under the high EU ETS scenario” said Ms Kim. This equates to 9.9 percent of the total chip exports to the EU.

Investors are increasingly excluding carbon-intensive companies from their portfolios, which could limit access to financing for high-carbon emitters, raising the cost of capital and reducing corporate valuations.

According to IEEFA’s analysis, if Scope 2 and 3 emissions were included in the South Korean ETS, Samsung DS’s carbon costs under the current 10 percent paid allocation system would be $26 million.

If free allowances are removed and companies pay 100 percent of their allocation in the future, the ETS expenditure could increase tenfold to $264 million.

Rising carbon costs in liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered semiconductor clusters and fossil fuel-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could further increase counterparty risks and production expenses, particularly if LNG is later included in the CBAM scope.

High-emission companies risk exclusion from global supply chains. Countries heavily reliant on fossil fuels may also face the ‘exodus risk’ of companies relocating to more low-carbon-friendly nations.

Leading global tech companies are adopting low-carbon supply chain strategies to reduce indirect Scope 3 emissions, such as Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Programme and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) Collective Procurement Programme.

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.

Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).

Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.

As the demand for renewable energy solutions continues to surge, the industry is battling a widening skills gap that must be addressed quickly to meet global carbon emission goals.

In this blog, we delve into the pressing issue of talent shortages within the renewable energy sector, examining the causes, implications, and viable solutions to ensure companies and stakeholders are well-equipped to thrive in this rapidly changing industry.

The Energy Transition

The energy transition refers to the global shift from traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources to sustainable and renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Governments, businesses, and communities are pushing this shift to cut emissions and fight climate change. As a result, the energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, as the diversification of energy sources calls for rapid industry growth.

This increased focus on renewable energy has created a surge in demand for skilled professionals with expertise in areas such as solar panel installation, wind turbine maintenance, energy storage systems, and grid integration. There’s a growing need for specialised talent to design, build, operate, and maintain renewable energy infrastructure. As a result, traditional energy companies, as well as new entrants in the renewable sector, are aggressively competing for a limited pool of qualified candidates.

The growth rate in the energy transition also outpaces the learning and development of candidates who lack the necessary skills and expertise. The evolution of technologies and regulations in the renewable energy space is forcing the industry to adapt quickly, often leaving a gap for professionals with up-to-date knowledge and qualifications. Equally, the retirement of experienced workers from the conventional energy sector and the inadequate pipeline of new talent entering the renewable energy workforce have made the shortage of skilled labour much more significant.

Advancing Technologies and Innovation

Advancing technologies and innovation in renewable energy have undoubtedly revolutionised the industry, but have also created a significant skills gap and talent shortage. Renewable technologies like solar, wind, and storage are evolving fast - faster than the workforce can keep up. capable of implementing, maintaining, and advancing these technologies. As a result, companies in the renewable energy sector are facing a shortage of qualified professionals with the necessary expertise to drive these innovations forward.

Traditional educational programmes and workforce development initiatives have struggled to keep pace with these changes, leading to a shortage of professionals with the right skills and knowledge.

Equally, the increasing complexity of renewable energy systems requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. This demand for a diverse skill set further exacerbates the talent shortage as companies struggle to find individuals with the necessary combination of technical, analytical, and strategic capabilities.

Navigating Talent Shortages to Ensure Secure Renewable Pipelines

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will need to create 14 million new renewable energy jobs by 2030 and move another 16 million workers to renewable energy roles. To grow sustainably, companies need to tackle the talent shortage head-on. . As the demand for renewable jobs continues to outpace the supply of skilled professionals, companies must focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent.

Investing and Nurturing Talent

Investing in specialised training programmes, partnerships with educational institutions, and apprenticeship initiatives can help build a pipeline of skilled workers equipped to meet the industry's evolving needs. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the organisation can empower existing employees to upskill and adapt to the changing technological landscape.

Not only does this train any new recruits into the industry, but it also offers those in different sectors with a wealth of experience the chance to diversify from other energy industries and bring the skills and knowledge they already have to the renewable sector.

Time and cost are real concerns - but the sooner companies invest in training, the faster they’ll build a strong talent pipeline.. One of the key offerings that companies can provide is specialised technical training. Courses on solar power systems, wind turbine technology, energy storage solutions, and other renewable energy technologies equip individuals with in-depth knowledge. With this expertise, they can effectively contribute to the design, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.

Learning and development can provide access to up-to-date information on industry standards, policies, and best practices, ensuring that talent is well-informed and compliant with industry requirements.

Mentorship and coaching programmes can also be invaluable for talent development. Companies can facilitate mentorship opportunities with seasoned professionals in the renewable energy sector, providing guidance and insight to support the career growth of less-experienced individuals.

Defining Company Culture

Defining a compelling employer brand and nurturing a distinct company culture can be the difference between attracting top-tier talent and falling behind the competition.

Renewable energy talent is drawn to organisations that cultivate a positive, inclusive, and supportive work environment. A company's mission, vision, and values should not just be words on paper but resonate authentically in every interaction and initiative.

Culture shapes every part of the employee experience—from hiring to retention. Prioritising cultural fit is paramount when it comes to renewable energy recruitment. During any talent acquisition efforts, companies should emphasise the importance of their culture and align it alongside the skills and experience they require to attract their ideal candidates.

EVP

An employer value proposition (EVP) encapsulates the unique rewards and benefits that differentiate a company from its competitors. By pinpointing organisational strengths, such as distinctive benefits, an inclusive company culture, unparalleled career growth avenues, or flexible work structures, companies can craft a compelling EVP that delivers an authentic look at what working life will be like for the next new employee.

EVP pairs closely with the employer brand. A robust employer brand celebrates diversity, champions innovation, and prioritises employee well-being. To attract top talent and potential hires, companies should prominently spotlight these attributes on their websites, social media, job descriptions, and throughout the interview process.

Note: An EVP is only as impactful as its reach. Ensure EVP permeates all company touchpoints, from job postings and websites to social media channels. An EVP that stands out can significantly amplify talent attraction strategy.

Authentic employer branding begins with the current workforce. Employees naturally evolve into brand ambassadors when they feel valued, engaged, and genuinely content in their roles. Their enthusiasm and pride amplify an employer brand, which will help companies build a reputation as a go-to employer within the industry.

One study found that around 70% of prospective employees would turn down job opportunities if the company offering the position had a bad reputation—even if they were out of work. This emphasises the need to invest in and uphold a stellar employer brand rooted in genuine employee experiences and organisational values.

Benefits also play a key role. These could include a competitive salary, bonuses, annual leave, health insurance, hybrid working, and more.

Streamlining Talent Acquisition Strategies

As competition for attracting top talent in the renewable energy recruitment space grows, streamlining the talent acquisition strategy is another step towards increasing your chances of hiring the people you require, whether permanent or contract.

Speed matters. In today’s market, delays can cost you the best candidates. By refining and accelerating the recruitment process, companies can swiftly identify, engage with, and onboard the best talent before competitors get there first.

Analysing the existing process and identifying any bottlenecks is key to speeding up the process. This could be the time it takes to get back to a candidate to offer them a position, potentially taking too long to post job specs or review candidate CVs. Once it’s been determined what could be costing the most time and resources, companies should optimise these without compromising the integrity of their hiring standards.

First impressions matter: As part of the strategy for attracting talent, it's crucial to remember that this is a candidate's first interaction with an organisation - and first impressions count. An efficient, organised, and transparent hiring process instils confidence in candidates and bolsters an organisation's reputation in the talent market.

Thinking about first impressions isn't just referring to the interview stage, where a company meets the candidate for the first time in person or through a virtual call. Their first impression could come at any moment, from renewable energy job specs, social posts, websites or through word of mouth. Ensuring a brand gives off the right impression across all channels is vital, as you never know when a candidate could be interacting with the company and gaining a first impression.

The Job Listing Experience

Streamlining the application process demonstrates respect for candidates' time and enhances their overall experience with the organisation. For in-demand talent, a seamless job process can be a decisive factor in choosing one employer over another.

Transparent job advertisements are crucial for attracting qualified candidates and building trust with potential employees.

By clearly outlining the job responsibilities, requirements, and company culture, transparent job adverts set realistic expectations and ensure that candidates understand what the role entails. This transparency not only helps attract candidates whose skills and values align with the position but also reduces the likelihood of mismatches and turnover, which in turn causes further delays in securing the best talent.

While job boards remain crucial to talent acquisition, the sheer volume can be overwhelming for active and passive candidates. Strategically selecting platforms that align with the renewable industry nuances and the specific roles being targeted will lead to a more robust talent pool better fitted to the required roles.

In today's digital age, leveraging social media also amplifies the reach of job posts. Platforms like LinkedIn, X, and industry-specific forums can serve as excellent channels to showcase job vacancies, reaching passive and active job seekers alike.

Attracting top talent is about being clear, specific, and compelling - right from the job post. . A well-articulated job description can be the first step in forging meaningful connections with potential hires, setting the stage for successful collaborations in the renewable energy industry.

Finding the Right Partner

For a company, getting talent acquisition right can be an impossible task. The specialised nature of roles within the renewable energy sector often demands candidates with a unique blend of technical expertise, industry-specific knowledge, and a deep understanding of sustainability practices. This requires a rigorous talent acquisition process, which many companies don’t have the time or expertise for.

A high-performing hiring team is instrumental in attracting top talent. Therefore, companies need to ensure their HR and recruitment teams are equipped with the necessary tools, training, and resources to execute their roles effectively.

Many organisations turn to recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) as a partner to support with talent acquisition. These organisations can offer their vast expertise to ensure these technical roles are filled quickly and compliantly. Often, they also have an extensive talent pool already.

A staffing provider can offer invaluable support to a company grappling with talent demands in several ways:

Specialised Recruitment Expertise: RPO providers are equipped with specialised knowledge and expertise in identifying and attracting top talent in various fields, including renewable energy. They can efficiently source, screen, and present qualified candidates, saving the company time and resources in the hiring process.

Access to a Diverse Talent Pool: These providers often have access to a vast network of professionals, including those with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies and sustainability. This can significantly expand the company's options and increase the likelihood of finding the right fit for their specific talent needs quickly.

Flexibility and Scalability: They can offer flexible staffing solutions to help companies manage fluctuating talent demands. Whether the need is for short-term project-based roles or long-term strategic positions, staffing providers can tailor their services to meet the company's evolving requirements.

(TSX:NDM)(NYSE American:NAK) (""Northern Dynasty"" or the ""Company"") and its 100%-owned U.S.-based subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership (""Pebble Partnership"") announce that the National Mining Association (""NMA""), the American Exploration & Mining Association (""AEMA""), the Alaska Mining Association (""AMA"") and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the ""Chamber"") have filed Amicus Briefs in the Alaska Federal Court in support of one of the largest undeveloped copper projects in the world, located in the U.S., which is being blocked by an illegal Obama/Biden veto.

""We appreciate the important support from the NMA, the AEMA, the AMA and the Chamber, as we fight back against the injustice of the illegal Obama/Biden-era veto,"" Ron Thiessen, Northern Dynasty President and CEO stated. ""The Obama EPA dreamed up this scheme to handicap future mining activity in the U.S., and the Biden EPA put this injustice into action without regard to the economic harm it could cause to all Americans.""

The NMA, AEMA and AMA summarize their argument with:

""…This case is exceptionally important to amici's members, the mining industry, and the nation's economy. The proposed mine-which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has unlawfully vetoed-will provide a crucial source of copper for construction, transportation, electrical and electronic projects, industrial machinery, and defense applications. Copper also plays an inextricable role in nearly all forms of renewable energy. The EPA's aggressive and unprecedented use of a regulatory veto comes just as the world prepares for a global shortage of copper and other minerals due to the surging demands of digitalization and electrification. While the United States has one of the world's greatest mineral repositories, the ability to get those minerals into the supply chain to help meet America's needs is threatened by crippling regulatory uncertainty, including the overly broad nature of EPA's asserted authority.

The misuse of EPA's veto authority casts a cloud over mining projects in Alaska and beyond. Regulatory obstacles to mineral development harm not only the U.S. mining industry, but also domestic manufacturing, innovation, and security… Amici and their members need certainty in the federal regulatory landscape governing mining operations and urge the Court to hold EPA to its statutory mandate and to prior interpretations and practice.""

Major arguments in the Chamber's brief include:

""…EPA vetoed a permit that is a crucial prerequisite for construction of the Pebble Mine...without considering the significant financial consequences of that veto for the project proponents, the State, and the national economy...""

""…Congress' instruction to EPA in Section 404(c)-that the agency evaluate whether effects are ""unacceptable"" before exercising backstop authority-is a paradigmatic demand that regulation proceed only after a reasoned consideration of costs. The statutory term ""unacceptable"" rivals those adjectives that the Supreme Court has already determined to ""naturally"" embrace a consideration of costs before an agency chooses to regulate…""

""…EPA ignored these principles by straining to read the word ""unacceptable"" out of Section 404(c). But the sheer ingenuity of the agency's reading underscores that it cannot be the ""best"" interpretation of Section 404(c) and therefore cannot justify EPA's decision…""

""…EPA's approach would turn the principles of reasoned decision-making inside out. It would encourage agencies not only to view the consequences of their actions through a keyhole-ignoring even sizeable costs of those actions-but also to shield that evaluation behind the Potemkin rationale of an ""alternative basis."" The upshot would be bad regulation badly explained. Nobody is well served when EPA erases a project of Pebble's magnitude and importance after (at most) feigning to check the price tag, and project developers, in particular, are likely to confront a chilled investment climate and other injuries to their reliance interests if the agency's approach is upheld…""

""...The Court should set aside EPA's veto and emphasize the importance of considering costs to determinations made under Section 404(c)…""

However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.
After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House.
Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD).
Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes.","The tense relationship between the Executive branch and Congress has led President Lula’s administration to reassess its strategy and increasingly see the Judiciary as a safe haven against potential setbacks imposed by lawmakers.

Recently, as tensions between the branches have escalated, the government has begun to consider bringing at least three cases to court after facing defeats in the Lower House and the Senate. However, this approach contradicts President Lula’s repeated message that the government should avoid litigation in politics.

One of the issues that may be brought to the Supreme Court is in the economic field. Last week, the Finance Ministry’s number two, Dario Durigan, indicated that the government is considering whether to go to court if Congress advances so-called “fiscal bomb” proposals—measures with severe negative effects on government finances.

His remarks came days after the Senate approved a supplementary bill with a multibillion fiscal impact that regulates the special retirement rules for community health agents and endemic-control workers. The bill guarantees these workers retirement at their last full salary (integrality) with adjustments equal to those granted to active civil servants (parity), and it establishes their own age and service-time requirements. The proposal is criticized by public-finance experts and is seen as a dangerous precedent for the sustainability of Brazil’s pension system.

Initially, the government was optimistic that the bill would not be brought to the floor by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, who had been considered an ally of the Lula administration in Congress. However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.

After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House. Some government members argue there is still room to negotiate the details, but they are also preparing for litigation amid rising tensions and no signs of de-escalation.

Although the Finance Ministry had already opposed the proposal, it passed without any dissenting votes or speeches, uniting members of both allied and opposition parties. In response, Durigan said on the 26th that the three branches “cannot throw everything away” after a joint effort by all institutions.

Another issue considered crucial for the administration is the environmental licensing bill. On Thursday (27), Congress overturned 52 of the 63 vetoes issued by Lula. The move was mainly driven by the agribusiness caucus and business sectors opposed to the vetoes. The government had long expected the possibility of the vetoes being overturned, but Congress postponed the session until after COP30—the climate conference held in Belém this month—in an attempt to minimize damage to the Legislature’s image.

A vote on the remaining vetoes was delayed indefinitely. As a result, most of the new Environmental Licensing Law—approved by Congress in July and criticized by environmentalists and the federal government’s environmental agency—now takes effect.

Lula is set to discuss the issue with the Environment Ministry and the Chief of Staff Office to explore legal options and potential actions. Environmental groups and left-wing parties have already threatened to bring the overturned vetoes to the Supreme Court.

A third proposal on the Executive branch’s radar is the anti-gang bill. The version drafted by rapporteur Guilherme Derrite was approved in the Lower House on the 18th, despite the government’s efforts to revise several parts of the report. The Planalto Palace now hopes to reverse the outcome in the Senate, but it already acknowledges, behind the scenes, that it has grounds to challenge key sections of Derrite’s report in court if the bill moves forward in its current form and reaches the president for signature.

The government’s main arguments are outlined in a report prepared by the Justice Ministry and obtained by Valor. The document states, for example, that the lawmaker’s proposal would violate the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD). There is also debate over whether Derrite can redesign these constitutionally mandated security funds using ordinary law.

Turning to the courts is not new for the Lula administration. In July, at the president’s own request, the Attorney General’s Office (AGU) filed a petition with the Supreme Court to reinstate the decree that increased the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) rates. At the time, Messias argued that Congress violated the separation of powers by overturning an executive decree and that AGU’s only option was to “defend” the president’s autonomy.

Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes. At the start of his third term on January 27, during a meeting with governors, he said he would “work and talk extensively” to ensure each branch has the autonomy to carry out its functions. He then told party leaders to avoid “litigating politics.”

“We are responsible for so much litigation,” Lula said at the time. “When we lose something in Congress, instead of accepting the rules of democratic play—that the majority wins—we appeal to another branch to see if we can win there.” He added, “We need to stop doing politics this way, because it leads the Judiciary to intrude on the Legislative and start legislating in Congress’s place.”

In 2025, Lula reaffirmed that stance. At the opening of the 26th March to Brasília in Defense of Municipalities in May, he urged mayors and lawmakers to settle federal disputes “at the negotiating table, not in the courts.” He added: “Issues should only go to the Judiciary when our political capacity is exhausted—when we show ourselves unable to continue negotiating to find a peaceful solution.”

Despite the government’s apparent contradiction of turning to the courts, experts interviewed by Valor say the move makes sense when Congress violates the Constitution. “It is absolutely consistent to appeal to the Supreme Court, particularly when Congress pushes political issues forward in the face of constitutional prohibitions. One example is the conditional impossibility of granting amnesty,” said Fernando Augusto Fernandes, a researcher and attorney with a PhD in Political Science at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF). “We must distinguish litigation from the unconstitutional politicization of Congress’s relationship with the Executive branch,” Fernandes said.

In a recent interview with Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, Morocco's Minister for Industry and Trade, Ryad Mezzour, delved deeper into Morocco's ambitious plans and the strategies underpinning its ascent in the global battery industry. Please note that this interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Platts: Could you elaborate on how Morocco is positioning itself as a key player in global battery supply chains and the production of electric vehicles?

Ryad Mezzour: Our strategy originated from Europe's commitment to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable mobility by 2035. Fifteen years ago, under the leadership of His Majesty [King Mohammed VI], we established a comprehensive ecosystem for car manufacturing, primarily targeting the European market. To remain competitive, we recognized the necessity of electrifying our production and integrating into the battery value chain. This journey began approximately six or seven years ago, during which we focused on developing the entire supply chain -- from raw materials to finished vehicles -- to meet the integration requirements for products exported from Morocco to Europe under our free trade agreement. We identified several key assets: abundant mineral resources, strong energy capabilities, competitive advantages, and a strategic response to commercial tensions at that time. Our strategy is clear: we have the capacity to produce 1 million cars annually and must ensure we can supply all necessary batteries. If we have excess production, we plan to deliver these batteries to our regional partners, effectively providing them with alternatives to the solutions currently available only in Asia. Our goal is to establish Morocco as a hub for producing battery components and electric vehicle batteries, encompassing the entire value chain rather than focusing solely on gigafactories.

Platts: What specific policies has the Moroccan government introduced to support this strategy?

Ryad Mezzour: We have created a global ecosystem to support all investments in Morocco. While there is no specific support program exclusively for batteries, we do offer competitive advantages. Firstly, Morocco is the world's leading reserve of phosphate, which aligns with the growing demand for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) technology in batteries. The availability of phosphate and phosphoric acid makes Morocco a key player, as we are one of the largest exporters of these commodities. Secondly, we have strategically developed our renewable energy resources, allowing us to produce energy at competitive prices. In fact, Morocco stands out in this region for its competitiveness in renewable energy production. Additionally, we have a proven track record in manufacturing a wide range of complex materials, including fertilizers, automotive components, and even aircraft engines. This capability demonstrates that Morocco is an industrial country equipped to deliver sophisticated manufacturing solutions. When considering all these factors -- talent, energy resources, material availability, and world-class infrastructure -- Morocco is uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive solutions in this region.

Platts: Given the competitive landscape for investment, what incentives does Morocco offer to foreign companies, particularly in the areas of mining and battery manufacturing?

Ryad Mezzour: For mining companies, the most compelling incentive is access to abundant resources. This is a significant factor for investors. For manufacturing, we provide support in terms of infrastructure development and facilitating trade. In some cases, we can arrange co-investments with Moroccan partners, which helps foreign investors feel more secure, especially if they are unfamiliar with the local market dynamics. However, the incentives for the mining industry are generally less pronounced than for other sectors due to the inherent rights associated with resource access. We also offer some of the most competitive renewable energy rates available today.

Platts: What are Morocco's long-term goals for its battery industry? What specific milestones is the government aiming to achieve?

Ryad Mezzour: We have already begun exporting precursors since January 2025. By June 2026, we expect to produce our first battery cells and modules. Batteries are already being assembled in several of our original equipment manufacturers' (OEMs') plants. Additionally, we will have our first battery management systems, electrolytes, and separators ready early next year, with anodes expected by the second quarter. Our complete value chain will be operational to serve between 400,000 and 500,000 cars annually, potentially by the third or fourth quarter of 2026.

Platts: Does Morocco have the necessary ports, roads, and other infrastructure to support these projects, or will additional development be required?",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:01.652830

Fusion energy is the same sort that powers the sun. And, as the International Atomic Energy Agency has explained, nuclear fusion occurs when two light atoms combine to form a heavier atom, releasing a lot of energy.

If we could harness this reaction, we might be able to generate more of the energy we need while transitioning away from less sustainable sources. But there have been obstacles standing in the way of problem-free fusion development. For example, even the tiniest wisp of air can stop a fusion reaction, as experts noted in Power Magazine.

Now, Commonwealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts says it is creating a container to keep a fusion reaction entirely airtight. The company has called this a ""vacuum vessel,"" describing the 48-ton steel container as ""instrumental,"" as CFS works toward ""large-scale commercial fusion energy."" As of late October, the first half of the vessel had been delivered.

""This is a really exciting time,"" said Brandon Sorbom, a CFS co-founder and its chief science officer, in a news release. ""It's a big moment for us because we have a big piece of hardware showing up, but it's also just a really big moment for the industry.""

While furthering fusion energy is an exciting prospect for many, researchers don't have all the kinks worked out just yet. There are still major obstacles to address in terms of sustaining and containing a fusion reaction that puts out more energy than it takes in — and doing so cost-effectively.

Nuclear fusion could one day create tremendous amounts of carbon-pollution-free electricity without the dangerous, long-lasting radioactive waste of today's nuclear fission reactors. But the technology to make a commercially viable fusion plant does not exist yet.

Still, if developers can effectively address these concerns, we could be looking at a more diverse and resilient energy mix down the line, with the potential to lower utility bills and mitigate the heat-trapping pollution that impacts air quality and drives rising global temperatures.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YCxgJUclKNTooauw49c78w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/109cafbf95cb2cf96d8a034fc6f38eb0,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:10.633941

Driver: Rapid digital substation deployment in accordance with IEC 61850 standards

The quick implementation of digital substations in accordance with IEC 61850 standards will lead to a major boost in the merging unit market globally. Since utilities and grid operators move digital substations, the demand for merging units, which collect and digitize analog signals of traditional instrument transformers, will drastically rise. Its growth is supported by the implementation of IEC 61850 Edition 2.1 that suggests the introduction of enhanced interoperability, real-time monitoring, and enhanced cybersecurity measures in mixed-vendor settings. Main solutions such as PCM600 and IET600 of Hitachi Energy are certified under this new edition, which simplifies the engineering and configuration of the digital substations, which enhances integration of merging units and its project implementation is quicker. Moreover, digital substations can provide high cost savings, safety improvement, and asset management. The shift to process bus architectures and virtualized protection and control systems continue to enhance the pace of merging unit implementation in upgrades and new projects in the brownfield. Other recent implementations have shown decreases in engineering labor, cabling downsizing, and increased reliability, which has enabled transition to the concept of unmanned substations and remote diagnostics. All in all, the increased pace of digitalization and greater IEC 61850 compliance is turning the merging units into the necessity of the present-day power grids.

Restraint: Limited technical expertise to support digital protection systems

One of the limitations on the integration of the unit market is the lack of qualified specialists familiar with the IEC 61850-based protection, sampling and substation automation. Most utilities, particularly in developing areas, do not have engineers who have been trained on the configuration, commissioning and maintenance of the sample-value systems. These skills cut short down the speed of digital substation projects, drives up commissioning expenses, and extends project schedules. Consequently, areas with untrained engineers might be reluctant to install digital substations in units of merging format, which restricts expansion in the market. In the case of merging units, this shortage of skilled workforce poses major obstacles. The misalignment between MU output and protection IED logic, the incorrect configuration of SV streams or poor time synchronization (PTP/IEEE 1588), as well as improper time synchronization between the volumetric signal and the protective relay itself may endanger the reliability of the system. Reports at utilities have been made at the Digital Substation forums, which have reported incidences of commissioning delays due to the lack of expertise in dealing with MU interoperability among vendors. This adds costs to the projects, protracts commissioning schedules, and reduces the level of trust in digital substitution adoption.

Opportunity: Massive retrofit potential in aging transmission & distribution infrastructure

The aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure worldwide presents a massive retrofit opportunity for the merging unit market. Many existing substations are based on legacy analog technology, which is costly to maintain, less reliable, and lacks the flexibility required for modern grid demands. Retrofitting these substations with digital elements such as merging units enables utilities to extend the life of their assets while modernizing essential functions without complete replacement. Merging units are critical in this retrofit trend by bridging the gap between conventional instrument transformers and the digital protection and control IEDs compliant with IEC 61850 standards. They convert analog signals from existing transformers into digital data streams transmitted over optical fiber or Ethernet-based process buses. This approach allows utilities to retain primary equipment while gaining the substantial benefits of digital substations, including enhanced safety, reduced wiring complexity, smaller physical footprint, and improved data accuracy for protection and monitoring. The retrofit potential is underscored by the urgency of upgrading aging grids to accommodate increasing renewable energy integration, decentralized generation, and smart grid functionalities. A fully digital or hybrid substation architecture increases system resilience, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity, and critical aspects as grids become more complex.

Challenge: Stringent cybersecurity requirements to protect merging units as critical interfaces in digital substations

Stringent cybersecurity requirements have become a major challenge for the merging unit market as digital substations increasingly rely on Ethernet based communication for protection and control. Merging units transmit high speed sampled value data and GOOSE messages, making them critical points in the substation’s communication chain. Research highlights that IEC 61850 communication, while efficient, was not originally designed with strong built in security. This creates vulnerabilities where attackers could spoof or manipulate sampled values or protection messages, potentially causing false trips, relay mis operations, or blocking protection functions. IEC 62351 provides guidelines for securing these communications through authentication and encryption, but many existing IEDs and merging units still lack full compliance, especially in real time environments where even milliseconds of delay can compromise system performance. Implementing cybersecurity in process bus networks adds further complexity for utilities and vendors. Adding cryptographic protection can introduce latency, requiring merging units to balance security with the strict timing needs of protection systems. In addition, utilities must deploy certificate management systems, secure key handling processes, and continuous monitoring to protect multivendor IEC 61850 systems. This significantly increases cost and engineering effort, particularly in regions where OT cybersecurity expertise is limited. As a result, the need to meet rigorous cybersecurity demands slows down merging unit adoption and complicates digital substation deployment.

With the international policy favoring renewable energy and the falling prices of wind and solar energy technologies and the rising investments in intelligent grids, the renewable energy sector is creating a wave of demand among the merging unit.

Merging Unit, By Type

The merging unit market is segmented by application into standalone and integrated merging units. The requirement on individual merging units is expanding as utilities and industrial operators move to flexible and modular digital substations architectures. Standalone merging units are more adaptable as opposed to integrated solutions, which are usually specific to protection and control systems. Therefore, they can be used in greenfield and brownfield substations. They enable utilities to upgrade existing substations without changing all remaining legacy equipment, which can incrementally upgrade the substation, minimizing costs and time. Standalone MUs are also interoperable with multivendor IEC 61850 devices, which makes them efficient in utilities requiring to have standardized and future-proof solutions which can easily be integrated with various protection relays, bay control units, and SCADA systems. The capability of standalone merging units to make installation simpler and make physical wiring complex is another important reason behind its growth. Standalone MUs improve accuracy of protection and data quality to monitor. They expand the system more easily and especially in areas with high renewable energy integration or in areas with swelling distribution networks. The federation of retrofit flexibility, cost reduction and facilitation of the present-day digital substitution modernization contributes to the increasing number of standalone merging unit implementation in utilities and industrial setups globally.

Merging Unit, By Configuration

The with relay output configuration is the fastest-growing segment in the merging unit market due to its ability to combine digital measurement with direct protection functionality. Merging units with relay outputs digitize current and voltage signals for transmission over IEC 61850 process bus and provide direct tripping or control signals to circuit breakers and other protective devices. This eliminates the need for additional standalone relays in certain applications, simplifying system architecture and reducing installation and wiring costs. Utilities and industrial operators increasingly prefer this configuration because it supports faster fault detection and response, which is critical in modern high-speed protection schemes, especially in grids with high renewable penetration or complex network topologies. Furthermore, merging units with relay outputs offer higher reliability and easier integration in new and retrofit projects. They enable multivendor interoperability, ensuring that the merging unit can work seamlessly with various IEDs while maintaining compliance with IEC 61850 standards. This flexibility is particularly attractive for utilities modernizing aging substations without a full system overhaul. The growing emphasis on digital substations, enhanced automation, and reduced maintenance complexity drives adoption of this configuration.

Sleek Teslas cruising along Sheikh Zayed Road, Porsche Taycans parked in Downtown Dubai, and EQS models gliding silently through Marina are now common sights. The shift toward electric luxury cars represents more than a technological trend; it reflects the UAE’s evolving vision for mobility, sustainability, and modern urban living.

A Changing Mindset Toward Sustainable Luxury

As the UAE moves toward cleaner and smarter energy solutions, residents have begun to rethink what luxury means. Traditionally, performance and exclusivity defined luxury cars. Today, environmental consciousness and quiet refinement also play significant roles. Electric models deliver instant torque, futuristic cabin design, and a calm driving experience qualities that align well with the lifestyle of cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Accessibility Through Premium Market Options

Electric luxury cars have become more attainable due to the increasing availability of high-end EV models across rental and ownership markets. Many travelers explore these cars during their stay, which also contributes to rising interest. Editorial sources often mention platforms such as the GTR Luxury official site, where enthusiasts learn about premium vehicle options as part of their planning. This exposure helps more people experience electric mobility without committing to long-term ownership.

Government Initiatives Accelerate Adoption

The UAE government has played a significant role in encouraging electric vehicle usage. Free parking incentives, toll exemptions, and charging infrastructure expansions have all influenced buying and renting decisions. Dubai alone has installed hundreds of public charging points through DEWA’s Green Charger initiative, making EVs more practical for daily use. These measures create a supportive ecosystem where luxury electric models can thrive.

Charging Infrastructure That Supports Seamless Use

A strong reason behind the rise of electric luxury cars is the rapid development of charging stations across the country. Residents can find chargers in malls, residential communities, business districts, and hotels. Locations such as JBR, Dubai Hills, and City Walk have made charging accessible to both residents and tourists. This infrastructure reduces range anxiety and gives drivers confidence to use EVs for longer routes, including trips to Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Fujairah.

Performance That Matches and Sometimes Exceeds Traditional Supercars

Modern electric luxury cars outperform many conventional supercars in acceleration and handling. Models like the Tesla Model S Plaid and Porsche Taycan Turbo S deliver instant power with no engine noise. This appeals to drivers who appreciate performance but prefer a more refined, futuristic feel. The smooth roads of Dubai especially Al Khail Road, SZR, and the long stretches near Expo City make EV performance even more enjoyable.

A New Aesthetic for Social Media Culture

Electric cars carry a distinct visual identity. Their clean lines, LED lighting signatures, and minimalist interiors make them appear futuristic in photographs. Influencers and travelers often showcase EVs at locations such as Bluewaters Island, Museum of the Future, and Palm West Beach. This association with modern design contributes to their popularity, especially among younger demographics who value visual storytelling.

Lower Operating Costs and Practical Daily Use

Although luxury EVs come at a premium price, their operating costs are relatively lower. Electricity is cheaper than fuel, and electric motors require less maintenance than traditional engines. For daily commutes between Marina and Business Bay or frequent drives to Abu Dhabi, EVs offer a cost-efficient alternative while maintaining luxury. This economic practicality appeals to long-term residents and business executives.

Corporate and Fleet Adoption

Companies in the UAE are also introducing EVs to their fleets as part of sustainability commitments. Hotels, private chauffeur companies, and business groups increasingly choose electric luxury sedans and SUVs to align their brand image with future-forward values. This corporate shift further normalizes EV usage across the country.

A Strong Future Outlook

With each passing year, more luxury EV models enter the UAE market. BMW i7, Mercedes EQS SUV, Audi e-tron GT, and Lucid Air are gaining traction among early adopters. New charging corridors and city-wide sustainability programs suggest that EV usage will continue rising. Dubai’s commitment to smart mobility drone taxis, autonomous vehicle testing, and AI-powered traffic systems shows that electric transport fits naturally into the country’s long-term vision.

The growing popularity of electric luxury cars in the UAE reflects a blend of lifestyle evolution, technological progress, and nationwide sustainability goals. With strong infrastructure, attractive incentives, and high-performance models entering the market, EVs are becoming an integral part of the country’s modern driving culture.

Climate change requires coordinated international responses. Between 2021 and 2023, weather- and climate-related disasters cost an estimated $182.7 billion in the U.S. and $162 billion in the EU. Yet political divisions continue to impede transatlantic climate adaptation, particularly as U.S. federal engagement has stalled and climate change policy grows increasingly contested. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s core functions—regulating pollution, conducting environmental research, enforcing compliance, supporting state programs, responding to environmental hazards, and protecting public and environmental health—have been sharply curtailed under the new administration. At the 2025 United Nations General Assembly in September, President Trump called climate change policy “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” With such open rejection of scientific evidence and the international climate consensus, federal-level transatlantic cooperation appears unlikely.

However, subnational diplomacy has proven remarkably resilient. At the same UN General Assembly, California Governor Gavin Newsom met with numerous international officials, including EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, to reaffirm state-level climate commitments and explore deeper transatlantic cooperation. This outreach illustrates how subnational actors can sustain climate progress even when federal leadership falters. This article therefore proposes a new framework to harness and enhance such collaboration.

A New Framework for Collaboration

In an era of political uncertainty, subnational partnerships between U.S. states and the EU offer a promising alternative channel for climate cooperation. This article introduces the Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework (TSRF), a novel approach aimed at strengthening climate adaptation efforts and delivering tangible benefits even in periods of U.S. federal inaction. Subnational actors are already engaging European partners, often with meaningful, if uneven, results that demonstrate both the promise and the limits of decentralized climate diplomacy. A compelling example is the cooperation between California and the European Union during the first Trump administration. In 2018, the European Commission and California signed a Memorandum of Understanding on emissions trading and clean energy, which led to regular technical exchanges, joint workshops on carbon markets, and continued alignment on vehicle emissions standards even as U.S. federal policy moved in the opposite direction. This partnership not only preserved transatlantic policy learning during a period of federal retrenchment but also helped stabilize global confidence in subnational climate leadership. Beyond this case, numerous other initiatives illustrate the emerging architecture of subnational engagement: California’s recent partnership with Denmark on green economy resilience; coalitions such as We Are Still In and the U.S. Climate Alliance; EU-backed initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors and the International Urban Cooperation (IUC), and global networks that include US and EU actors such as the Under2Coalition or the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action.

Yet these efforts often remain fragmented, underfunded, and institutionally fragile. Entrenched partisan polarization makes consistent federal climate leadership increasingly unlikely. A shift toward “diagonal cooperation”—collaboration between subnational U.S. actors and European regional or supranational entities—is therefore crucial. Backed by the EU and driven by U.S. states, regions and cities, the TSRF could synchronize existing networks such as the Transatlantic Climate Alliance and elevate overlooked initiatives like wildfire prevention and flood control. Subnational diplomacy, which means linking U.S. states, cities, private actors, and EU partners, offers a viable path forward. The TSRF would institutionalize and scale these efforts through a permanent governance anchor capable of tracking commitments, coordinating partnerships, and sustaining innovation across the Atlantic. Before outlining such an institutional backbone, the article turns to sectoral examples that illustrate foundational components of the TSRF.

Sectoral Examples Illustrating TSRF’s Potential

Flood Control and Coastal Protection: Learning from the Dutch Dialogues

Flooding endangers coastal and riverine communities across the Atlantic, yet subnational partnerships have already shown how local actors can connect global expertise to local needs. The Netherlands—renowned for its ability to hold back the North Sea—has become a global leader in water management, and has exported its expertise to flood-vulnerable U.S. states.

After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, disproportionately affecting lower-income communities and communities of color, Dutch officials invited Louisianan leaders to tour the Netherlands’ flood management systems to prevent future devastation. This exchange laid the foundation for the Dutch Dialogues: workshops between Dutch engineers and U.S. city planners that reimagined New Orleans’ relationship with water management and strengthened the resilience of at-risk communities. These workshops generated green infrastructure ideas such as wetland restoration and expanded drainage basins, which now shape New Orleans’ current resilience strategy. Similar approaches have since been adopted in Charleston, South Carolina, and Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.

These exchanges show the value of subnational partnerships. Cities like Charleston can collaborate directly with Dutch water authorities and U.S. academics without awaiting federal action. A TSRF would provide sustained support through structured coordination, funding opportunities, and formal governance to ensure durable cooperation beyond shifting political landscapes. A standing Transatlantic Resilience Advisory Committee, composed of regional U.S. officials and EU diplomats, could meet regularly to evaluate pilot proposals, oversee city-to-city partnerships and maintain ongoing transatlantic dialogue. By embedding coordination within an institutionalized forum rather than relying on one-off exchanges, the TSRF would shift collaboration from episodic inspiration to sustained resilience-building.

To support this, the TSRF would create a central coordination mechanism—potentially hosted by EU member states or the European External Action Service. The hub would not impose top-down rules; rather, it would identify shared risks, pool knowledge, and support joint adaptation strategies. U.S. municipalities seeking Dutch-style flood management tools could access EU technical expertise, apply for co-funding from EU adaptation instruments, and obtain logistical support for workshops or site visits. By offering continuity even as U.S. federal priorities shift, the TSRF would sustain long-term, resilient partnerships.

Wildfire Resilience: Shared Strategies from California to the Mediterranean

Wildfires offer another striking example of how the TSRF could enhance cooperation. Both North America and Europe now face increasingly severe fire seasons fueled by climate change. In 2020, California wildfires emitted smoke plumes that crossed the Atlantic; in 2022, 20 EU member states recorded above-average burned areas, including significant fires in Germany, the Czech Republic, and beyond.

Despite these shared challenges, transatlantic wildfire collaboration remains fragmented. The TSRF could facilitate subnational partnerships between wildfire-prone states such as California and European counterparts like Spain, Greece, and Portugal. These partnerships could focus on early warning systems, data exchange, forest management, and firefighting techniques. For example, the EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service generates satellite wildfire maps on demand; under the TSRF, U.S. state wildfire agencies could access these during major fire events. Likewise, California’s ALERT California camera network—an AI-enabled early detection tool—could be shared with European civil protection agencies. Sector-specific transatlantic working groups could link California’s Cal Fire with Greece’s fire service to exchange best practices in real time. Such peer-to-peer cooperation would save lives and property, while strengthening public support for climate partnerships despite national political tensions. A governance hub within the TSRF would ensure these partnerships become institutionalized and consistent rather than dependent on individual administrations or crises.

Building Institutional Backbone: An EU-Coordinated Governance Hub

For the TSRF to endure, it must be supported by sustained coordination that can weather fluctuations in U.S. federal policy. A governance hub housed within the European External Action service could serve as this backbone, centralizing progress in two ways.

First, it could track subnational commitments through a publicly accessible registry of climate-resilience pledges by city, state, and region. Beyond simple self-reporting, this system would integrate progress indicators, timelines, and metrics drawn from existing EU adaptation frameworks, enabling more meaningful dialogue with subnational U.S. actors about implementation gaps and opportunities. This effort could incorporate existing networks such as the Climate Alliance and America Is All In, giving subnational initiatives stronger international institutional connections and implementation capacity.

Second, the hub would facilitate structured exchanges and serve as a clearinghouse for technical expertise, partnership matching, and knowledge transfer. It would link wildfire agencies, coastal resilience offices, emergency-response teams, and local disaster-management units across the Atlantic. This structure would move cooperation from informal networking to institutionalized exchange.

Scaling Peer-to-Peer Cooperation: Transatlantic Innovation Exchanges

The TSRF could formalize “climate resilience twinning” arrangements, modeled on sister cities but focused on adaptation rather than cultural exchange. Pairing EU cities or regions with U.S. counterparts that face similar climate risks, such as matching a flood-vulnerable U.S. coastal community with a European city pioneering nature-based flood defenses, would create sustained channels for peer learning and policy transfer. Fellowships, staff exchanges, and recurring Resilience Dialogues would bring stakeholders together to share data, test approaches, and co-develop solutions. These connections would help cooperation persist beyond electoral cycles and enable long-term planning despite federal uncertainty.

Financing Action: A Joint Resilience Investment Fund

To convert plans into action, the TSRF should be backed by a Joint Resilience Investment Fund designed to attract private capital. The recent Clean Investment Monitor Update estimates that U.S. clean energy and transportation investment reached $68 billion in the second quarter of 2025, holding steady relative to 2024 and accounting for 4.8% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable goods—indicating substantial private investment capacity.

The fund could mobilize additional private capital from both sides of the Atlantic and support climate-resilience startups and public-private pilot programs. This would provide financial continuity less vulnerable to shifts in federal funding and further embed transatlantic economic collaboration within the TSRF.

Conclusion

In today’s volatile political environment, transatlantic climate resilience requires innovative cooperation beyond traditional U.S.-EU diplomacy. As the climate crisis accelerates, cooperation must adapt and evolve accordingly. Local and regional actors have demonstrated that they can sustain collaboration in politically unstable times. The Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework offers a way to institutionalize this momentum by connecting cities, states, and private actors across the Atlantic through a durable framework that shares goals, builds knowledge, and mobilizes resources.

This alliance is not only feasible, it is already emerging in sectoral pockets. What is missing is the connective institutional tissue to coordinate and deepen these partnerships to align them into a more integrated transatlantic resilience agenda, which could spill over into other areas of climate change policy. The TSRF can transform fragmented initiatives into a cohesive resilience strategy, reinvigorating the U.S.-EU relationship and linking communities in a shared mission to confront a profound challenge of our time.

The recent jump in the share price added about NIS 200 million to the value of each of their holdings, bringing them close to being shekel billionaires, on paper.

What impressed investors so much in Doral’s financials? Although the company still posts losses, it presents more than 50% growth in revenue. But two pieces of positive news encouraged the market. The first is to do with taxation, the second with guidance, and both are connected to the question whether Doral has had the luck to be in the right place at the right time.

Right place: the US. The scope of Doral’s projects there is huge, and already amounts to 7.7 gigawatts. For the sake of comparison, that is just over half the power consumption of the entire State of Israel at the peak of the winter season. In addition, projects that could yield another 2.5 gigawatts are expected to start construction in the coming year and to be connected to the grid in by the end of 2027. All this is in the red-hot US market, where demand for energy, particularly solar energy, is expected to be dramatic in the coming years.

Right time: Doral is expected to complete these projects just before the expiration of the tax breaks for renewable energy developments in the US. Leader Capital Markets analyst Gilad Ben-Zvi says, ""In the previous financials they reported only 2.5 gigawatts that they were certain would qualify for the tax breaks, and following recent developments they are now able to provide another level of certainty for investors on the large scope of mature projects that they will manage to connect.

""There’s a very strong environment at present in the US energy market, because of the considerable rise in demand for power in the coming years from new server farms and the substantial consumption of electricity for artificial intelligence.""

Doral is considered to be in a good position in relation to US companies as well, since it is expected to manage to connect new projects, and apply the tax breaks to them, while its competitors are still standing in line to connect to the grid.

""They’ll need a lot of money to meet the guidance""

RELATED ARTICLES

The combination of the tax breaks, the acceleration of projects, and the company’s unique positioning, have led Doral to issue optimistic guidance. The projects in the US will yield EBITDA of over $850 million a year from 2029, which compares with $61 million in the first nine months of 2025, and just $10 million in 2024. But what are the chances of meeting this fantastic guidance?

In order to maximize profits, Doral increased its position in US subsidiary Doral Renewables LLC by buying 10% of its shares from US partner/CEO Nick Cohen for $67 million. Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later. Incidentally, former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen serves as a director on Doral’s behalf in the US company, and holds options on its shares estimated in the past to be worth tens of millions of shekels.

There are, however, several question marks over Doral’s optimistic forecast. ""There is still uncertainty about the company’s ultimate value,"" says Leaders Ben-Zvi, adding ""we are still waiting for the next offering.""

Doral, he says, is still a company short of cash, and in order to finance its wave of construction ""they will need a lot more money, which will come from raising capital or even an IPO in the US. But the current deal gives a floor to the company’s value, and that’s what provided a following wind for the stock.""

Of course it remains to be seen whether the positive investor sentiment is maintained, and whether Doral will abide by its dramatic promises in the US market.

Electric vehicles now account for nearly 90% of lithium demand, up from 64% in 2020, with global EV sales expected to exceed 20 million units in 2025. The energy sector accounted for 85% of total battery metals demand growth over this period.

Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while China is responsible for 80% of graphite mining and over 90% of refining. The average market share of the top three refining nations for key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024, creating vulnerabilities that Western governments are addressing through diversification initiatives and domestic production incentives.

Indonesia's share of mined nickel production has risen from 16% in 2017 to around 50% in 2023, with Indonesia's total nickel pig iron production reaching approximately 1.85 million tonnes in 2024 and expected to reach around 2 million tonnes by 2025, accounting for 53.5% of global primary nickel production. This dominance creates both supply security concerns and pricing power dynamics.

Recent market action demonstrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures in China experiencing dramatic swings. Exchange regulatory measures imposing stricter trading rules and supply-side signals from production restarts contributed to a 9% single-session drop to ¥91,020/tonne after peaking at ¥102,500/tonne. Despite near-term corrections, underlying demand tied to electrification remains robust as battery gigafactory construction accelerates globally.

Western governments are prioritizing supply chain diversification through comprehensive policy frameworks. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and Australia's Modern Manufacturing Initiative provide tax credits, loan guarantees, and offtake support for domestic battery metal production, reducing project financing risk and creating government-backed demand for Tier-1 jurisdictional assets.

The Battery Metals Imperative

The global transition to electrified transportation and renewable energy storage is creating structural demand for critical minerals essential to battery production. Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin have emerged as foundational commodities enabling the shift away from fossil fuels, positioned at the intersection of climate policy, technological innovation, and supply chain security. The investment thesis for battery metals rests on fundamentals distinct from traditional commodity cycles. Policy-driven demand supported by government mandates and emissions regulations provides visibility extending through 2030, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration.

Global Trends Driving Battery Metals Demand

The electrification of transportation represents the primary demand catalyst for battery metals, with penetration rates exceeding forecasts. EV sales surged past 7 million units in the first half of 2025, a 28% year-over-year increase, with the International Energy Agency projecting full-year sales could approach 20 million units. Major automotive markets have established regulatory timelines phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035, creating policy certainty driving massive capital investment across automotive supply chains.

Battery chemistry evolution reshapes demand profiles for individual metals. Nickel-rich cathode chemistries maximize energy density and vehicle range, driving nickel intensity per vehicle upward. Batteries, the heart of every electric vehicle, rely heavily on lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite as key cathode and anode materials. Each EV requires approximately 50-100 kilograms of graphite depending on battery size, while copper content increases dramatically versus combustion vehicles due to electric motors, battery systems, and charging infrastructure.

Energy Storage & Grid Applications

Grid-scale energy storage is emerging as a complementary demand driver, with battery installations required to manage intermittency from renewable generation. Battery energy storage system installations are set to increase from 205 GWh in 2024 to 520-700 GWh by 2030, a 2.5-3.5x increase. Residential and commercial storage applications add another demand layer, with home battery systems gaining adoption in markets with high electricity costs or time-of-use pricing. These distributed storage applications utilize similar lithium-ion chemistries to EVs, competing for the same battery metal supply.

Supply Chain Reshoring Imperatives

Geopolitical tensions have elevated supply security to strategic priority for Western governments and automakers. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world's cobalt mining. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content requirements for EV tax credits, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act all prioritize domestic or allied-nation sourcing, creating structural demand for battery metal projects in stable jurisdictions at premium prices.

Supply Challenges: Commodity-Specific Constraints

The nickel market is experiencing supply transformation as Indonesian production dominates global output. In 2023, Indonesia accounted for 53.1% of the global nickel supply and was projected to reach 2.1 million metric tons by the end of 2024. However, this creates market vulnerabilities. The global primary nickel market is expected to remain oversupplied in 2025, with production from Indonesia forecast to expand further despite challenges like tight nickel ore availability and potential royalty rate hikes.

Battery sector dynamics add complexity, as the battery sector saw a shift in preferences from nickel-rich nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries toward nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, driven by price competitiveness. Despite this, the battery sector is expected to increase nickel consumption to 543,000 tonnes in 2025, making up 15.2% of global consumption. Nickel sulphide deposits in stable jurisdictions command premiums as automakers seek long-term, low-carbon supply agreements outside concentrated Asian supply chains.

Lithium: Price Volatility Masking Structural Growth

Lithium markets navigate the aftermath of speculative excess. Recent price action illustrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures experiencing dramatic swings following exchange regulatory measures and production restart announcements. A major mine with potential output of approximately 46,000 tonnes per year, roughly 3% of projected global supply, exemplifies how quickly brownfield supply can respond to price signals.

Despite near-term volatility, lithium prices dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to late 2015 levels, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015. The IEA warns that low prices could discourage future investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. Greenfield lithium projects face extended permitting timelines and infrastructure development requirements, meaning supply responses to sustained higher prices will lag by years.

Graphite and Other Critical Minerals

Graphite supply is even more concentrated, with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining. Natural flake graphite must undergo purification, spheronization, and coating processes to meet battery anode specifications, requiring specialized facilities and technical expertise concentrated in China. Western graphite projects must demonstrate integrated processing capability to produce battery-qualified material, adding capital intensity and technical risk beyond conventional mining operations.

Company Case Studies

Canada Nickel's Zero-Carbon Nickel Production (TSXV:CNC)

Canada Nickel is advancing the Crawford Nickel Sulphide Project in Ontario's Timmins region, positioning the asset as potentially one of the world's first zero-carbon nickel mines. The company recently secured an oversubscribed financing to advance engineering, permitting, and development activities.

As CEO Mark Selby stated their offering options:

""The Offering is oversubscribed. The Underwriters intend to fully exercise the Over-Allotment Option… If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be C$15.0 million.""

The proceeds support steps toward a construction decision targeted for 2026.

Crawford ranks as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and is expected to become the third-largest nickel sulphide operation globally based on feasibility study production rates. The deposit contains over 1.7 billion tonnes of reserves supporting a 41-year mine life, with life-of-mine cash costs of US$0.39/lb positioning Crawford in the first quartile globally. Updated FEED optimization improved after-tax NPV to US$2.8 billion with IRR exceeding 17%.

The decarbonization strategy through carbon sequestration, demonstrating 1.5 million tonnes CO₂ storage annually through IPT carbonation with potential scaling to 10-15 million tonnes via NetCarb Alliance, could position Crawford as a supplier of zero-carbon nickel to automakers with stringent emissions requirements. The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses 42 km² with multiple discoveries including high-grade intercepts at Bannockburn showing 3.95% nickel over 4 metres, suggesting district-scale growth potential beyond Crawford alone.

Sovereign Metals (AIM:SVML) : Rutile-Graphite By-Product Economics

Sovereign Metals is developing what it describes as the world's largest known rutile resource and second-largest known flake graphite resource in southeastern Africa. As the company notes:

""Kasiya holds 17.9 Mt of contained rutile (world's largest) and 24.4 Mt of contained graphite (world's second-largest).""

The unique aspect is that graphite emerges as a natural by-product of rutile mining, creating economics distinct from standalone graphite projects.

The Optimised Pre-Feasibility Study demonstrates pre-tax NPV of US$2.32 billion with 27% IRR, supporting steady-state production of 246,000 tonnes per annum rutile and 265,000 tonnes per annum graphite. Processing advantages stem from soft saprolite ore enabling simpler methods than hard-rock graphite peers, producing higher carbon concentrate at 96-98% versus typical 94-95%, while achieving up to 57% large-jumbo flake commanding premium prices.

The by-product economics create competitive advantages, with incremental graphite production cost of US$241/tonne sitting below Chinese weighted average cost of US$257/tonne, positioning Sovereign in the lowest-cost quartile on global cost curves. A successful 6-month pilot operation mining 170,000 cubic meters validated the full production chain, informing feasibility parameters and de-risking execution. With Definitive Feasibility Study expected in Q4 2025, Sovereign is advancing toward financing and construction decisions.

Fitzroy Minerals (TSXV:FTZ): Dual-Track Copper Strategy

Fitzroy Minerals pursues a dual-track copper strategy in Chile's premier copper belt, combining fast-track oxide development for near-term cash flow with deeper sulphide exploration for long-term scale. The company recently appointed a technical advisor who emphasized the strategic value of this approach.

As President and CEO Merlin Marr-Johnson stated their management:

""I am also delighted that Fitzroy management has outlined a fast-track route to non-operated copper production at Buen Retiro, which could give the Company sufficient cash flow to self-fund exploration in future years.""

The company holds approximately C$11M in cash supporting an ~C$8M exploration budget. The oxide project spans over 1.4 km of continuous copper mineralization with predominantly leachable minerals enabling low-cost heap leach processing. Brownfields status provides permitting advantages, while nearby hydrometallurgical infrastructure offers potential toll-processing solutions reducing capital intensity. Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway.

The sulphide project targets a large-scale copper-molybdenum-gold-rhenium porphyry system with initial drilling confirming 200 metres at 0.46% copper with higher-grade sub-zones. Multiple kilometre-long geophysical and geochemical anomalies across the 18,000 hectare land package suggest substantial exploration upside. By-product metals including rhenium, a scarce element used in superalloys, could materially enhance project economics. Strategic positioning between two major producing districts in a region with established infrastructure provides development advantages.

Rome Resources (LSE:RMR): High-Grade Tin Discovery

Rome Resources advances high-grade tin-copper-zinc-silver discoveries in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region, located 8 km from one of the world's highest-grade producing tin mines. The company recently announced a £200,000 placement to fund additional drilling related to ongoing tin discoveries, highlighting continued support for exploration of critical minerals in a district with demonstrated world-class grades.

The asset portfolio centers on two prospects: a tin-copper-zinc-silver system at Mont Agoma and a high-grade tin-only system at Kalayi. Over 5,000 metres across 26 holes have been drilled by mid-2025 with first resource models initiated for both targets. Mont Agoma hosts polymetallic mineralization with geochemical and drill data indicating large undrilled deeper zones representing expansion potential, while Kalayi features high-grade plunging tin shoots across a 2-km-long soil anomaly.

Tin's supply-demand fundamentals support the exploration thesis, with the metal identified as highly leveraged to electrification through solar panel manufacturing, electronics, and specialized battery applications. Global tin demand is forecast to grow up to 40% by 2030 driven by technology adoption. Rome operates three drill rigs with on-site core logging and XRF facilities, plus approximately 1,000 kg of metallurgical samples shipped for beneficiation testwork to understand multi-metal recovery potential. With continued drilling momentum and resource modeling underway, Rome represents early-stage exposure to high-grade tin discovery in a district with demonstrated production history.

The Investment Thesis for Battery Metals

Supply chain security premiums favor projects in Canada, Australia, and stable jurisdictions over lower-cost but geopolitically risky alternatives. Western automakers and governments increasingly prioritize supply reliability and ESG credentials over marginal cost advantages, supporting valuation premiums for Tier-1 assets even with higher operating costs.

Battery metal developments advancing with automaker offtake agreements, government loan guarantees, or critical minerals program participation demonstrate external validation and reduced financing risk. Projects lacking strategic alignment face higher hurdles securing project finance and may trade at discounts despite strong technical fundamentals.

Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin each face distinct supply-demand dynamics and price cycles. Portfolio allocation across multiple commodities provides downside protection when individual metals experience corrections while maintaining upside exposure to electrification's broad-based critical mineral demand.

Advanced-stage projects with completed feasibility studies and near-term construction decisions offer less execution risk but potentially lower return multiples, while earlier-stage exploration and resource definition plays provide higher risk-adjusted returns for patient capital willing to accept development timeline uncertainty and permitting risk.

As automakers face increasing pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions across supply chains, battery metals produced with renewable energy and carbon sequestration capabilities command premiums. Projects demonstrating low-carbon production pathways gain competitive advantages in customer qualification processes beyond pure cost competitiveness.

Given China's dominance in processing and its significant role in mining certain battery metals, policy shifts around production quotas, export restrictions, or environmental enforcement can rapidly tighten supply and drive price movements. Regulatory developments in Indonesia for nickel and China's domestic lithium market interventions create asymmetric risk-reward scenarios.

The battery metals investment case rests on secular electrification trends creating durable demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration. This supply-demand imbalance, amplified by Western governments' strategic prioritization of supply chain security, creates a favorable multi-year environment for projects in stable jurisdictions even if near-term prices experience volatility. Policy support through tax credits, loan guarantees, and domestic content requirements materially de-risks project financing for advanced-stage assets aligned with government critical minerals strategies.

Investor approaches should emphasize jurisdictional quality and strategic positioning over pure resource metrics. Projects in Canada, Australia, and other Tier-1 jurisdictions benefit from nearshoring premiums as automakers prioritize supply security, while developments with automaker partnerships or government backing demonstrate external validation reducing execution risk. Portfolio construction across multiple battery metals provides diversification, as individual commodities experience distinct price cycles. Lithium's recent volatility contrasts with nickel's structural deficit and graphite's processing bottlenecks, suggesting uncorrelated return profiles.

The four case study companies exemplify different risk-reward profiles within battery metals: Canada Nickel offers large-scale nickel sulphide development with zero-carbon differentiation and district growth potential; Sovereign Metals provides unique rutile-graphite by-product economics with near-term DFS completion; Fitzroy Minerals balances near-term oxide cash flow against sulphide exploration upside in established copper districts; and Rome Resources represents early-stage high-grade tin discovery with resource growth potential but elevated jurisdictional and exploration risk. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition through tangible supply-demand fundamentals and reduced geopolitical vulnerability, battery metals in quality jurisdictions present compelling opportunities as electrification transitions from policy aspiration to physical infrastructure reality.

TL;DR

Battery metals present compelling investment opportunities as electric vehicle adoption and energy storage drive structural demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, and copper. Supply constraints persist from geopolitical concentration with Indonesia controlling over 50% of nickel and China dominating graphite processing, while Western governments prioritize supply chain diversification through reshoring incentives. Canada Nickel advances zero-carbon nickel production with district-scale potential, Sovereign Metals offers unique rutile-graphite by-product economics, Fitzroy Minerals balances copper oxide development with sulphide exploration in Chile, and Rome Resources pursues high-grade tin discovery in the DRC. Projects in Tier-1 jurisdictions with strategic partnerships command premiums as automakers secure long-term supply, creating favorable outlook for quality battery metal assets despite price volatility.

RWE said the circa £200 million development will form part of the Pembroke Net Zero Centre and was announced by the First Minister for Wales at the Wales Investment Summit.

The company said the project secured planning consent in January and won capacity in the latest UK Capacity Market auction, with construction due to start in the first half of 2026 and commissioning in the second half of 2028 subject to an updated grid connection.

RWE said the two-hour system will be located on a 5.1-hectare site south of Pembroke Power Station and will use 212 lithium-ion battery containers to deliver 700MWh of storage.

The company said the project will also include biodiversity measures such as meadow planting, native woodland and scrub planting, and a new pond to support local wildlife.

Nikolaus Valerius, CEO RWE Generation SE (pictured), said: “In a dynamic energy world with more and more renewable energy, there is an increasing need for mature technologies that can instantly support the electricity grid. Battery storage systems are ideal for this because they are fast, efficient and competitive. Our Pembroke Battery is our UK flagship storage project and will make an important contribution to stabilising the UK energy market by efficiently storing surplus energy and feeding it into the national grid in a targeted manner when required.”

First Minister for Wales Eluned Morgan said: ""This significant investment by RWE demonstrates Wales' central role in the UK’s transition to clean and renewable electricity.

Indeed, between 2005 and 2020 load growth averaged about 0.1%, pushed slightly upward by population and economic growth while also held down by improved efficiency.

The rest of the world has also seen relatively modest growth in electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand grew by an average of 2.6% between 2015 and 2023.

Today, however, we have entered the era of load growth, which is witnessing a generational shift on how energy is generated, transmitted and consumed. The demand as it used to be, in terms of predictability and density, has transformed itself into patterns that are complex to predict and extremely high density, thanks to greater demand from electric transportation, manufacturing and, of course, the boom in electricity-thirsty data centers. The U.S. Department of Energy has forecasted that data centers could consume as much as 580 TWh annually in 2028, equal to about 123 GW and representing up to 12% of total US electricity consumption. Across the globe, electricity demand is forecasted to rise by 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026 – with China and India growing significantly faster.

Reliable supplies of increasing amounts of electricity are an economic and societal imperative, which is why utilities are making historic investments in grid infrastructure and assets. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 World Energy Investment report, capital investment in the energy sector is set to rise by $3.3 trillion, a 2% increase from 2024. $2.2 trillion of that investment includes funds earmarked for grid optimization.

The German utility E.ON announced plans to invest 34 billion Euros on grid infrastructure between 2024 and 2028. The Indian government says the country needs to invest over $500 billion USD by 2032 to provide the power the growing country requires. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund has committed over $500 million and disbursed more than $460 million to 15 projects across six ASEAN countries. The fund provides loans to finance infrastructure investment projects such as renewable energy plants and transmission and power grid development.

But the challenge remains: Not all investments are created equal in terms of ensuring the reliability of a grid buffeted by rapidly growing demand, extreme weather, a proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), and aging equipment. Utilities, regulators, grid operators, and developers all need to direct their investments efficiently and effectively, simultaneously meeting demand while also improving reliability and containing costs.

The integrated system planning imperative

Put simply, utility planners are faced with a challenging task. Making their task even more daunting is the reality that the tools and processes planners have long relied on were built for a very different power system than we have now. Transmission, distribution and generation planners have traditionally worked to manage and orchestrate a centralized generation with unidirectional flows of electricity. Planning departments have traditionally been structured vertically, creating divides between functions that solve for economics, physics and system adequacy.

When load growth was modest and electricity flowed in one direction from large power plants to consumers, that approach worked well. But in today’s high load growth environment, where a larger share of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DERs) are being integrated and extreme weather threatens system reliability, a more holistic approach to planning is critical. When different planning teams use their own complicated models with various tools and data, working together becomes difficult and time-consuming. Today’s grid planning needs to bring these different approaches together to make the process faster, more accurate, more adaptable, and more collaborative.

Integrated system planning (ISP) acknowledges the pressures of load growth and the complexity and interdependencies of the quickly evolving power system and provides a pathway for the collaboration and coordination needed in planning today. It serves as the backbone for maintaining system adequacy by implementing comprehensive planning for the future grid and delivering a path for a reliable, sustainable and affordable power system.

The value of ISP:

Comprehensive analysis for making faster planning decisions that drive investment signals, operational efficiency, and stakeholder collaboration.

Maximizing the efficiency of investments that drive prioritization while accounting for rapidly changing demand and interconnection requests.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.

Accelerating planning cycles to better meet the needs of customers who require electricity as fast as possible.

Improving regulatory outcomes by providing transparency around the need for capital investments.

Powering ISP with PlanOS

ISP requires more than a desire for traditionally siloed planning operations to work together. It demands actual tools to enable seamless, efficient, and valuable collaboration.

GE Vernova’s PlanOS was built to provide a platform that unifies planning data and models capacity expansion, resource adequacy, production cost, and power flow analysis. Instead of running these vital planning studies separately and hoping to reconcile results later, PlanOS integrates them in real time. The result: insights from one planning domain immediately inform others, improving speed and reducing the potential for errors.

A unified data model is the foundation of the PlanOS platform, ensuring all planners work from the same assumptions. Updates flow across the system, eliminating the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually reconciling disparate spreadsheets and models.

PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions. Collaboration features like version control and distributed access enable diverse teams to work together seamlessly without losing the specialized tools they need.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/x8jR5LJi2JNqDZNfz53ufHGUi8eo5xofSBDKt6nPOXw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjk5OTQ3ODQzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:20.101270

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise.
In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need.
That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs.
Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted.","We rely on the objectivity and trustworthiness of third parties to stay informed and make better decisions throughout our lives. Before purchasing a house, home inspectors help us identify issues we may overlook. In business, external auditors assess financial statements for accuracy and compliance.

But at a time of rapidly rising demand for electricity and other threats to the reliable supply of power, inverter-based resources (IBRs) are interconnecting to the grid without any comparable level of evaluation — without confirmation that they align with their interconnection agreements and without assurance that the models used by transmission operators reflect what’s on the ground.

And when models don’t reflect what’s on the ground, and when what’s on the ground doesn’t conform to requirements, the consequences can be severe. That’s where third-party verification comes in.

But how did we get here?

Getting IBRs online requires a different approach than we’re used to

Synchronous sources of generation — the backbone of our grid for more than a century — have traditionally been built and maintained by the entities also responsible for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power system: utilities.

With IBRs, those responsibilities are more commonly dispersed, with project developers and generator owners building facilities with an emphasis on cost and speed, and transmission operators tasked with maintaining grid stability.

Not only that, but IBRs, as a technology, differ significantly from synchronous generation. They’re based on software that controls the instantaneous output of power electronics, with no spinning inertial mass to provide a guaranteed stability buffer during times of regional grid instability. Inverters can provide excellent grid stability support, too — but only when their hundreds of adjustable functions and parameters are correctly set.

This new landscape calls for new strategies for keeping the grid running as smoothly and dependably as we’ve come to expect in the U.S.

A lack of verification can have real consequences

Although grid operators may have interconnection agreements based on industry standards and guidelines, such as IEEE 2800, without verification that those standards and guidelines are actually being followed, we can’t be confident that they’re doing any good.

Through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC’s) disturbance reports and alerts on reliability risks, we know that IBR plants are often configured incorrectly, putting the grid at risk due to unexpected and unnecessary tripping events — like what happened in Odessa in 2021 and 2022 and in the Iberian Peninsula earlier this year.

We’ve witnessed as much in our own on-site inspections of 300+ distribution- and transmission-connected IBRs. We continue to find inverters programmed with protection-related settings that deviate from known requirements and power plant controller (PPC) settings misaligned with the facility’s voltage schedule requirements specified by the transmission operator.

In fact, nearly every site we’ve visited since our work in this space began in 2017 has had deficiencies and discrepancies that have needed addressing.

Third-party verification is the solution the industry needs right now

Having a third party commission and verify IBRs — review site documentation and installed inverter settings, conduct PPC demonstrations, update and reconcile facility models — bridges the gap between transmission and generator operators.

Ultimately, it’s quality assurance that reveals whether facilities comply with the appropriate standards and agreements and whether grid operators can trust that their sites will perform as expected.

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise. A neutral third party can develop the proficiency necessary to confront the unique complexity of IBRs.

In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification

To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need. That may not be apparent in monthly performance reports; it may only show up during major events. But those are what we’re trying to avoid.

Unfortunately, the compliance issues that we and others are finding are unlikely to resolve themselves, and that will only elevate risk as IBR penetration — and load growth from data centers, manufacturing and electrification — increases.

That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs. Even starting small, initiating a pilot program or updating documentation requirements, can make a big difference.

Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted.

""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""","Data centers are fueling a race to develop artificial intelligence tools that have the potential to revolutionize almost every sector of society, and Big Tech is receiving bipartisan support at nearly every level of government to aid in this global competition for AI dominance.

But these building projects that have become a unifying force for politicians are also galvanizing communities that object to seeing one of these behemoth campuses of computer servers pop up in their backyards.

RELATED: Pa. and N.J. want data centers to guarantee their own power supply

Last month in Plymouth Township, the zoning board held a public hearing to discuss a proposal to build a 2 million square-foot data center at 900 Conshohocken Road, transforming 10 buildings at the former Cleveland-Cliffs steel mill that sits on 66 acres of land along the Schuylkill River into a high-tech network.

When Montgomery County residents learned about the plan to build this facility near their homes, they began fighting back – citing concerns over the project's potential impacts on the environment and their energy bills.

""This is like a David versus Goliath fight, and we're trying to get everyone mobilized and understand this,"" Patti Smith, who organized a petition that received over 1,000 signatures, said before the hearing.

Then on Nov. 18, residents packed the room to voice their opinions at the zoning hearing, only to find out that the developer had to withdraw the application over a legal issue because the agreement of sale of the property was not finalized. While this appears to be a victory for the community activists, they anticipate the developer will refile the application and are concerned this move only allows more time for an ordinance to be drafted that would give the company a stronger legal standing when the proposal is revisited.

In neighboring Chester County, another data center that's being proposed at the former Pennhurst State School and Hospital site is also receiving strong opposition from the community, with a petition that's racked up over 12,000 signatures. That proposal could also stall as opposition is pushing for an ordinance to tighten regulations.

While these neighbors are standing up against Big Tech, they are also realizing they're confronting resource-rich developers and a government that in many ways is working to ease restrictions as the country tries to meet the insatiable energy demands created by the growing use of AI platforms like ChatGPT.

In June, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) announced that Amazon will spend at least $20 billion to develop cloud computing and AI innovation campuses in the state. The investment, which the company says will create at least 1,250 tech jobs, will start by building facilities in Falls Township in Bucks County and Salem Township in Luzerne County before exploring other communities for future sites.

Shortly after that investment was touted by state officials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting of data center development.

Then last month, governors from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia (three Democrats and one Republican) submitted a joint proposal that would fast-track approvals for data center projects in which developers agree to build energy lines or substations and generate at least enough electricity to offset how much power the facility is expected use.

""Everybody wants to be the biggest and best adopter of AI technology and make the most money for their state, but it's very short-sighted,"" said Genevieve Boland, one of the organizers of the Cleveland-Cliffs petition. ""So the direction is coming from the federal government to essentially expedite data center approvals everywhere across the country and that has been trickled down to the state. Shapiro made a deal with Amazon and that was a huge deal. And then his mandate has trickled down to regional and local zoning boards to do whatever to approve these data centers.""

Impact on electric bills

While the AI boom is putting pressure on existing electricity grids and causing a nearly unquenchable thirst for more energy resources, it remains to be seen how these demands will affect the bills of residential customers.

The U.S. Department of Energy reported last year that data centers consumed about 4.4% of the total U.S. electricity in 2023, and it predicts that will rise to 12% by 2028.

And the increase in the number of these facilities has coincided with a rise in costs. In Pennsylvania, the average electric bill has gone from $134.85 in 2022 to $160.57 this year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But data centers might not be completely to blame for the higher bills, said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that does research for the nation's electric power industry.

""Most of the increase has been related to economy-wide inflation trends,"" he said. ""Where it's been faster than inflation has been in places like California, which had a really steep increase that's mostly related to wildfire impacts. ... Other places like New England, you've also seen higher prices. But again, that's more around (transmission and distribution) costs, grid modernization and resilience more so than data centers. So there are a lot of factors. Data centers are potentially one of them but really has not been the main one for what we've seen recently.""

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the average retail price of electricity in Pennsylvania over the past six years has risen 7.4% faster than inflation, the New York Times reported. In New Jersey, it's up 6.1%. But it's actually down in other parts of the country — including much of the Southeast, Midwest and Mountain regions.

In addition to the quantity of data centers, the speed at which they are being built is also causing a power problem. Despite their size, these massive campuses can be built within a year or two in many cases. And the projects often require investments to improve the local grid, like adding new sources to generate energy or enhancing existing systems.

""They can be built pretty quickly, which means it puts a lot of pressure on the timeline for adding grid resources, which tend to be a little bit slower than how fast you can add a data center,"" Blanford said. ""So it's been a major issue for power system planning.""

Tech companies have now become both energy consumers and producers, and whether individuals and small businesses see a jump in their bills might be dependent on state regulators and lawmakers making sure those firms cover the expenses.

""In theory, there are potential benefits to the electric system from having a large load there,"" Blanford said. ""... It can help with reliability, and it's not necessarily something to take for granted that it's going to increase electricity prices. In fact, it could decrease electricity prices by having more energy to spread the fixed costs over.""

Another factor that could impact utility bills is the Trump administration's stand against renewable energy projects, said Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College who served as the assistant director for data and democracy under the Biden administration. The Interior Department's policies are causing permitting delays and the agency has been reviewing previously approved wind and solar farms.

""So we're actually, as a society right now, reducing the amount of energy that we could be generating while increasing the usage of it,"" Friedler said. ""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""

To try to protect consumers, some politicians are stepping in. In New Jersey, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on halting rising utility costs, promising to freeze rates and declare a ""state of emergency on utility costs"" on her first day in office.

""My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it,"" she said in a statement.

Environmental impact

The AI boom is only a few years old so grasping the environmental impact can be challenging, but a study by Cornell University researchers published last month in the journal Nature Sustainability set out to quantify the industry's ecological footprint – and their estimations are staggering.

Depending on the speed of AI growth, researchers said U.S. data centers could eventually consume as much as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars per year, which would be equivalent of the annual resource consumption of the entire state of New York.

The Cleveland-Cliffs project in Plymouth Township calls for electricity generated by use natural gas turbines, which is cleaner than burning coal but still emits pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, formaldehyde and benzene. The Environmental Protection Agency warns that exposure to these types of emissions can have serious health effects, even though power plants have made great strides in reducing them over the past couple decades.

""As soon as we heard natural gas turbines ... we became incredibly alarmed,"" said Smith, the organizer of the petition against the project. ""... My preferred exposure to formaldehyde is honestly zero per year.""

The cooling system needed to prevent servers from overheating also has an environmental impact. Google said in 2021 that its average data center consumed around 450,000 gallons of water per day, which it said was the ""same amount of water used to irrigate 17 acres of turf lawn grass once.""

In their study, the Cornell scientists recommend holding tech companies to similar standards put on vehicle manufacturers to mandate fuel efficiency – with tighter regulations, more transparency and benchmarks for energy usage.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_27527015.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:22.284153

We’ve looked a little bit at the Food and Drug Administration process for companies to get approval to use recycled plastic in their consumer products.
ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem.","Judith Enck has spent her entire career working to protect public health and the environment.

Enck took the helm of New York’s oldest environmental organization, Environmental Advocates NY, soon after graduating college, then went on to hold senior leadership roles in state and federal government, including as deputy secretary for the environment in the New York Governor’s Office and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator during Barack Obama’s two terms. Now, as a professor at Bennington College and president of the Vermont-based nonprofit Beyond Plastics, Enck is on a mission to “end plastic pollution everywhere.”

Toward that end, Enck, who describes herself as a “solid waste gal,” wrote a new book with journalist Adam Mahoney called “The Problem With Plastic.”

The main problem with plastic, the authors say, is that it’s ubiquitous, polluting the planet, driving climate change and making us sick.

Plastic production has increased exponentially, from about 2 million tons a year in 1950 to 450 million tons a year today, with no limit in sight. And because plastics are made from fossil fuels and thousands of toxic chemicals derived from oil and gas, they cause harm throughout their life cycle, from extraction of the fossil fuels they’re made of to their production, use and disposal. Low-income communities and people of color who live near plastic plants bear the brunt of the industry’s toxic emissions, Enck and Mahoney say. Yet we all inhale and consume hundreds of thousands of microplastics per year.

Plastics have become so pervasive that scientists have found them blowing in the wind, near the peak of Mt. Everest, in the snow of Antarctica, in the ocean’s deepest trenches, in placentas, breast milk, stool, blood, lungs and even in our brains.

Plastic was never designed to be recycled, Enck explains in the book. The only aspect of plastics actually being recycled is the myth that recycling will stop plastic pollution. Inside Climate News recently spoke with Enck about the extent of the plastic crisis, its role in the climate crisis and what it will take to move beyond plastic. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

LIZA GROSS: Was there a specific moment or event that made you decide that plastic pollution was the issue you wanted to devote your time and energy to?

JUDITH ENCK: Well, there are two moments. One is the moment I was born. My parents, the late Helen and Sonny Enck, named me after St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. But I don’t believe plastics is a lost cause. I just think it’s an uphill battle.

But seriously, I do remember a moment, though it’s not like I wasn’t following the issue.

I was sitting at my desk at EPA Region 2 in lower Manhattan, and I read an article about the massive amount of plastic loading into the ocean, and it stopped me in my tracks. I know how important the ocean is, a major source of protein for most of the world. And I read that about 80 percent of plastic in the ocean comes from the land. It’s roadside litter that goes down a storm drain, into a stream, into a river, into the ocean. Or it’s derelict fishing gear. And it is really damaging the ocean.

And I decided at that moment, when I left the EPA, I was going to work on plastics. I didn’t know how, I didn’t know where, but that’s what led to the launching of Beyond Plastics, and then eventually the writing of this book.

GROSS: People often talk about plastics breaking down, but I’ve heard you say that’s not the right way to think about it. Could you expand on that?

ENCK: Plastics are made from fossil fuels and chemicals, and they are not degradable. So they don’t break down, they become smaller pieces of plastic. And in many ways, those smaller pieces are a much greater risk. So five millimeters or less is a microplastic, the size of a grain of salt. And then even smaller than that is a nanoplastic, and that’s what we’re breathing in and swallowing and, and that’s what’s building up from the Himalayan Mountains to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and everything in between.

GROSS: One thing that people might be surprised to learn is that plastic recycling was actually a PR strategy. In the book, you say that’s been part of a strategy to shift responsibility from the producer onto the individual consumer, to obscure the fact that companies are producing huge volumes of materials that can’t be recycled. How did that strategy become so effective?

ENCK: Because we were all subjected to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by plastic companies deceiving us into thinking we can recycle most of our plastic, which just isn’t true. You can recycle an old aluminum can into a new can, newspaper into cardboard or other paper products. But with plastics, we’ve got 16,000 different chemicals, many different colors, many different plastic types, or polymers. Think of your own home. You may have a bright orange plastic soap detergent near your washing machine and a black plastic takeout container in your refrigerator and a plastic bag on your counter. None of them can be recycled together. You have to separate everything by color, by chemical and by polymer. The people who know this the best there are plastic manufacturers, and yet they chose to spend millions of dollars telling us, don’t worry about all of your single-use plastic packaging, for instance, just put it in your recycling bin. But it really messes up recycling programs.

So I want to be clear: People should keep recycling paper, cardboard, metal and glass, and compost your yard waste and your food waste. But plastic recycling has been an abysmal failure.

GROSS: I was surprised to learn that the industry intentionally created confusion around recycling symbols, conflating the chasing arrows symbol that indicates products were made out of recycled materials with the numbers used to indicate things that can be recycled. It’s amazing how those very simple symbols could be such a powerful tool of misinformation.

ENCK: Yes. On one hand, it’s great that people look for the symbol because they want to do their part. But it is a huge problem when it’s used deceptively. The [Federal Trade Commission] has a voluntary guide that tells you when you can and cannot say that something is recyclable and when you should and shouldn’t use the symbol. But it’s voluntary, so most of the companies ignore that.

And you know, when pressed, I do say keep recycling number one and number two plastic. You have a little bit of a fighting chance that they will get recycled. Most of the other plastic either gets littered in the environment or goes to landfills or to incinerators. And what’s really troubling is, unless plastic is burned at a garbage incinerator, which is fraught with air pollution and other pollution problems, every single piece of plastic ever created is still on the earth today.

GROSS: Even if we were able to recycle things, with all the chemicals that are in these plastics, wouldn’t recycling just be concentrating the chemicals? Do we need to worry about that with the items that actually can be recycled, the ones and twos, as well?

ENCK: A lot of these 16,000 chemicals are very toxic. We’re talking about PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, cadmium, vinyl chloride, things that should not be touching our food. Beyond Plastics does not believe that recycled plastic should be used in any food packaging. We don’t want food or beverage packaging made from recycled plastic.

We’ve looked a little bit at the Food and Drug Administration process for companies to get approval to use recycled plastic in their consumer products. And the nicest thing I can say about it is it’s a very flimsy process itself. It’s self-reporting, and the FDA seems to have a giant rubber stamp out. They’re not looking out for our health and our well-being when they allow recycled-content plastic for food packaging.

GROSS: Speaking of all these toxic chemicals in plastics, scientists have been linking plastics increasingly to all sorts of non-communicable diseases. What are they learning about potential mechanisms of harm in what seems to be a relatively new yet ballooning research field?

ENCK: It is new, which is why the cuts in federal funding for public health research is so concerning. The first really comprehensive study I looked at was the presence of microplastics in the human placenta, which was done by Dr. Ragusa in Rome with some other Italian scientists. The baby is only in utero for seven, eight, nine months and is already being born pre-polluted, and there’s also microplastics in breast milk.

Microplastics have been found in virtually every part of the human body that scientists have looked at. We either inhale them or we swallow them, and microplastics have been found in our blood, our kidneys, our lungs, male testicles.

I think two of the most significant studies are one that was published by New England Journal of Medicine, looking at microplastics in the heart arteries, and they looked at plaque, and found if you had microplastics on the plaque, which many of the patients did, you had an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and premature death. And then another recent study looking at microplastics in the brain unfortunately documented that the microplastics, nanoplastics, cross the blood-brain barrier and increase risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases.

And recently there have been a couple articles about people asking, can you get it out of your body? It’s not like lead and chelation. You know, there’s no easy way to get this out of your body. So let’s redouble our efforts to prevent it from going into our bodies.

GROSS: What is the best way for people to keep this stuff out of our bodies?

ENCK: You can’t shop your way out of this problem. There are some steps you can take. The book has a section for people to do a home audit. Look at your kitchen. Get rid of that plastic cutting board. Do not put plastic in the microwave. Only buy cotton bed sheets because you’re spending, on a good day, seven hours in bed, so make sure your sheets and blankets are not made of plastic.

I know a lot of people who tell me the great lengths they go to avoid plastic, and if I’m close friends with them, I say, “That’s really good—could you spend half of that time calling your legislator and writing a letter to the editor?” We have to get systemic change. We have to mainstream alternatives to plastics.

Now here’s the good news: A lot of the alternatives are already here. Give me old-fashioned paper, cardboard, metal, glass, because it can be made from recycled material, and actually does get recycled. But I want to emphasize, by far the most important thing is reduction, reuse and refill. Building that refill-reuse infrastructure is crucial.

GROSS: There’s a lot of talk about stopping plastic pollution at its source. So just cap the production. More than 100 countries during the recent U.N. plastics treaty talks pushed for that to no avail. What do you think some of the most promising strategies are to really get a handle on this crisis?

ENCK: I think the action is at the state and local level. There are a lot of people—and we wrote the book for these very people who want to do something about the plastic crisis—and they can show up at their city council and say, “Let’s ban plastic bags.” They can show up at their county legislature and say, “Let’s provide funding to Meals on Wheels and restaurants to install dishwashing equipment so we’re not all eating our delicious food off of, you know, polystyrene plastic plates and forks.”

The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.

And then you climb the ladder. In New York, for instance, New York City banned plastic bags, and then the state did. That one little thing of banning all plastic bags at retail stores has been immense, and it’s just one of many things that can happen.

“The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.”

GROSS: There was a pretty striking stat in the book about plastic production emitting four times more greenhouse gases than the global aviation industry, which we think of as a massive contributor to the climate crisis. Why do you think the connection between climate and plastic is still unappreciated?

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem. Then you layer on plastics as a climate issue—it’s just a lot. But it’s actually not hard to document. Back in 2001 I wanted to figure out, because no one else had done it, what are the greenhouse gas emissions over the plastic life cycle?

We commissioned a report to look at greenhouse gas emissions from production, use and disposal, and what we found was pretty disturbing. We found that 232 million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted every year. That’s the equivalent of 116 coal-fired power plants. So we did this report, The New Coal: Plastics and Climate Change.

Beyond Plastics and the Center for International Environmental Law both identified plastics as a major climate issue. I just think the climate crisis is overwhelming, and people think about power production and transportation.

Now here’s the great irony: fossil fuel companies know they’re losing market share for transportation and power production. So their plan B is plastic production. The largest plastic producer in the U.S. today is ExxonMobil.

GROSS: You dedicated the book to the low-income communities of color living in the shadow of plastics facilities in the Gulf Coast and beyond. Are there any stories you heard from people living near these plants that really stuck with you?

ECNK: I was in Port Arthur, Texas, a couple years ago, and looking at this enormous petrochemical buildout, with local residents dependent upon the jobs, dependent upon this industry to keep Port Arthur alive, and yet Port Arthur is not doing well. I toured the Houston Ship Channel with a representative from Houston Air Alliance, and saw how close people’s homes are to these facilities. Same thing in Cancer Alley in Louisiana.

Our government has allowed the creation of sacrifice zones, and that is unethical. If people had resources, a lot of them would move. But they don’t have financial resources, nor should they move. These are their ancestral homes.

You hear Jo and Joy Banner with the Descendants Project talking about how we went from plantations to chemical plants. The through line is racism. So it means a lot to have, for instance, Dr. Robert Bullard endorse the book and the others, mostly women, happy to be profiled. They’re just doing extraordinary work, facing enormous odds, but they’re also winning.

Gross: Is there a final hopeful message you’d like to share?

ENCK: We wanted the book to be hopeful, which is hard to do on this issue. But we are hopeful, because while I don’t live in Cancer Alley or the Houston Ship Channel, I can work on policies to reduce the demand for plastics. That’s why we wrote the book. You can’t just leave it to people living in Cancer Alley to solve the problem.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226334572-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:07.471384

The pandemic and geopolitical chaos have exposed the fragility of global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rates overseas is no longer viable. When the true costs emerge, delays, lost sales, and bloated inventory, the math favors inventory that is closer to the customer. When a container is delayed or a supplier in Asia is disrupted, empty shelves, stock-outs, and lost sales flood the P&L. Availability and next-day (or near-next-day) fulfilment matter far more to consumers than the country of origin. That shifts the advantage toward production and logistics closer to demand.

The Proof It’s Happening (and Not Just Rhetoric)

US Export-Import Bank Commits $100 Billion to Secure Supply Chains

This resurgence isn’t a talking point — it’s measurable.

Manufacturing and construction are at historic levels. As companies regionalize production, such as chips, batteries, and clean-energy components, spending on U.S. factory construction has surged to unprecedented highs, reaching a $223 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate in July 2025 (up from low double-digit billions less than a decade ago).

Reshoring is driving real employment growth. The nonprofit Reshoring Initiative reports that 244,000 jobs were announced in 2024, tied to reshoring and foreign direct investment, with a cumulative total of ~1.7 million jobs since 2010. Announcements aren’t the same as payrolls, but they do signal capital commitments, vendor build-outs, and logistics reconfiguration.

Companies are publicly committing to significant U.S. investments. For example, Texas Instruments announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing (in Texas and Utah), creating some 60,000 jobs. Nvidia, TSMC, IBM, and Apple have all followed suit, publicly announcing investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity this year.

Collectively, these indicators point to a re-anchoring of critical production closer to end demand.

The Technology Stack Making “Made in America” Competitive

Ultimately, it’s not enough to bring the factory home. The new path to competitiveness is via digital + proximity. Ten years ago, domestic production was seen as a cost burden. Today, tech is turning it into a competitive advantage:

AI and advanced dispatch replace manual routing, compressing decision cycles from hours to seconds.

Digital twins enable companies to simulate thousands of “what-if” supply-chain scenarios (supplier shifts, demand swings, regional disruptions) before committing capex.

Automation and robotics reduce repetitive labor and human error across inbound, warehouse, and packaging operations.

End-to-end visibility at the SKU or carton level enables leaner inventories without sacrificing control.

Executives are leaning in: Deloitte’s 2025 smart-manufacturing research reveals that manufacturers are intensifying their digital initiatives to navigate complex transformations, mitigate operational risks, and mitigate labor scarcity. Broader Deloitte work finds the vast majority of manufacturers are already implementing advanced digital capabilities beyond pilots.

From Strategy to Execution: A New Playbook for the American Supply Chain

The new manufacturing boom isn’t just about bringing production back; it’s about moving smarter once it’s here. Modern supply chains are increasingly defined by:

Flexible fleets that shift seamlessly between middle-mile, LTL, and final-mile modes.

Dynamic cross-docks and forward deployments that position inventory closer to regional demand.

Software-orchestrated visibility that enables instant reconfiguration when disruptions occur.

Success metrics that matter to customers: on-time delivery, inventory turns, sell-through, cost-to-serve (which now includes dwell, touches and damage).

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Start at the Customer Edge.Don’t “boil the network.” Begin with the customer promise and work backward. Identify where long lead times or stockouts are breaking the experience, and pilot near-market solutions that close the gap. Modular, tech-enabled cross-docks and forward-deployed inventory enable the repositioning of freight closer to demand, allowing for faster fulfillment without the need for permanent infrastructure.

Use Automation to Offset Labor Costs.The real savings aren’t in cutting labor, they’re in cutting waste. AI-driven routing, dynamic load planning, and real-time dispatch reduce empty miles and idle time across middle-mile and LTL operations. When every mile, pallet, and dock slot is optimized automatically, higher employee wages become a non-issue.

Design for Optionality, Not Rigidity.Volatility is permanent, so optionality must be too. Build networks that can flex between modes – dedicated, pool, LTL, or parcel injections – based on cost, demand, or disruption. Tech-orchestrated nodes and dynamic cross-docks enable you to shorten lanes, diversify port of entry points, and rebalance flows in hours, not weeks.

Choose Partners for Adaptability.Yesterday’s networks were built on legacy partnerships; tomorrow’s are built on APIs. Work with providers who can deliver bespoke solutions in weeks, integrate live data into your TMS, and adjust service levels dynamically. Transparency, automation, and speed of integration are now the true hallmarks of reliability.

Future-Proof Against Policy and Tariff Shocks.Geopolitics won’t stabilize anytime soon. Prepare for tariff or sourcing volatility with digital twins and scenario modeling that simulate the impact of cost, transit time, and service across different configurations. When border rules or input prices change overnight, your network shouldn’t stall; it should re-route itself.

The “American Supply Chain Renaissance” isn’t about waving flags. It’s a pragmatic response to customers who value “in-stock tomorrow” over theoretical landed-cost savings next quarter. Capex is flowing into U.S. factories at record levels; policy is accelerating strategic sectors; digital operations are collapsing time and risk. Companies that align proximity with intelligence and measure success the way customers actually feel it will set the pace in the decade ahead.

Industry Context & Drivers

What factors are driving the resurgence of “Made in America” in supply chains today? It’s simple: speed wins. Consumers don’t care where something is made—they care if it’s in their hands tomorrow. COVID and geopolitical chaos ripped the cover off fragile global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rate overseas doesn’t cut it anymore. When the true costs show up—delays, lost sales, bloated inventory—the math favors being close to the customer. That’s the shift.

How have global disruptions reshaped the cost-benefit analysis of nearshoring or reshoring? For decades, companies optimized for the lowest unit cost. That equation was broken the moment a container stuck offshore meant empty shelves and millions in lost sales. The smarter equation now is reliability times speed, divided by risk. Nearshoring and reshoring aren’t patriotic gestures—they’re risk-adjusted, customer-centric business decisions.

In what ways has technology made domestic manufacturing and logistics more viable compared to five or ten years ago? We’re not relying on nostalgia. We’re relying on new math powered by technology. AI dispatches trucks instantly, robotics strip out warehouse labor, digital visibility lets you run leaner without losing control. Ten years ago, U.S. production looked like a cost drag. Today, tech is what makes it a competitive weapon.

Technology’s Role

Which supply chain technologies are enabling companies to make U.S.-based production competitive? The breakthroughs are in AI, robotics, digital twins, and visibility. AI kills wasted human planning hours. Robotics remove repetitive labor. Digital twins let you test a thousand network scenarios before you spend a dollar. And SKU-level visibility puts you in control of inventory in ways legacy systems never could. This isn’t about keeping up—it’s about leapfrogging.

How are freight networks and logistics infrastructure evolving to support more regionalized supply chains? We’re breaking away from the monolithic mega-DC playbook. The future is modular and on-demand. Flexible fleets, dynamic cross-docks, forward deployments—it’s about configuring networks in real time around customer demand. That’s why we built Warp. Legacy LTL and pool providers are frozen in 1995. Shippers don’t need nostalgia, they need adaptability.

Do you see “Made in America” relying more on digital coordination than physical expansion? Absolutely. You don’t win by pouring concrete; you win by coordinating smarter. We don’t need ten times the warehouses—we need networks that operate like living systems, with software that flexes every asset at peak performance. The future of Made in America is built on digital intelligence, not brute force.

Investor & Policy Perspective

How are government incentives shaping decisions around domestic production and logistics? The CHIPS Act and IRA didn’t just hand out subsidies—they reprogrammed boardroom strategy. If the factory’s in the U.S., the logistics backbone has to be here too. Incentives are accelerants, but the underlying fire is customer demand for faster, more reliable supply chains.

What are investors looking for in logistics and supply chain tech companies tied to the Made in America trend? Investors are done with vanity metrics and “Uber for freight” slides. They’re asking: does your technology actually bend the cost curve and improve service? At Warp, the answer is yes—because we eliminate manual waste in freight networks. That means lower costs, faster delivery, and happier customers. That’s what investors want: defensible tech tied to customer outcomes.

Are U.S.-based logistics startups seeing a funding boost tied to this shift? Yes, but the bar is higher. Spray-and-pray money is dead. What’s left is disciplined capital chasing companies that align with policy, with economics, and with customer reality. If you can prove you’re making Made in America competitive by giving customers faster, cheaper, more reliable freight, there’s money for you.

Actionable Insights for Shippers

What are the first steps shippers should take if they want to rebalance supply chains toward U.S. sourcing or production? Start with the customer experience. Where are you failing them today—stockouts, long lead times, unreliable deliveries? Map those pain points, then rebuild lanes and sourcing strategies around fixing them first. Don’t boil the ocean. Prove it one customer problem at a time.

How can shippers use technology to identify cost savings that offset higher domestic labor costs? Focus on eliminating waste, not labor. Visibility down to the carton, automated routing, smarter packaging, dynamic cross-docks. When you cut out empty miles, extra touches, and bloated safety stock, you offset labor costs overnight. Tech isn’t just a cost saver—it’s a customer experience enhancer.

Which metrics or KPIs should shippers track to evaluate the success of reshoring or nearshoring moves? Measure what your customer feels. On-time pickup and delivery, inventory turns, sell-through rate, cost to serve, damage claims. If your shelves are full, your deliveries are predictable, and your product is moving faster, you’re winning. Anything else is noise.

What kinds of partnerships should shippers prioritize in a Made in America strategy? Only partner with tech-enabled providers who can build around your needs. You don’t need “relationships” and handshakes—you need innovators who can stand up bespoke solutions fast. That’s the difference between another vendor and a true competitive edge.

For companies hesitant about reshoring, what low-risk pilots or partial moves could they test? Pilot with the customer in mind. High-margin SKUs, seasonal launches, or key markets where delivery speed drives loyalty. Or consolidate inbound vendor freight domestically. Start small, but make sure the experiment ties directly to customer outcomes—faster shelves stocked, fewer delays, higher sales.",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2635552345-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:09.741367

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips. Now they’ve been to two, and counting.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:17.700375

As a retiree on a fixed income, she is relieved that she’ll likely never have to buy another appliance, her energy bills are lower, and her home feels safer. ​“I don’t have to worry about gas blowing up or carbon monoxide, that kind of nonsense,” she said.

Gay-Robinson is among the hundreds of people who have benefited from a provision of Illinois’ 2021 clean-energy law that allows electric utilities to meet energy-conservation mandates in part by outfitting low-income households with electric appliances that reduce their bills — even though such overhauls actually increase, rather than decrease, electricity use.

Such policies are rare nationwide, but the approach could be a tool to help keep building decarbonization rolling as the Trump administration kills federal incentives for home electrification.

Modern electrical appliances — like induction stoves, electric dryers, and heat pumps that warm and cool spaces — are generally much more energy-efficient than their fossil-fueled counterparts. That means electrifying appliances cuts the amount of fossil fuels burned, even in places where gas and coal plants feed the power grid, said Nick Montoni, senior program director of policy and markets at the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University. As more renewable energy comes online, the emissions linked to electrical appliances decrease even further.

Plus, families breathe significantly cleaner indoor air when they change to an electric cooktop, due to the slew of health-harming pollutants emitted by gas stoves.

But replacing appliances is not cheap, and under the Trump administration’s budget law, federal tax credits to help households afford electric heat pumps and water heaters expire in December — seven years earlier than they were previously supposed to. Meanwhile, the future is uncertain for the federally funded Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program, an Inflation Reduction Act initiative that is administered by states and provides incentives for electric appliances. While some states have already launched their HEAR programs, the Trump administration put the remaining funds on ice earlier this year, and Illinois has not yet received its allotment.

Amid this federal upheaval, state policies that incentivize utilities to pick up the tab for electrification can be especially impactful.

“It’s expensive to electrify because it requires up-front cost,” said Montoni, who formerly served as deputy chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. ​“You have to be able to afford a heat pump, an induction stove, an electric water heater — those aren’t inexpensive. That’s why there are rebates and incentives.”

Illinois utilities commit to electrification

Illinois law requires ComEd to cut electricity consumption each year by an amount equivalent to 2% of the utility’s annual sales in the early 2020s. The state’s other big electric utility, Ameren, faces similar rules in 2029 under a law passed this fall, though in the past it had lower savings mandates.

The 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act specifies that a portion of mandated energy savings — 5% since 2022, 10% starting next year, and 15% after 2029 — can come from electrification. The law also created a formula to convert the amount of energy used by a gas-powered appliance to electricity in kilowatt-hours, allowing an estimate of how much energy is saved by switching from gas to electric.

“So if a home gets partially or fully electrified through an electric energy-efficiency program, the utility claims the savings by calculating the difference between the gas therms in kilowatt-hour equivalents and the kilowatt[-hours] added via the electric measures,” explained Kari Ross, Midwest energy affordability advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Montoni called the policy ​“a pretty interesting mechanism — not unique, but very rare, from what I’ve seen.”

Michigan does have a similar policy, since a 2023 law allows electric and gas utilities to claim electrification as part of their mandatory energy-waste reduction. That legislation also includes a formula for determining the energy-efficiency gains from going electric.

Montoni said allowing electric utilities to count electrification toward their efficiency mandates is an important way to incentivize the shift off fossil fuels, especially in the more than a dozen states where different utilities provide electric and gas service.

When a utility provides both gas and electricity, electrification will typically show overall energy savings, Montoni explained. But when a utility provides only electricity, a formula similar to Illinois’ is needed for the utility to show that it is saving energy, even though a given customer’s electricity use actually increases after electrification.

In northern Illinois, ComEd is the primary electric utility, operating alongside two major gas utilities.

Through its whole-home energy-efficient electrification program, ComEd pays all up-front costs for electric appliances and heat pumps for households earning at or below 80% of the area median income. That initiative has electrified over 700 low-income households since it launched in 2022. The utility also offers rebates for customers of any income for purchasing electric appliances, including geothermal heat pumps.

ComEd’s energy-efficiency plan approved by state regulators says that a quarter of spending on electrification must be for low-income households, and the utility can undertake electrification only if it will save a customer money on their energy bills. Michigan’s law includes a similar provision.

“We carefully model each home to make sure proposed upgrades result in energy savings,” said Philip Roy, ComEd’s director of clean energy solutions. ​“Nationally, I’m pretty sure this is one of the more ambitious approaches to electrification, especially for income-eligible customers.”

Gay-Robinson said she has saved some money on her bills since her home’s overhaul last summer, and more importantly, she has reliable appliances to get through Chicago’s extreme weather.

She recommended the ComEd overhaul to a friend, who was suffering through hot summers in poor health and without air-conditioning. Gay-Robinson thinks the electric heating-cooling system her friend got at no cost may have saved her life.

Gay-Robinson said she still prefers cooking with gas, but she’s grateful ComEd provided new cookware along with her electric induction stove. ​“I thought it would be hard to even work the doggone stove. It looks like something out of the future,” she said. ​“But it wasn’t as hard as I thought.”

More retrofits like Gay-Robinson’s are on the way. In an agreement with stakeholder groups and regulators, ComEd has committed to spend a total of $162.3 million over the next four years on electrification and weatherization, which reduces the amount of power needed to heat and cool spaces.

In central and southern Illinois, Ameren provides both gas and electric service.

Ameren has not undertaken ambitious electrification programs like ComEd, and it had lower energy-efficiency mandates until the clean-energy law passed in October brought its targets into parity with ComEd’s. But Ameren will spend $5 million through 2029 helping customers switch from propane-fired heat, which is common in rural areas, to electric heat pumps.

Changing times

Home-electrification retrofits that lower energy bills may be harder to come by in Illinois and beyond in the future, as electricity prices spike due to the record-high cost of securing enough power-generating capacity for the PJM Interconnection regional grid, which spans 13 states.

Since ComEd is only allowed to offer customers new electrical appliances that will reduce their bills, high electricity prices mean some exchanges that worked in the past will no longer qualify; keeping a gas appliance may be cheaper.

“We are in a moment where further iteration is needed” on electrification policies, said Roy, also citing the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on appliance costs and the looming expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient equipment.

“We see a lot of momentum with these programs,” said Roy. ​“We think [electrification] will play a key role in not just energy-efficiency goals but broader energy policy. Combining all those elements — traditional energy efficiency, electrification, rooftop solar, battery storage — we have a lot of the tools, we just have to fine-tune the policy structures and incentives so we can accelerate the transition.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Water-heater-being-moved_GettyImages-2169894284.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f619c14dad71f25dfc6335203aeadbc5,N,,2025-12-01 04:58:19.927393

The global rush toward green hydrogen presents itself as a win-win solution for climate action and economic development. European leaders paint an optimistic picture: South Africa possesses abundant renewable resources, critical minerals for electrolysers, and growing industrial capacity that could position it as a global clean hydrogen leader. South African President Ramaphosa echoes this enthusiasm, envisioning hydrogen as a way to marry Africa’s mineral wealth with renewable energy to decarbonise industries while creating jobs and stimulating investment.

While green hydrogen development is promoted as a climate necessity and force for sustainable development, the inequitable investment partnerships South Africa is making with foreign partners risk reproducing the same extractive relationships where African countries provide raw input while others reap the industrial and financial benefits.

In global trade relations, access to resources and production capacity has rarely translated into control or equitable benefit. Africa’s vast resource potential has historically been externally controlled, with limited domestic value capture. This pattern risks repeating itself in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

South Africa holds a critical role in the emerging hydrogen economy as a source of renewable energy and green hydrogen production. Yet, its position is increasingly shaped by structural and historical dynamics, reducing it to a resource extraction zone, serving the decarbonization and energy security goals of Global North partners.

While European nations secure high-value activities such as technology development, market leadership, financing, trade agreements, and certification schemes within their own borders, South Africa is relegated to low-value roles in production and supply.

Germany’s National Hydrogen Strategy, for example, positions the country as the “lead provider of hydrogen technologies by 2030” (e.g. fuel cell technology), while sourcing hydrogen from partner countries in the Global South. Partner countries are expected to supply raw materials and low-value hydrogen commodities, while Germany retains control over advanced technologies and market access. Similarly, the Netherlands positions itself as Europe’s “hydrogen gateway,” capturing lucrative trading, storage, and transport activities while externalising environmental and social costs to supplier nations.

South Africa’s own Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy, though framed as nationally driven, emphasises export markets. It outlines a vision for over 100 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity, primarily for export, requiring extensive infrastructure such as desalination plants, specialised transport networks, and dedicated export ports.

This export-first approach risks diverting renewable energy away from urgent domestic priorities like energy access, industrialisation, and job creation, reinforcing green extractivism; the appropriation of land, water, and other resources for renewable energy projects in ways that replicate the exploitative patterns of fossil fuel extraction rather than inclusive development.

Mechanisms of contemporary extraction

Green extractivism operates through sophisticated neoliberal mechanisms that legitimise resource appropriation as a climate necessity. Foreign direct investment and public-private partnerships establish corporate-led governance frameworks that prioritise investor returns over local benefits. Rather than supporting adaptation and mitigation for vulnerable populations, climate finance consolidates corporate control over resource governance and embedding neoliberal policy frameworks within national strategies.

South Africa has restructured its institutions and policies to create an investor-friendly ecosystem, offering tax incentives, subsidies, and tailored regulatory processes to attract foreign investment. The German KfW Development Bank’s allocation of $1.3 billion to support South Africa’s hydrogen sector comes with structural reform conditions mandating increased private sector participation in energy governance. Public funds are channelled through the blended finance platform SA-H2 Fund to de-risk investment in the Coega Green Ammonia project, led by UK-based Hive Energy.

Despite its strategic importance, the project’s value chain remains largely dominated by foreign entities. Its substantial output of one million tonnes of green ammonia annually is geared toward export markets in Asia and Europe. Financial risks are socialised through public funding, while profits are expected to flow primarily to international investors.

South Africa’s profound structural vulnerabilities, shared by many African economies, undermine its position in international energy and trade relationships. Economic fragility, driven by persistent unemployment, extreme inequality, currency depreciation, and Eskom’s debt crisis, intersects with critical infrastructure deficits across multiple sectors. The country faces a strained electricity grid, limited gas pipeline infrastructure, water scarcity in regions targeted for hydrogen production, and port facilities ranked among the world’s least efficient.

These vulnerabilities create conditions where any promise of development becomes difficult to refuse, regardless of its terms. While South Africa mobilises its renewable energy resources to serve European decarbonisation goals, millions of its citizens continue to experience energy insecurity through persistent load-shedding. Even green fertilisers produced from hydrogen remain unaffordable for smallholder farmers.

Renewable energy generation for hydrogen production requires vast territorial appropriations that bring industrial development into direct conflict with existing land uses. Hydrogen production is particularly water-intensive, exacerbating water scarcity in arid regions like the Northern Cape, where major projects are planned.

The transformation of strategic ‘Hydrogen Hubs’ treats these regions as abstract spaces for industrial development rather than lived environments sustaining cultural identity and economic security. Sasol’s Boegoebaai hydrogen cluster in the Northern Cape, spanning 60,000 hectares, risks dispossessing the indigenous Nama people of their ancestral lands.

Similarly, the deep-water port and desalination facility to support hydrogen production risks disrupting marine ecosystems due to brine discharge, increased salinity, and thermal pollution from desalination plants. The fishing community also face displacement and loss of livelihoods, especially in areas like Port Nolloth.

Mpumalanga, long devastated as a sacrifice zone for coal production, has suffered from severe air pollution, land degradation, and widespread health impacts. The province is now home to three major green hydrogen projects being developed on land leased from Eskom, near existing coal infrastructure: Sasol Hyshift in Secunda, Camden Green Hydrogen and Ammonia in Ermelo, and HDF Renewstable Mpumalanga in Standerton.

This new wave of industrial transformation risks further marginalising local communities by concentrating the burdens of both the old carbon economy and the emerging green economy.

Contested vision of just transition

Despite the policy rhetoric emphasising ‘just transition’ — the shift to a low-carbon economy that ensures fairness and inclusion for workers and communities affected by the transition – current arrangements demonstrate a significant disconnect between transformative aspirations and material realities.

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan shows a striking imbalance between infrastructural spending on large-scale export projects and social investments in community benefits and addressing energy poverty. Of the 1.5 trillion rand total investment, only 60.4 billion rand specifically targets just transition initiatives in Mpumalanga, the province most affected by coal sector transitions.

European hydrogen strategies, including the EU Hydrogen Strategy and related initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone and Clean Hydrogen Partnership, focus on industrial competitiveness, infrastructure development, and decarbonisation targets, completely ignoring community consultation. This systematic exclusion occurs despite South Africa’s constitutional commitments to democratic governance and communities’ rights to clean water and land.

There is an urgent call for a justice-centred ‘post-extractivist transition’, one that envisions development beyond resource extraction, prioritising ecological sustainability, community autonomy, and equitable benefit-sharing across Africa. This approach should centre local control in global climate and energy debates. While some level of resource extraction may be necessary to support the energy transition, such activities must reinforce rather than erode community rights, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development.

A justice-centred post-extractivist transition should restructure international energy and trade relationships to centre genuine community participation in project design and ownership structures, recognising communities’ right to refuse projects that don’t serve their interests, regardless of broader climate justifications. Instead of treating consultation as a mere procedural requirement, it should embed community veto power into governance structures and ensure affected populations maintain meaningful control over decisions affecting their territories.

Projects should demonstrate direct contributions to addressing energy poverty and strengthening local economies through community ownership models, local manufacturing capacity, and revenue sharing that enhances rather than displaces existing economic activities. The land-intensive nature of renewable energy infrastructure makes territorial rights central, requiring integration of renewable development with existing land uses and community priorities.

South Africa faces conflicting development visions: one treating the continent as an extraction zone serving global markets, and another positioning renewable energy as a foundation for energy sovereignty, democratic participation, and equitable development.

Current policy trajectories lean heavily toward the former, but structural contradictions point to the need for alternative visions. Alternative visions must challenge the financial, trade, and governance frameworks that privilege Global North interests over Global South priorities.

South Africa could leverage its strategic position differently. Rather than competing to offer the most attractive investment incentives, it could coordinate with other African hydrogen producers to establish minimum standards for foreign investment, similar to how oil-producing nations have used collective bargaining. Regional cooperation could help resist the race-to-the-bottom dynamics that characterise current negotiations.

While the global energy transition shows signs of reproducing historical patterns of extraction, it also holds the potential to become a foundation for more equitable international trade relations. The direction ultimately depends on whose interests shape the transition’s terms and whose voices are centred in energy governance. A justice-centred post-extractivist transition must recognise the complementarity of climate action and decolonisation, and pursue these together.

The hydrogen economy is still emerging, and its final structure remains contested. Decisions made in the coming years about ownership models, governance frameworks, and benefit-sharing mechanisms will determine whether this transition strengthens or undermines the prospects for genuine sustainable development in South Africa — and whether it becomes an effective tool for global decarbonisation.

The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition.","UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (IPS) - Although Africa holds more than 30 per cent of the world’s critical green minerals—including cobalt, lithium, manganese, and rare earth elements vital for building batteries, wind turbines and solar panels— this has not translated into prosperity for the continent.

At the Africa Climate Summit 2025 held in Addis Ababa in September 2025, leaders and experts explored ways Africa can benefit more from its resources.

Under the theme “Accelerating renewable energy, nature-based solutions, e-mobility, and scaling up climate finance,” the Summit sought ways to build a resilient and prosperous future for Africa. The important question, however, was whether Africa would continue exporting its raw materials for others to reap the profit or seize this moment and drive the agenda of its transformation.

Speaking at the Summit, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Claver Gatete, called for a united African front in order to leverage these resources strategically.

“We cannot afford to repeat the exploitative patterns of the past,” he said. “Africa must industrialise using its own resources, creating jobs and sustainable growth of our people.”

The current net-zero clean energy race has triggered surging global demand for minerals used in batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, of which Africa is a key supplier.

Mr. Gatete emphasised the need for African governments to invest in local processing, value addition, and stronger regional cooperation, and avoid exporting raw minerals.

Risks and opportunities

The Summit highlighted both opportunities and risks. On one hand, critical minerals could generate billions in revenue, accelerate clean industrialisation and help Africa achieve the SDGs.

On the other hand, unchecked extraction will not benefit Africans and would worsen inequality and environmental degradation.

Mr. Gatete called for building continental capacity to process, refine, and manufacture components like batteries within Africa. He cited the ECA—Afreximbank Battery and Electric Vehicle (BEV) value chain initiative, launched in the DRC and Zambia, to build special economic zones (SEZ) for producing electric vehicle battery precursor and components as a concrete example of this shift “from resource extraction to technological innovation and prioritisation of local value addition.”

To expand this further, participants emphasised the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to develop integrated regional value chains, reduce external dependence, and unlock economies of scale. In the same breath, they called for continental unity to avoid fragmented national policies that could weaken Africa’s bargaining power.

To address this, ECA proposed the formation of African Critical Minerals Alliance—to harmonise regulations, negotiate better trade deals and promote intra-African collaborations.

“Unity is our strength,” Mr. Gatete reminded participants. “By working together, African countries can ensure that green minerals become a foundation for prosperity, not another lost opportunity.”

Africa’s financing gap for climate action was also discussed at the Summit, with leaders renewing their calls for increased international climate finance, debt relief and technology transfer. They also underscore the importance of the private sector investment aimed at strengthening regional value chains, building local processing capacity and expanding critical infrastructure.

The Africa Climate Summit 2025 ended with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Declaration, a renewed commitment to place sustainability, equity, and local development at the heart of mineral exploitation. The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition. The challenge now is how to turn that potential into lasting, inclusive prosperity for its people.

As clean technologies and renewable energy gain momentum across the UK and beyond, historic buildings face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint.

Many sustainable retrofits – such as LED lighting, heat pumps, and improved insulation – have proven relatively straightforward to implement without compromising the integrity or appearance of heritage and listed buildings. The integration of solar technology, however, has not always been readily accepted or implemented.

Solar roofing: Preserving the past while powering the future

Solar is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the world, but both official heritage guidelines and public opinion have indicated concern about the visual impact of traditional rooftop solar panels on historic buildings. The core challenge lies in reconciling modern, often bulky, technology with the architectural integrity and charm of the past.

Rooftops are ideal for solar installations, thanks to their unobstructed access to sunlight and efficient use of space. However, traditional solar panels can be visually intrusive – especially on heritage and protected buildings.

This is where building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar roofs come in: seamlessly integrated into the roof structure, they enable protected buildings to adopt clean energy without compromising aesthetics.

Blending into the architecture, quality solar roofing is often described as “invisible”. BIPV technology has now advanced to support buildings with distinctively coloured roofs – such as green oxidised copper or terracotta tiles – by offering solar materials in matching shades, allowing discreet rooftop solar integration for the first time.

UK heritage guidance embraces solar, but adoption remains limited

As the UK Government rolls out its ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan – targeting 45–47 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030 – heritage organisations have also become increasingly committed to integrating solar into their properties and guidance policies; albeit with caution to protect visual appearance.

For example, Historic England updated its guidance in July 2024 to clarify that – with the necessary permissions and careful visual planning – solar panels can be appropriately integrated into heritage buildings. Prior to this, installations were often hindered by inconsistent decision-making across local councils.

However, despite this policy progress, uptake remains low. A government-commissioned review found that 87% of heritage building owners perceive listed-building consent as a barrier, and 75% say it prevents energy efficiency upgrades. In practice, only a small fraction of heritage buildings currently feature solar installations, highlighting the failure of standard panels to win widespread acceptance.

York Minster: The exception that proves the rule

Leading the way among religious buildings, the Church of England (one of the UK’s largest heritage custodians) pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its buildings by 2030. A recent example of solar integration is the iconic York Minster, which activated 184 solar panels in January 2025. These panels, discreetly positioned on the South Quire roof, will generate around 70,000 kWh annually – roughly a third of the Minster’s electricity demand.

Yet the installation drew public criticism: “Fitting panels to a historic building like that seems absurd…” and “That seems wrong on a historic building. I’m pro solar panels, but I don’t think they’re appropriate everywhere” are just two of the comments made by local members of the public when the solar plans were announced. This underscores how traditional panels can still clash with heritage sensibilities and deter broader adoption.

Still, the emissions and cost-savings potential of solar for heritage buildings is hard to ignore.

Bath Abbey offers a compelling feasibility study on solar’s potential: modelling suggests 164 PV panels could generate around 45 MWh per year – 35% of its annual usage – saving 10 tonnes of CO₂ annually, with payback in 13 years and a projected profit of £139,000 over 25 years.

Gloucester Cathedral – which installed 150 solar panels on its nave roof in 2016 – has reduced its energy costs by over 25%. It is considered the oldest UK cathedral with a solar installation, but one of many historic religious buildings in the UK to make such a move.

BIPV: The solution for widespread adoption

Rather than relying on rare, high-profile exceptions, the heritage sector now needs a solution built for scale – BIPV solar roofing delivers this.

Instead of ‘clashing’ with history, integrated solar roofing:

Merges with the existing roofline, avoiding the ‘stuck-on’ look

Mimics traditional materials like slate, terracotta or oxidised copper with coloured options

Eliminates the most significant barriers – visual impact and public resistance – by remaining discreet.

As Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council, puts it, “In some cases, BIPV could be appropriate” for historic buildings, highlighting that suitable technology already exists today to meet the needs of heritage custodians.

Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral are two examples of iconic UK heritage buildings which have not yet adopted solar PV despite the Church of England initiatives. Their esteemed heritage status rightly calls for more careful scrutiny of how installations might impact aesthetics.

Solar roofing offers a solution. Instead of traditional panels that may jar with the fabric of these sites, mock-ups show how discreet BIPV roofing could be applied seamlessly – maintaining their tradition and style whilst generating clean, renewable energy to keep the buildings running. For custodians of these buildings, this is the first credible way to reconcile climate action with heritage protection.

Balancing preservation with progress

Renewable energy is the future – and soon, even the most exceptional buildings will need to adapt. The key is applying innovative, tailored solutions that support organisations in making the transition – with respect for their values and context. Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.

It’s a two-way street: if we're asking heritage organisations to commit to climate action, we must also respect their stewardship of historic fabric and place. That’s the difference between symbolic early adoption and genuine, scaled climate leadership.

Marrying the past with the future may not be straightforward – but it's essential. These treasured buildings will only endure if we protect both their history and the planet they stand on.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs and builds on GM and Redwood’s existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars – we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications. The memorandum enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and chief executive officer of Redwood Materials. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4 percent in 2023 to 12 percent by 2028. As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

UK: National Grid has joined the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), strengthening its commitment to expanding clean-energy infrastructure, developing local skills, and supporting economic growth across the North of England. The move comes as part of The Great Grid Upgrade, the company’s wide-ranging investment programme designed to connect more affordable, home-grown renewable power to the national network.

The announcement was marked at the Eastern Green Link 2 (EGL2) converter station visitor centre in Wren Hall, recently opened by Keir Mather MP. The event brought together apprentices, industry leaders and regional partners, highlighting the collaboration behind the upgrade programme.

National Grid’s major projects in the North include Eastern Green Link 1 and 2, Yorkshire Green, and proposed developments such as the Cross Border Connection and North Humber to High Marnham. Collectively, the company’s network investment is expected to support up to 55,000 jobs across the UK by 2030, with a significant share in northern communities.

The economic impact is already visible. On EGL2 alone, construction partner BAM is creating around 200 roles, including apprenticeships and specialist engineering jobs. ‘Meet the buyer’ events for EGL1 and EGL2 have helped hundreds of northern SMEs access new opportunities in civil works, cabling, transport, environmental services and technical design. METLEN, delivering the EGL1 converter station, has so far awarded contracts worth around $225,000 (£170,000) to small and medium enterprises.

National Grid is also upgrading Grid Supply Points and replacing overhead line crossings, such as the River Tyne, with modern cable tunnel solutions to support regional transport, industry and long-term growth.

BACKGROUND The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS.
EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.
Eliminations The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters.
However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to update several regulatory definitions defining ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Proposed Rule is a culmination of decades of agency and judicial process that at times narrowed and expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over our nation's waters. Driven by the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), the Trump Administration is poised to change the definition of WOTUS to limit federal jurisdiction. These changes are intended to respect State and Tribal authority and promote regulatory certainty and clarity.

As further explained below, the Proposed Rule would clarify the definition of WOTUS by defining ""continuous surface connection,"" ""relatively permanent,"" and ""tributaries,"" and would clarify several exemptions under the CWA. Additionally, the Proposed Rule would add a new exemption for groundwater and would eliminate interstate waters that don't themselves independently qualify as WOTUS from federal jurisdiction.

EPA and the Corps are also inviting comments on alternative approaches and additional revisions to the WOTUS definition and its implementation. Comments must be received on or before January 5, 2026.

BACKGROUND

The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS. This lack of statutory definition has resulted in ambiguity, protracted rulemaking, and decades of litigation over the breadth of WOTUS.

Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the definition of WOTUS in Sackett. The Court adopted a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, holding that the CWA's use of ""waters"" encompasses ""only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographical features,'"" such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes. Similarly, Sackett concluded that the Agencies' definition of ""adjacent,"" used to determine whether a wetland constituted a jurisdictional water under the CWA, was too broad, and affirmed that the ""continuous surface connection"" test is the appropriate standard. Shortly thereafter, the Corps and EPA under the Biden Administration promulgated regulations conforming the regulatory definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision (Amended 2023 Rule). EPA and the Corps are now proposing to revise the definition again to address concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including assertions that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court's interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction and implementation-related issues.

For additional background and history of the WOTUS saga, refer to Van Ness Feldman's past alerts and notices.1

KEY CHANGES

Definitions:

The most significant proposed changes would revise the definitions of two terms that guide whether a water is a WOTUS or not: ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection."" The rule also clarifies the definition of ""tributaries."" Each term plays an important role in determining whether a particular water qualifies as a WOTUS.

WOTUS includes (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of ""waters of the United States;"" (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary.

Relatively Permanent. The Proposed Rule would define ""relatively permanent"" to mean ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The relatively permanent definition applies to tributaries, lakes and ponds, and adjacent wetlands.

With the addition of ""at least during the wet season,"" the Agencies propose to add a temporal element to the test. ""Wet season"" would be defined using existing agency tools, and quantitatively as the point at which ""precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,"" and would vary by geographic region and ecotype. Significantly, water must stand or flow for the entirety of the wet season to qualify as ""relatively permanent;"" intermittent flow, or longer flow not occurring during the wet season do not qualify as relatively permanent waters. The Agencies are soliciting comments on alternative methods that could better define the wet season given site and region-specific factors.

Continuous surface connection. The Proposed Rule would define a continuous surface connection as one ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.""

EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season. The Agencies explain that this is meant to limit the scope of jurisdictional wetlands by suggesting that even if a wetland is more broadly delineated, only those portions of the wetland that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season are under federal jurisdiction.

Tributaries. The Proposed Rule would redefine tributaries as ""bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.""

This definition expressly excludes ""a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through [natural or artificial] feature[s]... if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow."" However, tributaries do include natural, man-altered, and man-made waterbodies, such as rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, ponds, and impoundments,"" as long as they connect to a downstream traditionally navigable water. Tributaries may connect through non-jurisdictional features, so long as those features convey relatively permanent flow.

Exclusions

The Proposed Rule would modify three existing jurisdictional exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and adds a new exclusion related to groundwater.

Waste water systems. The Proposed Rule would continue an existing exclusion for waste treatment systems, and define ""waste treatment systems"" as ""including all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the [CWA], including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).""

By adding this definition, the Proposed Rule appears to expand the scope of the exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system. The Preamble of the Proposed Rule acknowledges that a cooling pond constructed within a WOTUS would be excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction provided it complies with CWA requirements.

Prior Converted Cropland. The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland. The Agencies propose that prior converted cropland is considered abandoned if it is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. The Proposed Rule also explains that agricultural uses can include myriad conservation and non-extractive uses, providing that the Agencies' new list of agricultural uses ""may not be obvious to Corps field staff,"" such that the Corps can rely on public or private documentation that the land is being used in accordance with the agricultural uses set forth in the rule.

Ditches. The Proposed Rule would clarify the types of ditches that are excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction, explaining that non navigable ditches that are constructed or excavated ""entirely in dry land"" are not WOTUS. The Proposed Rule explains that ditches that channel or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their jurisdictional status if the tributary continues to meet the regulatory definition of a tributary.

New exception for groundwater. The Proposed Rule explains that groundwater has never been interpreted as WOTUS, explaining that groundwater is by nature not navigable. However, ""surface expressions of groundwater,"" like groundwater that emerges from the ground and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream, are not subject to the exclusion and would continue to be subject to federal jurisdiction if they otherwise meet the requirements of a WOTUS.

Eliminations

The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters. Eliminating these triggers would remove lakes and streams that straddle state borders, that do not themselves independently meet the regulatory definition of a WOTUS. The Agencies reason that this has been a consistent source of litigation, reads out ""navigable"" from the statute, and is ultimately not supported by Sackett or Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The Proposed Rule provides that nonjurisdictional interstate waters are appropriately regulated by the ""States and Tribes under their sovereign authorities.""

Additionally, the Proposed Rule would restrict mosaic wetlands to the individual wetland segments, which previously together constituted a single wetland comprising the hydrologically connected segments. In particular, this has significant implications for jurisdictional determinations in Alaska, where permafrost wetlands have long been regulated under the mosaic wetland interpretation.

Additionally, the Agencies are seeking comment regarding whether to adopt a USDA definition of wetland under the Food Security Act that expressly excludes certain permafrost wetlands in lands with high agricultural potential in Alaska.

Implications

The Proposed Rule would limit the scope of federal jurisdiction over the nation's waters and correspondingly reduce the federal regulatory burden and compliance issues for work done in and near waters that are no longer considered jurisdictional. We would anticipate a significant reduction in the number of Section 404 permits and associated CWA 401 water quality certifications. However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.

Once finalized, additional litigation on the final rule is almost certain to occur.

Furthermore, irrespective of this rulemaking, states and Tribes will likely use their own regulatory authority to fill the gap left by Sackett and the finalized rule. States, including Washington, have ongoing rulemaking processes to further develop their regulatory authority over state waters.

""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity.
Advt At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems.
Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""
To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital.","The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a holistic green transition that strengthens finance, boosts recycling systems, and simplifies environmental approvals, saying this shift is essential as India moves closer to its $ 5 trillion economy goal.

Elaborating on the CII Proposals in this area, Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, underlined that India needs a green transition not as a choice but as a strategic requirement for long-term growth. ""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity. This transition is vital not only for meeting climate goals but also for shaping India's long-term growth, competitiveness, and global standing,"" said Banerjee.

At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems. Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""

According to him, India needs nearly $ 1 trillion in green investments over the next 10 to 15 years, and close to $ 10 trillion by 2070, to reach its net-zero goal. But current finance flows meet only about one-fourth of this requirement. To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital. The body can be set up in GIFT City and supported by global funds without needing direct government spending. It can offer concessional finance, equity support, guarantees, and securitisation to bring down project costs across renewable energy, clean mobility, green buildings and industrial decarbonisation.

Banerjee also proposed a ""Green Tech Expo Fund"" to help Indian clean-tech companies participate in global technology events. The idea is to push India's growing innovations in green technology onto the world stage and build partnerships with global investors and buyers.

He further highlighted the strong need for a recycling strategy for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, as India depends heavily on imports. Rules for mandatory recycling of batteries and electronics, fast-track clearances, and incentives for domestic recovery of minerals, were also suggested. Banerjee recommended creating Circular Economy Parks for waste like plastics, tyres, e-waste and batteries, with 15 parks in three years and 45 in five years.

To make approvals faster and clearer, Banerjee has proposed a unified Environmental and Climate Clearance Authority with a fully digital system and automatic approvals within fixed timelines for projects that meet low-emission and sustainability norms. He also stressed the need for energy-efficient buildings, recommending a National Digitalization of Built Environment Initiative and uniform adoption of building energy codes.

As India builds for the future, the shift must go beyond electric vehicles and renewable power to include green finance, easier environmental processes, stronger recycling systems and sustainable buildings. ""These are vital for not only building a resilient, innovative, and inclusive economy but also offer significant untapped opportunities for investors looking to capitalise on these transformative trends,"" Banerjee said.
