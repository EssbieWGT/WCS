We are here today on the 15th anniversary of the Kalamazoo River oil spill so that history does not repeat itself.
""The massive Enbridge oil spill into our Kalamazoo River was so toxic that when we went that day to see it firsthand, we quickly left, feeling ill from the smell.
He talked about the Kalamazoo River oil spill and its legacy.
“A movement that says never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers.","Environmental groups gathered over the weekend to mark the 15th anniversary of an oil spill into the Kalamazoo River. The message they delivered is this: That oil spill 15 years ago was a warning about what could happen if an oil pipeline that runs through the Great Lakes is not shut down.

Tented booths were set up to represent different groups that responded to what happened 15 years ago when Enbridge’s Line 6b burst. One-point-two million gallons of oil was recovered from that tar sands oil spill along more than 35 miles of the Kalamazoo River and one of its tributaries near Marshall, Michigan.

A report from the Federal On-Scene Coordinator extensively details the event and the damage, but residents say there was also a toll on them that is incalculable.

The Michigan Climate Action Network organized the event at the Historic Bridge Park near Battle Creek. That site was chosen because it was part of the long stretch of contaminated shoreline.

Denise Keele is the Executive Director of that group. She says no one has forgotten the damage caused by Line 6b. That’s why they worry about Line 5.

“The message remains the same: to shut down Line 5 and no oil tunnel. We are here today on the 15th anniversary of the Kalamazoo River oil spill so that history does not repeat itself. We should learn from our mistakes.”

Keele added the other mistake is perpetuating the use of fossil fuels that’s causing disruption of the Earth’s climate.

Local residents say they've paid a price because of the oil spill 15 years ago.

""The massive Enbridge oil spill into our Kalamazoo River was so toxic that when we went that day to see it firsthand, we quickly left, feeling ill from the smell. We knew it must never happen again,"" said Iris Potter with the group Kalamazoo Remembers.

She said Michigan should learn from that experience as the state reviews permit applications from Enbridge for a proposed tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of the 72-year-old the Line 5 pipeline.

“So now, just envision that in the Straits and beyond. A spill happens when you least expect it and quickly the beauty is gone. Believe me,” Potter said to the crowd and an online audience watching the speeches.

Nichole Keway Biber is the Mid-Michigan Organizer of Michigan Clean Water Action. She’s also a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. She noted that today Line 5 is more than 30 years older than Line 6b was when it ruptured.

“The many places that 645-mile-long pipeline crosses over waters is close by to the Great Lakes, beyond just the absurdity of that four-mile-stretch beneath the Straits. That’s all a threat. That pipeline is over 70-years-old,” Biber said.

Some of the environmental groups’ leaders spoke to those gathered at the event. Sean McBrearty is Coordinator of the Oil and Water Don’t Mix campaign. He talked about the Kalamazoo River oil spill and its legacy.

“This was entirely man-made. And it was only as big as it became because the negligence of the people who know, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the federal government are asking us to trust the Great Lakes with.”

He said that devastating Line 6b oil spill -one of the largest inland oil spills in the U.S.- spurred a movement.

“A movement that says never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers. A movement that says we’re going to protect our Great Lakes. And make sure the same company responsible for this oil spill does not strike again, this time with a larger pipeline running more oil in the heart of the Great Lakes.”

Right now, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is taking comments from the public on permit applications submitted by Enbridge. The company wants to tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of Line 5. The current pipeline sits on the lakebed of the Straits that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

Beth Wallace is the Great Lakes climate and energy director for the National Wildlife Federation. She said EGLE is falling short in its responsibilities. It should be reviewing what kind of environmental damage could be caused by tunneling under the Straits of Mackinac in addition to the impacts where the tunnel construction begins and ends above ground.

""Our own state agencies, the ones that were stuck here sucking oil out of the river, seem to be playing right into the hands (of Enbridge), refusing to properly assess risk for a pipeline that poses a disaster for 20 percent of the world's (accessible) fresh water,"" Wallace told the crowd.

She questioned whether the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy was fulfilling its obligations under the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act to review whether the drilling of the tunnel itself would have environmental impacts.

“Who are the decisions really serving? They’re not the people of Michigan. They’re not the tribes who have stewarded these waters for generations, and not the millions that rely on the Great Lakes.”

In a previous Michigan Public news story, EGLE said that during its review of the Enbridge Line 5 tunnel proposal, the top priority has been protecting the Straits of Mackinac and surrounding wetlands from adverse environmental impacts. The tunnel would hold a pipeline that carries petroleum products through an environmentally sensitive area, replacing the line that runs along the bottom of the straits.

EGLE added that The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is used primarily for construction projects on the bottomlands of the lake.

When asked what the groups were willing to do to stop Line 5 and the proposed tunnel, Wallace said if EGLE does not do its job fully, the National Wildlife Federation will take the agency to court.

Nichole Keway Biber with the Michigan Climate Action Network and member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa responded to the question this way.

“Our indigenous people and our nations and our allies aren’t going to let this happen. We cannot. We cannot. So, if they want us to be up there camping out, and bring our drums, and bring our medicine, we’re ready to do that,"" she said to cheers and applause of several of those gathered.

When asked for a comment regarding the concerns of the environmental groups, Enbridge responded:

""Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed.

We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions.""

EGLE is taking comments about the construction of the proposed tunnel and any concerns about environmental damage caused by it are being taken online or through the mail until August 29. You can learn more about the permits and leave comments here. Or you can submit comments by mail to:

Dr Tan See Leng, Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science & Technology, said in an interview on July 21 that the country needs to acquire technical expertise in this area to ensure its safety.

“Our neighbours, the Philippines, Indonesia, have publicly signalled that they intend to build nuclear plants. So, regardless of whether we have made the decision, our neighbours have made the decision,” he said in his first interview in the new portfolio.

Dr Tan was previously overseeing energy issues as Second Minister for Trade and Industry.

Five Asean countries – Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand – have said they are either studying the feasibility of advanced nuclear technology to meet their growing energy needs, or already have plans to build new reactors in the coming decades.

As Singapore continues to evaluate the viability of nuclear energy for the country, local talents have to be trained so they can determine whether advanced nuclear technologies are safe and suitable for the Republic when these come onto the market, Dr Tan said.

On July 11,

the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Institute

was launched with an aim to train 100 nuclear experts by 2030 – up from the 50 today.

Singapore also renewed the Third Country Training Programme Memorandum of Understanding with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on July 25.

Under the agreement, Singapore will develop training programmes with the UN nuclear watchdog to support developing IAEA member states with fellowships, scientific visits and training courses.

Topics covered will include human health, industrial radiography, environmental radioactivity monitoring and analysis, and accelerator science.

Singapore’s approach to nuclear energy has changed over the years, as new technologies come online.

In 2012, the Republic had initially considered atomic power nuclear technologies of that time unsuitable for deployment in the small city-state.

Dr Tan noted that conventional nuclear plants are large, and require exclusive buffer zones. “Categorically, let me tell you that they will not be suitable for us,” he said .

But nuclear technologies have evolved since.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are thought to be more suitable for land-scarce, population-dense Singapore, as they have a lower power capacity, enhanced safety standards and require much smaller buffer zones, compared with conventional reactors.

Dr Tan said: “We have not excluded that... because there is a lot of promise for some of the advanced modular reactors – the physics, the engineering, the technical feasibility, all point to the fact that they are possible, but it is just that commercially, they are still not viable yet.”

He also stressed that ensuring the safety of nuclear technologies is of “paramount importance” to the Government.

While Dr Tan acknowledged that Singaporeans may still have certain perceptions about nuclear energy, he said the country still needs to press ahead in this area given the interest from some of its neighbours .

Singapore has bilateral agreements with the United States and France to pursue cooperation on nuclear energy, which could better help in the country’s evaluation of the viability.

In July 2024, the Republic inked the

123 Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation with the US

, which will allow Singapore to learn more about nuclear technologies and scientific research from American organisations.

For example, local research institutes could work with US national laboratories and technology companies to perform safety simulations and modelling of SMRs.

In May, Singapore and France

signed agreements on nuclear energy

to facilitate cooperation on safety, workforce development, research, environmental protection, the protection of public health, and emergency preparedness and response, among others.

Dr Tan said that these partnerships will enable Singapore to learn more about the regulatory approvals, safety protocols, operations and engineering designs, among other things.

The US tariffs are not likely to affect these agreements, he said.

Dr Tan said that the learnings from the partnerships will help Singapore eventually make the assessment on whether to “jump in, or just stay at the capacity- and capability-building level”.

He added that Singapore is also open to exploring partnerships with other countries that have nuclear expertise, such as the United Arab Emirates, China and South Korea.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1e7ddf5bcfb2abd985225536f6a6c2038ddb8a4eb93c6f141eb9e265f6094f6c,N,,2025-07-27 20:59:30.024598

Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies are expected to raise the cost of food, electricity, and insurance, while weakening the safety nets that protect vulnerable families.

By slashing tax credits and subsidies for solar, wind, and energy storage, the administration has stifled the growth of renewables and tilted the energy market back toward carbon-emitting fossil fuels. As a result, utility bills are climbing. Nationally, residential electricity rates have risen by over 6% in the first half of 2025 alone, with average household energy costs up more than $200 compared to 2022. Forecasts suggest that these bills could rise by another $170 to $640 annually by 2035, depending on the region and the pace of fossil fuel reliance.

At the same time, the growing intensity of climate-driven disasters, such as droughts, floods, and wildfires, are pushing food prices steadily higher. Crop failures and supply chain disruptions are expected to drive food inflation by roughly 3% annually, making groceries increasingly unaffordable for low-income families.

Insurance costs are surging as well. Property and auto premiums have risen sharply in recent years due to worsening climate risks. As the administration dismantles climate resilience initiatives and reduces federal disaster aid, insurers are passing the risk onto consumers which are pricing many out of adequate coverage entirely.

These rising costs hit low- and middle-income working Americans the hardest. They spend a greater share of their income on food, energy, and housing. Yet the administration has proposed cutting programs that help cushion these blows, like energy assistance (LIHEAP), food aid (SNAP), and Medicaid. The result is a perfect storm: higher bills and fewer lifelines. These costs are expected to rise the fastest and the sharpest in rural parts of America.

But consumers are not powerless. They can voice their dissatisfaction by contacting elected officials, voting for candidates who support climate resilience and affordability, and joining grassroots efforts that advocate for clean energy and economic justice. Local and state governments also remain key battlegrounds where people can push for renewable mandates and utility protections.

Fluctuations in the prices of fossil fuels due to geopolitical conflicts have driven up energy prices. Dealing with the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, is also critical for Singapore, he said.

“Energy is existential for us, just like water was existential in the 90s,” said Dr Tan in his first formal interview as Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science & Technology on July 21.

The portfolio sits under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and was created in the

latest round of Cabinet changes

in May. Dr Tan was previously Second Minister for Trade and Industry, and he continues to helm the Manpower Ministry in the new Cabinet .

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had said that science and technology are key drivers of growth, while energy – especially clean energy – will be an important part of his Government’s agenda.

Singapore now relies on natural gas, a fossil fuel, for about 95 per cent of its energy needs.

The Republic’s goal

is to reach net-zero emissions – where the total amount of emissions is balanced by activities to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – by 2050.

Achieving this would require the energy sector, which makes up about 40 per cent of the nation’s total emissions, to cut its emissions.

Dr Tan said Singapore is exploring all possible options in its energy transition to ensure its energy needs are met in a sustainable, resilient and cost-effective way.

“Nothing is off the table. We will explore every single pathway, every single possibility, and... make sure it is cost-effective and sustainable,” he said.

During the 90-minute interview, Dr Tan fielded a range of questions about Singapore’s energy future, from developments in the Asean power grid, to the country’s

exploration of nuclear and geothermal energy

, and the role of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage.

He acknowledged that Singapore’s energy transition will result in higher costs, and said the Government will provide support to help people cope.

For example, utility rebates such as the U-Save rebates help households to offset utility expenses, while climate vouchers are meant to encourage them to switch to green appliances. Meanwhile, he said the Government will work with businesses such as through energy efficiency grants to help them manage this impact.

“It is not going to be possible for the cost to not go up,” Dr Tan said. “But what we will endeavour to do is to manage that gradient... and supplement it with rebates, with grants to help our local population, our households and businesses.”

The promise of energy imports

Dr Tan said that in the near term, renewable energy imports hold the most promise for Singapore.

The Republic has limited access to renewable energy resources, so importing clean electricity generated elsewhere can help.

In 2024, Singapore

raised its low-carbon electricity import target

from 4 gigawatts (GW) to 6GW by 2035. This is expected to make up around a third of the country’s energy needs by 2035.

Dr Tan said there is a possibility to increase the target beyond this, depending on partnerships.

The Asean power grid – which will allow countries to share renewable energy resources – is also gaining traction, with a growing number of bilateral discussions on the issue.

For example, Singapore and Indonesia in June

inked three key agreements

to strengthen cooperation in clean energy and sustainable development, including agreements on cross-border electricity trade.

A regional grid is a win-win for countries importing and exporting renewable energy, Dr Tan noted.

It will not only help Asean achieve its net-zero ambitions earlier, he said, but also bring about economic growth to the countries. “Given the vast amount of potential that is within Asean itself, you could unlock significant economic opportunities,” he added.

A

US-Singapore study

on energy connectivity in South-east Asia had assessed that building the Asean power grid can generate US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) annually in research and development, and create as many as 9,000 jobs a year.

Asked if the breakdown of multilateralism around the world helped to focus attention on the importance of the regional grid, Dr Tan said: “I think that in a way, we’ve all been encouraged as a result of all of the recent developments.”

He added: “I don’t think there’s any one major particular push. It’s a whole series of nudges. I think the tariffs could also be one of those reminders to encourage all of us to come together and work even more closely as one united Asean.”

Dr Tan said the other pathways that Singapore is exploring – such as the use of carbon capture technologies, the potential of hydrogen as a clean fuel, or tapping nuclear energy – are “still some distance away”.

“So I think in the foreseeable next five years, you will see a lot of work on renewable energy imports, and at the same time, still natural gas, and how to decarbonise natural gas.”

The importance of partnerships

Calling his new portfolio a “redesignation” since he had also overseen energy issues as Second Minister for Trade and Industry, Dr Tan said the new title will help him up the ante in international partnerships.

“It allows a more seamless coordination across the different government agencies within Singapore and also at the same time, when we negotiate internationally,” he said, noting that many countries have dedicated energy ministers.

Dr Tan said that while progress on the Asean grid has been made, challenges remain. These include logistical issues like the need to upgrade existing infrastructure to transfer energy.

This is where Singapore could step in to provide investments, such as initial funding to crowd in more capital for cross-border energy projects.

For example, the Government has appointed Singapore Energy Interconnections, a newly incorporated government-linked company, to specialise in developing cross-border power infrastructure.

Singapore’s

$10 billion Future Energy Fund

– set up to catalyse investments in clean energy technology that may involve high upfront costs and significant commercial, technological and geopolitical risks – could also provide initial funding.

But to attract other sources of capital, such as from the private sector, government-to-government frameworks will be needed to give investors greater certainty, said Dr Tan.

That would improve the “bankability” of such projects, he said . “I think it will attract significant investments, both from public capital, private capital, and even longer-term philanthropic capital .”

Going forward, Dr Tan said natural gas will likely remain a core pillar in Singapore’s energy mix.

But its share will change depending on the development of technologies.

“A good position for Singapore is that by the mid-2040s, natural gas will be around just slightly below 50 per cent of our mix,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ee418fdc7aa0e1455190b140453401f967a9e65221555d9ba2fd8c8209796e6e,N,,2025-07-27 20:01:49.269730

He urged European leaders to “stop the windmills,” because they are ruining their countries.

Mr. Trump made the remarks ahead of a key meeting on tariffs with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

“I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it. It’s so sad,” Mr. Trump said Saturday.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump repeated his plea as he sat with Ms. von der Leyen and other leaders in Scotland ahead of the tariff talks.

“We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains,” the president said.

Mr. Trump is a longtime opponent of wind energy. He failed in his bid to block an offshore wind project near his Turnberry Golf Resort in Scotland.

The president said nine windmills can be seen from the resort, where he played on Sunday.

He’s hoping Europe bans windmills.

“Today I’m playing the best course, I think, in the world, Turnberry. Even though I own it, it’s probably the best course in the world, right?” Mr. Trump told reporters as he sat among European Union leaders. “And I look over the horizon and I see nine windmills. I said, isn’t that a shame? What a shame you have the same thing all over all over Europe, in particular, you have windmills all over the place.”

Wind, and in particular offshore wind, is one of the most expensive ways to provide energy, according to analysts.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January prohibiting new wind projects in the United States, although ongoing projects are allowed to continue.

Mr. Trump said the turbines are noisy, harm marine life, kill birds, ruin landscapes and rust after eight years. There is nowhere to safely bury them, he said.

“Germany tried it and wind doesn’t work,” Mr. Trump said. “You need subsidies for wind energy and energy should not need subsidies.”

Many U.S. states and some European countries have turned to wind energy to help achieve a goal of net-zero carbon emissions, but wind is intermittent and has not been able to fill the gap in Europe created by closing coal and nuclear power plants.

Wind supplied more than a quarter of Germany’s electricity in 2023 but it was not enough to power the grid thanks to slower-than-typical wind speeds. A massive increase in output from gas-fired power plants was required to keep the country out of the dark. Electricity prices are higher in Germany than in any other country in Europe.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/07/27/Trump_Scotland_92032_c0-71-1695-1059_s1200x700.jpg?9aa0cfe699f755c20a2826c1805466334ff01e52,N,,2025-07-27 20:01:57.022779

“Some of the highest quality steels are being made right here in Mississippi County.” When Hybar is fully operational, it will employ more than 154 workers.
They didn’t hire a general contractor to construct the facility, Stickler said.
Even before Hybar began operations, Mississippi County was by volume the largest steel-producing county nationwide.
Stickler said he’s not surprised the Mississippi County has become, by volume, the largest steel producing county in the country.","More than a decade ago, a group of businessmen in the steel industry decided to embark on an ambitious plan. They decided to build a steel mill in southern Mississippi County on the Arkansas River near Osceola.

Big River Steel (BRS) opened in 2017, and a few years later was sold to U.S. Steel, BRS founder and former CEO David Stickler told Talk Business & Politics. A second mill, BRS II, was opened near the first one last year and now Stickler has opened Hybar, a steel mill that produces rebar in the shadows of the first two steel mills he helped to bring to the county.

“These are some of the finest steel mills in the world,” he said. “Some of the highest quality steels are being made right here in Mississippi County.”

When Hybar is fully operational, it will employ more than 154 workers. It will produce 700,000 tons of rebar annually. Stickler said they had to raise about $1 billion to build Hybar and construction began in August of 2023. They didn’t hire a general contractor to construct the facility, Stickler said. The company entered into a “hybrid” construction partnership with Lexicon, a company that specializes in building steel mills.

The arrangement allowed Hybar to keep its construction costs down and allowed the company to remain in control of the mill’s construction flow, but they got the expertise of one of the leading mill construction companies in the country, he said.

Lexicon CEO Patrick Schueck said the project partnership was beneficial for both companies.

”Lexicon was honored to serve as the construction manager for Hybar’s new rebar mill,” Schueck said. “With this project marking the fifth steel mill our team has built in the region, we brought decades of industrial construction expertise to the project. From breaking ground to rolling out the first ribbed rebar, the facility was completed in approximately 22 months — an incredibly aggressive timeline for a mill of this scale and complexity. What makes this project especially significant is that it showcases how Lexicon can lead large-scale industrial builds that push the boundaries of innovation, efficiency and sustainability. Our longstanding partnership with leaders in the steel sector, including Hybar, enabled us to align construction methods with forward-looking clean energy goals and LEED certification standards.”

One of the key features of the Hybar facility is the solar array, Stickler said. The array can power the plant that takes scrap metal and melts it. The melted steel is then cast into billets and afterwards it is hot rolled and then bent into shape. The array is among the practices and technological features that make the mill one of the most energy efficient in the industry, he said.

“From a broader perspective, this facility sets a new benchmark for sustainability in the U.S. steel industry. It’s the first in North America to produce rebar using 100% solar energy — thanks to a behind-the-meter solar installation — and it reduces emissions by up to 50% compared to traditional mills,” Schueck said.

Even before Hybar began operations, Mississippi County was by volume the largest steel-producing county nationwide. In 2024, 72.3 million tons of steel was produced in the country, and about 9.5 million tons of that was produced in the county, or about 13% of the country’s steel output.

The steel mills employ about 5,000 people directly and indirectly employ almost 8,000.

Rebar is used to build many things including bridges, tunnels, high rise buildings, ports, airports, public works projects and others.

“The demand for rebar is never ending,” Stickler said.

Schueck agreed with Stickler. During the next year he expects a lot of major construction projects to unfold and the demand for steel, and specifically rebar, will be high.

“From my perspective, the outlook is quite optimistic,” Schueck said. “We’re seeing a renewed focus on domestic production, which I believe will lead to an uptick in large-scale construction projects. We’ve already had indications from major steel producers that they’re committed to expanding their capacity here in the U.S., and that’s a positive sign. The demand for infrastructure improvements and new facilities — like data centers and manufacturing plants — is strong, and I expect that to drive growth in our sector. We’re also tracking several significant projects, including chip plants, that are coming into play, and I think we’ll see more announcements in the near future.”

Two companies, Nucor and Commercial Metals Company (CMC) control about 75% of the rebar market, Stickler said. Both are in the rebar fabrication business, and that hurt independent fabrication firms, he said. For instance, if an independent fabrication firm wants to bid on a bridge project, they will go to one rebar producer to get a price. At times, some of the rebar producers will raise the price or try to outright take the project from smaller fabrication companies.

Stickler said Hybar will not get into the fabrication business and will not “squeeze” those businesses. It will, however, expand its rebar production footprint, he said.

Plans are underway to construct another rebar producing mill adjacent to the current facility, he said. Construction is slated to begin in late summer or early fall. This facility should cost about $100 million less because the site drainage work, retention pond, and heavy haul road have already been built. But inflation has been on the rise and that will impact project costs, he said.

Hybar may also build one or two other rebar mills. Sites in Georgia and South Carolina have been examined, he said.

Stickler said he’s not surprised the Mississippi County has become, by volume, the largest steel producing county in the country. Public officials have been easy to work with, the state has a regulatory atmosphere that is conducive to business, and the workforce is outstanding.

He envisions Hybar having the most efficient workforce in the industry and that will lead to more money in workers’ pockets — through higher production.

“My goal is to have the highest paid steelworkers, with the lowest labor costs — we will achieve that through higher production and efficiency,” he said.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hybar1_Aug2025.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 20:02:00.403052

Parry says the government should decide the details of the charge now but not impose it until electric vehicles make up at least 30 per cent of light vehicle sales and, later, heavy vehicle sales too.

“We need the certainty of knowing how the charge will work, but there is a convincing argument that it should not be imposed until EVs are better established,” he says.

“Right now, we need more EVs to reduce our carbon emissions and support Australia’s fuel security. Every EV on the road reduces our need for imported fuel.”

The collaboration aligns with Tanzania’s broader energy reform agenda, which includes the recently launched National Energy Efficiency Strategy (2024–2034).
As Tanzania continues to champion clean energy—both regionally and globally—the success of the IGE programme highlights the power of collaboration.","Dar es Salaam. In a move that experts believe could accelerate Tanzania’s transition to clean energy, researchers and senior government policymakers have sealed a collaborative pact aimed at delivering evidence-based reforms to fast-track the country's clean cooking ambition.

This initiative comes as Tanzania continues to grapple with the heavy reliance on biomass fuels for cooking—a staggering 85 percent of the population still depends on firewood and charcoal, according to government estimates.

The resulting emissions not only endanger human health but also undermine the country’s environmental and climate targets.

Speaking at a workshop hosted at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) on July 27,2025, as part of the Inclusive Green Economy (IGE) programme, Deputy Commissioner at the ministry of Finance, Dr Remidius Ruhinduka, emphasised the urgency of this partnership.

“Energy plays a pivotal role in achieving development objectives, particularly in improving citizens’ quality of life while safeguarding the environment. If we want to reduce emissions by 2030, there must be a shared understanding between researchers and policymakers,” Dr Ruhinduka said.

The event also marked the graduation of the programme’s first cohort of civil servants, who, over the past year, have worked alongside researchers to tackle the theme of “Energy Efficiency and Reduced Emissions” under the IGE initiative. Funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the IGE programme has been implemented since 2021 across five East African countries—Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia.

In Tanzania, it aims to build capacity within ministries and government agencies to formulate sustainable policies grounded in research and economic-environmental policy instruments.

“In the past, there was a significant gap between policymakers and researchers. Researchers had solutions, but decision-makers were unaware of them. Through IGE, we have successfully bridged this gap,” said the IGE Lead in Tanzania, Dr Aloyce Hepelwa.

According to Dr Hepelwa, this collaboration has already resulted in policy reform recommendations that will serve as catalysts for improved clean energy advocacy at household level. The ministries involved in this cycle of the programme included the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Transport, and the Rural Energy Agency (REA).

“The aim is to promote the adoption of energy-efficient domestic appliances and identify strategies to improve policy enforcement,” Dr Hepelwa added.

The collaboration aligns with Tanzania’s broader energy reform agenda, which includes the recently launched National Energy Efficiency Strategy (2024–2034). The strategy seeks to: Enhance energy security, promote innovation, reduce poverty and mitigate climate change.

These reforms, according to Dr Ruhinduka, are essential if the country is to realise its 2030 emissions reduction targets, as committed under international climate frameworks.

Yet, despite this ambitious policy landscape, the uptake of clean cooking technologies remains low. According to experts, this is due to a combination of factors including lack of awareness, high costs, and cultural preferences.

“Even though electric cookstoves are available, many Tanzanians are unaware of their benefits. There are companies offering incentives for electricity usage, but the public response is still minimal,” noted an environmental expert from the Vice President’s Office-environment, Mr James Choyi.

Mr Choyi, who is also among the first cohort of the programme, stressed the importance of providing consumer incentives and strengthening community-level awareness to complement policy-level reforms.

Research-backed policies for vision 2050

The IGE model could serve as a blueprint for other national goals, including Tanzania’s long-term Vision 2050, which seeks to transform the country into a middle-income, climate-resilient economy.

“We have trained policymakers to use economic policy instruments to design impactful, evidence-based strategies that support economic growth without harming the environment,” Dr Hepelwa noted.

Experts argue that embedding research into every phase of policy development—from agenda-setting to evaluation—will ensure that Tanzania’s development efforts are both inclusive and sustainable.

“This partnership is not only timely, but it is critical for ensuring that our climate targets are not just political promises but achievable goals rooted in science,” said a clean energy researcher from Ardhi University, Dr Magdalena Peter.

As Tanzania continues to champion clean energy—both regionally and globally—the success of the IGE programme highlights the power of collaboration.

Stakeholders are now calling for continued funding, scale-up of the initiative, and institutionalisation of researcher-policymaker networks across all sectors.

“Our ambition is to see all policy reforms informed by data, and more importantly, designed by people who understand both the science and the systems,” concluded Dr Ruhinduka.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/resource/image/5133994/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/80894b82dac2d896f9401cce792b3d50/Ye/clean-energy-for-cooking-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 19:00:03.438851

If approved, it will influence the trajectory of renewable energy investment and policy for years to come.
Developers, investors, and manufacturers will need to adjust their expectations based on the final structure of the tax-and-spending package.","Senate Republicans introduced an amendment in July 2025 aimed at modifying key provisions within President Trump’s proposed tax-and-spending package. The amendment seeks to adjust the phase-out schedule of subsidies for wind and solar projects, as well as eliminate a proposed excise tax on components sourced from China.

The original proposal outlined by the administration included a gradual reduction in financial incentives for renewable energy over a defined timeline. However, the amendment put forward by Senate Republicans aims to soften the pace of this phase-out, allowing for continued support of the sector during a period of transition. This adjustment is intended to provide greater stability for developers and investors who rely on these subsidies to fund and execute large-scale renewable projects.

In addition to revising the subsidy phase-out, the amendment also targets a separate component of the tax-and-spending plan. The original proposal included an excise tax on solar and wind equipment manufactured in China. This measure was designed to address trade imbalances and protect domestic manufacturing interests. However, the amendment seeks to remove this excise tax entirely, signaling a shift toward a more market-oriented approach.

The proposed changes reflect a broader strategy to balance economic growth with energy policy objectives. By extending the availability of subsidies, the amendment supports the continued development of renewable energy infrastructure, which has seen significant growth in recent years. At the same time, the removal of the excise tax acknowledges the role of international supply chains in the production of critical components, many of which remain essential to the U.S. energy sector.

The amendment is currently under review and is expected to be debated as part of the larger tax-and-spending package. If approved, it will influence the trajectory of renewable energy investment and policy for years to come. The changes could also affect the competitive landscape for domestic and international suppliers, reshaping procurement decisions in the clean energy market.

Industry stakeholders have been closely monitoring the legislative developments, as the outcome will impact project planning, capital allocation, and long-term operational strategies. Developers, investors, and manufacturers will need to adjust their expectations based on the final structure of the tax-and-spending package.

The Senate’s proposed amendment underscores the ongoing evolution of U.S. energy policy and the political dynamics shaping its implementation. As the debate continues, the final version of the package will determine the extent to which subsidies are maintained and how international trade considerations are integrated into domestic energy strategy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 19:00:06.505669

Once complete Clean Energy Link – North is expected to make around 400MW of existing wind and another 1GW – enough to power around 500,000 homes – of new renewable energy available to customers across the SWIS and allow for more clean energy generation in the Mid-West.
“Clean Energy Link – North is pivotal and the start of our accelerated planning for future transmission corridors to unlock renewable energy across the state.","The Western Australian Government has awarded new contracts totalling $342 million as part of the state’s largest investment in electricity transmission infrastructure in more than a decade.

Western Power said this is an important milestone in Western Australia’s clean energy transition and phased coal exit by 2030.

The investment enables major upgrades to the northern section of the SWIS (South West Interconnected System), the electricity distribution network servicing Western Australia from Geraldton to Albany and east to Kalgoorlie.

The contracts signed with GenusPlus, UGL Engineering, and Acciona are part of a $584 million State Budget commitment for Western Power to undertake network upgrades and expansion as part of the Clean Energy Link – North program.

The Western Australian Government said it has now invested $1.6 billion in the State’s electricity network expansion.

Clean Energy Link – North includes high-capacity transmission lines, terminals, substations and transformers installed to unlock the flow of clean energy in the regions north of Perth.

The upgrade runs from Western Power’s Northern Terminal in Malaga to Three Springs.

These contracts will deliver a 26.5km overhead 132kV transmission line from Wangara to Neerabup Terminal, new 132kV and 330kV terminals and line within the existing network, including existing line conversions and upgrades.

The work also includes the design and construction of new bays and associated lines at Regans Ford, construction of a new terminal at Three Springs and upgrading the existing transmission network in and around the Northern, Neerabup and Eneabba Terminals.

The Western Australian Government said that more than 400 jobs will be created, with the upgraded transmission network able to take more renewable energy to service households and businesses.

Once complete Clean Energy Link – North is expected to make around 400MW of existing wind and another 1GW – enough to power around 500,000 homes – of new renewable energy available to customers across the SWIS and allow for more clean energy generation in the Mid-West.

This increased capacity is more than the output from the two largest state-owned coal-fired power stations (Muja D and Collie) – of just under 750MW combined.

Western Power CEO, Sam Barbaro, said the utility has undertaken extensive scoping and planning for this project, and these contracts will lay the groundwork for the next five years.

“We look forward to working with [Genus, Acciona and UGL] as they help us deliver the critical infrastructure needed to continue the transition of the network to cater for renewable energy growth towards net zero,” he said.

Western Australian Energy and Decarbonisation Minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, said strengthening and expanding Western Australia’s main electricity network is fundamental in enabling industry and households to be powered by renewable energy from the Mid-West.

“It will mean industry can reliably and safely connect their wind, solar and battery projects to the transmission network, increasing the amount of renewables on our system, with the aim of doubling them by 2030,” she said.

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill.
Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.
“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs.
1777 and Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Act adds “insult to injury.” This story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization.","MAINE, USA — It would be hard to argue that Maine’s solar incentive program hasn’t been successful in spurring the development of small-scale solar projects. Since it was established in 2019, the program, formally called Net Energy Billing, has helped bring hundreds of arrays and more than 1 gigawatt of solar power onto the grid — far exceeding the program’s 750 megawatt goal.

Where community support for the program wanes is on the issue of costs, with critics arguing that NEB has become a raw deal for Maine ratepayers who have subsidized solar development to the tune of more than $200 million annually.

Enter L.D. 1777, a bill that the Maine Legislature passed with bipartisan support last month and that Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on June 27. The administration and other proponents of the measure, including lead sponsor Rep. Sophia Warren (D-Scarborough), say overhauling the NEB program is necessary to better protect ratepayers amid rising energy prices.

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill. “This new law is a responsible, forward-looking reform that ensures we can continue growing clean energy while protecting Mainers from rising electricity bills.”

But solar energy advocates and developers warn that the law, which retroactively impacts projects that have already been built or are already under construction, threatens to put Maine’s growing renewable energy sector on ice.

Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.

“The cost of electricity, the numbers on folks’ utility bills, we need to take those incredibly seriously and look for the many ways that those costs can be lowered,” she told The Maine Monitor.

“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs. That’s incredibly disappointing.”

Among other things, the law tasks the Public Utility Commission with establishing a new credit payment structure for non-residential customers in NEB’s tariff rate program. Instead of the current structure, where rates are tied to standard utility electricity rates, they would be capped and increase at 2.25 percent annually.

When Warren introduced her bill in May, she said having the tariff rate tied to volatile natural gas and fossil fuel markets ultimately led to “unexpectedly high returns” for renewable energy developers.

“In many cases, these rates now exceed what is required for project viability and are placing an unnecessary burden on nonparticipating ratepayers,” she wrote in written testimony to her colleagues in the House.

The law also makes changes to the NEB credit program, imposing new monthly per-kilowatt fees on community solar projects ranging in size from 1 to 5 megawatts beginning next year, with larger arrays paying more to local utilities. A 1 megawatt array would pay $2,800 per month, while a 5 megawatt project would pay $30,000. The new fees do not impact projects smaller than 1 megawatt, such as household rooftop arrays.

The changes are expected to slash overall payments to existing community solar farms by approximately 20 percent and save Maine ratepayers approximately $61 million annually over the next 16 years, according to the state’s Office of the Public Advocate.

Across the board, members of MREA in the solar development space have voiced to Donoghue that L.D. 1777 will significantly impact their current projects in Maine and their future relationship with the state.

“They are likely or have already directly communicated to me that they are no longer going to look to build projects in Maine because they perceive it as too risky from a regulatory perspective,” she said.

Nexamp, a member of MREA that has dozens of community solar projects across Maine, called the law’s retroactive policy changes “a breach of economic trust” that will “permanently damage Maine’s reputation as a climate leader.”

The adoption of L.D. 1777 came as Republicans in Congress were putting the final touches on President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful” budget bill, which includes numerous provisions meant to stymie the nation’s buildout of renewable energy.

The federal act, which Trump signed into law days after L.D. 1777 received Mill’s signature, rapidly phases out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects and terminates tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

Together, the federal act and the new state law leave Maine’s clean energy sector in a precarious place, according to Donoghue and Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group.

“I do find that it’s been a little frustrating to hear state policymakers in Maine criticizing these federal actions when they really don’t need the help of DC to kill solar programs in the state of Maine,” Daniel said, stressing that uncertainty in the Maine market will drive clean energy investors to do business elsewhere.

As for Maine’s new, more aggressive target of achieving 100 percent clean electricity by 2040, Donoghue worries that the state now finds itself with limited options to get there.

“We’re going to be exceptionally challenged to meet those goals,” she said, adding that the combination of L.D. 1777 and Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Act adds “insult to injury.”

Keeping the agency running could require them to use money that would have otherwise gone to a laboratory to test Guam water for contaminants, and a new headquarters.

Lastimoza reported earlier this month that Guam EPA stands to lose around 85% of its budget as the Trump White House looks to slash “categorical grants” from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in fiscal 2026. She said the cut would “literally eliminate” the agency’s operations.

The USEPA gives categorical grants to state and territorial governments to help comply with environmental laws that are on the books.

The White House has pointed to the cut as a way to save taxpayers $1 billion, while making jurisdictions responsible for their own programs.

“It is true that for fiscal year 2026, all categorical grants, which is basically our consolidated grant, will be eliminated,” Lastimoza told the Guam EPA board.

But she said the agency is still due about a $1.9 million allotment for fiscal 2025, which will come by the end of September.

Lastimoza said the money, which is a little more than half of the $3.4 million or $3.5 million GEPA gets annually from the grant money, will help the agency get through fiscal 2026.

Likewise, Guam EPA is still on track to get $9 million from an emerging contaminant grant meant to help the agency build a new lab and headquarters in Dededo.

Lastimoza said the program manager for Guam has agreed to use some of that $9 million to cover salaries, if it comes to it.

“However that works out, he’s willing to work with not shutting down the agency,” Lastimoza said.

Redirecting funds will require Guam EPA to either slow down building the lab and headquarters, scale down its “bells and whistles,” or not proceed at this time, she said.

There’s already a contract out for architectural and design work for the building, meant for construction at the old Dededo solid waste transfer station, the Pacific Daily News has reported.

Lastimoza said getting the design work done will still get Guam EPA a “shovel-ready” project whenever funding becomes available.

The lab the $9 million is meant to pay is expected to improve Guam EPA’s ability to test drinking water for emerging contaminants, chemicals that were only recently classified as toxic or discovered in water supplies.

Lastimoza said renovating Guam EPA’s current facilities, which belong to the airport and are close to being condemned, is not an option.

Other potential sources of revenue include use taxes, the administrator added.

Guam EPA by law gets 20% of use tax collections, which historically amounts to $60 million a year, Lastimoza said.

That translates to about $12 million annually for Guam EPA but the money goes directly into the Guam EPA Environmental Cleanup Fund to cover costs for preserving natural resources.

Vice Speaker Tony Ada’s Bill 8-38 would shift that money so that Guam EPA can hire employees, but Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero vetoed the bill in June.

The governor’s veto message took issue with the timing of the bill, which requires a detailed plan from Guam EPA for the money, and said it couldn’t go into effect until fiscal 2026.

Lastimoza on Thursday said if Guam EPA needs to, it will ask lawmakers to appropriate money out of the General Fund to keep operations running.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/c2/bc2d81d6-a66a-59de-ad37-9a3d6bcceeca/60ee4c74e6182.image.jpg?crop=1803%2C947%2C0%2C101&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-27 18:01:08.524050

cleveland.com (TNS)

COLUMBUS — If your electricity bill feels unusually steep this summer, rising temperatures aren’t the only reason.

A record-breaking auction in the wholesale electricity market last year set higher prices for future supply. Ohioans saw increases that averaged 10%-15%, according to the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council.

And another financial heatwave is on the horizon.

Earlier this week, PJM Interconnection — Ohio’s regional grid operator—released the results of its latest capacity auction. Prices jumped 22% from last year’s record, hitting the maximum allowed rate of $329.17 per megawatt-day.

These new costs will appear on electric bills in June 2026, with expected increases of 1.5% to 5%.

The price hike isn’t just about hot summers. It’s tied to a sharp rise in electricity demand, fueled by the growth of data centers and artificial intelligence.

A February report from the Ohio Business Roundtable projected the state’s energy needs could climb 50% over the next decade.

Without more power generation, the report warned, Ohio could face brownouts, higher bills, and missed opportunities for economic growth.

Blame the auction, not the AC

It’s easy to blame the air conditioning when your power bill goes up in the summer. But this year, there’s more going on behind the scenes.

PJM formed in the late 1950s when utilities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland joined to expand an integrated power pool.

Today, PJMmanages the power grid for 13 states, including Ohio, and each year it holds an auction to make sure there’s enough electricity available in the future.

Think of PJM like an air traffic controller for the electric grid.

It directs electricity from hundreds of power plants, plans for weather events, sets wholesale prices, and ensures your lights turn on every time you flip a switch.

One of its most important tools is the annual capacity auction, which sets the price utilities must pay to guarantee backup power is available three years ahead.

That includes having enough energy on hand for peak times, like hot summer afternoons.

PJM says capacity costs typically make up a small share of what you pay. But last year’s record-breaking auction pushed Ohio electric bills up by 10% to 15%.

This week’s auction could add another 5% starting in June 2026.

Stuck in the queue

Experts say these price spikes are happening because PJM isn’t approving new power plants fast enough. Since 2014, only 7% of proposed projects have actually made it onto the grid.

“It’s very easy for your eyes to glaze over because the details are excruciating,” said Abraham Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute. “But it’s really important to realize that the queue is the graduating class of seniors who are going to take the jobs from those of us who are retiring.”

In other words, the new generation of energy projects — solar farms, wind turbines, and natural gas plants — needs to step in as older coal and gas plants retire. When those new resources get stuck waiting for approval, the entire grid has fewer options to keep prices low.

“The reason it makes such a difference,” Silverman added, “is they are the greatest way of decreasing prices.”

Advanced Energy United Director John Gordon said 95% of the projects in PJM’s queue are renewable energy projects. Some have been waiting on their approval for six years.

The long delays have forced a few power developers to withdraw their projects altogether as building costs, business plans, and market conditions have shifted in the years they’ve spent waiting.

“It’s really just tragic, frankly, that this massive resource has been held up,” Gordon said.

That backlog has also raised eyebrows at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

“It takes [PJM] twice as long as what’s required,” said Clara Summers, campaign manager with Consumers for a Better Grid. “This price spike was avoidable and should never have happened.”

Forecasting the future

While PJM’s backlog is slowing down the supply of new energy, local utility companies are adding pressure from the other side of the equation—by raising the amount of power they say customers will need.

Before utilities can buy future electricity through PJM’s auction, they have to predict how much power their customers will need three years from now.

These predictions are called load forecasts, and they play a major role in how PJM calculates its prices.

“Consumers are on the hook for paying for this future demand,” Summers said. “It’s really important to get the forecast right.”

One of the biggest challenges is figuring out how to account for data centers.

The massive buildings store and process information for things like cloud services, artificial intelligence, and social media.

These centers use huge amounts of electricity, and utilities often include proposed data centers in their forecasts.

“Too often a proposed data center is included in a utility’s load forecast even if it has little chance of being built,” Summers said.

There’s a difference, in her opinion, between a company that has expressed interest in building a data center and one that has put down money.

“Only one of those is reasonable to include,” Summers said. “Sometimes there are five to 10 times more than the number that will actually be built.”

When PJM uses these load forecasts in its auction, it can lead to higher prices. And when auction prices go up, so do customer bills.

Political power struggle

Not everyone agrees with how PJM is handling the rising cost of electricity.

The debate is increasingly political, especially between states that export energy and those that rely on importing it.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro negotiated a price cap in this year’s auction to keep prices from climbing even higher. Without that cap, PJM says electricity costs could have hit nearly $389 per megawatt-day—an 18% jump beyond the new price.

Pennsylvania can make demands of PJM because it produces more electricity than it uses.

But some Ohio lawmakers believe that gives Shapiro too much power.

Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman has said the price cap undermines free-market principles and could put Ohio at a disadvantage.

Huffman has even floated the idea of Ohio leaving PJM altogether and joining a different regional grid operator called MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

“If that’s going to be how PJM acts,” he said, “we need to consider, do we want to be part of a non-free market system?”",https://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/135137909_web1_Electricity.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 18:00:57.327500

Utility companies also may offer incentives for energy efficiency improvements, so check with yours.","Substantial tax credits for improving a home’s energy efficiency, such as $2,000 for installing a new heat pump, were supposed to last through 2032 but now the rules have changed.

The new deadline: New Year’s Eve 2025.

The huge tax-and-spending package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill” stripped away federal funding on most initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency and combatting climate change. That includes consumer tax credits for electric vehicles (they now expire Sept. 30), home energy improvements and tax incentives for building utility-scale solar and wind power projects.

For homeowners planning energy-related improvements, from adding insulation to replacing major systems, there are just months left to act. Any items eligible for the credit must be installed by the Dec. 31 deadline.

There are no income limits on seeking these tax credits. They can be claimed for a number of energy-saving improvements to a primary residence.

The credits are non-refundable dollar-for-dollar reductions in income tax liability, which means they can reduce one’s tax bill to zero but any remaining credit wouldn’t be refunded to the taxpayer or carried over to future years.

So, how can they be used and what are they worth?

Up to $3,200

The tax credits are worth 30 percent of the cost of improvements, but with different rules and maximum credits for different things. Altogether, the most that can be claimed for energy efficiency improvements is $3,200.

The largest credit, up to $2,000, is for installing a qualifying heat pump or heat pump water heater.

All those tax credits listed above add up to thousands of dollars, but remember that the maximum that can be claimed is $1,200, plus up to $2,000 more for the separate heat pump tax credit.

You may also have noticed the word “qualified” keeps popping up. All of the improvements that can result in a tax credit must meet efficiency standards, such as Energy Star’s “most efficient” rating for windows, or the 2023 International Energy Conservation Code standards for insulation.

Those can be looked up on irs.gov, and check with your installer.

Thinking of installing solar panels, geothermal heating or a battery storage system? Those separate 30 percent federal tax credits now have an end-of-year deadline, too.

For electric vehicle chargers, those must be placed in service by June 30 next year to claim up to $1,000 of the cost as a tax credit.

Remember that the things I’ve just outlined are only the federal tax credits. Utility companies also may offer incentives for energy efficiency improvements, so check with yours.

For example Dominion Energy offers a $750 rebate on the purchase of a qualifying heat pump water heater and $500 on a heat pump, which would be in addition to the federal credit.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/f6/4f6f58e8-2ddb-4179-ba8b-cf5d5b180bd7/634db30d5aa57.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C176&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-27 18:00:33.498737

This twenty-year partnership seeks to address the growing energy demands of Meta’s data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) operations. The deal marks a significant step as Meta becomes one of the first tech giants to directly engage with an existing nuclear power facility, the Clinton Clean Energy Center. This collaboration is set to provide a substantial portion of the electricity needed to power Meta’s expansive digital services, including Facebook and Instagram, as well as its evolving AI tools.

The Power of Nuclear Energy in the Digital Age

As the digital world expands, the need for large-scale, reliable energy infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Meta’s partnership with the Clinton Clean Energy Center signifies a strategic approach to meeting this demand through nuclear energy. The Clinton facility will increase its output from 1,121 megawatts to 1,151 megawatts, an enhancement that underscores the potential of nuclear energy to support technological advancements. This increase of 30 megawatts is estimated to power approximately 800,000 households in the United States, showcasing the extensive reach and impact of such energy solutions.

Other tech companies are also turning to nuclear energy. Google, for instance, has entered into agreements involving small nuclear reactors, while Microsoft plans to revitalize the Three Mile Island plant. These decisions reflect a growing trend among tech firms to secure robust energy sources that can sustain the rapid growth of AI and other digital innovations. By investing in nuclear power, these companies are not only ensuring the continuity of their operations but also contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

Economic and Environmental Implications

The agreement between Meta and Constellation Energy is not just about powering data centers; it also has significant economic and environmental implications. The Clinton plant benefits from Illinois’s zero-emission credits program, which incentivizes low-carbon energy production. This program, however, is set to expire in 2027. Post-expiration, Meta will continue to provide financial support through its energy agreement, aiding in the renewal of the plant’s operating license and ensuring the continued contribution of nuclear energy to the state’s grid.

Environmentally, nuclear energy offers a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, which is crucial in the fight against climate change. By supporting nuclear facilities, Meta and other tech giants are playing a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices. This shift towards nuclear power could serve as a model for other industries seeking to balance energy demands with environmental responsibilities.

The Role of Tech Giants in Shaping Energy Policy

Meta’s involvement in nuclear energy is indicative of a larger trend where tech companies are increasingly influencing energy policy and infrastructure. According to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Energy, the certainty of operational continuity is a significant concern for utilities, making these partnerships vital. The collaboration with Constellation Energy could inspire other companies to invest in existing nuclear infrastructure, ensuring reliability and sustainability for future data center operations.

Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation, expressed the company’s ongoing discussions with potential clients nationwide, highlighting the broader implications of Meta’s lead in this area. By investing in operational nuclear facilities, tech companies can secure stable energy supplies while supporting the longevity and modernization of critical infrastructure. This proactive approach not only benefits the companies but also bolsters the local economies and communities dependent on these energy plants.

Local Impact and Job Security

The partnership between Meta and Constellation Energy extends beyond energy production; it also plays a crucial role in securing jobs and economic stability for local communities. Bobby Wendell, a union representative, emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable work environment at the Clinton plant. For many employees, the continued operation of the plant ensures job security and economic prosperity, which are vital to both the workforce and the surrounding community.

The support from tech giants like Meta provides a lifeline for these facilities, enabling them to continue operations and contribute to the local economy. As the demand for energy grows, the involvement of major corporations in sustaining energy infrastructure becomes even more critical. This partnership highlights the interconnectedness of technological advancement, energy sustainability, and community well-being.

As Meta sets a precedent in the tech industry with its nuclear energy agreement, the future of energy consumption for digital enterprises appears poised for transformation. While the benefits are evident, it raises important questions about the role of technology in shaping energy policy and the balance between innovation and sustainability. How will these developments influence global energy strategies, and what further steps will tech companies take to ensure a sustainable future?

The next phase of this trade relationship will unfold as the EU's Clean Industrial Deal and U.S. industrial policies converge.","The U.S.-EU trade deal finalized in July 2025 marks a seismic shift in transatlantic economic relations, with far-reaching implications for American energy and industrial sectors. At its core, the agreement hinges on two transformative commitments: the EU's pledge to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years and a $600 billion investment in U.S. industry. These figures are not mere numbers—they represent a recalibration of global trade dynamics, driven by geopolitical necessity and economic strategy. For investors, the deal opens a window of opportunity in sectors poised to benefit from this unprecedented alignment of transatlantic interests.

Energy Sector: A Windfall for U.S. Producers

The EU's $750 billion energy purchase is a direct response to its urgent need to reduce reliance on Russian gas. This commitment is structured around two pillars: liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear fuel. The EU has agreed to a $250 billion annual procurement of U.S. LNG, totaling $750 billion over Trump's second term. This shift is already reshaping the U.S. energy landscape.

LNG Exporters as Key Winners

Companies like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Sempra Energy (SRE) stand to gain significantly. The removal of EU retaliatory tariffs and the establishment of long-term contracts create a stable revenue stream for these firms. For example, Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminals are now prioritized in EU procurement plans, ensuring capacity utilization rates near 100% for the foreseeable future.

Nuclear Fuel and Renewable Synergies

Beyond LNG, the EU's commitment to U.S. nuclear fuel and green energy infrastructure is equally compelling. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act, which mandates 40% of clean energy components be sourced locally, aligns with U.S. firms like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Vestas Wind Systems (VWS). These companies are expanding their European footprints through green hydrogen and battery storage projects. The EU's decarbonization goals, paired with the Trump-EU deal's tariff reductions, create a fertile ground for U.S. renewable energy firms to scale operations in Europe.

Industrial Sectors: A $600 Billion Infusion

The EU's $600 billion investment in U.S. industry is a strategic move to bolster American manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure. This influx of capital is expected to flow into sectors critical to both economies: semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, and industrial electrification.

Semiconductors and Advanced Manufacturing

The EU's investment will likely target U.S. firms under the CHIPS and Science Act, such as ASML (ASML) and Intel (INTC). By reducing EU tariffs on U.S. semiconductor equipment to zero, the deal removes a major barrier for American firms seeking to expand their European operations. Additionally, the EU's procurement of $150 billion in U.S. military and industrial goods will drive demand for defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX).

Industrial Electrification and Grid Modernization

The EU's Clean Industrial Deal, announced in February 2025, complements the trade agreement by accelerating electrification and grid upgrades. U.S. firms involved in grid infrastructure, such as Siemens Energy (SIEGY) and General Electric (GE), are well-positioned to benefit from EU-funded projects. The EU's $1 billion Industrial Decarbonisation Facility will further support U.S. clean energy technology deployments in Europe.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the deal presents immense opportunities, investors must remain vigilant. The EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, a retaliatory tool beyond tariffs, could disrupt market access if trade tensions resurface. Additionally, the EU's decarbonization goals may reduce long-term demand for fossil fuels, including U.S. LNG.

To mitigate these risks, a diversified approach is prudent. Investors should consider industrial conglomerates like 3M (MMM) or Honeywell (HON), which operate across multiple sectors and geographies. For the energy sector, hedging with renewable energy ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) can balance exposure to both fossil fuel and clean energy transitions.

Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Transatlantic Trade

The Trump-EU Trade Deal is more than a political achievement—it is a catalyst for economic transformation. By securing the EU's $750 billion energy purchase and $600 billion investment, the U.S. has positioned itself at the center of a new energy and industrial era. For investors, the key lies in identifying firms that align with these strategic priorities: U.S. LNG exporters, renewable energy leaders, and industrial innovators. As the EU pivots toward energy security and decarbonization, the U.S. energy and industrial sectors are set to reap the rewards of this historic agreement.

The next phase of this trade relationship will unfold as the EU's Clean Industrial Deal and U.S. industrial policies converge. Investors who act decisively now will find themselves at the forefront of a transatlantic economic renaissance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 18:00:52.647976

The Trump administration is moving to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 “endangerment finding,” a cornerstone of federal climate policy. The finding declared greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, a danger to human health and welfare, providing the basis for numerous regulations on emissions from cars, power plants, and industries.

READ: Gaza’s Starvation: US House Speaker Johnson Points Finger At Hamas, Despite IDF Reports

Led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA’s draft proposal argues the agency overstepped its legal authority in issuing the finding. This action directly challenges the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, a statute that critics argue was never intended to regulate CO2.

The administration’s move also leverages the Supreme Court’s recent decision to do away with the Chevron Deference, which previously compelled courts to defer to agency interpretations of federal law.

If successful, revoking the finding would significantly limit the federal government’s ability to regulate carbon emissions. This move is expected to face strong opposition and legal challenges from climate advocacy groups, who maintain that climate change impacts have only worsened since 2009.

However, the administration frames this as a necessary step to curb regulatory overreach and allow market forces to drive energy and climate solutions, emphasizing concerns about rising energy costs and grid reliability under current policies.

The impending legal battle will determine the future scope of federal climate regulation in the U.S.

Before announcing the deal, Trump said that “pharmaceuticals won’t be part” of the deal as his administration is creating a more aggressive approach in that sector.","President Donald Trump announced a sweeping new trade deal between the United States and European Union on Sunday.

The bloc has agreed to purchase $750 billion of American energy and invest $600 billion into the US beyond current levels while the US imposes a 15% tariff on most goods being imported from the EU.

The US president revealed the deal shortly after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland.

“I think it’s the biggest deal ever made,” Trump said.

“I think we both wanted to make a deal,” the president added. “It’s going to bring us closer together. I think this deal will bring us very close together.”

Part of the agreement also involves the EU to “purchase a vast amount of military equipment” from the US. Trump noted that “We don’t know what that number is” yet.

After making the deal, Von der Leyen and Trump both shook hands.

“The starting point was an imbalance — a surplus on our side and a deficit on the US side,” Von der Leyen said when asked about Trump’s concessions. “And we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic.”

Previously, Trump had threatened to place a 30% tariff rate against the EU if they failed to reach a deal with the US.

Von der Leyen had went to Scotland with the purpose of meeting with Trump and working out a trade deal. Both parties put the odds of coming to an agreement at 50% an hour before announcing the deal.

Before announcing the deal, Trump said that “pharmaceuticals won’t be part” of the deal as his administration is creating a more aggressive approach in that sector.

During their post-meeting press conference, Von der Leyen called Trump a “tough negotiator and dealmaker.” Trump interjected adding “and fair.”

During a gaggle with reporters on Sunday, Trump said he has no intention of delaying the Aug. 1 tariffs deadline a third time.

So far, Trump has made preliminary tariff deals with the UK, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines.

He also has a variety of tariffs in place now, including a 25% rate on automobiles, aluminum and steel as well as 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico.

Trump has also reached a tariff truce with China and has given Beijing until Aug. 12 to cut a deal.

Earlier this month, the US president gave Moscow an ultimatum to create a peace deal with Ukraine amid their ongoing war or else face 100% secondary tariffs on Russian energy.",https://thenationaldesk.com/resources/media2/16x9/5338/986/1x152/90/6810bf86-6e65-46f4-9600-06e33fd7d8c6-AP25208611431791.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 18:01:17.266959

Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change.","NEW YORK (AP) — When world leaders, diplomats, business leaders, scientists and activists go to Brazil in November for the United Nations’ annual climate negotiations, poverty, deforestation and much of the world’s troubles will be right in their faces — by design.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

It hums mellow on top of our homes/unfastens softly listlessly upon our streets navigates noiselessly along beneath the farmland grounds a mile removed. This Energy Revolution is called green energy — and it is quickly changing how we live, work, travel and dream.

From Sunlight to Switchboards

Enter a well-designed home today and there is a faint but strong shift that you will feel. Solar panels shimmy with pride-cum-sustainability on the building roofs, sending clean energy into the kitchen, the bedroom and other corners. Smart meters minute by minute keep count of each unit of energy and on we need to think carefully. The era of mindless consumption of power is over, and the era of mindful consumption has come. It is due to the strong government efforts and the rise in knowledge about climate facts that solar energy has finally ceased to be a luxury. It is a way of life.

Mobility, Reimagined

Silent hum of electric motors is taking over roaring engines on our roads. Schoolchildren are transported by e-rickshaws, urban highways are glided by electric buses and electric charging points appear as green points at malls and parking spaces. The EV (electric vehicle) tsunami is not on its way, but it has already hit the shores, and it is accelerating. Things used to be considered futuristic are now becoming a part of our morning commute. EVs are taking over the pace of the city powered by clean grids and anchored by tech.

Empowering the Grassroots

This is not a change that is limited to sky lines of the cities. Green energy is being installed in heartland India and brightening villages where power used to flicker off -- or not show up at all. Microgrids in the form of solar power supply are used in classrooms, clinics, and community centers. Without any dependence on diesel prices and fuel panic, farmers continue to water their farms using solar-powered pumps. Renewable energy is an opportunity to many, and yet not merely an environmental solution since it leads to opportunities, education, and empowerment.

Innovation at Every Turn

There is the bio energy plant which turns kitchen waste to cooking gas on the one hand, and windows which act as solar panels on the other, innovation is blossoming. Entrepreneurs and start ups are building green solutions out of ideas that can be scaled. The green collar army of installers, technicians, energy auditors is expanding, generating good jobs in the back-yards around the nation. India is at the perfect position to spearhead this green revolution as it has the blend of ancient wisdom and the latest technology.

A Greener Rhythm of Life

Green energy is not all about watts and volts. It is all about embracing more respect towards the earth by adopting a mellower pace, one that looks forward. It is about generating power in homes instead of polluting rivers, and in commuting instead of casting a haze in the sky. It is all about compassion, self-sufficiency and reconnecting people and the environment.

The Road Ahead

Naturally, there are problems on the way. The technologies of storage, energy equity, and infrastructure remain to be addressed. But the trend is obvious and cannot be turned back. Since green energy moves in silently and revolutionizes our everyday lives, it also changes the vision of progress: greener air, less noisy towns, stronger friendly communities, and a planet that heaves a bit easier. Therefore, the next time your ceiling fan hums on a sunny afternoon or your EV passes a petrol station, just stop and figure it out, you are not consuming energy. This is how you are creating the future.

In the first half of the year, US EV sales hit a record of 607,000 but declined in the second quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book.
A GM spokesman said the new investment will create more jobs there, though the company is not putting a number on staffing yet.","(Bloomberg) —

General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution plan to add more battery production lines at their joint venture plant in Tennessee to make lower-cost cells starting in late 2027, the companies said in a statement Monday. The amount of the investment was not disclosed.

The Ultium Cells LLC plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, will begin to make lower-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries, or LFP, in addition to more-expensive and longer-range nickel-based batteries. The new LFP batteries will enable GM to make more lower-priced electric vehicles.

The news comes as most automakers are pulling back on electric vehicle investments in the US market. EV sales in the US have slowed and President Donald Trump’s tax bill cuts the $7,500 federal tax incentive for battery-powered models in September.

But GM remains committed to EVs. After spending $35 billion to develop its Ultium battery platform and a dozen models, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra sees electric drive as the long-term future and a near-term way to win over buyers as other automakers back off.

In the first half of the year, GM’s EV sales more than doubled to more than 78,000 as its $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV sold near 28,000. This is the low-priced EV’s first year of full production.

GM may be a lone bright spot in the market. In the first half of the year, US EV sales hit a record of 607,000 but declined in the second quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. Tesla Inc. sales are on pace for their second annual decline.

Barra hired former Tesla Inc. executive Kurt Kelty to rethink GM’s battery strategy. With him running the energy storage operations, GM has invested in LFP technology, different cell shapes that can store more energy on board and another chemistry called lithium manganese rich batteries that the company believes will lower EV costs and give drivers satisfactory driving range.

Rival Ford Motor Co. has pulled back from EVs. The company scrapped plans for a three-row electric sport utility vehicle and pivoted toward hybrids and other vehicles that still run with a gasoline engine on board.

The Ultium Cells Spring Hill plant currently employs about 1,300 people. A GM spokesman said the new investment will create more jobs there, though the company is not putting a number on staffing yet.

In 2024, China’s primary coal mining region, Shanxi, produced around 1.27 billion tonnes of coal, which is more than that of India.
However, thanks to the government’s rapid renewable energy rollout, the country is growing to rely less on coal and is developing its green energy sector.
Several other companies have also established operations in Shanxi to support the transition from a coal region to a renewable energy hub.","China’s coal hubs are some of the biggest in the world, with the Asian country having long relied on the fossil fuel for power and industry. However, some of these regions are now being transformed into green energy hubs, as China gradually reduces its reliance on coal in favour of renewable alternatives. One such region is Shanxi in the North of China.

In 2023, China produced around 4.71 billion tonnes of coal from over 3,000 mines. Coal is China’s biggest source of carbon emissions. However, with China pledging to achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and to net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, the government is gradually closing its coal mines as the country expands its renewable energy capacity.

If Shanxi were a country, it would be the second-biggest coal producer in the world, after China. However, thanks to the government’s rapid renewable energy rollout, the country is growing to rely less on coal and is developing its green energy sector. China is developing more wind and solar power than the rest of the world combined, and its wind and solar power generation soared to almost 1,500 GW in April, exceeding its fossil fuel output.

In Shanxi, around one in ten people work in the coal and related industries. There are fears that as China shuts down its coal mines, many people in the province will be left unemployed. More than 1.7 million coal-related jobs are expected to be cut by 2030. In anticipation of the dramatic hit to the job market, Shanxi is developing other economic sectors, such as tourism and clean energy.

By the end of 2024, Shanxi had a total installed clean energy capacity of 61.89 GW, which is around the same as that of the United Kingdom. Over half of it came from solar power, which reached 34.8 GW last year. In Shanxi's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for renewable energy development, the province set a target of a cumulative 30 GW wind capacity and 50 GW solar PV capacity in operation by the end of 2025, which is aimed at diversifying the province’s energy mix.

LONGi, one of China’s largest solar power companies, launched a solar panel factory in Datong in 2022, which employs over 160 people, with over half of its employees coming from the coal industry.

Several other companies have also established operations in Shanxi to support the transition from a coal region to a renewable energy hub. Meijin Energy, in Shanxi’s capital Taiyuan, is one of China’s largest private coke companies, with the capacity to process over 6 million tonnes of coal each year, and 11 million tonnes of coke. In recent years, Meijin has expanded its portfolio to include hydrogen, which is a byproduct of the coking process and can be used to fuel vehicles. Meijin now produces around 1,500 tonnes of hydrogen a year, much of which is used to power its transport. Previously, the excess hydrogen was burnt or discarded, which contaminated he air. However, the company has seen the potential of supporting the energy revolution in the region.

In 2024, the Chinese firm Shanxi International Energy Group signed a deal with a local government in northern China to produce 350,000 tonnes a year of green aviation fuel produced from wind-powered hydrogen, according to local reports. The $1.48 billion project is expected to include 1 GW of new off-grid wind power, which will be used to produce green hydrogen to be combined with sequestered carbon dioxide to produce e-kerosene, which is chemically identical to conventional jet fuel.

The project is expected to be developed over two phases. The first phase includes the development of 300 MW of wind power to produce 100,000 tonnes of green kerosene a year, and the second includes a further 700 MW of wind energy capacity, for a fuel output of 250,000 tonnes.

There is also international interest in diversifying China’s energy mix and helping the Asian country reduce its reliance on coal to support a global green transition. In 2019, the World Bank Group launched a $350 million project aimed at accelerating “Shanxi’s transition to a lower coal consumption and more diversified economy, and provide alternative employment opportunities, thereby mitigating global climate change and improving air quality.”

There is significant potential for China’s Shanxi province to transition away from a reliance on coal to renewable alternatives in the coming years. However, the closure of many coal mines will likely lead to significant job losses across the region. China could mitigate the risk of widespread unemployment in Shanxi by investing heavily in a just transition, training workers in the coal industry to take up roles in other energy sectors as the province expands its renewable energy capacity.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

One theme that seems to recur in that history is BPA’s desire for dominance and control. In 1976 BPA sought congressional approval for unfetter authority to acquire and market new energy. Congress, however, granted a more constrained authority.

BPA’s recent decision to join Market + seems inexplicable. Their other alternative, energy market EDAM, offers advantages on cost, reliability, integration of renewable energy resources, and environmental impacts. What could explain BPA’s preference?

Here’s the essential fact: Without BPA participation, the Arkansas based Markets+ is probably not a viable project. BPA owns 75 percent of Northwest transmission. Without that transmission Markets+ would have very limited ability to deliver or receive energy from Northwest participants such as Puget Sound Energy and Snohomish PUD. Without strong participation by Northwest entities and access to their hydropower, Markets+ would be too limited to succeed.

Bonneville knows that their participation is a life-or-death matter for Markets+, as does the market’s organizer, the Southwest Power Pool. This gives BPA a degree of leverage they could not hope to have as part of EDAM. BPA has been lured away from what would most benefit our region so it can be a big fish in a small pond rather than share the advantages of a bigger pond with other big fish.

By slashing tariffs and unlocking $600 billion in EU investments in U.S. industry, the agreement has created a tailwind for companies exposed to European demand. While skepticism remains about the EU's ability to fulfill its financial commitments, the immediate stabilization of trade tensions and the removal of retaliatory threats have already triggered a re-rating of energy and industrial equities. For investors, this presents a rare opportunity to identify high-conviction stocks poised to capitalize on the new trade framework.

Energy Sector: LNG and Renewable Infrastructure as Winners

The EU's pivot to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its push for green energy infrastructure have made energy stocks a focal point. Cheniere Energy (LNG) stands out as a direct beneficiary. With the EU seeking to diversify away from Russian gas and stabilize its energy supply, U.S. LNG exporters are in a strong position to secure long-term contracts. The trade deal's tariff reductions on U.S. energy exports further enhance profitability for companies like Cheniere, which operates terminals in Texas and Louisiana.

Renewable energy firms are also gaining traction. NextEra Energy (NEE), the largest U.S. clean energy producer, is expanding its footprint in Europe through green hydrogen and battery storage projects. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act, which mandates 40% of clean energy components be sourced locally, aligns with NextEra's expertise in solar and wind infrastructure. Investors should monitor Vestas Wind Systems (VWS), a Danish turbine manufacturer with growing U.S. demand, as the trade deal eases restrictions on cross-border green technology trade.

Industrial Sector: Steel, Aluminum, and Manufacturing Resilience

The U.S. steel and aluminum industries, long plagued by EU tariffs, are set to benefit from the deal's quota-based system. ArcelorMittal (MT) and Nucor (NUE), two of the largest U.S. steel producers, have already begun restructuring supply chains to mitigate trade risks. The removal of 50% tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports will reduce production costs and improve competitiveness for these firms.

Moreover, the EU's $150 billion procurement of U.S. military equipment and industrial goods has created a surge in demand for defense and manufacturing companies. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, given their dominance in defense contracts and their ability to scale production for European markets.

Tariff Stabilization and Market Re-Rating

The trade deal's success lies in its ability to eliminate the “tariff discount” embedded in European export stocks. For instance, the Stoxx Europe 600 Autos index, trading at a 42.6% discount to fair value, could see a valuation rebound if retaliatory measures are averted. U.S. investors should consider Stellantis (STLA), which has a hybrid U.S.-EU production model, as a speculative play on tariff normalization.

Renewable energy ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) have already outperformed broader markets, reflecting investor confidence in decarbonization trends. However, the sector's long-term success will depend on the EU's ability to meet its $600 billion investment pledge—a target that remains unproven but structurally aligned with U.S. manufacturing priorities.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the trade deal offers optimism, investors must remain cautious. The EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument—a retaliatory tool beyond tariffs—could still disrupt market access for U.S. firms if trade tensions resurface. Additionally, the EU's decarbonization goals may reduce long-term demand for fossil fuels, including U.S. LNG.

For a balanced approach, consider hedging with diversified industrial conglomerates like 3M (MMM) or Honeywell (HON), which operate across multiple sectors and geographies. These firms are less exposed to trade volatility while still benefiting from the EU's procurement commitments.

Investment Thesis and Recommendations

High-Conviction Buys:

Cheniere Energy (LNG): Direct exposure to EU LNG demand and tariff reductions.

NextEra Energy (NEE): Leadership in renewable energy with EU green hydrogen partnerships.

ArcelorMittal (MT): Benefiting from EU tariff easing and industrial demand.

Speculative Plays:

Stellantis (STLA): Hybrid production model with EU exposure.

Vestas Wind Systems (VWS): Renewable infrastructure growth in the U.S.

Defensive Holdings:

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN): Diversified exposure to renewable energy trends.

3M (MMM): Resilient industrial conglomerate with low trade sensitivity.

The U.S.-EU trade deal is not a panacea, but it has created a stable environment for energy and industrial sectors to thrive. By focusing on companies with strong EU demand, tariff resilience, and alignment with green energy transitions, investors can position themselves to capitalize on this pivotal moment in transatlantic trade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 15:03:30.259174

On one hand, politicians in Wyoming are delighted that the Project 2025-inspired “Big Beautiful Bill” will enhance support via tax breaks for the state’s faltering fossil fuel industry. Ironically, the same politicians are also a bit pissy that wind and solar — the cheapest and fastest-growing energy sector in the state and nation — are under real threat of collapse.

Wyoming generates about 10,200 megawatts of electricity from all sources, according to state and federal data. Nearly one-third comes from wind and solar, and one megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes. More than half the electrons generated in the state are exported to customers outside Wyoming’s borders.

The upcoming loss of tax credits will have statewide effects due to the demise of hundreds of electrical power sector projects and the long-term consequences of that industry vacuum.

Many Wyoming politicians are wary of coming face-to-face with their constituents, who’ll be paying higher electricity bills.

“While the new policies are a step backward, the combination of surging demand for electric power and economic benefits of renewable energy technologies ensure that clean power will continue to play a significant and growing role in our nation’s energy mix,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet insists. “Our economic and national security requires that we support all forms of American energy. It is time for the brawlers to get out of the way and let the builders get back to work.”

The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that Power Company of Wyoming’s Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Carbon County will add more than 3,500 megawatts of electrical generation capacity, boosting the state’s power generation by 34%. The 600-turbine project qualifies for federal tax credits,

Developers had planned to begin producing wind energy in phases, with the target date of 2030 to place the project into full capacity operation. This and other major additions to Wyoming’s electrical generation industry is uncertain.

Wyoming, known for its extremely cold winters, has by far the steepest average monthly cost of energy, according to a WalletHub report: $1,591 — in large part because it consumes the most motor fuel and residential oil per capita, and has the highest monthly prices for both. One consumer advocacy group — Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose 400 members include Microsoft, Amazon, and Google — warned that if the renewable energy sector loses the 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits, it would raise the cost of electricity in Wyoming by an average 29% — the steepest increase in the nation.

Trump signed the executive order directing the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” Projects must begin construction before July 4, 2026 and be operational by the end of 2027, shaving several years off the previous eligibility timeline. The deadline sounds workable until reality sets in: permitting can take years during a favorable administration, which Trump and colleagues are not.

The executive order condemns commercial wind and solar development, saying it “denigrates the beauty of our nation’s natural landscape,” “displaces” affordable domestic energy sources, is “unreliable,” and poses a threat to national security for relying on supplies from “foreign entities of concern.”

A 2025 University of Wyoming survey reveals Wyoming residents overwhelmingly believe that changes in water resources and climate are happening, and risks can be reduced with community response plans and statewide policies.

Wyoming is one of the few states in the nation that imposes a tax on wind energy generation, producing millions of dollars each year that are split between the state and the counties hosting wind power plants. An argument that politicians in Wyoming may use to prop up ongoing wind and solar plant construction is the cost-share built into the Trump order that will split federal rents and fees with local governments hosting wind and solar facilities.

How did the Trump Administration get Renewables So Wrong?

The conversion to renewable energy-powered production has been remarkable over the last few years. At least 160 clean energy manufacturing facilities or expansions have been announced since August 2022, driven by tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, with 47 declared in 2024 alone. Collectively, these facilities are expected to result in 100,000 new manufacturing jobs and at least $500 billion in investment, $75 billion of which has already been spent.

Despite the interest of overseas investors in pursuing renewable energy opportunities in the US, on April 8 Trump issued an order aimed at force-feeding more coal back into the nation’s power generation profile. The Associated Press ran the story under the headline, “Trump signs executive orders to boost coal, a reliable but polluting energy source.”

The US solar industry has been working overtime to convince Republican members of Congress that solar energy can deliver more kilowatts, more quickly, than any other form of power generation. Solar developers had been at a particularly strong advantage in the wake of Biden-era policies that saw a massive surge in solar manufacturing capacity in the US, providing developers with a robust domestic pipeline for solar modules.

So, for the first time, solar and wind energy are now cheaper than coal, natural gas, or oil and are the quickest options for installing new electricity generation. Solar is now growing faster than any power source in history — people are constructing a gigawatt’s worth of solar panels every 15 hours. That’s more or less what one coal-fired plant generates.

In a special address this month at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Secretary‑General António Guterres declared the world has “passed the point of no return” on the shift to renewables. He cited surging clean energy investment and plunging solar and wind costs that now outcompete fossil fuels. “The energy transition is unstoppable, but the transition is not yet fast enough or fair enough,” he said, asking the audience to “follow the money.” He mentioned that $2 trillion flowed into clean energy last year — $800 billion more than fossil fuels and up almost 70%.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wyoming.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 15:03:34.170611

The study was conducted by Citizens Action Coalition and “exposes how Indiana’s monopoly utilities have imposed the most severe electric bill increases on residential customers in at least two decades — with some families paying nearly $50 more a month than just one year ago.”

Using data from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the utility-focused customer advocacy group compared July 1 residential bills for 1,000 kWh of usage from 2024 and 2025.

“Things keeps getting worse for Hoosier consumers and our state leaders continue to allow it to happen,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the coalition. “Based on this trend, the rhetoric regarding affordability emanating from the Statehouse appears to be nothing more than lip service. Hoosier consumers can no longer afford monopoly pricing. Something must change soon.”

The statewide average increase was nearly double the prior year’s record increase of 9.3%, the analysis found.

“Indiana has been growing, and Indiana’s utilities have an obligation to keep pace with that demand and power a modern economy,” the Indiana Energy Association said in a statement.

“In recent years, our energy companies have made substantial investments in additional power generation and modernization of the state’s century-old electric grid that delivers that power. We’ve added advanced technology to the electric grid that reduces power outages and hardens the grid against severe weather. There also have been substantial investments in evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to keeping affordability top of mind, while also making the investments needed to provide reliable electricity.”

IEA is a trade association that represents Indiana’s investor-owned electric utilities and local distribution gas companies.

Here are some findings about individual utilities from the analysis:

NIPSCO residential customers were hit hardest: $50 per month (26.7%) increase in just one year, compounding a 17.8% hike in 2024. This follows an IURC-approved settlement opposed by CAC.

CenterPoint bills surged $44 per month (25%) after the IURC greenlit a large base rate increase.

Duke Energy Indiana raised residential bills nearly $26 per month (20%).

AES Indiana increased bills nearly $17 per month (12%) — and now seeks an additional $21 per month by 2027 in a pending rate case.

I&M bills rose $6 per month (3.9%).

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

There are several contributing factors, including smoke from wildfires and auto emissions. The sunlight also plays a big role.

Particulate matter from those fires and ground-level, human caused ozone from cars are the specific pollutants in the air, a problem exacerbated during the long summer days because of ultraviolet rays emitted by the intense sunlight.

Several state health agencies in the region have issued air quality advisories.

Ozone is a ""regional issue,"" according to Kevin MacDonald, public information officer with the Clark County Division of Air Quality in Nevada, one of the counties that has issued an advisory.

""One of the issues with ozone is that pollutants will travel like wildfire smoke, and this all plays a factor in what we call this 'stew' that forms ozone,"" he said.

Ground-level ozone pollution increases during the summer months, he added.

""If you look at a 24-hour day and look up data from one of our monitoring stations, you'll see ozone is going to be low in the morning and then, typically, around 2- to 3 O'clock is when it's reaching its peak,"" MacDonald said. ""The sunlight is helping to cook that ozone.""

Southern Nevada is under an ozone advisory through the end of August. A particulate advisory has also been issued due to wildfires. Clark County has exceeded safe ozone levels on at least 14 days this summer.

This week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency forecasted ongoing bad air quality in parts of Nevada. The forecast also said areas in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming should expect poor air quality in the days ahead.

That has led state and local officials in several states to recommend that people take proactive measures, such as driving less, refueling their vehicles in the evenings to minimize the evaporation of gas fumes, and reducing household energy use.

To the shock and surprise of nobody, former natural gas CEO and current US Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarily canceled a federal loan guarantee of almost $5 billion for the Grain Belt Express, a new 5-gigawatt transmission project of historic proportions aimed at bringing wind energy from Kansas to kilowatt-thirsty points east. If yanking the loan was meant to be a kill shot, Wright missed the mark. The project lives on.

The Grain Belt Express Wind Energy Project

In terms of historic proportions, the Grain Belt Express meets the bar of transformative infrastructure projects like the Transcontinental Railroad. Completed in 1869, the new railway revolutionized the US economy when it shaved travel time between New York and San Francisco from an arduous months-long journey down to a single week.

The Grain Belt Express will have a similar, seismic-scale impact on electricity transmission in the US, if and when it goes into operation.

That will take some doing. The ambitious, multi-state project has already jumped on and off the CleanTechnica radar for almost 15 years. It began to take shape during the Obama administration under the wing of the Texas startup Clean Line Energy Partners, which launched in 2009. In 2011, Clean Line announced plans for a new, 700-mile high voltage direct current transmission line shunting wind energy from Kansas to interconnections in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and beyond. After a series of fits and starts, the project seemed to hit the end of the trail in 2015, when the Missouri Public Service Commission nixed it.

Undeterred, Clean Line appealed the decision and the Public Service Commission turned it down again. Still undeterred, Clean Line took its case to the Missouri Supreme Court. In 2018, the court greenlit the project, but by that time, Clean Line had already seen enough. The firm had other projects in the works, and it dropped the Grain Belt Express from its roster in 2019.

Follow The Money To Wind Energy

Clean Line was not the end of the line for the wind energy dream. In February of 2019, the Chicago-based clean energy developer Invenergy slipped word that it was willing to pick up the Grain Belt thread. That same year, the Missouri Public Service Commission reversed itself, greenlit the project, and okayed Invenergy’s plan to acquire it.

And … that’s where things went south again. In Missouri, state lawmakers stepped in to quash the project with new anti-wind legislation. Property owners also vowed to appeal. In an even more concerning development, the state of Illinois abruptly decided not to let the Grain Belt Express go through after all.

Nevertheless, Invenergy persisted. By 2023, the company assembled almost $4 billion from Blackstone Infrastructure Partners to support its various renewable energy ventures, including its portfolio of interregional transmission lines. The company also broke the project into phases, beginning with Missouri, where it counted transmission agreements with almost 40 municipal utilities by 2023.

More Money For A Massive Wind Energy Project

With private sector dollars and municipal utilities in its pocket, Invenergy applied to the Loan Programs Office of the US Department of Energy for a loan guarantee. On January 16 of this year, the DOE came through with conditional approval of a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for Phase I of the project, a 578-mile, 2.5-gigawatt high-voltage line from Ford County in Kansas to Callaway County in Missouri.

To be clear, a DOE loan guarantee is not a direct loan. The loan program was launched under the Bush administration in order to help transformative energy projects obtain favorable credit terms, not to dole out taxpayer dollars willy-nilly. It was designed from the start to absorb a degree of risk while yielding significant economic benefits overall, which it has done (see lots more LPO background here).

The Missouri phase is not the whole Grain Belt project, but it will have a significant impact on regional transmission. “The project will connect three regional grids: the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and Associated Electric Cooperative Incorporated (AECI),” the DOE explained upon awarding the conditional guarantee, adding that it will “significantly expand import and export capabilities between these areas.”

“MISO, which is already a net importer of electricity, is expected to have a growing electricity supply gap as electricity demand grows,” the DOE added. “Grain Belt Express Phase 1 would unlock access to low-cost energy in Kansas to help bridge this gap.”

The US Department Of Energy Steps In It Again

With approvals from all four states finally in hand, the path ahead seemed clear. However, that’s when things went even farther south. On July 17, The New York Times noted that Republican US Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri raised a series of objections to the project beginning in March. The state’s Republican Attorney General also called upon the Missouri PSC to reverse itself again.

The ruckus reportedly culminated in a consequential Oval Office chat last week between Hawley and US President Donald Trump in person, with Energy Secretary Wright on the line. The consequence was that all those years of work and all those billions of dollars went up in smoke. On July 23, Wright announced the termination of the loan guarantee.

Invenergy was having none of it. As reported by the Times, the firm took to X (formerly Twitter) to make sure everyone still on X understands what happened to their transformative wind energy project, without saying wind energy. “Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda,” Invenergy asserted, as cited by the Times.

“Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand,” Invenergy added for good measure, still without mentioning wind energy.

When last heard from, Invenergy is also going to court to stop the Missouri Attorney General from creating any more mischief.

The Wind Energy Dream Rises From The Ashes

The story doesn’t end there. Digging in its heels on the Grain Belt Express website, Invenergy also reminded everyone that it has already assembled a binder full of private investors. “While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee, a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company stated.

So, it’s onwards and upwards for the most transformative wind energy project of its kind in US history. We sure have come a long way from the early 20th century, when thousands of windmills — not wind turbines, windmills — dotted the US landscape, performing vital water supply tasks at farms and ranches all over the US.

Or, have we? If you’re thinking Invenergy is being somewhat overly optimistic about their chances, consider that the project already has more than 14 years of project development under its belt. What’s another 3.5 years? On January 20, 2029, Trump will hande the reins of government over — peacefully this time, one hopes — to another Commander-in-Chief, presumably one more fit to steer the ship of the nation.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LPO-12-2024-GrainBelt-CC-Web-ProjectPage.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:42.432147

On Tuesday, GM executives suggested they were hoping for a lower tariff rate from the trade negotiations.","Large US automakers have criticised the US-Japan trade deal for setting a lower tariff for Japanese auto exports compared with those from Mexico and Canada, where Detroit automakers operate.

President Donald Trump’s accord with Japan appeared to be a ‘bad deal’ for the US industry, said Matt Blunt, head of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.

The accord between Washington and Tokyo sets a 15 per cent tariff for Japanese goods, including autos.

Vehicles manufactured overseas currently face a 25 per cent levy under a Trump-imposed tariff that took effect in early April.

Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba highlighted the relief for Japanese automakers, a sector that accounts for eight per cent of Japanese jobs, saying, ‘we are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume.’

But that relief did not sit well with the AAPC, whose members have organized their supply chains around the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump negotiated in his first term.

All three Detroit companies export from Canada and Mexico to the United States.

‘American Automakers still need to review the details of the US Japan agreement but any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no US content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high US content is a bad deal for US industry and US auto workers,’ said Blunt.

The Japan deal also comes as Trump’s administration is engaged in negotiations with other auto-focused countries that face the current 25 per cent tariff on finished autos.

These include South Korea and Germany, a key player in Washington’s trade dealings with the European Union.

The flow of imports from South Korea includes autos from South Korean companies Kia and Hyundai, as well as General Motors, which exports the Chevrolet Trax and other vehicles to the United States from the country.

On Tuesday, GM executives suggested they were hoping for a lower tariff rate from the trade negotiations. Executives noted that affordability of the vehicles in an earnings conference call.

‘We have continued to bring the vehicles in from Korea because they’re (profitable) and they’re very much in demand,’ said GM Chief Executive Mary Barra.

‘Customers love those vehicles.’",https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202507/d3f9681bc8c689a2d11ea49f1819a16c_og.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 14:03:14.790767

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs?
One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.

These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.

First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.

Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.

“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”

Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.

Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.

The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.

But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.

The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.

For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.

Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.

You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.

A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.

A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)

But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.

At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.

I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.

“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”

He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.

Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.

“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”

In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.

Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.

She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.

Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.

Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.

Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs? One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.

The rally, organised in partnership with the Indian Air Force, Tata Motors and PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), ran from Delhi to Adampur, Punjab, and back, covering key stops including Murthal and Ambala.

The initiative was aimed at raising awareness about clean mobility and acknowledging the role of India’s defence forces. Over 30 Tata Harrier EVs participated in the rally, which acted as a live demonstration of India’s readiness to support electric mobility over long distances. Tata Power ensured uninterrupted operations by deploying strategically placed charging stations along the entire route.

The company’s charging network played a critical role in enabling seamless travel without range anxiety. By powering the rally end-to-end, Tata Power tested its public charging infrastructure under real-world conditions across multiple cities and terrains.

Tata Power’s participation in the rally aligns with its broader goal of expanding EV adoption in India. The company currently operates more than 5,400 public and captive EV charging points, over 1.35 lakh home chargers, and 1,200+ bus charging points across 600+ cities and towns. Its charging solutions are installed across highways, commercial zones, residential areas, and tourist locations.

To date, Tata Power’s EV network has enabled over 23.6 crore green kilometres and helped avoid over 1 lakh tonnes of CO₂ emissions through electric buses alone. The company aims to expand to 7.5 lakh home chargers and 10,000 public charging stations by 2030.

National Rooftop Solar Programme: Proposals on the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation

National Rooftop Solar Programme: Public Private Partnership Model (PPP Model)

CPD calls for the National Rooftop Solar Programme to begin with carefully selected pilot projects, rather than a simultaneous nationwide rollout. Drawing on past failures—including the underwhelming Rooftop Solar System—CPD stressed that a measured, evidence-based approach is essential for success.

This recommendation emerged at the media briefing titled ‘National Rooftop Solar Programme: Proposals on the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation’ held on Sunday, 27 July 2025 organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD)at its own premises.

In his introductory remarks, Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem, Research Director, CPD, remarked ‘The interim government plans to establish connections for nearly 3,000 megawatts of electricity by December 2025. These installations will be made in government infrastructure, schools, and hospitals. This initiative is part of the government’s renewable energy policy, which aims to reach 20 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and 30 per cent by 2040’.

He added, ‘Previous rooftop solar programmes in Dhaka led to installations that were more symbolic than functional, fostering negative perceptions about renewable energy, which we must overcome to ensure the success of this new initiative’.

In her keynote presentation, Ms Helen Mashiyat Preoty, Senior Research Associate, CPD, highlighted ‘The government’s plan to install 3000 MW of rooftop solar on public institutions is commendable, but premature implementation without feasibility assessments, clearly defined institutional roles, or coordinated oversight could undermine its impact’. In this context, CPD recommends starting in areas with high solar potential, grid readiness, and institutional capacity to manage installations and maintenance.

She underscored that, to ensure sustainable implementation, agencies such as Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB), and Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) must first clarify their responsibilities. Each installation should be preceded by structural analysis, shadow studies, and site-specific financial modelling. CPD further emphasises that procurement must be handled by accredited vendors, and all installations must comply with stringent technical standards.

For financing, CPD proposes that Bangladesh Bank introduce a concessional green energy loan scheme with a lower interest rate with longer loan repayment period, alongside sovereign guarantees to reduce investor risk under the OPEX model. Without these mechanisms, the private sector is unlikely to commit capital to large-scale deployment.

Maintenance is another critical challenge. Under the CAPEX model, systems often deteriorate due to unclear accountability and weak follow-up. CPD suggests embedding 5–10-year maintenance clauses in EPC contracts, supported by a government-backed guarantee fund and digital monitoring systems linked to a central solar dashboard.

Mr Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, General Member, Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA), reflected on the challenges with previous rooftop solar projects, stating, ‘Our experience with residential rooftop solar installations has been disappointing, with many systems criticised for their lack of functionality. For example, in my own Dhaka building, 3-5 kW systems were installed but didn’t work. In contrast, solar installations in villages, which were implemented from 2003 to 2021, have been successful and continue to operate.’

He added, ‘These solar systems have lasted almost 25 years with regular maintenance, demonstrating that solar home systems themselves aren’t the issue—rather, it’s the poor installations that caused the problems’.

‘The Power Division has been closely monitoring the national rooftop solar programme’s implementation, with a committee reviewing the tender documents’ said the Director of Renewable Energy and Research & Development Department, BPDB, Mr Moniruzzaman.

He added ‘We are integrating remote monitoring facilities to ensure efficient operation and grid stability, confident that the system will enhance energy savings and strengthen our distribution network’

Engr. Md. Mujibur Rahman, Director (Deputy Secretary), Renewable Energy Development, SREDA, highlighted ‘The solar installations planned for homes in 2010 were ineffective because there was no obligation for them to generate electricity continuously. With the new net metering system, we must convert those meters and set a requirement for a certain percentage of electricity generation to ensure that people will meet the necessary targets’.

Mr Sardar Mohammad Zafrul Hasan, Chief Engineer (Planning & Design) at Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB), remarked ‘Our Power Division has tendered for 1,500 MW of solar capacity and, after consulting on grid stability, we foresee no issues’.

He added ‘With the 3,000 MW rooftop solar target, we are confident there will be no grid problems. To support this, we’ve already initiated key mitigation measures, including 100 MW and 35 MW battery energy storage projects’

Sharing his concerns, Mr Ramprasad Pal, Deputy Director, Renewable Energy Department, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, said ‘When the net metering system was introduced, issues arose, particularly with the rural electricity associations. Immediately after its implementation, a drop in revenue was observed, which remains a significant concern. If the OPEX model were implemented, they could generate electricity and sell it back to consumers, thereby incentivising them’

Reflecting on the National Rooftop Solar Programme, Engineer Naznin Akter, Managing Director, GSOLARIC Bangladesh Ltd, said ‘I respectfully disagree with the notion that the net metering system has completely failed. It is still ongoing, though there are some issues with domestic connections. However, industrial connections, like those from companies such as Hamim Group and Akij Group, have been very successful’

Mr Khondkar Morshed Millat, Former Director, Sustainable Finance Department at Bangladesh Bank, discussed about the refinancing scheme and said ‘A separate scheme is not necessary. The existing 1,000 crore BDT green refinancing fund from Bangladesh Bank already includes solar rooftop projects, providing ample support. When institutions approach the bank for solar financing, the first question is, “Are you going to horizontally or vertically integrate?” The main challenge with horizontal integration is the lack of land availability, but rooftop solar remains the prime objective, which is certainly achievable’.

In his concluding remarks, Mr Mostafa Al Mahmud, President, Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said ‘This programme will create jobs for over 100,000 people, both directly and indirectly. In fact, I believe the number will be much higher—perhaps 2 to 2.5 million people. Some will become importers, others will be retailers or wholesalers, and many others will be involved in various roles, ultimately spreading across the grassroots level, which will contribute to sustainable development. This is a major and effective development’.

When does the federal EV tax credit expire?

Before the bill came into being on July 4, new and leased EVs came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000, effectively bridging the gap between electric and gas. Not every EV qualifies, with the tax credits available to each buyer dependent on a number of criteria, which differs for new, used and leased electric vehicles.

We can only assume the number of new and used EV owners will drop in the United States as a consequence of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act,’ which will see the federal electric vehicle tax credit expire on September 30.

What’s better value, electric or gas?

Although electric vehicles are cheaper to run than gas-powered cars, the initial price difference between the two is a turn-off for many potential purchasers.

Those incentives were originally designed to help make electric vehicles more appealing to prospective buyers simply by making them more affordable; at present, to buy a new electric vehicle it is around $9,000 more expensive than a gas vehicle, or $2,000 if you’re buying used.

However, despite the elimination of the tax credit, those in the know insist EVs are significantly more efficient, and will therefore be much better value, in the long run compared to their gas-powered ancestors.

“Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America told CBS.

Dr. Mullah Zainul Abidin Abid, the Deputy Minister of Environmental Protection, remarked, “Over the past year, we have made substantial strides in addressing climate change, fostering international partnerships, enacting legislation, enhancing public awareness about environmental preservation, and safeguarding our natural heritage.”

He also announced the successful review of the National Climate Change Strategy and National Commitment (NDC) documents. Notably, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan participated in the International Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Azerbaijan for the first time.

In the realm of climate change, three major international projects valued at $40 million have been greenlit by the UNDP, GEF, and UNIDO. The agency has relaunched the Small Grants Program (SGP) to support numerous environmental initiatives.

Moreover, the agency evaluated 1,650 projects in 1446 AH for environmental and social impacts, approving 1,148 major projects. They have also issued 166 licenses for international wildlife trade and enforced stringent measures to curb the import of hunting arms.

Efforts in public awareness include carrying out 1,613 programs in partnership with scholars, tribal elders, schools, and academic institutions, directly reaching around 200,000 individuals and indirectly impacting approximately 17 million more. Additionally, over 10,300 messages have been disseminated through social media channels.

In the fight against air pollution, more than 23,000 activities were assessed, resulting in the correction of 283 cases and issuance of 301 permits. The agency inspected sewage systems in 1,095 buildings in Kabul, issuing 2,000 awareness notices.

Legislation-wise, the draft law addressing environmental pollution control and reduction has been finalized and forwarded to the Ministry of Justice. The international wildlife trade regulations have been reviewed, with the Clean Transport Policy draft awaiting approval from Emirate leadership. Moreover, a comprehensive five-year plan to combat air pollution has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office.

Looking ahead, the agency aims to bolster international cooperation, continue climate change adaptation programs, promulgate environmental policies, expand collaborations with relevant bodies, and sustain public awareness drives.",https://www.alemarahenglish.af/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gw2L5NGWwAIxnYF-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-07-27 14:03:10.683122

The organized chaos had a reason. Teams of high school students from across the nation prepared their vehicles for the Solar Car Challenge, an annual event held July 17-23 in Fort Worth, which aims to educate participants in science, engineering and alternative energy.

Students spent the past year working on their cars.

Before race day, the teams’ cars must go through “scrutineering,” a series of six tests that are evaluated by judges and ensure all rules are followed and each vehicle is safe to operate.

The Falcon EV team from Fort Worth Country Day toiled away in the garage. Co-captains Jason Pham and Andrew Lobo worked quickly and calmly as they prepared their car.

“Scrutineering is actually way more intense than the race day, or that’s how it felt,” Pham said. “Because right here we have a test to pass to be able to race, and we want to race. This is the most important step for us.”

This isn’t the first time Pham and Lobo participated in the challenge. Their team has competed for the past three years, they said. The difference is both students stepped up into team leadership.

“It’s definitely a lot more work, but it’s definitely a lot more rewarding too,” Lobo said.

The event is a competition, but teams help each other and foster a collaborative atmosphere, both captains said.

“Everyone plays fair,” Pham said. “Everyone wants the best for each team because we want to compete at each other’s best, not their worst. That’s what the event is about.”

Jennings, a lifelong resident of Hartford’s North End, remembers wading through standing water to do her laundry.

As a marginalized population, Jennings said the North End is encumbered with poverty, racial discrimination, low employment rates, and low levels of home ownership.

“Whenever the Department of Environmental Protection tried to crack down on the landfill, they would pass laws exempting the North Hartford landfill from the regulations and rules.","Cynthia R. Jennings, a lifelong resident of Hartford’s North End, remembers wading through standing water to do her laundry. She later developed an illness her doctor attributed to mold. And she has channeled those experiences into helping her community deal with environmental problems.

Her experiences bring to life the impact of Hartford’s flooding problems on residents who have for generations endured floods from untreated waste mixed with water from storms that, in recent decades, have intensified due to climate change.

‘It’s like a swamp’: Hartford residents share the reality of living with flooded homes and businesses

On a sunny February afternoon, Jennings opened the front door to her house at 86 Hartland St., in the Blue Hills neighborhood, with a smile. She wore a floor-length blue and black dress. She thanked a group of journalism students for stepping in as the next generation to address climate change. Her passion for advocacy radiated through her kitchen and neat dining room.

“This is very tantamount to the survival of many people in this city, this state, and this country,” Jennings said.

Starting many decades ago, the basement floor of her family’s previous house on Cambridge Street was always covered with a foot and a half of water.

“We had our washing machine up on a pallet so that it would not get wet,” she said. “And we would walk through the water to put our clothes in the washing machine.

About 30 years ago, Jennings became ill. Her doctor suggested the illness was due to the mold that grew from bacteria in the sewage water.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine, has linked respiratory illness and some cancers to black mold.

Jennings’ old house on Cambridge Street was prone to constant flooding. Its foundation was often wet along with the basement. The fire department would not pump out wastewater, she said, and her family did not have the money to hire a contractor. She said they lived with the water.

But the house where she lives now on Hartland Street and where she raised her son and daughter stands on slightly higher land and did not flood during the childhoods of her children. Her son, Sean Brown, is now 58 years old and lives in North Carolina. Her daughter, Shirene Brown, is 55 and lives in Florida. But in recent years, mixed waste and stormwater flooded this basement. After one storm, Jennings was devastated to find that valuables belonging to her mother had been destroyed. These included irreplaceable pictures, clothes, and shoes.

As of today, a sub pump and backflow preventer were put in about eight months ago. This is a temporary fix until the storm water and sewage water are separated.

In the past two decades, Jennings has watched storms in her neighborhood become more intense, a documented effect of a changing climate.

“Flooding is out of control and placing people out of their homes,” she said.

Hartford residents beset by flooding draw lawmaker support. Will it bring change?

She channeled her experiences with flooding into her career as a civil rights attorney and an environmental activist. The activism dates to the 1990s, when she and other residents of the North End worried about the health effects of dumping trash in the city landfill in the North Meadows area, about a half mile from her neighborhood.

Jennings moved into politics. She served six years on the Hartford City Council, until 2018, when she had to resign after changing her party affiliation. She ran unsuccessfully as an independent for Secretary of the State in 2022. She ran for office out of a sense of loyalty to her community. She said she would say, “You are not going to ignore us and take our tax money. We pay the same taxes as everybody else.”

According to the Connecticut Data Collaborative and Liberal Arts Action Lab, north Hartford is a predominately African American community in Hartford. As a marginalized population, Jennings said the North End is encumbered with poverty, racial discrimination, low employment rates, and low levels of home ownership.

The state reported in October 2024 that 100% of children in the Hartford public schools qualify for free and reduced lunches.

Jennings connects this statistic to the “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States” study conducted by The United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, which concludes that minority groups inhabit the most environmentally risky places in America.

Jennings’ former colleague and fellow founding member of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice, Dr. Mark Mitchell, described Jennings as a powerful force.

“She is tenacious. Obviously, very intelligent. She is passionate, and she’s not afraid to confront those in power,” Mitchell said in an online interview in March 2025.

When Mitchell was health director for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, Jennings was a block captain in the North End. Mitchell recalls how Jennings, alongside Larry Charles and a former neighborhood group called ONE/CHANE Hartford, led opposition to the landfill’s expansion.

“Whenever the Department of Environmental Protection tried to crack down on the landfill, they would pass laws exempting the North Hartford landfill from the regulations and rules. But it was because of Cynthia Jennings and ONE/CHANE that EPA became involved and that they were able to hold the landfill operators to account because of their opposition and their community organizing,” Mitchell said.

One community particularly important to Jennings is renters. According to Housing Data Profiles, created in collaboration between the Partnership for Strong Communities and the Connecticut Data Collaborative, 63.9% of units in Hartford are renter- occupied.

Jennings advocates that renters get renters’ insurance and that building owners make sump pumps available to renters, because the owners must give permission for residents to apply for the state’s grant program that covered repairs and backflow preventers for homeowners. That program allocated about $9 million over two years and is now on hold.

Renters’ and tenants’ insurance policies “will mean that they can live in a hotel with their families while repairs are done to their units,” Jennings said. “Other than that, they face the real possibility of living in a shelter.”

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

Joslyn,,,,,https://www.kansas.com/opinion/guest-commentary/article311450135.html,"Electric vehicle sales surged in 2023, reaching 14 million globally with 1.4 million sold in the United States, a whopping 67% year-over-year increase.

Who’d have guessed, the volatile Elon Musk has a starring role in Kansas’s economic future — and Kelly’s legacy.","Just two years ago, Democrats were on the verge of achieving their long-awaited green energy revolution.

President Joe Biden had reversed former President Donald Trump’s fossil fuel initiatives and set an ambitious goal for all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emissions.

He signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate package that delivered historic investments for cutting emissions.

Electric vehicles led the way, an industry turbocharged by the IRA’s generous tax credits for vehicle purchases, home chargers, battery manufacturing and billions for new production facilities.

Electric vehicle sales surged in 2023, reaching 14 million globally with 1.4 million sold in the United States, a whopping 67% year-over-year increase. They accounted for 10% of U.S. light vehicle sales, with Tesla holding over half the EV market share.

Eager to capitalize, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly brokered a deal with Panasonic to build a massive $4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in De Soto, aimed at supplying Tesla’s new factories in Texas. An $829 million dollar tax incentive package secured Panasonic’s investment, made possible by the bipartisan APEX Act passed by the Kansas Legislature.

Kelly described the deal as transformative, the largest economic development project in Kansas history, expected to create 4,000 jobs and thousands more through related businesses.

Trump posed little threat. The intense backlash after the Capitol riots and mounting legal challenges cast serious doubt about his future.

And despite lingering concerns about his age, Biden was expected to win reelection and help Democrats take back the House. The anticipated “red wave” never materialized in the midterms, signaling waning strength of the Republican brand.

Yet, what felt inevitable crumbled.

Trump returned stronger, calling the shift to EVs a “transition to hell,” framing it effectively as a “government assassination” of auto jobs and unionized workers.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk joined Trump, which eventually led to a major loss in the company’s market share and a sharp stock sell off.

The enthusiasm for EVs seemed driven as much by political momentum as by consumer demand. When that momentum slowed, so did the market.

Overall sales slumped in 2024, dropping to 8% of U.S. light vehicles sales. Buyers remained concentrated among the affluent and college educated, with limited penetration into the broader public. Biden’s zero-emissions goal appeared naïve and disconnected from middle-and working-class realities.

Democrats were swept in November.

Trump recently signed his One Big Beautiful Bill, which terminates EV tax credits and phases out incentives for battery production.

Just as Biden had undone Trump’s policies, Trump unraveled Biden’s.

Because federal control routinely alternates between the parties, companies are constantly exposed to shifting regulations and the prospect of brand polarization — ask Disney, Bud Light, now Tesla.

Getting the politics wrong carries serious consequences.

Now that circumstances have changed so dramatically, would Kelly still place such a large bet on EVs?

Would Panasonic?

After all, many clean energy projects have been canceled, including battery plants in Georgia and Arizona.

EVs are excellent cars, and the market will still grow — just more slowly now.

But that slower pace has Kansans concerned about the direction this might take, and whether Tesla comes out ahead.

Who’d have guessed, the volatile Elon Musk has a starring role in Kansas’s economic future — and Kelly’s legacy.","The Biden administration's initial push for electric vehicles (EVs), fueled by the Inflation Reduction Act, saw significant growth in EV sales and investments in related industries.

The future of large-scale EV projects, such as the Panasonic battery plant in Kansas, is now uncertain due to the changing political and economic landscape.

The fluctuating political climate and its impact on industries like EVs highlight the risks associated with policy reversals and brand polarization.

Just two years ago, Democrats were on the verge of achieving their long-awaited green energy revolution.

Biden had reversed Trump’s fossil fuel initiatives and set an ambitious goal for all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emissions. He signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a landmark climate package that delivered historic investments for cutting emissions.

Electric vehicles (EV) led the way, an industry turbocharged by IRA’s generous tax credits for vehicle purchases, home chargers, battery manufacturing and billions for new production facilities.

Electric vehicle sales surged in 2023, reaching 14 million globally with 1.4 million sold in the United States, a whopping 67% year-over-year increase. They accounted for 10% of U.S. light vehicle sales, with Tesla holding over half the EV market share.

Eager to capitalize, Gov. Kelly brokered a deal with Panasonic to build a massive $4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in De Soto, aimed at supplying Tesla’s new factories in Texas. A multi-billion dollar tax incentive package secured Panasonic’s investment, made possible by the bipartisan APEX Act passed by the state Legislature.

Kelly described the deal as transformative, the largest economic development project in Kansas history, expected to create 4,000 jobs and thousands more through related businesses.

Trump posed little threat. The intense backlash after the Capitol riots and mounting legal challenges cast serious doubt about his future.

And despite lingering concerns about his age, Biden was expected to win reelection and help Democrats take back the House. The anticipated “red wave” never materialized in the midterms, signaling waning strength of the Republican brand.

Yet, what felt inevitable crumbled.

Trump returned stronger, calling the shift to EVs a “transition to hell,” framing it effectively as a “government assassination” of auto jobs and unionized workers.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk joined Trump, which eventually led to a major loss in the company’s market share and a sharp stock sell off.

The enthusiasm for EVs seemed driven as much by political momentum as by consumer demand. When that momentum slowed, so did the market.

Overall sales slumped in 2024, dropping to 8% of U.S. light vehicles sales. Buyers remained concentrated among the affluent and college educated, with limited penetration into the broader public. Biden’s zero-emissions goal appeared naïve and disconnected from middle-and working-class realities.

Democrats were swept in November.

Trump recently signed his Big Beautiful Bill, which terminates EV tax credits and phases out incentives for battery production.

Just as Biden had undone Trump’s policies, Trump unraveled Biden’s.

Because federal control routinely alternates between the parties, companies are constantly exposed to shifting regulations and the prospect of brand polarization — ask Disney, Bud Light, now Tesla.

Getting the politics wrong carries serious consequences.

Now that circumstances have changed so dramatically, would Kelly still place such a large bet on EVs? Would Panasonic? After all, many clean energy projects have been cancelled including battery plants in Georgia and Arizona. EVs are excellent cars, the market will grow — just more slowly now.

That slower pace has Kansans concerned about the direction this might take, and whether Tesla comes out ahead.

Who’d have guessed, the volatile Elon Musk has a starring role in Kansas’s economic future — and Kelly’s legacy.

Experts agree that scaling up DAC technology could provide substantial help in addressing emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonize.","In a bold move to fight the climate crisis, the United States has committed $1.2 billion to create two carbon-sucking vacuums that aim to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere. These two massive Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities, located in Texas and Louisiana, are designed to each remove up to one million tons of CO2 annually. This is equivalent to the emissions of 445,000 gas-powered cars each year, offering an innovative approach to tackling the growing global environmental crisis.

A Revolutionary Technology: Direct Air Capture

The technology behind these machines, Direct Air Capture (DAC), is one of the most advanced methods of addressing the climate emergency. These machines work by drawing in air and passing it through a chemical filter that captures CO2, leaving other gases behind. Once captured, the CO2 is stored underground or repurposed for industrial uses such as concrete production or aviation fuel.

The technology is still relatively untested at a large scale, with only a few DAC facilities operating globally, including a successful plant in Iceland, operated by the Swiss company Climeworks, a key partner in this project. Climeworks has already demonstrated the effectiveness of DAC in capturing carbon in smaller amounts, and now, with the US government’s support, the hope is to scale the technology to a level that could make a real dent in global emissions.

While each DAC facility may seem like a small contribution in the fight against climate change, the potential impact is significant. If scaled to the level required, DAC could play an essential role in meeting the world’s net-zero emissions goals.

The $1.2 Billion Gamble

The US Department of Energy’s investment will support two facilities in Texas and Louisiana, with each facility expected to capture one million tons of CO2 annually. According to Secretary Jennifer Granholm, “Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won’t reverse the growing impacts of climate change,” adding that “We also need to remove the CO2 that we’ve already put in the atmosphere.” This reflects the understanding that reducing emissions is not enough on its own to address the scale of global warming.

The Louisiana project, dubbed Project Cypress, will be run by the US non-profit Battelle in partnership with Heirloom Carbon Technology and Climeworks. Shashank Samala, CEO of Heirloom, spoke optimistically about the pace of progress, stating, “Just two years ago, we were in a petri dish where we were removing grams of CO2 from the air… If we continue this pace of exponential growth every year, I think a billion tons a year is definitely, definitely achievable.”

Meanwhile, the Texas facility, led by Occidental and Carbon Engineering, is designed to scale up even further. Its ultimate capacity could reach up to 30 million tons of CO2 per year, making it a key part of the US’s long-term strategy to reduce atmospheric carbon.

The Challenges of Scaling Dac Technology

Despite the promising outlook, the Direct Air Capture technology faces significant hurdles. One of the primary concerns is the cost of operations, as the technology is still relatively expensive. Climeworks’ director Jan Wurzbacher noted that while the technology is advancing, it must become significantly cheaper in the coming years to have a meaningful impact on global CO2 levels. The challenge is not only financial but also technological, as scaling DAC to a level that can have a global effect requires further research and development.

Currently, the technology is considered “relatively untested” on a large scale, and costs are high. But the ambitious goals set by the US government signal a belief that DAC has the potential to change the way the world addresses the climate crisis. As Granholm emphasized, “If we deploy this at scale, this technology can help us make serious headway toward our net-zero emissions goals while we are still focused on deploying, deploying, deploying more clean energy at the same time.”

A Step Forward in the Climate Fight

While Direct Air Capture might not be the ultimate solution to the climate crisis, it represents an important tool in the fight to reverse the damage already done. The United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified carbon removal technologies like DAC as essential to keeping global warming within safe limits. In particular, the ability to capture carbon after it has already been emitted into the atmosphere may become crucial in stabilizing the climate over the coming decades.

Experts agree that scaling up DAC technology could provide substantial help in addressing emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonize. However, the cost and energy requirements for these machines remain a major concern. As Martin Penwald from Climeworks points out, “The energy used for these machines could be more effectively utilized directly on the grid,” raising the issue of whether the energy needed to power DAC systems could outweigh their benefits.",https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CO2-Emissions.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:05:30.517570

They filter pollutants from runoff, provide wildlife habitats, and recharge groundwater supplies.

Building a rain garden involves selecting a suitable location, amending the soil, and choosing native plants.

Rain gardens offer many environmental benefits including managing stormwater by capturing runoff and reducing the amount of water flowing into storm drains and waterways.

“Rain gardens kind of use your yard opportunistically,” said Carlee Steppe, a conservation botanist with Wildlife Conservation at the Wildlife Resource Division. “A lot of times they’re there to kind of prevent a certain part of your yard from flooding. For example, if you didn’t want water runoff on your driveway, or you didn’t want it moving into a child’s playground, you could add a rain garden.”

Steppe said a rain garden is made up of wetland plants which are used to absorb some of the water coming in.

“Some cities use them on a larger scale, essentially to help water flow through some type of rain garden to prevent pollution from entering into the environment,"" said Steppe. ""The plants can absorb some of the nutrients and things that come out of people's yards. Typically, people are using them on a smaller scale in their own yard.”

A rain garden is a depressed area in the landscape that collects rain water from a roof, driveway or street and allows it to soak into the ground, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

Planted with grasses and flowering perennials, rain gardens can be a cost effective way to help filter out pollutants in runoff, provide food and shelter for butterflies, song birds and other wildlife.

Additional benefits of rain gardens, according to the EPA:

The soil and plants in a rain garden filter out pollutants like sediment, nutrients and heavy metals from the runoff, improving water quality.

By allowing water to soak into the ground, rain gardens help reduce the amount of water flowing over land and into storm drains, which can help prevent flooding and erosion.

Rain gardens help recharge groundwater supplies, which can be especially important in drought-prone areas.

University of Georgia extension agent Campbell Vaughn said the traditional way of dealing with runoff is to get it to a hard surface, put it in a pipe and run it out into the river.

“This gives water an opportunity to get to a place, get moisture back into the soil for the little area,” said Vaughn of rain gardens. “You add in plants that can handle the moisture. Sometimes they even have the ability to filter some of the stuff that may be on the surface that's getting washed into these areas. It keeps some of the toxins out of the rivers and streams.”

How to build a rain garden:

Choose a location that receives runoff from a roof or other impervious surface.

The size of the rain garden depends on the area of the contributing runoff and the soil type.

Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter to improve drainage and water retention.

Choose native plants that are adapted to wet and dry conditions.

“In an undisturbed environment, water falls to the ground, either hitting the surface and running off or percolating through the soil into the groundwater,"" noted Dr. Bodie Pennisi, the Vincent J. Dooley Professor in Horticulture at the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, in an email. "" ... Through both routes, water makes its way to our streams, ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans. As we develop and alter the urban landscape, this natural cycle is disturbed, impacting both water quantity and water quality.”

“The amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil to recharge groundwater decreases from 50% to 15%,” he added. “The changes to the water cycle from changes caused by land development are numerous.”

Changes to the water cycle due to land development according to Pennisi, include:

Increased runoff

More frequent and severe flooding

Decreased infiltration

Less groundwater recharge

Decrease in base flow to streams

More pollution generated from land use is delivered to waterways.

“The increased volume of runoff from storms also increases the likelihood of flooding downstream, particularly during intense storms,” said Pennisi.

Cities are ideal for implementing rain gardens

Pennisi said parking lots are large areas of impervious surface because they generate large volumes of stormwater.

“Rain gardens can be incorporated in parking lots,” he said. “Cities, municipalities and schools can be proactive in mitigating stormwater runoff and help with water quality.”

It may become even harder to develop solar and wind projects that require federal permitting, as the Trump administration has put Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in charge of deciding which projects may proceed on federal land.
This is expected to lead to bottlenecks and delays for many renewable energy projects.
It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest-growing sources of electric power.” Approximately 5 percent of solar projects and 1 percent of wind projects are situated on federal land, according to ACP.","United States President Donald Trump announced plans in July to tighten federal permitting to restrict solar and wind energy development. This follows the passing on Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which seeks to expand the fossil fuel and nuclear power sectors while also halting renewable energy progress in the U.S. These moves could lead energy companies to pause investments in renewable energy projects due to the uncertain outlook for the industry, as developers face more red tape and fewer financial incentives in establishing new solar and wind projects.

It may become even harder to develop solar and wind projects that require federal permitting, as the Trump administration has put Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in charge of deciding which projects may proceed on federal land. Burgum now has the “final review” of leases, rights-of-way, construction plans and all other aspects of the Interior Department’s federal permitting process for wind and solar projects, according to an internal memo.

The Interior Department said in a statement that it was “levelling the playing field” for coal and natural gas “after years of assault” by the Biden administration. This follows recent moves by the Trump administration to encourage new coal developments and boost production to supposedly drive down energy costs.

Burgum’s office will now be responsible for reviewing 68 types of agency actions, including federal permits, environmental reviews, lease sales, site plans, wildlife impact assessments and numerous smaller decisions and consultations related to solar and wind energy developments. This is expected to lead to bottlenecks and delays for many renewable energy projects.

Jason Grumet, the CEO of the lobby group American Clean Power (ACP), said, “The Interior Department adds three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review to the construction of domestic energy projects.” Grumet added, “This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest-growing sources of electric power.” Approximately 5 percent of solar projects and 1 percent of wind projects are situated on federal land, according to ACP.

While only a small percentage of wind and solar projects are developed on federal lands and waters, many projects situated on private lands consult with the Interior Department to determine whether they require federal permits to comply with wildlife protections or other laws. Several industry groups have criticised the move for hindering the development of U.S. solar and wind power, which has accelerated in recent years.

The new measures are expected to restrict the development of solar and wind energy projects and, therefore, slow the speed of new clean electricity generation at a time when the U.S. electricity demand is expected to soar. As tech companies invest heavily in the rollout of data centres to support complex technologies such as artificial intelligence, experts worry that the U.S. will not be able to meet the growing electricity demand. President Trump has regularly been criticised as experts say his restrictions on the development of renewable energy projects are at odds with his claims that the U.S. is facing an energy emergency to meet growing demand for electricity.

The recent passing of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act also threatens green energy progress in the U.S., as it scraps several financial incentives for renewable energy development. Another executive order from July called for the Interior Department to “eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities compared to reliable, dispatchable energy sources,” referring to coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

Several House Republicans had previously lobbied for the bill to bring an end to green energy subsidies even faster than the final Act stipulates. Upon voting for a watered-down version of the bill, in terms of renewable energy restrictions, some lawmakers said that Trump had promised to address their concerns through executive action.

And it seems like Trump has followed through with his promise by signing an executive order to end market-distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources on July 7. The order directed the Treasury Department to consider revising its guidelines for how and when renewable energy projects would need to commence development in order to be eligible for tax breaks.

Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management at the Interior Department, said, the “actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars.” Suess added, “American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable base load energy, not regulatory favouritism toward unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

In recent months, it seems that Trump has waged a war on renewable energy development in the U.S., while also stating the need to rollout more electricity to meet the rising national demand. Through several executive orders and the Big Beautiful Bill, Trump has favoured fossil fuels and supported a reversal of the U.S. energy agenda, as he aims to move away from renewable energy to oil, gas, coal and nuclear power.

Smart cities: from streetlights, traffic lights, and sidewalks to urban panels that can use transparent panels to operate on clean, independent energy.
Why transparent solar windows could be our future?
Other than that: The average efficiency is still lower than that of traditional solar panels.","A future where your home’s windows not only let in light but also power your appliances is no longer science fiction, it’s reality. That’s because a new generation of transparent solar panels, known as smart glass or transparent photovoltaic glass, is arriving in the United States, promising to transform glass facades into veritable invisible power plants. But how does this work in practice?And is this technology worth investing in?

How do these windows generate energy without darkening the room?

Let’s get straight to the point: these windows aren’t like the standard solar panels we’re used to seeing on rooftops. That’s because, while traditional solar panels absorb all visible light (hence their dark appearance), transparent solar panels operate much more subtly: they let through the light your eyes can see and capture only invisible rays, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR). It’s as if the window has a “detective mode,” seeing what no one else sees and transforming it into electricity.

There are two main types:

Fully transparent: identical in appearance to regular glass (but with lower efficiency).

Semi-transparent: balancing visibility and energy generation with better practical results.

It’s worth noting that the technologies behind these windows include extremely thin materials such as perovskites, which are nothing more than quantum dots, and special polymers that can absorb energy without blocking the view.

Where can this type of solar panel be used?

So you might be wondering, “Cool, but where is this actually being used?” The answer is in more places than we could imagine:

Sustainable architecture: think of glass buildings generating energy for their own consumption. The acronym BIPV (Building-Integrated Photovoltaics) has already become a trend in Europe and is starting to appear in the US.

Electric vehicles: manufacturers are already testing this technology on solar roofs on cars, trains, and even boats, which helps charge batteries even when the vehicle is turned off.

Smart cities: from streetlights, traffic lights, and sidewalks to urban panels that can use transparent panels to operate on clean, independent energy.

Electronics and wearables: from solar watches to glasses with self-charging sensors, the idea of devices that never need an outlet is gaining traction.

In other words, besides versatility, one of the greatest advantages is aesthetics: the technology doesn’t interfere with the design of products or buildings. Everything works behind the scenes. This even reminds us of those other solar panels that, unlike this transparent one, are colored, you choose: green, red, orange, or silver, all with unexpected performance.

Why transparent solar windows could be our future?

Of course, it’s not all positives… Because it’s a new technology, cost is still a barrier, especially for 100% transparent models. Just to give you an idea, while a semi-transparent window can cost around $80/m², completely invisible versions exceed $400/m². Other than that:

The average efficiency is still lower than that of traditional solar panels. While these reach 20–25%, transparent models are in the 7–10% range.

The durability of materials like perovskite is still being optimized; many lose efficiency over time and with exposure to moisture.

Energy production depends on UV and IR radiation, which can be compromised in locations with frequent cloudy days or constantly shaded windows.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ultraviolet-window-hit-seethrough-panel.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:04:33.309619

US GDP and distillate consumption are closely correlated and the outlook is less optimistic now than in January 2025. The rebound at the end of 2026 for US GDP looks like wishful thinking to me.

Higher natural gas storage levels in October 2025 lead to lower natural gas prices than in last month’s STEO. This is due to higher output than expected and lower demand for natural gas from power plants due higher natural gas prices.

Marketed natural gas output is 2.9 BCF/d higher in 2025 than in 2024, but in 2026 output decreases slightly by 0.2 BCF/d due to low natural gas prices.

Solar is expected to surpass wind in 2026 to become the largest source of renewable power in the US.

Inventories of coal at US power plants are expected to continue the decline that started in 2024 through 2026.

US tight oil output has not increased much since early 2024.

US Shale gas output has been relatively flat since 2023.

This updated tight oil scenario expects the peak to be in 2025 for US tight oil, a year earlier than last month’s scenario.

The scenario above attempts to model marketed shale gas production where it is assumed that dry shale gas is about 92% of marketed shale gas production.

Net exports of natural gas are expected to increase by 4.3 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026 and there are 24 BCF/d of LNG capacity under construction or approved which are expected to begin exports between 2024 and 2030. Assuming all of this is developed and net pipeline exports are unchanged the net exports would increase by 24 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026. It looks to me that unless natural gas consumption in the US drops by 20 BCF/d, there will not be enough natural gas produced in the US to meet the demand from LNG exporters. In the next few years we will see just how much natural gas can be produced in the US, it may be much less than many believe.",,N,,2025-07-27 12:04:38.309240

BERLIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nestled at the heart of Germany's industrial corridor, a Chinese-backed battery gigafactory offers a revealing glimpse into stronger Europe-China collaborate in powering Europe's green energy transition.

Located in Arnstadt, Thuringia, the 1.8 billion euros (2.11 billion U.S. dollars) facility, built and run by the Chinese company CATL, has been operating since late 2022 as the first large-scale power battery manufacturing site in Germany.

With an annual design capacity of up to 30 million cells, enough to power roughly 200,000 electric vehicles, the factory supplies key European automakers racing to decarbonize under mounting regulatory and market pressure.

Yet the plant is more than just a production facility. It has emerged as a test case for cross-border industrial integration, merging China's battery expertise with Germany's engineering tradition, and offering a model of how the two can collaborate in the green transition.

CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION

The factory's early stages required hundreds of engineers and technicians from China to stabilize operations and train local staff. Now, with a largely European workforce in place, collaboration has become part of the plant's daily rhythm.

""I was skeptical about Chinese manufacturing at first,"" said Amjad Abdallah, a module assembly technician. ""But working side by side, I saw how precise their systems are and how high their standards really are.""

Joint teams of Chinese and European technicians now work together to calibrate assembly lines, fine-tune precision tolerances, and troubleshoot automated systems. As workflows become more integrated, informal cultural exchanges are emerging as well, basic greetings in Chinese and German have become part of the shop floor's everyday soundscape.

""At first, we relied on gestures and English,"" said Qian Lei, a Chinese engineer. ""Now we're joking in basic German.""

The effects of this collaboration extend beyond the factory walls. Local public transport has added new routes to serve the facility, complete with bilingual signage. Small businesses catering to Chinese employees, such as restaurants and coffee shops, have sprung up in the city center, reflecting a level of social integration rarely seen in foreign-led industrial projects.

As the number of expatriate staff declines, local employees have taken over core functions including module integration, packaging, and logistics. ""I'm heading back to China soon. The team here is fully capable,"" said Qian.

GROWING GREEN CAPACITY

The Arnstadt plant represents part of a broader wave of Chinese investment across Europe's battery value chain. Chinese battery makers are stepping up efforts to establish localized production across Europe.

New CATL plants are under construction in Hungary and Spain, while other firms are investing in Slovakia and expanding operations in Hungary, launching their first European factories. Together, these projects aim to support European carmakers with local supply chains and advance the region's shift to electric mobility.

The Arnstadt site has become CATL's first overseas plant to operate with net-zero carbon emissions. It runs on green electricity, uses fully electrified internal logistics, and is managed through a smart energy control system. The plant is also collaborating with Germany's Fraunhofer Institute to develop battery life prediction models, aiming to improve durability, enhance resource efficiency, and lower long-term maintenance costs.

""The plant not only produces next-generation batteries with a lower carbon footprint but also promotes circular economy practices, such as recycling and energy efficiency,"" said CATL spokesperson Caspar Spinnen. ""It showcases how international collaboration can accelerate the shift toward a greener, more sustainable future.""

""Chinese producers now dominate not only in cell chemistry and systems integration, but also in recycling and life cycle management,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, a renowned German automotive expert.

The Thuringia site has already generated more than 1,000 jobs while supporting local construction, retail and transit services. Arnstadt Mayor Frank Spilling said rising tax revenue is being reinvested into public infrastructure, including daycare centers and housing developments.

""This project has helped establish Thuringia as a future hub for battery research and production,"" said the state's Economy Minister Colette Boos-John.

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

As China and the European Union mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, their leaders on Thursday convened for the 25th China-EU summit in Beijing and issued a joint statement on climate change, in which they recognized that strengthening China-EU cooperation on the issue will impact the well-being of people on both sides.

Amid Europe's accelerating shift toward green industry, the experience of one small town in Thuringia offers a glimpse into how China-Europe cooperation is helping drive regional economic transformation.

""This kind of deep industrial cooperation helps anchor bilateral ties beyond politics,"" said Michael Schumann, chairman of the German Federal Association for Economic Development and Foreign Trade. ""It reflects mutual trust, long-term vision and shared value creation.""

""The cooperation is no longer just practical, it has become essential,"" said Dudenhoeffer. ""Chinese firms lead in production efficiency and energy density; European automakers remain ahead in user experience and design. It's a natural and strategic complement.""

The battery facility is part of a broader trend. Chinese automakers are deepening their industrial partnerships in Europe and accelerating local operations. BYD is building a car manufacturing plant in Hungary; Chery has formed a joint venture with Spain's Ebro to produce electric vehicles; and SAIC also plans to set up its assembly base in Europe. As Chinese brands expand their presence, their EV models are gaining growing traction among European consumers.

On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest.
Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.
“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said.
“This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities.","After a proposed provision in the recent Republican tax break and spending cut law that would have opened up millions of acres of federal lands for sale was axed, Colorado climate leaders and public lands advocates still didn’t have much to celebrate.

That’s because the massive federal policy bill‘s surviving provisions governing oil and gas leasing on federal lands are “an egregious step back for the environment,” according to Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

The law makes it easier to lease federal lands in several Western states for oil and gas extraction. It also limits the ways by which this land can be regulated and lowers the royalty rate that oil and gas companies must pay the government, among other related provisions.

“This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it’s hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure,” Hornbein said. “It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.”

The law, achieved through the reconciliation process in Congress and signed July 4 by President Donald Trump, who calls it the “big, beautiful bill,” mandates that the secretary of the Interior Department make federal lands available for oil and gas leasing on, at minimum, a quarterly basis in nine states, including Colorado. The available lands are governed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.

Those agencies handle swaths of public lands that are typically multiuse. On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest. The lands are also often used for commercial purposes, including by tourism and recreation companies, and for resource extraction. The state is home to 24 million acres of federal land.

By prioritizing oil and gas leasing above other uses for certain lands, the law “hurts everybody but the extractive industries,” said Colorado Springs resident and outdoorsman David Lien.

Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.

“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said. “To use a hunting term, I’d say the reconciliation bill passed by Congress has gutted public lands, in respect to extractive industries.”

The Bureau of Land Management declined an interview request for this article.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a statement on Tuesday. “This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The Department is proud to implement President Trump’s agenda and get the federal government back to working for the American people.”

Limited regulation

Federal lands used for oil and gas leasing are regulated by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management through a variety of means, including resource management plans, which are long-term land-use blueprints.

Prior to the signing of the GOP reconciliation bill, these plans served as a starting point for regulation, not a finish line. But the law has made it so the government “may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval included in the resource management plans” for oil and gas leases, according to a Bureau of Land Management statement.

Allison Henderson, the southern Rockies director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this provision poses a “significant risk” to the environment, water supplies and vulnerable species of animals that live on public lands, because resource management plans “do not provide kind of the nitty-gritty, site-specific types of mitigation measures that are necessary.”

Resource management plans are typically updated every 10 to 20 years, and a single plan can often cover a wide region spanning hundreds of thousands of acres. Henderson said this makes the plans not adaptive or area-specific enough to be adequate as the exclusive means for environmental regulation of oil and gas leases on federal lands.

“The RMPs are doing these broad, kind of general covers of big picture stuff,” Henderson said. “So this provision really seems to be like it’s trying to prevent anything more protective from going forward, which means that a lot will fall through the cracks.”

Lower royalty rate

Beyond its anticipated adverse effects on the climate, the law also decreases the revenue that states and the federal government bring in from leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction.

When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government. The GOP law sets the royalty rate for new onshore oil and gas leases at 12.5%, which is below market rate and significantly lower than the Biden-era royalty rate of 16.67%. This change means the government is expected to earn billions of dollars less in royalties over the next decade.

Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state. In 2024, oil and gas lease royalties for onshore federal land in Colorado totaled $131 million, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior natural resource revenue database.

“In addition to being a significant attack on public lands, this is also going to be causing us to lose billions of dollars in royalties, and then who knows what the ultimate billion dollars of cost it’ll be as a result of the climate emissions that are going to end up happening because of these leases,” Henderson said.",https://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/oil-and-gas-near-parachute-2023.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:04:56.278788

Southeast Asia's energy landscape is undergoing a transition toward new energy, with China playing a pivotal role in advancing green development through sustainable solutions. One key example of this trend is the Monsoon Wind Power Project in Laos.

The first-phase 300 megawatt installation of the Monsoon Wind Power Project - a 600 megawatt wind power project in Laos and Asia's first cross-border new-energy transmission project built by PowerChina - recently began commercial operation, according to a release published on PowerChina's official website on Sunday.

This marks a milestone for the largest single-unit wind power project in Southeast Asia. It provides strong momentum for Laos' energy transition and cross-regional green power supply.

As Laos' first wind power project, its benefits extend beyond Laos. By connecting to Vietnam's grid, the Monsoon Wind Power Project plays a crucial role in regional energy security and contributes to Southeast Asia's green energy ambitions. It provides a stable, clean power supply and offers a concrete example of how renewable energy can be shared across borders, benefiting entire regions.

Leveraging its abundant hydro, wind, and solar energy resources, Laos has positioned itself as the ""battery of Southeast Asia"" and is fully committed to advancing the development of its power industry. Cooperation between China and Laos in the renewable energy sector is conducive to advancing related industries in Laos and boosting its electricity exports.

Laos is intensifying its efforts in the energy transition, with collaboration from China playing a key role in these initiatives. China has been a key partner in driving the development of renewable energy in Laos, providing expertise, technology, and investment. Cooperation between the two nations goes beyond wind power; Laos has also worked with China to develop its hydropower potential, which is among the major hydropower projects in the region.

For instance, the China General Nuclear Power Corporation's clean energy base in northern Laos is a key supporting power source for China-Laos power interconnection and integration. The project is planned as a large-scale clean energy base integrating wind and solar power.

China's involvement in the Southeast Asian renewable energy sector is part of a broader effort to promote green development. Over the years, China has become a global leader in renewable energy technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to electric vehicles and energy storage systems. With its expertise and resources, China is helping Southeast Asian countries build the infrastructure needed to transition to a low-carbon economy.

China's ""carbon emission reduction capabilities"" are a key asset in this effort. The country has made significant progress in reducing its own carbon emissions through the deployment of renewable energy sources and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. By exporting this technology and knowledge to countries like Laos, China is contributing to the region's green development and supporting the global effort to combat climate change.

Moreover, China's role in Southeast Asia's renewable energy sector is evolving toward building a full green value chain. This shift is creating jobs, supporting local talent development, and introducing green finance initiatives, with Chinese financial institutions offering loans for low-carbon projects.

From 2000 to 2020, China's public investment in renewable energy projects in ASEAN countries accounted for 60 percent of the total foreign public investment received by ASEAN during the same period, the Xinhua News Agency reported in September 2024.

At the same time, Chinese companies are transferring technologies and standards in wind, solar, and energy storage, enhancing local capacity to build and manage its own clean energy infrastructure.

Southeast Asia faces significant energy challenges, including rising demand for electricity, environmental concerns, and the need to reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, the region is rich in renewable energy resources, such as hydro, solar, and wind, which can provide a sustainable path forward. Through partnerships exemplified by the one between China and Laos, Southeast Asia is taking critical steps toward a more sustainable future.

Watch now: Does clean energy really cause blackouts?","Fusion energy is heating up in Europe. Startups raked in a record €290 million (around $339 million) in the first half of 2025 as investors piled into the dream of near-limitless clean power, reported The Next Web.

This year's tally has already overtaken 2024's total of €185 million, which was the previous high watermark for European fusion funding, the publication said, citing Dealroom data.

Topping the list was Munich-based Proxima Fusion. It scored a record-high deal for a European fusion startup, raising €130 million in June.

The company is betting on a fusion device called a stellarator, an intricate, twisted ring of metal that founders hope could offer a more stable source of fusion energy than existing reactors.

Proxima cofounder Francesco Sciortino told The Next Web: ""Fusion holds the potential to fundamentally transform the way we think about energy, changing the world from a place that's controlled by those with reserves of oil and gas, to one where technology lets countries control their own fate.""

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear fusion is the process of combining two light atoms, such as hydrogen, into a heavier one, which releases a huge amount of energy.

Watch now: Does clean energy really cause blackouts?

It's the same reaction that powers the sun. Scientists are working to recreate it and make it commercially viable on Earth, something that some experts think could happen in the 2030s.

The benefit of fusion is that it doesn't depend on the weather, like wind and solar energy production, meaning cheaper, more predictable clean power for everything from public transport to data centers to heating homes.

Unlike current nuclear power plants that use fission, which involves splitting atoms and results in radioactive waste, fusion does not create long-lasting harmful byproducts.

The second-biggest European fundraiser was Munich-based Marvel Fusion, which raised €113 million in a funding round in March, per The Next Web.

Marvel is developing a type of fusion that uses lasers to create extreme heat, causing atoms to fuse together and release energy.

Meanwhile, researchers in California achieved a fusion ignition in 2023, meaning they generated more energy than they used in the reaction.

While the technology is still a way off, experts think it could eventually become a source of virtually limitless clean energy — cutting out the need for carbon-emitting dirty fuels altogether and making the planet a healthier and safer place for generations to come.

He stated that this estimate refers to the national energy project plans over the next five years.

""Currently, Indonesia has a 169 million productive-age population out of a total of 284 million. Approximately 7.27 million of them are still pursuing higher education or are unemployed. This is an opportunity that must be utilized by providing as many job opportunities, one of which is through the energy sector,"" as stated by Dadan in a written statement on Sunday, July 27, 2025.

On the other hand, Dadan explained that the potential for job creation in the energy sector is closely related to Indonesia's per capita electricity consumption. He acknowledged that the current employment in this sector is still minimal due to low electricity consumption.

Dadan stated that the current electricity consumption is only 1,337 kWh per year. This figure lags far behind Vietnam, which has reached 2,648 kWh. ""This means that we need to increase power plant capacity. The investment projection for green energy is expected to reach 42.6 gigawatts (GW) in the next 10 years, with an investment value of Rp1.682 trillion. These projects will create huge demand for labor,"" he said.

He added that apart from power plant construction, job opportunities also arise from supporting sectors such as production, services, logistics, and increasing domestic consumption.

Furthermore, Dadan emphasized the importance of industrial downstreaming and the development of clean energy ecosystems as drivers for job creation. He cited the recent laying of the first stone for the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry by President Prabowo Subianto.

According to Dadan, Indonesia has great potential to develop this sector as it is one of the countries with the largest nickel reserves in the world.

""Job opportunities exist not only in battery factories, but also in mining, raw material processing, to final products. This is also part of efforts to strengthen energy resilience and expand the use of clean energy,"" he said.

Dadan believes that the job creation effect is not limited only to the main sectors, such as power plants and mining. Energy projects will also trigger growth in other indirectly involved sectors, such as catering, logistics, banking, and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

10 stocks we like better than Nio ›

Over the past decade, many countries prioritized the development of renewable energy solutions to curb their greenhouse emissions. From 2025 to 2033, Grand View Research expects the global renewable energy market to keep expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% as that secular trend continues. That expansion is generating tailwinds for many green energy companies, but it can be tough to separate the winners from the losers in this fragmented market.

So today, I'll take a closer look at three promising companies in the electric vehicle (EV), hydrogen, and nuclear markets: Nio (NYSE: NIO), Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG), and Cameco (NYSE: CCJ). All three of these stocks are speculative, but they might just churn a modest $100 investment into thousands of dollars over the next few years.

The EV play: Nio

Nio is a major Chinese EV maker which is gradually expanding into Europe. It differentiates itself from its competitors with its removable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out at its power swap stations across China and Europe. Its drivers can pay for those battery swaps individually or pay a monthly fee for lower rates.

Nio's namesake brand sells higher-end sedans and SUVs. Its newer Onvo and Firefly sub-brands sell cheaper SUVs and compact cars, respectively. From 2020 to 2024, Nio's annual deliveries rose more than fivefold, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 42%, and its number of year-end battery-swapping stations jumped from 155 to 3,445.

Most of its recent growth was driven by brisk sales of Nio's higher-end sedans, its gradual growth in Europe, and the recent launches of its Onvo and Firefly vehicles.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Nio's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 26% as it continues to grow its market share in China and disrupt the European market. It isn't profitable yet, but it's growing at an impressive rate for a stock which trades at less than one times this year's sales.

The hydrogen play: Plug Power

Plug Power is the world's largest pure play hydrogen charging and storage company. It mainly provides hydrogen fuel cells and charging stations for warehouse forklifts, and its top customers include Amazon and Walmart. It's already deployed more than 70,000 fuel cell systems and over 250 fueling stations across the world.

In 2024, Plug Power's revenue plunged 29% as its net loss widened. That decline was caused by the challenging macroheadwinds, which throttled the market's demand for new hydrogen-charging projects, and tough year-over-year comparisons to two big acquisitions (which expanded its smaller, cryogenic-systems business) in 2022 and 2023.

But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Plug's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 30% as the macroenvironment stabilizes and the hydrogen market heats up again. It also aims to narrow its losses with Project Quantum Leap, a cost-cutting plan aimed at reducing its expenditures by $150 million to $200 million each year.

A new $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the construction of six green hydrogen manufacturing plants should help it stay solvent as it tries to expand its business again. That outlook seems promising, yet Plug trades at less than three times this year's sales. Therefore, any positive news about the hydrogen market could drive its stock a lot higher.

The nuclear play: Cameco

Cameco, which is based in Canada, is the world's second-largest uranium miner after Kazakhstan's national miner Kazatomprom. It mined about 17% of the world's uranium in 2024, and it operates its mines and mills in Canada, the U.S., and Kazakhstan.

The company's revenue declined every year from 2011 to 2021. That decline started after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which drove many countries to reevaluate their nuclear energy plans. As uranium's spot price plunged, Cameco suspended its biggest mines to conserve its cash. The COVID-19 pandemic then hampered its recovery.

But from 2021 to 2024, Cameco's revenue grew at a CAGR of 29% in Canadian dollar (CAD) terms as its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) surged at a CAGR of 206%. That recovery was driven by soaring uranium spot prices (which rose from $29.63 in January 2021 to $78.50 this June), its restarted mines, and its acquisition of a 49% stake in the nuclear power plant designer and builder Westinghouse Electric in late 2023.

Uranium's comeback was driven by the market's rising demand outstripping its tight supply, supply chain disruptions in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Niger, as well as the rapid growth of the power-hungry cloud and AI data center markets. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 8% (in CAD terms) as its adjusted EBITDA rises at a CAGR of 16%.

Those are impressive growth rates for a stock which trades at just 25 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, so Cameco's stock could still have plenty of room to run.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) last month approved the Darden Clean Energy Project (DCEP), the first project under the state’s Opt-In Certification program.

The project will be the largest battery energy storage system in the world once it is built and will support the state’s progress to 100 percent clean electricity, according to state officials.

Projects seeking approval through the Opt-In Certification program are required to provide community and economic benefits agreements. Environmental justice groups had raised concerns whether the transition from agriculture to energy production would be equitable for the communities’ residents.

Enviromental advocates said the residents in the communities neighboring the project already face challenges such as undrinkable and unaffordable water, extreme heat, and historical disinvestment.

“We think clean energy is what we need. However, the way how you go into that transition and looking at the local impacts of those projects is something that we need to keep at the core of things,” said Nayamin Martinez executive director with the Central California Environmental Justice Network.

The approval of the solar project creates a precedent for the numerous other programs and projects what will be coming to the Valley, Martinez said.

The residents of the three predominantly Latino farmworkers communities formed Comunidades de Westside to advocate for their health and well-being and ensure there are benefits coming directly to their community from the nearby project.

Mariana Alvarenga, senior policy advocate with Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said residents asked the CEC not to approve the project at its June 11 meeting until residents agreed on the community benefits agreement plan with the developer. The agreement has since been finalized but it is not yet public.

The energy project is the first one to be approved under Assembly Bill 205’s “opt-in” permitting process that fast-tracks renewable energy development. Enviromental reviews must be completed within 270 days from when the project application is deemed complete.

More than 20 organizations across California supported Comunidades de Westside’s priorities, which included dust mitigation measures and for traffic to be rerouted during the construction of the project, which is estimated to take three years.

In a May letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom, CEC commissioners and environmental justice advocates urged the state Energy Commission to ensure that the Darden Clean Energy Project invests in community priorities and mitigate the impacts on nearby disadvantaged communities.

The residents and the organizations demanded “a just transition that centers community voices.”

Martinez said having strong community benefit agreements allows those companies to “demonstrate that they are going to be good neighbors by treating the residents that will be more affected in a just way.”

What is the Darden Clean Energy Project?

The DCEP project will be located four miles northwest of Five Points and three miles southeast of Cantua Creek and Westside Elementary School.

The solar power plant will be built on 9,500 acres of land in unincorporated western Fresno County that is no longer able to support agricultural production. The land was owned by the Westlands Water District.

The project, owned by IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power, includes a 1,150-megawatt solar facility with approximately 3.1 million solar panels and up to 1,150 megawatts of battery storage, enough to power 850,000 homes for four hours.

Construction is projected to begin at the end of 2025, with the facility becoming fully operational in late 2027 or early 2028.

The project will create over 1,200 jobs during its peak construction phase and approximately 16 full-time operational positions, according to Elizabeth Knowles, head of community engagement for Intersect Power.

According to state officials, some of the community and economic benefits that DCEP is required to provide under the Opt-In Certification program includes:

$2 million in community investments over the next decade, starting with a $320,000 commitment to Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, a nonprofit supporting crime victims, family wellness, and civic engagement in rural communities.

More than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs to support the local workforce throughout the construction period, which will last from 1.5 to 3 years.

An estimated $169 million in economic benefits to the local area over the project’s lifetime, estimated at 35 years.

This month, Intersect Power partnered with Centro La Familia to distribute air conditioning units to community members in Five Points and Cantua Creek affected by high temperatures. Approximately 250 units were distributed at both events.

The initiative was in direct response to community requests to address concerns about lack of cooling as part of the Darden Community Benefits plan, Knowles said.

Margarita Rocha, executive director with Centro La Familia, said the response from the community at the events was overwhelmingly positive.

CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo said the project “exemplifies a community-focused approach that advances the state’s energy goals while creating benefits for local workers and residents.”

Knowles said the project will commit $2 million over the first 10 years in direct community investments through our Community Benefits Plan, as well as $5 million over the lifetime of the project.

“Since 2023, we have had an ongoing commitment to being a strong partner to the region, working closely with local stakeholders to ensure the Darden Project delivers lasting benefits and truly elevates the communities closest to the site,” Knowles said.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/e5fig5/picture310814285/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Solar%20Five%20point%20event%201S4A1311,N,,2025-07-27 09:59:45.114670

A recent breakthrough from South Korean researchers has ushered in a new era of possibilities with lithium-metal batteries. Known for their potential to significantly enhance energy capacity, these batteries have long been plagued by safety concerns and limited lifespan. However, the novel manufacturing method developed by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) could change the landscape, offering a promising path forward for long-range EVs and large-scale energy storage systems.

Understanding the Lithium-Metal Battery Breakthrough

The breakthrough centers on a revolutionary approach to manufacturing lithium-metal batteries, which are known for their theoretical energy capacity that surpasses conventional lithium-ion cells. Despite this potential, these batteries have been challenging to commercialize due to the risk of dendrite formation. Dendrites are needle-like structures that can grow during charge/discharge cycles, posing a significant risk of short-circuiting and fire hazards. The novel method developed by KRICT scientists involves a solvent-free, roll-based transfer printing technique that introduces a protective layer to the batteries.

By eliminating solvents that could damage the reactive lithium metal, this technique ensures a uniform coating and significantly enhances the stability of the cells. The protective layer combines ceramic and polymer components, which effectively safeguard the anodes from dendrite growth. The innovation not only boosts the lifespan of these batteries but also makes them safer for widespread use in EVs, representing a significant leap forward in battery technology.

China Unveils Groundbreaking Lithium Battery Tech That Flags Deadly Failures Seconds Before the Battery Fully Activates

The Impact of the New Manufacturing Method

The implications of this breakthrough are far-reaching. By addressing the critical issue of dendrite formation, the manufacturing method paves the way for more reliable and efficient energy storage solutions. In tests, the batteries equipped with the new protective layer maintained 81.5% of their initial capacity after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Even under high-rate discharge conditions, where the battery is fully depleted in nine minutes, the cells retained 74.1% of their capacity, demonstrating remarkable resilience.

This advancement not only enhances the performance of lithium-metal batteries but also opens up new possibilities for their application in various sectors. From long-range electric vehicles to large-scale energy storage systems, the potential uses are vast and varied.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

Alphabet's AI-led growth and Tesla's EV struggles highlight the sector's bifurcation.","The AI and electric vehicle (EV) sectors have long been the twin engines of tech market euphoria, but Q2 2025 earnings reports reveal a stark divergence in their trajectories. Alphabet's robust growth in AI and cloud computing contrasts sharply with Tesla's struggles in the EV market, while Trump-era trade policies add a layer of geopolitical volatility to both. Investors now face a critical question: Are the current market highs for these sectors sustainable, or are they built on fragile foundations of speculative optimism?

Alphabet: AI's Golden Child

Alphabet's Q2 2025 results underscore its dominance in AI-driven innovation. Revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $96.4 billion, with Google Cloud surging 32% to $13.6 billion. The company's AI tools, such as Gemini (450 million monthly users) and AI Overviews (2 billion users), are not just enhancing user engagement but also monetizing through cloud infrastructure and enterprise partnerships.

Alphabet's forward P/S ratio of 6.43X may seem lofty, but its strategic investments justify scrutiny. The company increased 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, driven by AI infrastructure demand. Sundar Pichai's emphasis on AI integration across search, YouTube, and cloud services reflects a long-term vision that could sustain growth. However, Trump's tariffs on semiconductors and copper—affecting data center costs—pose a risk. The EU's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods could further pressure European ad revenue. Investors must weigh Alphabet's AI monetization potential against these macroeconomic headwinds.

Tesla: EV Market Struggles and AI Hopes

Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings tell a tale of waning automotive dominance and unproven AI ambition. Automotive revenue fell 16% to $16.7 billion, with deliveries dropping 14% to 384,000 units. Regulatory credit revenue plummeted to $439 million, and the company's trailing P/E of 189.05 hinges on the success of robotaxi and Optimus robots.

While Musk touts Austin's robotaxi tests as a “future cash cow,” the reality is more complex. Tesla's core automotive business faces pricing pressures, supply chain bottlenecks, and the expiration of U.S. EV tax credits by September 2025. Trump's 145% tariffs on Chinese EV components have driven battery costs up by over 160%, squeezing margins. The company's delayed Model 2 and competition from Chinese automakers like BYD (which surpassed Tesla in global EV sales in Q4 2024) further cloud its prospects.

Trump Trade Deals: A Double-Edged Sword

The Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs, averaging 26% on key partners, have created a trade war-like environment. For Alphabet, this means higher costs for semiconductors and copper, critical for AI infrastructure. For Tesla, tariffs on Chinese battery components and the EU's retaliatory 30% tariffs on U.S. goods threaten to erode its already thin margins.

The administration's anti-EV policies—eliminating the $7,500 federal tax credit and easing fuel economy standards—add to the uncertainty. While Tesla's FSD software revenue grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, its near-term profitability remains in question. Meanwhile, Alphabet's cloud business, less exposed to physical trade, is better positioned to weather the storm.

Investment Implications: Balancing AI's Promise with Macro Risks

The sustainability of AI and EV market highs hinges on two factors: the pace of AI monetization and the resolution of trade tensions. Alphabet's premium valuation is justified if its cloud and AI infrastructure dominate the $1.2 trillion AI market. However, investors should monitor the EU's retaliatory measures and the U.S. dollar's strength, which could pressure European ad revenue.

For Tesla, the focus must shift from speculative AI bets to tangible automotive turnaround. The company's robotaxi ambitions require not just technological execution but also regulatory approval and consumer adoption. Given its stretched valuation, a diversified approach—hedging with short-term options or diversifying into AI-driven services—may mitigate downside risks.

Conclusion: A Divided Tech Landscape

The AI and EV sectors are no longer monoliths. Alphabet's AI-led growth and Tesla's EV struggles highlight the sector's bifurcation. While Trump's tariffs have exacerbated these divides, the long-term potential of AI remains compelling. Investors should prioritize companies with defensible cash flows and lower trade exposure, while maintaining a cautious stance on EVs until supply chain resilience and policy clarity emerge. In this volatile landscape, adaptability—not just in technology but in portfolio strategy—will define success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:01:47.160001

1. Vice President Sara Duterte’s Trial: Is it Dead in the Water

The next round of the Marcos-Duterte family feud was expected to play out in Congress. But the Dutertes scored a win—and the possibility of a reprieve until February 2026 or even longer—in Friday’s Supreme Court ruling that temporarily banned an impeachment trial.

The Marcos-controlled House impeached Duterte last February, but a divided Senate has been delaying a trial, citing technicalities and remanding the impeachment complaint to the House.

Now the high court has unanimously ruled that the House impeachment complaint, filed on February 5, was invalid because the constitution bans the filing of an impeachment complaint against the same official during a one-year period. (The court said that last December, the House already archived—and dismissed—three impeachment complaints filed by private citizens against the vice-president.)

Some observers say that the ruling signals a thawing of the Marcos-Duterte family feud—a sign of a truce that allows the Marcoses to ease the growing tensions between the two families.

So will the trial even take place?

Does a Congress in thrall to the country’s two most powerful families have the gumption to hold Sara Duterte to account for allegedly misusing more than P600 million in confidential funds, making death threats against the President and his family members, and for possible involvement in drug-war related killings?

How will the tiny progressive bloc in the 20th Congress, caught between two feuding families, play its cards? And what does all this mean for the country’s tarnished record of accountability?

2. Budget Meetings Behind Closed Doors: Time to Let the Public in?

The 2025 national budget, critics said, was the “most corrupt” in Philippine history. They flagged the huge cuts to the Department of Education and zero funds for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation even as public money was directed to pork-barrel type projects that fattened the legislators’ patronage pots in an election year. These include increased funding for public works projects and cash aid programs.

Most of this redirection took place in secret bicameral meetings between the House and the Senate. At least three petitions challenging the budget’s constitutionality are now in the Supreme Court.

Good governance advocate Cielo Magno is pushing an #OpenBicam campaign to open closed-door bicam meetings—the most secretive stage of the budget process—to the public.

Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez, who is poised to retain his position as house speaker, expressed openness to the proposal. Some senators have also voiced support.

But is Congress ready for transparency?

3. The Quadcom’s Next Act: What’s on the Agenda?

The most sensational public hearings in the 19th Congress were held by the “quadcom,” four House committees that held joint hearings into the police reward system during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war and cracked open the workings of POGOs, illegal gaming operations said to be hubs for online scams and human trafficking.

Live coverage of the quadcom hearings was avidly watched online and on TV. A high point was when Duterte threatened to hit former Senator Antonio Trillanes IV during one of the hearings. The House panel also got Duterte to say he took full responsibility for the killings.

The quadcom ended its hearings with the five proposed bills on extrajudicial killings, POGOs, land fraud, identity falsification and espionage.

The quadcom is expected to reconvene and expand its focus to other issues, including the case of the missing cockfighters and online gambling regulation.

Will the quadcom continue to generate interest? And will its hearing produce real changes, not just political theater?

4. Congress Leadership: Will Romualdez and Escudero retain their positions?

The 20th Congress, like the 19th, will likely be a battleground between the two most powerful families in the country—the Marcoses and the Dutertes.

As House Speaker during the 19th Congress, presidential cousin Romualdez presided over the Duterte impeachment, passed a controversial budget, and approved a proposed constitutional amendment easing restrictions on foreign ownership of local businesses.

The Marcos government’s ability to advance its political and legislative agenda hinges on whether Romualdez can keep being Speaker. So far, reports say he has the votes of at least 291 out of 317 representatives despite grumblings from lawmakers from Visayas and Mindanao, known Duterte bailiwicks.

In the Senate, Escudero and Sotto have butted heads over the stalled impeachment trial. Sotto has also raised concerns over budget insertions that were supposedly intended to get some senators to support Escudero’s leadership.

5. A Long-Sought Reform: Will We Finally Get an Anti-Dynasty Law?

In 1987, the Philippines was emerging from dictatorship and entering a new era of restored democracy—one that promised to break away from the elite rule that marked Ferdinand Marcos Sr.’s regime.

The Constitution ratified that year mandated Congress to pass a law prohibiting political dynasties. But nearly four decades later, no such law still exists and families rule.

The result of the last midterm elections confirm the increasing hold of families: 19 of the 24 senators and 80% of district representatives come from political clans. In addition, at least 18 obese political dynasties, families that have four or more elective positions, are now in power.

Despite this, electoral reform advocates, who have long opposed political dynasties, noted small signs of progress: Some challengers won against dynasties, others came close, and a few longstanding clans lost seats.

Some lawmakers—including Erwin Tulfo, himself from a political family—have voiced support for reviving efforts to pass an anti-dynasty law, following strong advocacy against families during the campaign.

“Pocket rescissions, I think, are unconstitutional,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a spending cardinal, this week.
“Like that’s the concept behind a pocket rescission.
Not all Republicans are certain about the legality of the use of pocket rescissions, however.
), a senior appropriator and former attorney, said this week when asked by reporters whether pocket rescissions were legal.","Some Republicans in Congress are uneasy about the possibility the Trump administration will use a “pocket rescission” to claw back already approved government funding as fears of a fall shutdown rise.

The Trump administration has already clawed back funds through the use of a rescissions package that passed both chambers of Congress, and some GOP lawmakers are concerned about having to vote on a second, possibly politically tougher, package of cuts.

But these lawmakers say the use of pocket rescissions, an idea floated by the White House’s budget chief that could yank back money without input from lawmakers, could create bad feelings not only with Democrats, but also with Republicans.

“Pocket rescissions, I think, are unconstitutional,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a spending cardinal, this week. “So, just like impoundment, I think, is unconstitutional.”

“So we’ll see how it goes,” he said.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought referred to pocket rescissions as “one of the executive tools” that are “on the table” earlier this month, as the administration continues a sweeping operation aimed at reducing federal spending.

“The president was elected to get us to balance, to deal with our fiscal situation, and we’re going to use all of the tools that are there depending on the situation, and as we move through the year,” he said at an event.

However, he also noted then that the administration hasn’t yet “made a determination to use it in part because we’re making progress during the normal course of business with Congress.”

Trump became the first president in decades to successfully claw back funds through the special rescissions process, with the GOP-led Congress agreeing to pull back about $9 billion in previously allocated funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting.

The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) lays out rules governing that process and allows the administration to temporarily withhold funding for 45 days while Congress considers the request. If Congress opts not to approve the request in the timeframe, the funds must be released.

Under a pocket rescission, however, experts say the president would send the same type of request to Congress, but do so within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The targeted funds could then essentially be held until the clock runs out and they expire.

Vought has described the tactic as “no different than a normal rescission, except for the timing of when it occurs.”

“A pocket rescission occurs later in the end of the fiscal year, within 45 days of the time that you have to hold the funding, and then the money evaporates at the end of the fiscal year,” he said.

But some budget experts have strongly pushed back on the budget chief’s characterization, arguing the tactic is “illegal” and undermines the intent of the ICA. The Government Accountability Office also said during Trump’s first presidential term that the law does not allow “the withholding of funds through their date of expiration.”

“It is a method through which [Vought] would get to impound funds against congressional intent,” said Bobby Kogan, a former Senate budget aide and senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, in a recent interview.

“Pocket rescission says, ‘Well, what if I send up a request 45 days before the end of the fiscal year, then even if Congress says no, I can still end all funding for the rest of the year, right?’” he argued. “Like that’s the concept behind a pocket rescission. Profoundly illegal because it would allow you to impound funds without congressional approval, which is illegal.”

At the same time, other experts have argued impoundment law is murky on the matter and have described the tactic as a potential loophole. Some have defended the administration’s interpretation of the law and argue lawmakers would have prohibited the maneuver over the years if they wanted to.

Not all Republicans are certain about the legality of the use of pocket rescissions, however.

“I don’t know. I haven’t researched it,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator and former attorney, said this week when asked by reporters whether pocket rescissions were legal. “I’d prefer that we not do it that way.”

The Louisiana Republican, who has been pushing for the White House to work with Congress to get more rescissions packages out the door, instead said it “wouldn’t bother” him if the administration sent “a rescission package a week and spell out in detail what they want to propose we cut.”

There’s been concern from members on both sides of the aisle that the administration’s plans to continue to claw back federal funding with only GOP support could threaten bipartisan funding talks for fiscal 2026.

But Republican rifts over the president’s latest rescissions requests were also an issue.

The party clashed over potential cuts to programs like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and public broadcasting dollars that help fund not only PBS and NPR, but also local stations some Republicans say their constituents depend on.

Under the pocket rescissions strategy, experts say the administration could reduce some funding by strategically holding up appropriations set to expire at the end of the fiscal year.

If Congress chooses not to approve the administration’s request for cuts, it could still provide funding for the program as part of a deal to keep the government open past September. Congress often opts to keep government funding levels mostly the same at the start of a new fiscal year to buy time for a larger deal updating funding levels.

But experts have emphasized that would be “new funding,” noting funding an account was denied at the end of the fiscal year as part of a pocket rescission likely would not roll over into the next.

Asked whether another rescissions plan could worsen the outlook for a funding deal for fiscal 2026, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said this week that “the only thing that would worry me is if Congress didn’t get a chance to vote on it, that’s the key thing.”

“I don’t want to see things up here that get jammed where Congress doesn’t vote.”

Cole was asked whether he was referring to pocket rescissions.

“I don’t care procedurally what you want to call it,” he responded. “I expect Congress to vote on these things, and you know that would worry me, and I know that would worry my colleagues in the other chamber, on both sides of the aisle, certainly worry my Democratic colleagues here.”

“And there’s a lot of Republican concern about this too,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Pocket-rescission_072725_AP_Scott-Applewhite.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-27 10:00:22.044926

DOE noted that additional federal sites may be evaluated in the future, potentially expanding this initiative beyond the initial four locations.
Background: Savannah River Site","The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina as one of four federal locations to host new artificial intelligence?ready data centers and associated energy generation infrastructure.

Among the four selected sites are Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

DOE’s announcement follows an April Request for Information from the White House identifying 16 potential Department?owned sites for AI data center build?out. The agency evaluated thousands of acres of federal land focusing on areas able to support rapid construction and co?located power infrastructure.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the selections are part of a strategy to “accelerate the next Manhattan Project,” citing strong suitability for hosting data centers alongside power generation to boost grid reliability, enhance national security, and reduce energy costs.

DOE plans to invite private sector partners to develop cutting?edge AI data centers and energy projects at SRS and the other sites. Solicitations are expected in the coming months, with partner selections potentially complete by the end of 2025.

While limited details have been released specifically for Savannah River, DOE emphasized that all four sites are “well?situated for large?scale data centers, new power generation, and other necessary infrastructure.” DOE further stated that it will consult with local governments, federally recognized tribes, and the public during project planning.

These developments align with the Trump administration’s executive orders issued in July, which aim to streamline federal permitting for data center infrastructure, promote advanced nuclear reactor deployment, and leverage federal land for energy?AI development.

Construction on selected sites, including SRS, was initially projected to begin as early as late 2025, with targeted completion set for the end of 2027. DOE noted that additional federal sites may be evaluated in the future, potentially expanding this initiative beyond the initial four locations.

Some of this hydrogen may have accumulated within accessible traps and reservoirs under the Earth’s surface. This store has the potential to contribute to the global hydrogen economy for hundreds of years.

This has been demonstrated by the production of near-pure hydrogen from a single gas field in Mali, attracting the attention of governments in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe.

There is also interest from major venture capital investors and international resource companies. By the end of 2023, 40 companies were exploring natural hydrogen globally. That has likely doubled since 2024.

Hydrogen as a resource

Hydrogen resources have long been a multi-billion-dollar market, even before recent interest in hydrogen as a contributor to the green energy transition. The environments and conditions that result in natural hydrogen accumulation occur globally. But one of the barriers to investment in many jurisdictions is regulatory, as hydrogen had not previously been considered as a resource.

Natural hydrogen can be used to decarbonize hard-to-abate but globally critical industries. Industries that use hydrogen include fuel refining (about 44 per cent), ammonia and fertilizer production for food sustainability (about 34 per cent), and steel manufacturing (about five per cent).

According to a recent British government policy briefing document, addressing this requires governments to include hydrogen as a listed natural resource. Future uses for hydrogen may include long-distance transportation and contributions to the decarbonization of the mining industry.

High carbon footprint

Most of the hydrogen used today is produced from fossil fuels. Because of this, hydrogen production contributes about 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Efforts to produce low-carbon (green) hydrogen from renewable electricity and carbon capture and storage technologies remain expensive.

Natural hydrogen has a carbon footprint comparable to or below that of green hydrogen. The two will likely be complementary, but estimates are uncertain as natural hydrogen is as yet an unproven resource.

Developing strategies could determine whether hydrogen from any source is an economically viable resource. For natural hydrogen, exploration strategies have to be developed to find and extract natural deposits of hydrogen at an economically feasible cost. This also needs incentives that include natural hydrogen in exploration or production licenses.

Hydrogen and helium

The U.S. Geological Survey recently estimated there’s enough accessible natural hydrogen to supply global hydrogen demand for about 200 years.

Hydrogen forms in the Earth’s crust through two natural geological processes: chemical reactions between natural groundwaters and iron-rich minerals and water radiolysis. Water molecules are broken by natural background radioactivity in rocks releasing hydrogen — and helium, a valuable element included in Canada’s Critical Minerals Strategy — as a byproduct.

The search for helium began in Canada in the 1920s, but it is only recently that systematic commercial exploration for helium has restarted. By the 1980s, systematic studies of natural hydrogen began in Canada, Finland and parts of Africa as part of research on subsurface microbial life.

Renewed interest

An unusual coincidence sparked the current global interest in hydrogen. An accidental discovery of the small natural hydrogen gas field in Mali coincided with the publication of extensive historical data from the former Soviet Union, drawing attention to hydrogen’s immense potential as a clean power resource. Australia, France and the U.S. were among the first countries to re-investigate historical natural hydrogen.

Natural hydrogen and helium systems have similarities to petroleum systems, requiring a source rock, a migration pathway and accumulation in a reservoir. The infrastructure for natural hydrogen wells would be comparable to hydrocarbon wells, albeit with changes in well completion and drilling methods.

The footprint of a natural hydrogen production project would take up much less space to deliver the same amount of energy compared to a green hydrogen production facility, which requires solar or wind farms and electrolyzers.

Similarly, natural hydrogen projects do not need to draw on surface water resources, which are scarce in many parts of the world.

Future policies

Some jurisdictions lack policies regulating hydrogen exploration. In others, regulation falls under existing mining or hydrocarbon policies. The lack of clear regulations in areas with high potential for natural hydrogen exploration — such as the U.S., Canada, India and parts of Africa and Europe — is a major obstacle for exploration.

An absence of regulation slows down exploration and land acquisition, and prevents the decision-making required for developing infrastructure. And critically, it means that no community consultations are undertaken to ensure the social acceptance essential for the success of such projects.

A project in South Australia demonstrates what legislation can accomplish. Once regulation of natural hydrogen exploration and capture was implemented, the government received dozens of applications from companies interested in natural hydrogen exploration.

The appetite for exploration is clearly there, but policy and regulatory solutions are required. New exploration projects will provide critical new data to understand natural hydrogen’s potential to provide green energy.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/679937/original/file-20250714-56-1zz59o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C33%2C6914%2C3457&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-27 10:59:36.242100

High-voltage DC, however, can only be optimized by studying the electric network as a whole.
The Europeans formed a consortium, “Friends Of The Supergrid,” in 2006 to consider a high-voltage DC supergrid over their 540 GW AC grid.
But the U.S. has not taken full advantage of high-voltage DC capability and other important new technologies.
We need a program to upgrade the national electric grid, which should include three critical elements.","U.S. electricity demand is rising rapidly, and all the while the electric system is operating closer to its physical limits, causing more frequent system disturbances. These problems will increase in number and severity if we continue down our current path.

Most national attention has focused on the need for additional generation. However, the power produced by these generators cannot be delivered to the trillions of devices that use this energy without a robust network of transmission lines that links generators to local distribution networks throughout the country.

The current patchwork legacy system of jurisdictional responsibilities and competing state interests bottlenecks the needs of the 21st century electric economy. Transmission siting approvals are shared among many redundant decisionmakers based on laws enacted when interstate transmission was in its infancy. The result is that sub-regional decisions are made that fail to take full consideration of the advantages, economies of scale and the best new technologies that benefit the interconnection as a whole.

A high-voltage direct current (or DC) transmission system, for example, can overlay the alternating current or AC grid, providing significantly more capacity to move power large distances to users. High-voltage DC, however, can only be optimized by studying the electric network as a whole.

The average age of our transmission lines is between 40 and 50 years. Obtaining required approvals of new projects can take decades, and lines proposed to meet minimum reliability requirements are often rejected for political reasons or abandoned by their proponents as costs and delays accumulate. As the grid is stretched closer to its physical limits, lower-cost generators operating below their full capability cannot help regions in distress because of the delivery limitations of the AC system.

As recently observed, the Northeast operated near critical limits during an extended heat wave, while generation in neighboring areas couldn’t be delivered to alleviate the concern. NERC, the national agency responsible for reliability of the high voltage electric system, stated in its 2024 Reliability Report that 35 GWs of additional transfer capability was needed throughout the national grid.

Electricity does not flow over transmission lines like water or natural gas through pipes. Changes in supply or demand and other system conditions instantaneously impact power flows across the entire Eastern (600GWs), Western (160GWs) and Texas (95 GWs) AC interconnections based on physical laws unique to electricity.

This speed-of-light delivery must be kept in balance between power sources and uses at all times, while maintaining a constant frequency of 60 hertz and ensuring that the amount of energy transmitted does not exceed the capacity of any individual transmission line in the interconnection. Every second, complex computer programs surveil every source, line and use to identify limitations that result from system changes so that operators can respond effectively.

Because every change affects the entire AC network, complex, protracted studies must be made for all system additions, slowing down the ability to keep up with requests to connect to the system.

The Chinese and Europeans have long recognized these same problems.

In 2005, the Chinese began to overlay their 1300 GW AC grid with an high-voltage DC system, creating a hybrid grid that currently consists of 55 HVDC lines with a combined 170 GWs of transfer capacity. Another 27 GWs is under construction. Many of China’s high-voltage DC lines are more than 1,500 miles long, and a new 12 GW line is over 2,100 miles long, which is like connecting California to the MidAtlantic.

The Europeans formed a consortium, “Friends Of The Supergrid,” in 2006 to consider a high-voltage DC supergrid over their 540 GW AC grid. Europe also established ENTSOe, a group of all transmission owners, to study their collective transmission needs and coordinate a unified plan with the European Union.

But the U.S. has not taken full advantage of high-voltage DC capability and other important new technologies. In 2016, Alexander Macdonald published a study based on 10 years of NOAA supercomputer analysis of system conditions and weather patterns, which concluded that every dollar of high-voltage DC investment would produce $3 of benefits while also substantially reducing carbon emissions.

Opportunities also exist to replace existing conductors with composite core conductors, which would substantially increase the carrying capacity of existing lines. And a new technology known as grid-forming inverters can detect system anomalies in milliseconds, providing immediate benefits to real time grid reliability. This capability is especially important as more “rotating iron” is reaching the end of its useful life.

If these matters are not addressed, America will not have the energy to meet the needs of a growing economy. We need a program to upgrade the national electric grid, which should include three critical elements.

First, like the establishment of the transcontinental railroad and interstate highway system, America needs to build a national, preferably buried, network of high-voltage DC lines that overlays the existing AC network. In addition to the physical security and environmental advantages, buried high-voltage DC lines can be placed in the same Right of Way as existing AC transmission lines.

Second, the transfer capacity of the existing AC network should be improved by hot line conversion, without taking any line outages, to composite core conductors on crucial circuits.

Third, the advantages of grid-forming inverters to real-time grid reliability are intuitively obvious; installation of these devices should be a priority.

With rapidly rising demand, the future is coming at us quickly, and we are not ready for it. These three priorities, effectively implemented, would assist in ensuring that there is sufficient reliable energy to meet the growth needs of the American economy.

Alas, some $600 million already has been spent on the Mid-Barataria project.
The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority will need to see if any of the work already done can be salvaged.","In the annals of coastal protection efforts in Louisiana, progress has never been in a straight line. Periods of vigorous activity have been followed by periods of re-evaluation and assessment.

It seems that with the cancellation of the ambitious Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the state is now turning the page on another era in its continuing battle to find the best ways to restore its coast.

As this newspaper has long supported the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, we lament that we won't see the fruits of this painstakingly planned coastal restoration project. But we respect that there were legitimate concerns about the project's $3 billion price tag and its potential effects on commercial oyster growers and shrimpers along the coast.

Though this chapter is at an end, the state should not retreat from its wetlands-replenishment efforts, but instead should redouble them.

Fortunately, there’s more than just one way to address our coastal issues.

The state’s series of successive, six-year Master Plans for coastal rehabilitation have identified numerous means of successfully retarding and in some cases, reversing marshland loss. Among them are the three big approaches of diversions, drainage and dredging, but also in the mix are oyster-reef reconstruction, man-made berms and breakwaters, and more. The 2023 Master Plan has identified a plethora of possible projects worthy of implementation, often in specific locations and with a high level of confidence.

With the Mid-Barataria project now shelved, money originally slated for that huge project may be available for repurposing in dozens of smaller initiatives. Officials should quickly convene to decide which existing plans should be sped up or expanded, which new projects can now be funded and what other ideas new science or research may offer.

Alas, some $600 million already has been spent on the Mid-Barataria project. The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority will need to see if any of the work already done can be salvaged. The state says it hopes to build what's known as the Myrtle Grove project, a diversion around a quarter of the size, and a large-scale land bridge in the Barataria Basin using dredged sediment.

Whatever happens next, it also helps to know that language in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act will direct as much as $50 million in additional funds to Louisiana for coastal protection each year. This means the CPRA happily will have more to work with than it could count on back when the 2023 Master Plan was adopted.

Louisiana's land loss isn't going away, so we must keep pressing forward. With the Mid-Barataria's loss, a host of other opportunities now arise, just as we want new wetlands to arise in areas previously lost to the sea. State officials should move smartly and expeditiously to seize the day.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/82/38227080-58f7-11ef-bf8d-13bc606ed204/66ba878d5b696.image.png?crop=1233%2C647%2C0%2C21&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-27 12:06:03.450284

Roads and other transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local government revenue in Colorado.
They want that to go to fixing the roads Colorado drivers use.
The budget passed during the most recent legislative session cut nearly $114 million in transportation funding to help fill a $1.2 billion budget hole.
“The lack of transportation funding has reached a point of critical concern.","A proposed ballot initiative for 2026 would require that revenue collected from transportation costs including car registrations, gas taxes and delivery fees go toward road and bridge maintenance, an effort backers say could increase transportation funding to meet the state’s needs.

Two versions of the same measure were filed with Legislative Council Staff last week by retired contractor Donald Hanneman from Castle Rock and retired tech executive Michael A. Hancock from Aurora. One includes a 10-year sunset. The initial review and comment meeting is set for August 1.

“We need to redirect existing fees back to roads, which is the cornerstone of our economic development,” Weld County Commissioner Kevin Ross said in a statement in support of the initiative.

Roads and other transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local government revenue in Colorado. A lot of that state transportation funding comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees — money that is already constitutionally required to go into the Highway Users Tax Fund and toward the construction and maintenance of public highways.

For the current fiscal year, there is projected to be about $1.3 billion in the HUTF to distribute to various entities. About half of that will go to the transportation department and smaller shares are slated for counties and municipalities.

The proposed ballot measure would require that all sales taxes, tolls and fees imposed on cars and gas, retail delivery fees and ride-share fees go towards roads and bridges, ultimately pulling money from the state’s recent efforts to encourage different modes of travel and mitigate environmental impacts from car use.

Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit.

Since landmark 2021 transportation legislation, a handful of fees and enterprise funds have partially funded projects like electrifying vehicle fleets, encouraging multimodal transit and installing electric vehicle charging stations.

Colorado’s prearranged ride fee, for example, is either 18 cents or 34 cents, depending on vehicle type, and is imposed on rides from companies like Uber and Lyft. It funds transit expansions, electric vehicle adoption strategies and air pollution mitigation.

The 28-cent retail delivery fee is allocated to multimodal transportation options, state highways and electrification efforts. It raised close to $93 million in 2024. A little less than 30 percent of that fee revenue goes to the Multimodal Transportation and Mitigation Options Fund, and the rest goes to HUTF.

But measure backers say that about $200 million in transportation fees, such as the prearranged ride fee and delivery fee, are being directed away from road maintenance to funnel money towards mass transit projects in the Denver metro area. They want that to go to fixing the roads Colorado drivers use.

The budget passed during the most recent legislative session cut nearly $114 million in transportation funding to help fill a $1.2 billion budget hole. A coalition of elected officials and business groups urged lawmakers not to make those cuts, and some of them are now backing the potential ballot measure.

“The lack of transportation funding has reached a point of critical concern. In order for Colorado to stay competitive, we need funding for roads and bridges infrastructure that meets the needs of our industries that operate statewide,” Loren Furman, president and CEO of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “Sustainable solutions are critical for ensuring that Colorado is a place that attracts businesses and workers.”

The measure would also require that federal funds meant for car use and two-thirds of sales tax collected on car parts and accessories go toward road maintenance.

Matt Frommer, the transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project said the initiative would be a move in the wrong direction, especially as the federal government rolls back policies like electric vehicle incentives.

“Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit,” he said. “There’s a real risk here of abandoning these efforts at all levels of government right at a time when they’re starting to pick up and gain some traction.”

He said the impact of such an initiative could be fewer transit options, increased car dependence and more traffic congestion on the state’s roads.

The measure’s proponents have a long road to landing the issue on the ballot, including getting a title set by the state Title Board, getting approved for a petition and gathering enough signatures. As a constitutional amendment, it would need 55 percent of the vote to pass.",http://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:27.830257

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs?
One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.

These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.

First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.

Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.

“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”

Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.

Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.

The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.

But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.

The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.

For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.

Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.

You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.

A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.

A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)

But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.

At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.

I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.

“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”

He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.

Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.

“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”

In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.

Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.

She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.

Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.

Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.

Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.

Following a trip to China in 2024, Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, has publicly expressed his concern regarding Chinese vehicle manufacturers such as BYD, Xiaomi, and Changan. He emphasizes that this issue extends beyond the quality or affordability of their automotive products, but rather pertains to the speed at which they are capable of innovating.

This is why Ford has proposed a restructuring of its production strategy, focusing on smaller, more accessible electric vehicles that meet market needs. This new platform will be led by former Tesla engineer Alan Clark. Despite acknowledging the challenges of matching China in large-scale production, they will do everything possible to continue competing on equal terms.

Ford

Founded by the world-renowned Henry Ford in 1913, the Ford Motor Company first emerged in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is an automobile manufacturing company whose headquarters are now located in Dearborn. Although it began its journey in the United States, it has successfully expanded globally, becoming recognized for producing automobiles, commercial vehicles, and racing cars. While Ford had previously invested in electric vehicles between 1998 and 2002 (without much success), it was not until 2024 that they revisited this concept. It was then that mass production of the Ford Explorer, a fully electric vehicle, commenced, and it is now available in the market.

Research on the Chinese market

Although Ford is of American origin, a significant portion of its market is located in Europe. It is precisely there that vehicle manufacturing companies face increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers. The President and CEO of Ford, Jim Farley, has come to regard companies from the Asian giant as an ‘existential threat’ to the rest of the manufacturers. To substantiate his theory, in 2024 he traveled to China with the aim of closely studying the competition.

Once there, he was completely fascinated by the speed at which these companies have been able to develop, incorporate, and market new innovation techniques. He highlighted companies such as Xiaomi, BYD, and Changan, stating, “What really keeps me awake at night is the speed at which the Chinese are innovating. Everyone talks about how good or cheap they are, but what truly stands out is how fast they are”.

What makes China´s production different?

In case the visit to the competition did not shed enough light, Ford has gone a step further. In its quest to understand and compete with BYD, the North American brand has disassembled one of the Chinese electric vehicles to analyze it piece by piece. What makes Chinese production different? Farley emphasized the cost reduction of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and their vertical integration. This allows them to reduce costs by manufacturing their own batteries, without compromising on quality.

On the other hand, although Farley explained that BYD’s propulsion systems are not the most powerful, the market strategy they have employed certainly is. It is evident that they need to optimize their own manufacturing processes if they intend to compete with such companies. “We need smaller plants, less labor, and to reduce complexity,” he stated.

What is next for Ford?

Ford’s response to this situation has been a restructuring of its own production processes, and the announcement of the launch in the coming years of a low-cost, smaller, and more accessible electric vehicle. However, its main concern remains the same: ‘What really worries me is how we are going to execute these technologies on a large scale.’ It is not so much whether our technology will be competitive, but whether we will be able to produce on a large scale with these new suppliers.’ This new platform will be led by former Tesla engineer Alan Clarke, with the expectation of narrowing the gap with Chinese manufacturers. Will Ford achieve its goal?",https://www.lagradaonline.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-38.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 06:58:54.834554

BlackRock’s U.S. voting guidelines still demand that companies adopt “science-based” emissions targets.
No amount of public relations spin can disguise the reality: BlackRock is still boycotting legal energy production.
And it is exactly the type of conduct Texas law was written to stop.
Texas is an energy superpower, and our prosperity depends on the freedom to produce, transport, and consume reliable food and fuels.","When Texas passed SB 13 in 2021, a model policy I helped craft, it did so for a reason. The law bars state entities from doing business with financial companies that take any action to penalize or economically harm fossil fuel producers or impose environmental standards beyond what federal and state laws require. It was a clear, necessary stand against the woke finance machine.

Yet despite this law, BlackRock was quietly dropped from the state’s boycott list after claiming it had pulled back from climate alliances. Never mind that BlackRock itself admitted its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative “doesn’t change how we manage portfolios.” In other words, the same discriminatory practices just under a different banner.

The evidence is overwhelming. BlackRock’s U.S. voting guidelines still demand that companies adopt “science-based” emissions targets. That’s a polite way of insisting on net-zero policies that would all but erase fossil fuel use within 25 years. Under the widely accepted definitions of “science-based,” this means companies are expected to slash emissions from electricity and heat generation to near-zero by mid-century. If that isn’t an attempt to impose climate mandates far beyond any legal requirement, what is?

It gets worse. BlackRock still pressures companies to churn out reams of climate disclosures modeled on the SEC’s failed proposal — regulations so burdensome the SEC admitted they would cause “significant harm” to the economy. In practice, these demands amount to a shakedown: Comply with our climate edicts or watch your board seats vanish. In 2024 alone, BlackRock voted against 127 directors for failing to meet these unrealistic expectations.

It also continues to back shareholder resolutions that target fossil fuels and the Texas ranchers who rely on them. For example, BlackRock voted for a Berkshire Hathaway resolution demanding net-zero electricity — effectively the elimination of natural gas and coal. And in a particularly absurd twist, it supported proposals at Cracker Barrel, Denny’s, Jack in the Box, and Wingstop to force emissions targets modeled on McDonald’s supply chain. These net-zero goals call for electrifying farm machinery, ditching nitrogen fertilizer, and cutting beef consumption in half. The consequences for Texas agriculture and cattle ranching would be devastating.

And let’s not forget BlackRock’s unrepentant pledge to divest from thermal coal. That policy has been on the books since 2020 and remains today. No amount of public relations spin can disguise the reality: BlackRock is still boycotting legal energy production.

This is not conjecture or conspiracy theory. It is documented in BlackRock’s own stewardship reports, proxy voting records, and policy guidelines. And it is exactly the type of conduct Texas law was written to stop.

What’s even more remarkable is that Texas removed BlackRock from the boycott list while the state attorney general is suing it for collusion to suppress fossil fuel production. At a minimum, this litigation should have prompted caution and further scrutiny, not a clean bill of health.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Texas is an energy superpower, and our prosperity depends on the freedom to produce, transport, and consume reliable food and fuels. When Wall Street giants such as BlackRock weaponize trillions of dollars to kneecap these industries, families pay the price through higher electric bills, higher food costs, and diminished economic opportunity.

Texans aren’t asking for special treatment. We’re demanding a level playing field and accountability for companies that say one thing in press releases and do another behind closed doors. The Texas comptroller’s office owes taxpayers a transparent explanation of how BlackRock’s record was evaluated, what evidence justified removal from the list, and whether any independent verification occurred.

CHEVRON’S CONDUCT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH TRUMP’S AGENDA

It’s time for policymakers to remember why SB 13 passed in the first place: to defend our energy economy from activists who treat fossil fuels as a sin to be purged. BlackRock hasn’t abandoned that ideology. It has simply learned to disguise it.

Texas has the law, the evidence, and the moral clarity to hold BlackRock accountable. Now, it must find the will.

Revealed at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Forum, the initiative is being led by XRG, the new international arm of Adnoc, and aligns with the broader BRICS vision for tech-driven development.

The surge in AI adoption is expected to require up to 150 gigawatts of new power capacity within five years, but America’s outdated grid is already struggling. According to UAE energy minister Sultan Al Jaber, this moment offers a rare opportunity to build modern infrastructure capable of supporting data centers that now consume as much energy as mid-sized cities. With grid upgrades taking years, the U.S. faces an urgent $300 billion annual gap just to keep pace.

XRG’s plan significantly increases the UAE’s U.S. energy presence, focusing on unlocking grid access for nearly 2,600 GW of stalled global capacity.

The investment strategy cuts across nuclear, renewable, and fossil fuel sectors. In Texas, XRG has taken part in the state’s largest LNG facility, while Masdar USA has deployed over 5.5 GW in clean energy. This all-of-the-above approach aims to provide the flexibility and scale needed for AI’s massive energy appetite.

Time, officials warn, is running out. The UAE sees the next five years as a critical window to establish energy partnerships that are future-proof and commercially viable.

The move also comes amid regional geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, with the UAE doubling down on diplomacy and economic collaboration. As BRICS pushes ahead with plans for a shared currency and deeper economic integration, the UAE’s U.S. energy initiative positions it as a central player in shaping the technological and energy backbone of the future.

More than just a business deal, this investment marks a strategic leap—bridging infrastructure gaps while advancing the UAE’s role in both the AI and BRICS-driven global order.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance.
Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.
Kate Harper and Conor Lamb Co-Chairs Energy Future PA","Editor: Pennsylvanians could be forgiven for feeling a bit whipsawed when it comes to recent energy-related news here in the Keystone State.

On one hand, the recently signed federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” pulls back from recent progress that has been made in clean energy production, limiting our energy options instead of supporting an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. That means fewer jobs, less economic growth and an electric grid that will become increasingly strained under continued and unprecedented demand for more power.

On the other hand, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and President Donald Trump were in Pittsburgh recently to announce a whopping $90 billion in energy and technology investments in Pennsylvania. Among them is a plan from Westinghouse Electric Company to build 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors across the U.S. – expected to generate $6 billion in investment and 15,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

There is widespread support for more investment in safe, reliable nuclear power. Pennsylvania has a strong nuclear legacy and generates the second most nuclear energy in the country. To lead the new nuclear resurgence, we’ll have to exceed our current pace. As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance. That means setting aside party labels and advancing commonsense energy policy that is solution-driven and puts Pennsylvanians first. Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Only through a comprehensive approach to our energy policy can we ensure our power supply is reliable, clean and affordable – not just today, but for future generations.

Of all the possible ways to gather clean energy, nuclear power seems the most likely to allow us to dispense with fossil fuels completely.
Meanwhile, a single nuclear power station creates enough energy to provide power for 2 million average Europeans.
Environmentalists had turned against nuclear power in the early 1960s – psychologists have tracked its association among these groups with the nuclear bomb.
People fear nuclear power over coal power for much the same reason they worry more about shark attacks than traffic accidents.","Britain was once poised to be the world leader in clean energy. We split the atom, pioneered the first commercial nuclear power station, and by 1988 had built 18 reactors, the third highest number in the world. By the mid-1990s, we were producing enough energy to supply a quarter of the country’s electricity. But then, even as climate change was mov ing from being a contested idea to an accepted one, progress stalled. We stopped building entirely. Now we get just 14% of electricity from this source, and five of our six remaining plants are due for retirement at the end of the decade.

Last week Ed Miliband optimistically announced the dawn of a new “golden age” of nuclear power. His hopes rest on a single Suffolk megaplant, Sizewell C – already delayed and now to be around 12 years in the making, if finished on time. And that looks far from guaranteed.

After 10 years of planning, and nine of building, Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, pictured above, missed its deadline for completion this year. It has now been pushed back to 2031, with such an expanded budget that it is to be the most costly power plant in history. How did we lose our advantage? Of all the possible ways to gather clean energy, nuclear power seems the most likely to allow us to dispense with fossil fuels completely. Wind and solar power can be unreliable – especially on a cloudy island with such variable weather – and backup systems can’t always compensate, as hydroelectricity stores and batteries run down in a few hours. In fact, wind farms must actually shut down when gusts are too strong. Meanwhile, a single nuclear power station creates enough energy to provide power for 2 million average Europeans. Over time, it is also the lowest-price way to garner low-carbon energy, and it has the lightest ecological burden.

Steep initial costs are talked about as the central challenge to building more power stations – and that is the block against which political will has tended to founder. Long and risky construction processes mean that the price starts high and can rise astronomically if things go wrong. But British projects are also among the most expensive in the world. Only America does worse.

The UK has more stringent safety rules than many other countries – and in some, such as China, construction workers earn less than their British counterparts. High-paying Finland and France build more cheaply, as does South Korea, where costs are roughly a quarter of what they are in Britain.

Instead Britain may be missing the secret to success, which – according to the thinktank Britain Remade – is repetition. South Korea builds fleets of plants for every design, relying on economies of scale and learning from practice. This provides workers with standard protocol and a steady pipeline of projects. France bulked up its supply in the 1970s with a similar approach, building 56 reactors with an average construction time of six years each. But Britain seems to have forgotten how to build nuclear power stations. Each project must start again from scratch. That is the direct result of a full 20-year hiatus.

Britain’s underlying problem with nuclear has not in fact been technical, but psychological. The trigger was two high-profile disasters, both of which sharply halted nuclear progress all around the world: Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. The first was the result of a human mistake – operators disabled safety systems during a test – combined with a flawed reactor design; the second was caused by an earthquake and tsunami. The horrific results were splashed across newspapers, and reporting continued for years. But in some countries the effect has lingered longer than in others.

People fear nuclear for much the same reason they worry about shark attacks

In the UK, according to a recent study, public fears were further stoked after Chernobyl by an unusual alliance of environmental activists and fossil-fuel interest groups. The Thatcher government was in the midst of a fight with the miners’ unions when Chernobyl melted down. The disaster became part of that battle. Analysis shows that MPs sponsored by miners’ unions were much more likely to speak out against nuclear energy; newspapers with ties to fossil fuel published more anti-nuclear articles.

Britain's sluggishness can also be explained partly by the political makeup of its green groups, which might have formed the vanguard of those pushing for this clean energy solution. But an ideological split emerged, dominated by those who preferred to campaign for reduced energy consumption rather than technological solutions. Environmentalists had turned against nuclear power in the early 1960s – psychologists have tracked its association among these groups with the nuclear bomb. With few green champions for nuclear, Britain turned back to fossil fuels.

As a result, there has been an enduring idea in Britain that nuclear is “very unsafe” – similar to Germany, which has all but shut down its nuclear capacity since Fukushima. This compares with 15% of Danish and 11% of Swedes.

But this does not reflect reality. Hugely improved safety methods mean the likelihood of another disaster is extremely minimal. Calculations of deaths per terawatt-hour generated put nuclear power, at 0.03, on a par with wind turbines, which is at 0.04, (mostly from accidents, such as drowning in the process of setting them up). For coal, this rises to 24.6, owing to pollution. In fact living near a coal power station exposes people to more radiation than living near a nuclear one – but both are low, at around 0.01mSv (millisieverts, a measurement of radiation) a year. For comparison, those living in Cornwall receive about 6.9mSv a year

Risks are tough to calculate correctly. We tend to overestimate the danger of the dramatic and unfamiliar. People fear nuclear power over coal power for much the same reason they worry more about shark attacks than traffic accidents. But fossil fuels are much more dangerous, by any standard. One back-of-the-envelope calculation from a recent report finds that the swap in nuclear power stations for fossil fuels after Chernobyl has resulted in the loss of “318 million life years” since 1986.

Yet support for nuclear power is rising across the world, including in Britain. Why? Well, perhaps the most efficient way to shift perception of one threat is for another, larger one to come along . France’s success can be explained by the oil crisis in 1973: the country was almost completely reliant on foreign oil; that problem ate the nuclear one. Now we are going through a similar moment of our own. Academics have used the term “reluctant acceptance” to explain the shift in support as climate risks ramp up. But the real change may have come since the energy threats posted by the war in Ukraine. Campaigners should remember that their greatest advances are made not in the field of science, but in politics.

These are impressive documents, readily available on the internet, which should be required reading for anyone interested in Maine’s future. The heart of our state energy plan is to have 100% clean energy (non-carbon based) by 2040.

It’s an extraordinarily ambitious goal.

Recent actions by the current federal administration to deny any new wind power projects in federal waters and to withdraw approval for a major wind project already being constructed demonstrate that, unfortunately, Maine is not fully in control of its energy future.

There is reason to doubt that Maine will reach a 100% electricity powered by “green” sources by 2040. But it does seem clear that by 2040 or 2050, if enough electricity can be generated, and if the transmission and distribution grids can be upgraded to support the increased amounts of electricity needed (both vastly expensive and technically challenging tasks), gas- and diesel-powered vehicles and fuel-oil or propane furnaces and heaters will be prohibited or strictly regulated within 25 years in the state of Maine.

Aside from all of the community planning, economic development and conservation issues that will arise in this green energy effort, there has been little public consideration of how this new state green energy system will be protected, both from the increased violent natural events brought on by a warming planet, and protected from both domestic and foreign parties that may see Maine’s energy infrastructure as a target.

Maine has made more progress in thinking about its energy future and taking direct action toward specific goals than most states. And in spite of federal interference and lack of support, Maine continues to work with Canada and other Northeastern states to coordinate grid improvements.

In-state, Maine is providing direct support for installation of heat pumps and EV charging stations, while also collaborating on advanced wind energy projects. While I am grateful for and impressed by what is being accomplished, under extraordinarily difficult conditions, I am increasingly concerned that the Maine Energy Plan focuses so much on how to make our electrical supply “green” that it does not adequately consider how to keep it protected.

It is my impression that most people living and working in Maine don’t fully grasp what is being proposed, and what is starting to happen. The Maine Energy Plan envisions that by 2040 or 2050. there will be few if any fuel oil-fired furnaces, and no more gasoline- or diesel- powered cars or trucks, which means that there will be few if any gas stations and few if any heating oil delivery services. The only energy for our homes and businesses will be electricity.

The impact that this change will have upon jobs, community structure and appearance (now is the time to start planning for what should and should not happen with all of those intersection-located gas stations) will be immense.

During the past 10 years, as I have driven on I-95 from Portland to Augusta, I have been intrigued by the growing number of solar farms visible along the side of the road. On occasion I have driven onto side roads, which allow a direct close view of some of these large solar panel installations, and have also looked at them using Google Earth.

It is interesting to see the evolving design of solar panels, the structures they are mounted on and how the arrays of panels are connected to the grid. What is also interesting to see, from Google Earth and site visits, are the various ways that people could gain access to these solar farms.

I make no claim to be a security expert, but it seems obvious that two or three people equipped with splitting mauls, axes and each carrying 5 gallons of gasoline could easily get over the low fences surrounding the sites or break through the gates with a reinforced vehicular grill and, within 20 minutes, render any of those sites inoperable for between six months and two years, if the sites were even deemed by their owners to be worth reinvestment as solar farms.

As Maine becomes more dependent upon electricity as its only source of residential and commercial energy, the infrastructure supporting that single source becomes an increasingly attractive target both for the individual seeking revenge for some real or imagined wrong and for military or paramilitary groups seeking large-scale civil disruption. Such a disruption could be either a distraction to camouflage some other action or to diminish the state or the nation’s capacity to function. Russia, very early in its war with Ukraine, targeted Ukraine’s energy production and distribution infrastructure.

Last month, I went to a medical appointment next to Thompson’s Point, on Sewall Street. There is an electrical substation there, where high- voltage electricity from the transmission grid is switched to low-voltage electrical power and fed to the local Portland area distribution system.

The security for this vital component of economic and residential activity is a high fence with rolled strands of barbed wire and a front locked gate. However, for the two hours I was on Sewall Street, that gate was open with no vehicle or visible personnel on the site. The fence would probably have been effective until the late 1990s. Now almost any truck and many SUVs could easily push open the surprisingly flimsy gate, and anyone with training and some simple equipment could bypass the rolled barbed wire. Major harm could be achieved without even entering the compound.

It is my deep concern that existing physical security for Maine’s vast electric power infrastructure, designed for a less informed, more law-abiding society that no longer exists, and at a time when the electricity supply system was not so essential for the functioning of everything, is now inadequate.

Advertisement

Added to my concern is that new security threats exist. Anyone wanting to damage a substation, an electricity-generating dam or a solar farm can gain essential planning knowledge from any cellphone, tablet or computer using such free tools as Google Earth. Several firms are eager to sell drones with night-vision cameras and software that would allow highly accurate maps to be prepared from undetected night drone surveillance flights.

I won’t go further, but terrorist groups around the world have discovered and are using internet-provided information to cause vast harm: information that into the 1980s was esoteric, hard to find and very often highly classified. Why will such attacks never happen in Maine? Or, perhaps, when will that happen in Maine?

***

What to do about this?

Establish a task force that includes military, police and others knowledgeable in the disruption of power supply systems and hopefully, in the defense of such systems, complete a review of best security practices across the country and around the world. Then develop guidelines and standards; hold education and training workshops. Then start requiring that any new electrical source being connected to the grid must be reliable, repairable and physically secure.

And review every existing connection to the grid, giving operators of those sources a time specific by which security improvements must be in place, in addition to providing technical assistance and, whenever possible, financial help or incentive. Then inspect and, as necessary, repair or upgrade those systems every year. This should become one of the highest priority capital improvement projects of the state, of New England and the nation.

The Governor’s Energy Office is, in my opinion, doing a really good job and the governor deserves great credit for such strong support of the office’s efforts. And the GEO staff is looking at the durability of the transmission and distribution grids, as well as what kind of changes will be needed when and if Maine relies not just upon a relative handful of electricity generators, but literally hundreds if not thousands of homes, institutions and businesses connecting their solar panel arrays to the grid.

The 15 years between now and 2040 are going to require immense amounts of work, skill, money and luck, along with increasing awareness and support from the general population if the energy plan is to have any chance at success.

But all of this good and expensive work will be wasted if the transmission lines, substations, distribution lines and sources of electricity are not physically secure. This immense, complicated, absolutely essential, and in many instances highly vulnerable infrastructure needs to be physically secure from the byproducts of a warming planet. Those include more high wind events, more ice, sleet and hail damage, more and higher tidal surges and rain bombs when warmer air holds more moisture and drops several inches of rain in an hour.

But they must also be secure from deliberate actions to disrupt and destroy. When everything is connected through the “grid,” and when everything depends solely upon electricity, whether green or not, it takes relatively little to have a big, powerful, dangerous impact. And unfortunately, in the world we presently live in, that makes all parts of Maine’s electrical infrastructure prime targets for those who wish to cause harm.",https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/07/26688861_20210930_solar_8368-e1633025584955-1024x638-1-1753378013.jpeg?w=1024,N,,2025-07-27 10:00:09.300131

The move, which is expected to be proposed in the coming days, would reverse the scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and undermine efforts to limit emissions and tackle climate change. This would have significant implications for climate policies in the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly set to propose a significant change in its stance on climate change, which could reshape U.S. climate policies. The EPA is expected to reverse its 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" a scientific and legal determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health. This move would undo the core legal authority underpinning major climate regulations across transportation, energy, and industrial sectors [1].

The EPA's proposal, submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget on June 30, is expected to be released for public comment after interagency review. This reversal would modify the legal framework that has been the basis for federal climate change regulations for over a decade. The decision is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and other industries [1].

The implications of this proposed change are far-reaching. It could lead to a relaxation of emissions standards for vehicles, industrial processes, and power plants, potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This move is likely to be opposed by environmental groups and climate advocates who argue that reducing emissions is crucial to mitigating the effects of climate change. The automotive industry, which has been grappling with tariffs and weak demand, may also face additional challenges if emissions standards are relaxed [1].

The EPA's action comes amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the automotive industry. President Donald Trump recently announced a new trade agreement with Japan that lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports to 15%, down from the previously threatened 25% rate. This agreement includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States [2]. However, the impact of this trade deal on the automotive industry remains to be seen, as it could both boost U.S. inventory and partnerships while also creating potential challenges for automakers facing tariffs and weak demand [2].

Additionally, the EPA's proposed rollback of the endangerment finding coincides with significant financial struggles in the automotive sector. Stellantis reported a preliminary net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) for the first half of 2025, driven by weak North American sales, program cancellations, and a €300 million tariff hit under President Trump’s new trade policies [2]. General Motors also reported a 34.5% decline in second-quarter 2025 net income to $1.9 billion, primarily due to tariffs, warranty costs, and EV inventory adjustments [2].

The proposed rollback of the endangerment finding is a complex and contentious issue with far-reaching implications for climate policy, the automotive industry, and investors. As the EPA's proposal moves forward, it will be crucial to monitor the regulatory and market responses to understand the potential impacts on the U.S. economy and environment.

The leaders also unveiled an ambitious new framework for bilateral ties, formally known as the UK-India Vision 2035.

Described as the most comprehensive trade deal India has ever entered into and the most economically significant bilateral agreement for the UK since its departure from the European Union, the pact is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion annually. This milestone marks a significant shift in the trajectory of trade, investment, and strategic collaboration between two of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a “major win for Britain”, saying: “It will create thousands of British jobs across the UK, unlock new opportunities for businesses and drive growth in every corner of the country, delivering on our Plan for Change. We’re putting more money in the pockets of hardworking Brits and helping families with the cost of living.”

Announced against a backdrop of economic volatility and geopolitical flux, the agreement reflects a shared intent to usher in a decade of deeper cooperation across several areas. These include trade and defence, as well as clean energy, education, and cutting-edge technology.

Prime Minister Modi hailed the signing as a historic moment in the relationship between India and the United Kingdom. He emphasised the importance of a shared vision and reaffirmed both nations' commitment to progress as equal partners in innovation, security, and inclusive development.

For businesses and consumers alike, the deal offers tangible benefits. Indian exporters will gain unprecedented access to the UK market, while British consumers can expect lower prices and a wider range of products. On the UK side, the agreement opens new avenues for trade, job creation, and cross-border investment in industries ranging from aerospace to green energy.

According to the Department for Business and Trade, Indian buyers will soon be able to enjoy British goods, including soft drinks, cosmetics, automobiles, and medical equipment, at significantly reduced tariffs. Rates that previously averaged around 15 per cent will now fall to just 3 per cent. In return, UK consumers and businesses will see Indian products become far more affordable and widely available.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the deal “historic” and stated, “India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an emerging economic superpower.” This trade deal puts the UK in the best position to partner with India over the next decade, promising to unlock thousands of jobs and boost growth across both economies.”

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds praised the agreement, calling it a historic step forward. He also revealed nearly £6 billion in new investment commitments and export agreements. Twenty-six British companies are launching new ventures in India, including aerospace leaders Airbus and Rolls-Royce, which will supply aircraft and engines as part of contracts valued at approximately £5 billion.

Yet the scope of this partnership goes far beyond trade. The UK-India Vision 2035 outlines long-term objectives across various sectors. These include a new Defence Industrial Roadmap aimed at bolstering joint defence capabilities and sharing advanced technologies. The two nations will also strengthen their collaboration on climate and clean energy, with the UK gaining access to India’s rapidly growing renewable energy procurement markets.

In financial services, the agreement locks in liberalisation measures that remove key barriers to UK investment. India has committed to maintaining foreign investment caps in the insurance sector and to ensuring equal treatment for British firms, an essential step toward stability and long-term investor confidence.

Further collaboration will focus on addressing global threats, including corruption, organised crime, and irregular migration. Enhanced intelligence-sharing protocols and new operational frameworks are being established to support these efforts.

The timing of today’s announcement is notable. It coincides with the first anniversary of the UK-India Technology Security Initiative, launched in July 2024. Both governments reaffirmed their shared ambition to lead in frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space innovation, and cyberdefence.

For the UK’s green economy, the deal provides a unique foothold in India’s rapidly growing clean energy sector. Analysts expect this to give a substantial boost to British green tech exports while advancing India's broader energy transition strategy.

Education and innovation also sit high on the agenda. The two countries plan to deepen academic ties, expand student exchange programs, and increase collaborative research between universities and tech institutions. Over the coming decade, these partnerships are expected to foster significant cross-border talent and knowledge transfer.

As the UK Parliament prepares to ratify the deal, government officials are urging businesses in both countries to prepare for implementation. The agreement will be formally tabled in Parliament in the coming weeks, following standard legislative procedure.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_51681a3d97194836910829b691ec035b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_51681a3d97194836910829b691ec035b~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-27 09:00:01.007928

They’re building a 2.5-million-square- oot facility that will make batteries for General Motors’ growing fleet of electric vehicles.

The new plant marks a $3.5 billion investment that is projected to bring 1,700 new jobs to St. Joseph County, which wooed the company by approving lucrative tax abatements and $50 million in bonds to build out infrastructure to the site. “Everything seems to be on track from our end of things here,” said Jeff Rea, president and CEO of the South Bend Regional Chamber of Commerce. “Everybody feels good about it here.”

The same story is playing out in Kokomo, where Stellantis, in partnership with Samsung SDI, is building two battery plants totaling a $5.7 billion investment projected to create 2,800 new jobs.

But EV advocates say battery plants like the ones under construction in Indiana will soon face major setbacks that could lead to fewer jobs and put billions of publicly invested dollars at risk.

Republican lawmakers this month approved President Donald Trump’s “One, Big Beautiful Bill” that guts Biden-era incentives approved in the Inflation Reduction Act that have fueled the rapid growth of Indiana’s EV industry.

SETBACKS AND JOB LOSSES

In October, the $7,500 tax credit for American-made EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs will end, as will the tax credit for commercial EVs that offered up to $40,000 for heavy trucks. The 30% tax credit for personal EV charging infrastructure will expire after June 30.

Those credits have been instrumental in pushing EV sales, which in the U.S. have increased 60% since 2022. During that time in Indiana, the number of new EV registrations doubled to 35,000, according to Go Electric Vehicle Indiana, a statewide initiative dedicated to advancing the adoption of EVs.

Now, without the tax credits, sales of battery electric vehicles could drop about 30% in 2027 and 40% in 2030 compared to a scenario in which Biden-era policies are continued, according to a Princeton University study published in March.

With the anticipated drop in sales, up to 72% of all battery cell manufacturing that will be operational by the end of the year won’t be needed, due to the slumping demand for EVs. Plants could be at risk of closure, the study reported.

In Indiana, that could put nearly 7,000 jobs at risk in 2030, most of which would be in the battery sector, according to an April study published by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

Battery manufacturers are already responding to the Trump administration’s abrupt shift in EV policy. A Japanese company in June halted construction of a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

In South Bend, a company called SiFAB will likely delay the expansion of a production line for a new kind of silicon fiber used to build lithium-ion batteries, according to Rea. The company did not respond to an interview request.

“These changes can affect what happens at our local companies here,” Rea said. “I think they’ll still advance their platform. It just may be slower compared to what they originally planned.”

‘FAR MORE THAN AN EV CREDIT’

The cuts to the tax credits come as Indiana companies have invested billions to build out their EV markets as sales have steadily increased across Indiana and the nation.

GM, Honda, Stellantis and Toyota have poured, in total, more than $1.4 billion into new EV production lines at their Indiana facilities. ENTEK, a battery-component supplier, is investing $1.5 billion to build a new facility in Terre Haute.

An EV startup called Slate is spending $360 million to convert a former printing plant in Warsaw into a new production facility for customizable electric trucks. The company said the project would bring about 1,600 jobs to the city.

Add it up, and Indiana today ranks ninth in the nation for new EV investment, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now, the claw back of federal support for electric vehicles will disrupt the longterm financial plans for those companies, argued Ryan Lisek, program director for Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit working to accelerate EV adoption.

“These manufacturers have made multi-billion-dollar investments that were predicated on these different tax credits being there, so that’s going to hurt,” he said.

Removing the tax credits will also undermine what has become a uniquely American industry that has developed into a major economic driver in places such as Indiana, argued Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association and son of former Vice President Al Gore.

The $7,500 tax credit approved in the Inflation Reduction Act applied only to vehicles assembled in the U.S. that don’t use minerals from any country considered a “Foreign Entity of Concern,” including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

Those stipulations led many automakers in the past few years to onshore their EV production in the U. S., Gore explained. Today, about 74% of all EVs sold in America are made in-country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. That’s far higher than the 50% of gas vehicles made in-country and sold in the U.S.

“This tax credit was highly tailored for American manufacturing, American battery components and mineral production,” Gore said. “It was far more than an EV credit.”

“Now, this pretty intense, top-down effort to unwind a lot of the energy credits … also unwound a lot of policy that was really highly tailored around American jobs and competing with China,” he added.

‘A BUMP IN THE ROAD’

Although ending tax credits will slow the adoption of EVs, it won’t stop their long-term success in the U.S., argued Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns at the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that aims to end America’s dependence on oil.

The price gap between electric and gas vehicles has gradually narrowed in the past five years while new battery technolog y has allowed for longer driving distances, making EVs far more attractive to new car buyers, Viles explained. Those trends made the Tesla Model Y the fourth best-selling vehicle in the nation last year.

Phasing out the credits could force automakers to move more quickly to bring down EV prices in order to compete with their more popular gas counterparts, argued Lisek of Drive Clean Indiana.

“It is going to hurt the market,” he said. “We’ll be seeing the training wheels come off for electric vehicles. But I think we’re going to see softer prices as manufacturers and dealers sharpen their pencils.”

Although EV companies and automakers will likely pull back on near-term investments as federal support evaporates under the Trump administration, those companies that have already made investments are set to reap the benefits, Gore asserted.

“The demand for good EVs that deliver on what people are looking for is always way higher than I think most people estimate, because in the end, they’re really good cars that people love to drive,” he said.

Back in New Carlisle, the first steel went up last month at the GM battery plant.

Liz Winter, the company’s senior manager of corporate affairs, noted GM has invested in a resilient critical minerals and battery supply chain to “support American innovation, manufacturing and economic security.”

Those investments have made “GM the engine of growth for the U.S. auto industry this year, and we don’t see that changing,” she said in an emailed statement.

Even so, the “engine of growth” will likely idle down in the coming years as EV tax credits disappear, according to Viles.

But for bedrock auto companies like GM and Stellantis that have already made huge EV investments in Indiana, the slowdown represents only a bump in the road to the industry’s long-term success, Viles argued.

“It’s a very big bump in the road, but I don’t think we’re hitting a wall.”

The complexity of lithium supply chains now threatens the pace and affordability of the global net zero transition.
This sharp increase in mineral input – particularly lithium – underscores how the world’s clean energy supply chains remain at risk.
The IEA now warns that without rapid expansion and diversification of lithium production, shortages could delay or inflate the cost of clean energy deployment.
Only 10% of lithium demand is expected to be met through recycling in that timeframe.","Lithium’s role in clean energy systems goes far beyond its use in electric vehicle batteries. It is central to any global attempt to shift away from fossil fuels, but while lithium is abundant in nature, getting it where it is needed most – and at the right time – is a different story.

The complexity of lithium supply chains now threatens the pace and affordability of the global net zero transition.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for lithium will rise more than 40-fold by 2040 under the agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario – which aligns with the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

Even less ambitious policy scenarios still point to at least a doubling of overall mineral needs.

This sharp increase in mineral input – particularly lithium – underscores how the world’s clean energy supply chains remain at risk. Current mining, refining and investment plans fall far short of projected needs.

Lithium’s essential supply chain role

Energy systems based on solar, wind and battery technologies rely on far more mineral input than traditional fossil fuel infrastructure.

One electric vehicle (EV) requires six times more mineral material than a petrol-powered car, while an onshore wind power plant requires nine times more than its gas-fired counterpart.

For EV batteries and energy storage, lithium is joined by key materials such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.

These determine battery longevity, performance and energy density. Copper and aluminium, meanwhile, underpin electricity grid expansion, while rare earth elements power the magnets in wind turbines and EV motors.

As demand grows, attention is shifting to where these materials come from, how they are transported and refined and whether supply chains can keep pace.

From 2010 to now, mineral requirements for new power generation capacity have already grown by 50%.

The IEA now warns that without rapid expansion and diversification of lithium production, shortages could delay or inflate the cost of clean energy deployment.

Jakob Stausholm, Chief Executive of mining company Rio Tinto, links lithium directly to Rio’s low-carbon business model.

Following the firm’s $6.7bn acquisition of Arcadium Lithium, Stausholm says the move will “create a world-class lithium business” and help position Rio as a key supplier for low-emission technologies.

Strategic moves to secure lithium

To respond to rising demand, countries and companies are scaling up lithium output. In Chile, the second-largest holder of lithium reserves, a major partnership has formed between state-owned Codelco and lithium producer SQM.

Their joint venture will extract and refine lithium from the Salar de Atacama from 2025, with Codelco assuming full operational control from 2031.

Máximo Pacheco, Chairman of Codelco, says: “Just as we have contributed to making Chile the world leader in copper production, we will now contribute to making our country a leader in the production of lithium.”

This is both a strategic industrial agreement and one built around environmental performance. Both companies commit to higher environmental standards, local stakeholder engagement and technological upgrades.

The goal is to meet growing global demand while also addressing the growing scrutiny around water use, waste management and emissions from lithium extraction – particularly in sensitive regions like the Atacama desert.

The Arcadium deal positions Rio Tinto alongside customers such as Tesla, General Motors and BMW.

By integrating lithium into its wider minerals portfolio – which includes copper, aluminium and iron ore – Rio aims to reduce customer exposure to price volatility and supply disruption.

Yet while moves by companies like Rio and Codelco are promising, they remain outpaced by demand.

Supply chain gaps and future risks

Lithium’s sharp demand trajectory exposes several structural risks. Mineral extraction is geographically concentrated.

More than 70% of cobalt and 60% of rare earths come from just one or two countries – mainly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and China. Lithium, while more widely distributed, still faces similar issues with refining and processing concentrated in a few regions.

Mining projects are slow to come online. The IEA reports an average lead time of 16.5 years between discovery and production.

Meanwhile, clean energy rollouts – especially EVs and grid-scale batteries – are accelerating much faster.

Even if all existing projects are delivered on schedule, only half of lithium and cobalt demand will be met by 2030 under climate-aligned scenarios.

This supply shortfall could raise costs and create bottlenecks. For lithium-ion batteries, raw materials now make up 50–70% of total costs.

A doubling in lithium or nickel prices could push battery prices up by 6% – cutting into cost reductions achieved through scale.

Recycling, seen as one way to ease pressure on primary supply, is unlikely to make a major dent before 2040. Only 10% of lithium demand is expected to be met through recycling in that timeframe.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0269d16bfb9a9f94a50d49d7d0e1cd72:cef0c61355a8464a52dfbb408dea9fd9/lithium-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 09:00:08.673859

Government tax credits for electric vehicles and home projects will soon be no more.

The Washington Post reported that Republican lawmakers voted to axe many clean energy incentives earlier than expected. Federal tax credits for electric vehicles will end on Sept. 30. Credits for energy-saving home upgrades will expire on Dec. 31.

""These are the kinds of things people make decisions about when they need to — when machines come to the end of their useful lives or when they're not working correctly,"" said Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, per The Washington Post. ""Now we have a perverse incentive where, if you want to get … a discount, you have to rush out and do it before the end of the year.""

For anyone eyeing an EV, Sept. 30 is your last chance to sign a purchase or lease agreement for up to $7,500 off a new model or $4,000 off a used one.

Corey Cantor, research director at the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told The Washington Post: ""A car is often the second-largest purchase a person makes. You do need to shop around and get a sense of what's out there.""

Solar panels still qualify for a 30% tax credit under the Residential Clean Energy Credit, averaging $5,084 back, according to The Washington Post. But Congress could cut this credit by year's end. That means homeowners would need installations finished before Dec. 31 to snag the savings.

Installing solar isn't just about money. It can cut down on pollution that is heating up the planet. EnergySage offers a free tool to compare local installer quotes and get quick rooftop solar estimates.

Heat pump water heaters, insulation, and window upgrades are part of the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, paying up to $3,200 per year. As reported by The Washington Post, Rewiring America says most homeowners use this for insulation, doors, and windows. The average claim? Around $882.

Toward the end of the year, you can still use EnergySage's mapping tool to see average solar panel costs and state incentives in your area. Together with their services, the average homeowner could save nearly $10,000 on solar installations.

Some rebates aren't going away just yet. The Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program still offers big discounts on heat pumps, electric stoves, insulation, and wiring upgrades. If your household brings in 80-150% of your area's median income, you might get half off, according to The Washington Post. Families earning less could even have the whole cost covered, up to certain limits.

Are you currently using solar power in your home?","A major step toward more affordable renewable energy recently occurred in Peru. Zelestra, a Spanish renewable energy company, has officially switched on the country's largest solar farm.

The solar farm, dubbed the San Martín project, consists of 450,000 solar panels and will generate over 830 GWh of clean energy annually, powering more than 400,000 homes. To put it in perspective, a U.S. household uses roughly 10,500 kWh per year, or 0.0105 GWh.

Located in the La Joya district of Arequipa, Peru, this plant is good news for everyday people because solar energy can help lower electricity bills in the long run and benefit the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, the sun's energy is free, so once the panels are built, the power they produce doesn't depend on buying expensive gas or coal.

By adding substantial clean power to the grid, the San Martín project can help protect families from rising energy costs while also maintaining power during major storms.

""By leveraging our global expertise in engineering, procurement, and construction, we can successfully co-build tailored solutions that bring projects to life on time and on budget,"" said Zelestra CEO Leo Moreno, per Renewable Energy Magazine. ""We are proud to see the most ambitious solar project in Peru now fully operational, and we look forward to a long-term partnership with Kallpa in delivering clean, reliable energy for years to come.""

Building and running this solar farm has already created hundreds of local jobs, and it will continue to provide steady work for those who maintain and operate it. Additionally, replacing fossil-fuel energy with solar energy reduces pollution.

This project alone will prevent over 160,000 tons of carbon pollution from entering the air each year, according to the report. This means cleaner air and a healthier environment for the community. In short, Peru's sunshine just got a whole lot more powerful, and everyone's set to breathe a little easier because of it.

Some of our deepest values take root in childhood. For me, it began in the lush green spaces of the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad, a peaceful space where native flowering trees thrive, and bird songs are more common than traffic noise. The constant presence of rich biodiversity instilled in me the value of coexisting with Nature and sparked a desire to conserve it from a young age.

Law wasn’t an accidental choice. In the late 1990s, I pursued the five-year Integreated LLB (Hons.) from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. Environmental law wasn’t offered as a subject then. We only touched upon it briefly through laws like the Air Act and the Water Act. This early exposure sparked my interest and I found myself drawn to issues around natural resources, governance, and sustainability.

Inspiration

Reading Down to Earth magazine during my student years only deepened that curiosity and made me aware about environmental concerns. This led me to apply for an internship at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi. What began as a three-month internship turned into several transformative years, as I was introduced to the grassroots dimensions of environmental justice and met inspiring figures like Rajendra Singh, the “Waterman of India”.

My early work in the development sector focused on human rights, gender, and natural resource management and gave me valuable field exposure and insights into how laws play out in real life. Soon, I began engaging with questions around sustainable development, governance, and how law could be used as a tool to promote environmental responsibility. This eventually led me to the field of environmental law, not just as an academic subject, but as a dynamic and evolving space where real impact was possible.

Connecting environment and law

I advise other organisations, develop curricula, teach at multiple institutions, and conduct training for forest officers, civil servants, and members of the judiciary. Through the Centre for Environmental Law (CEL), WWF-India, we’ve tried to strengthen environmental law education in the country. I’ve designed and launched several online courses such as the Post Graduate Diploma in Environmental Law and Policy, developed jointly with National Law University, Delhi, and the LL.M. in Environmental Law, Energy and Climate Change, in collaboration with O.P. Jindal Global University, which have opened new avenues for students to pursue specialised legal careers in environmental issues.

What makes this journey rewarding is the ability to work for the voiceless wildlife and ecosystems that cannot advocate for themselves. One of the most exhilarating cases I followed was the Nyamjang Chhu case in Arunachal Pradesh, where the return of the endangered Black-necked Crane to its threatened breeding ground, just in time for the final court hearing, led to the halting of a hydropower project. It was as though Nature itself had spoken!

I often say that environmental law is not something that can be practised in isolation. You need to bring in science, economics, politics, even ethics. One of the biggest challenges is how to communicate complex environmental issues to diverse stakeholders; from communities to corporations to judges. That’s where law can act as a bridge.

To anyone considering a green career in law, I’d say: identify problems but focus equally on creating solutions. Use your skills to advocate, to innovate, and to act. Our generation has done its part but it’s your voice that will shape the future. Be that voice for the voiceless.

Behind California, it is also America’s second-largest producer of solar power, but it is catching up rapidly.
“Renewable energy is so important to rural Texas,” says John Davis, another rancher and a former member of the Texas House of Representatives.
No, it’s clean power, it’s renewable power, it’s economics.
The group’s polling in March showed 64pc of Republican voters in Texas favour renewable energy, up from 60pc two years earlier.","Bobby Helmers used to be an oilman.

For years, he worked leasing land for petroleum companies and at one point had as many as nine oil wells on his ranch in West Texas.

But those wells have long been plugged up.

“It’s not that I was dissatisfied with the oil,” says Helmers. “It’s just that production was depleting. They became no longer economically feasible.”

Now, instead, the 84-year-old Trump voter has six wind turbines spinning on his ranch.

Standing 300ft high, they make up the north-eastern end of a 76-turbine farm that stretches into the distance and is owned by French utilities company Engie, which pays Helmers handsomely for the privilege.

“If you’re talking about bottom-line dollars, the wind turbines make more for the ranch than the cattle do,” says Helmers. “They’re a blessing.”

His shift to renewables may seem surprising, especially given that he lives in the largest oil-producing state in the largest oil-producing country in the world.

But the free-market, Republican region has also now become far and away America’s biggest generator of renewable energy, as well as producing nearly 43pc of all US crude.

Last year, the state generated 124,934 gigawatt hours of wind energy, enough to power 11.6 million homes and nearly three times the second-largest wind-producing state.

Behind California, it is also America’s second-largest producer of solar power, but it is catching up rapidly.

Between 2020 and 2024, California’s solar output jumped by 67pc. In Texas, the increase was 338pc.

Its wind and solar output combined is nearly double the Golden State’s, and so far this year, nearly half of Texas’s electricity was powered by clean energy.

The numbers are testament not to government mandates but to what is the most aggressively competitive electricity market in America.

Texas has its own grid, a granular, location-based pricing system and no utility monopolies.

The result is an abundance of clean, cheap power fuelling strong economic growth in Texas, with many Republicans supportive of the shift away from oil.

However, their backing is now being put to the test as Donald Trump wages war on America’s clean energy sector.

After returning to the White House with a promise to “drill, baby, drill”, the US president has dismissed wind farms as “junk” and referred to them dismissively as “windmills”.

He is now planning to fund his “big beautiful bill” by gutting America’s green energy industry, stripping away credits to fund a barrage of tax cuts.

Economists predict the move will cost Texas more than $50bn (£37bn) in lost economic growth over a decade, putting the president on a collision course with some of his core supporters.

“Renewable energy is so important to rural Texas,” says John Davis, another rancher and a former member of the Texas House of Representatives.

“And these are Republican voters. They’re alienating their own base. They’re going against their very own voters.”

Free-market power

Visiting Texas’s latest solar farm means driving through the Permian Basin, America’s largest oilfield.

For miles, on either side of the road north of a town called Big Spring, hundreds of oil pump-jacks are visible across vast fields of mesquite trees.

Their pickaxe-shaped heads dip slowly up and down as they extract crude oil from underground wells. Located among them, as far as the eye can see, are hundreds of wind turbines.

While oil and gas production is still dominant in Texas, the Hornet Solar Farm, which became fully operational in April, is emblematic of the state’s renewable energy boom.

Hornet consists of 1.3m solar panels that, in 12,000 rows, span an acreage 11 times the size of London’s Hyde Park. They produce 600 megawatts of electricity – nearly double the output of the largest solar farm in the UK.

The farm is so large that its owner, Vesper Energy, has installed a herd of 2,140 sheep that can be seen trotting beneath the panels, tasked with keeping vegetation at bay.

This is in addition to five people employed as full-time mowers. And Vesper is already working on plans to expand the farm further.

“Texas, in general and especially this area of West Texas, has all the elements you look for in a perfect solar project,” says Zach Wald, Vesper’s vice president of engineering, procurement and construction.

It is not just about the amount of sun, but the quality of the transmission system, the speed of the planning system, and the openness among locals to this kind of development, says Wald: “There’s a community that’s positive and wants it.”

As well as boasting sun and wind, Texas also has a growing population that requires power.

But another driving factor in attracting renewable energy companies is the free market.

“In Texas, there is no push for renewable energy,” says Nick Chaset, the chief executive of Octopus Energy US, the American arm of Britain’s largest energy supplier, which launched in the US five years ago in Houston. “It’s purely markets, may the cheapest resource win.”

Politically, Texas and California couldn’t be further apart, especially on net zero. However, both states have embraced clean power, albeit for different reasons.

“Texas and California have diametrically opposed political rhetoric,” says Chaset. “California is very much net zero or nothing. It’s about trying to construct a perfect world, [which means] it becomes extremely expensive.

“That dynamic mimics the UK a bit. It’s very high-minded, but actually not necessarily delivering the desired outcome.”

The challenge facing California is that its energy costs are some of the highest in the country, despite boasting plenty of solar power and battery storage.

By contrast, Texas has lower costs because of its agnostic, free-market approach to net zero, as well as a dearth of regulation.

“You just have to fulfil your energy obligations to your consumers, and because you’re competing, you’re trying to do it at the least cost,” says Chaset.

A kilowatt hour of power for a Texas homeowner in April cost 15.55 cents (12p), according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), compared with 31.55 cents in California.

Another key aspect that sets Texas apart is that it has its own grid, run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot).

Crucially, unlike other states that also have their own grids such as California, Texas is not tied to the Eastern or Western interconnectors.

This means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) has no role in Texas’s transmission market, meaning local officials are free to set the state’s power policies as they wish.

“The benefit of that is agility,” says Pablo Vegas, the Ercot chief executive.

This means that decisions can be made without federal consent, taking years off the approval process.

“We operate probably the most pure competitive electric market in the United States,” says Vegas.

While in Britain, the grid has one price nationally, Ercot has 17,000 “nodes”.

“That is effectively 17,000 different mini-markets across the state,” says Guy Newey, the chief executive of the Energy Systems Catapult in the UK.

While other parts of the US operate capacity markets, which means operators are paid for providing capacity to meet peak demand, Texas operates an “energy-only” market. This means operators are only paid for the electricity they provide to the grid.

Every five minutes, in every node, each power plant in Texas bids a price for the electricity that it can deliver to Ercot. Ercot then dispatches the cheapest energy into the grid first.

As the generators are only paid for what they send into the grid, there is a major incentive to be cheap.

“It set up its markets to be cut-throat,” says Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas.

By contrast, in many other parts of the US, there is no competition at all, says Rhodes.

“In the south-east US, they’re a fully regulated monopoly utility,” he says. “The same company owns all the generators and the power lines, and they’re the ones you pay your bill to at the end of the month.”

Rewards for keeping costs down help the renewables sector, where projects are cheaper and quicker to build than new gas power stations.

“This is all getting built in Texas, not because solar and storage are green, but because it is simply the most cost-effective and fastest,” says Chaset.

Theoretically, this pricing system creates more financial risk for renewable energy companies operating in Texas compared to the UK, where the British Government protects against price volatility with so-called contracts for difference.

This extra risk is more than outweighed, however, by the speed and agility of Texas’s planning system, says Newey.

This is aided by the fact that 97pc of the land in Texas is privately owned, meaning landowners can largely sell up to whomever they want.

Renewables-loving Republicans

John Davis was approached three times before he finally agreed to let an energy company build seven turbines on his Stoney Lonesome Ranch – land that has been in his family since 1880.

The first couple of times, Davis turned them down because he did not like the look of wind turbines. “We thought they were big monstrosities,” he says.

But six years ago, he relented and now takes great pride in the 500ft turbines turning above his herd of Wagyu cows and their calves.

“I think they look majestic,” says Davis. “It shows we’re part of the new clean power that’s sustainable and it’s great for kids growing up in rural communities to see that you can do renewable power.”

As for what triggered his Damascene conversion, the 65-year-old grins before responding: “They get a lot prettier when they start paying you money. I can be bought.”

Leasing his land for wind turbines now produces around 40pc of Davis’s income, meaning he is far less reliant on the volatility of cattle farming.

“That is significant because I don’t have to maintain them,” says the rancher. “I don’t have to water them, or feed them, or castrate them.”

As a result, he has been able to reinvest in the ranch and use some of the money to build a community area in the town that hosts a weekly farmers market. “People can strike oil, we happened to strike wind,” says Davis.

This flexibility highlights how conservatives in Texas have long favoured the development of a wide range of power sources, regardless of Trump’s anti-green agenda.

The seeds of Texas’s wind boom began in 1999, when then-governor George W Bush scrapped the state’s electricity monopolies and called for more wind power.

This was then followed by a decision in 2005 by Rick Perry, Bush’s successor and Trump’s energy secretary during his first term, to push through the Texas Utilities Code.

This designated Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (Crez), which enabled transmission lines to be connected to windy areas before contracts were signed with developers.

Davis was serving in the Texas House of Representatives when both bills were passed. “All the Republicans supported it,” he says.

“Even though we are an oil state, we were all saying, ‘We have a lot of sun, we have a lot of wind – that’s a good thing.’”

However, he insists he is anything but a net zero fanatic.

“We don’t like to call it green energy, because that is affiliated with AOC,” Davis adds, referring to Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“If you say green energy, people think you’re just a tree-hugger. No, it’s clean power, it’s renewable power, it’s economics. I’m not doing it to try to save the Earth.”

Ironically, one key driver of demand in Texas’s renewable energy sector is oil and gas, as shale production in the Permian Basin uses vast amounts of electricity.

Yet in Texas’s last biannual legislative sessions, which adjourned in June, some Republican lawmakers brought forward a series of bills designed to curb the renewable energy rollout by introducing new regulatory requirements and fees.

“The anti-renewable Right in Texas is starting to look a lot like the California pro-clean energy Left,” says Chaset. “They both think the government must make all decisions and mandate this and that. In both cases, it’s top-down decision making.”

Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation (CTEI), a group formed six years ago to advocate for an “all of the above” approach to energy, lobbied hard against the measures, alongside many landowners. Davis is himself a member. The Republican House rejected the bills.

CTEI is part of the Conservative Energy Network, a group that spans 25 states in America trying to advance free-market clean energy policies.

The group’s polling in March showed 64pc of Republican voters in Texas favour renewable energy, up from 60pc two years earlier. Only 22pc are against.

Opposition to renewable energy generation in Texas is typically based on objections to the appearance of wind and solar farms, as well as concerns that they rely too much on subsidies, says Matt Welsh, CTEI’s state director.

Others also point to their intermittency.

Storm Uri, which dumped record amounts of snow on Texas in February 2021 and triggered the worst energy infrastructure crisis in the state’s history, leaving 4.5 million people without power, has left a troubled legacy.

At the time, Texas governor Greg Abbott claimed the power blackouts were because “wind and solar got shut down”.

In reality, wind turbines did freeze, but so did Texas’s gas wells and coal power pipes.

Altogether, more fossil fuel power went offline than renewables, but the narrative blaming renewables stuck.

“That has been disproved, yet it got ingrained and started this gradual doubt about the value of wind and solar,” says Welsh.

War on the ‘windmills’

As for Trump, he has expressed consistent opposition to renewable energy.

“I don’t want windmills destroying our place,” the president said as he prepared to sign his “big beautiful bill” this month. “I don’t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up half a mountain and they’re ugly as hell.”

For once, his bite may be worse than his bark.

The bill will claw back more than $500bn in subsidies and tax credits implemented under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Within this, the one that matters the most for the renewables sector is the bill’s measure to eliminate tax credits for clean electricity production and investment for projects starting after 2027, worth around $250bn over the next decade.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM.” Trump wrote on Truth Social in June.

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world.”

Federal subsidies for renewable energy have certainly increased the price advantage that renewable energy producers have selling electricity into Ercot, says Vegas.

Of course, America’s fossil fuel industry also gets massive subsidies to the tune of tens of billions per year.

However, these subsidies do not flow directly through to the real-time market price for consumers in the same way that they do for renewables, says Vegas.

Wind farms get production tax credits for every megawatt they produce. “That is real-time revenue that can be priced into their economic dispatch,” says Vegas.

As a result, the sudden loss of the tax credits means that fewer projects will be built and household energy bills will rise.

According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the bill means Texas will miss out on about 77 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity over the next decade, compared to the current trajectory. This will mean $52bn in lost GDP growth and a net loss of 94,000 jobs.

It will also add 23pc to consumer energy prices and 54pc to industrial energy prices over the next decade, says O’Brien.

This is after accounting for inflation. By 2030, annual household energy bills in Texas will be $220 higher because of the bill. By 2035, the extra cost will be $480.

“Instead of seeing prices come down as we add renewables, we’re seeing prices go up because of the bill,” says O’Brien.

Although it increases subsidies for oil and gas, fossil fuel production cannot be raised quickly enough to fill the hole left by fewer renewables.

“I am actually a proponent of phasing out the tax credits,” says Doug Lewin, the president of Stoic Energy Consulting. “But actually phasing them out, with a ramp over 20 years as opposed to this cliff.

“Because what is mangled at the bottom of the cliff are consumers in the American economy. And if you’re truly conservative from a market perspective, you should be in favour of phasing out oil and gas subsidies too.”

“It’s going to raise the cost of building things and it’s going to slow down the build-out,” says Aaron Zubaty, chief executive of Eolian, an investor behind several energy projects in Texas. “Then less stuff will be built.”

Such concerns are being raised amid a radical policy shift in government.

This month, Doug Burgum, Trump’s interior secretary, announced that renewable energy projects would only be allowed to progress on public lands if he or his deputy had personally approved them.

“What we have already seen is projects that are really good that we’ve been developing for a very long time have had their permits denied in the last few weeks, very surprisingly,” says Zubaty.

“We are already seeing multiple projects, tens of millions of dollars of investment, that within the last two weeks we are going to have to walk away from.”

One now mothballed project was a 150-megawatt solar project in Virginia.

Unsurprisingly, Davis is frustrated by the policy shift and the anti-renewables rhetoric.

“Rural Texas doesn’t have very much economic development,” he says.

“That’s what just doesn’t make any sense, and that makes me frustrated as a conservative, as a Republican, as a rancher. My own party, it’s like they’re turning against us. It’s wrong-headed.”

Complaints of this nature are emerging in the wake of horrific flash floods that killed 137 people in Texas this month, sparking outcry over Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service.

However, regardless of grumbles, Trump knows that he can probably still count on Texas for support.

While he disagrees with the president over renewable energy cuts, Davis says in no way will they be enough to stop him from voting Republican.

Even so, he’ll keep fighting his case.

“Wind just makes sense,” says Davis. “For me, I can’t think of anything more conservative than to use what God gave us, wind and power.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000433171358_17534351152250_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-07-27 02:58:50.062637

Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.
“The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports.
United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.
“Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them.","The global switch to renewable energy has passed a “positive tipping point” where solar and wind power will become even cheaper and more widespread, according to two United Nations reports released Tuesday, describing a bright spot amid otherwise gloomy progress to curb climate change.

Last year, 74 per cent of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the UN’s multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5 per cent of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024.

The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar power now is 41 per cent cheaper and wind power is 53 per cent cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.

“The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. “We are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.”

“Just follow the money,” Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was US$2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about US$800 billion more than in fossil fuels.

Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough.

The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China — where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy — as well as countries such as India and Brazil.

Yet Africa represented less than two per cent of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.

“The Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts,” said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable.

The UN reports are “right on the money,” said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn’t part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable.

And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to US$620 billion, compared to US$70 billion for renewables, the UN report said.

But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that’s because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centres and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world.

“A typical AI data centre eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,” Guterres said. “By 2030 data centres could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.”

So Guterres called on the world’s major tech firms to power data centres completely with renewables by 2030.

In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3 per cent per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since US President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration cut many federal renewable energy programmes, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.

Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically.

“Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets,” Guterres said.

Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, “there are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.”

David Waskow of the World Resources Institute said the message of problems mixed with optimism makes sense. He compared Tuesday’s assessment to climbing a mountain and taking time halfway through to look down and appreciate how far you’ve come. But a look up shows the trek is getting steeper.

Guterres said he understands how young people could have a sense of “doom and gloom,” and regrets what his generation has left them — but all is not lost.

“This is not inevitable. We have the tools, the instruments, the capacity to change course,” Guterres said. “There are reasons to be hopeful.”",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/07/27/3191480/8342042.jpg?itok=7tzDfrm9,N,,2025-07-27 01:59:06.704414

Tesla's big swing moment is not just a test of engineering and execution—it's a defining chapter in the company's evolution.","In the summer of 2025, Tesla finds itself at a crossroads. The electric vehicle pioneer, once synonymous with market dominance, now faces a confluence of challenges: a 10% year-over-year drop in U.S. EV sales, a 13% global delivery decline, and the impending expiration of federal EV tax credits. Meanwhile, competitors like General Motors and BYD are closing the gap, and Chinese automakers are reshaping the global EV landscape. Yet, amid these headwinds, Tesla's leadership—CEO Elon Musk chief among them—has staked the company's future on three ambitious bets: robotaxi, Optimus, and the Tesla Semi. These projects, if successful, could redefine Tesla's role in the global economy. If they fail, the company risks becoming a relic of the EV era it once defined.

The Robotaxi Gambit: A $75 Billion Bet on Autonomy

Tesla's robotaxi service, currently in a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, is the most audacious of these bets. Priced at $6.90 per ride, the service is projected to generate $1 billion in 2026 and scale to $75 billion by 2030, assuming regulatory and technical hurdles are overcome. This vision hinges on two critical factors: regulatory approvals in key markets like California and Europe, and public trust in Tesla's camera-only autonomy system.

The robotaxi is more than a mobility service—it's a platform for AI-driven data collection and refinement. With 500,000+ Tesla vehicles on the road already generating real-world driving data, the company has a unique edge in training its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. However, delays in deploying FSD globally (due to regulatory fragmentation) and technical challenges in achieving full autonomy could derail timelines. For instance, Tesla's inability to secure approval in California by mid-2025 has already pushed back its plan to cover half the U.S. population with robotaxi by year-end.

Investors must weigh the potential of robotaxi against Tesla's current financial realities. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report revealed a 12% year-over-year revenue drop and a 16% plunge in net income, driven by waning EV tax credits and rising competition. Yet, if robotaxi achieves its 2030 revenue target, it would represent 45% of Tesla's total vehicle revenue that year, potentially offsetting declines in core EV sales.

Optimus: The Humanoid Robot with $10 Trillion in Long-Term Potential

Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, unveiled in 2023, is another moonshot. Designed to handle repetitive tasks in manufacturing and beyond, Optimus is expected to begin factory operations by late 2025. The production roadmap is aggressive: 10,000 units in 2024, 100,000 units annually by 2026, and 100 million units by 2030. At scale, production costs could fall below $20,000 per unit, with market pricing likely higher due to demand.

The market potential is staggering. Analysts estimate that capturing just 1% of the $25 trillion global automation market could generate $250 billion in revenue by 2030. Optimus's success, however, depends on Tesla's ability to scale production efficiently and ensure the robots meet safety and performance standards. Early adopters in manufacturing and logistics will be critical, but skeptics question whether the technology can transition from controlled environments to broader consumer markets.

The Tesla Semi: A Delayed Promise in a Crowded Market

The Tesla Semi, first unveiled in 2017, has become a symbol of the company's struggle to balance ambition with execution. Production is now expected to begin in late 2025 at Tesla's Nevada gigafactory, with annual capacity targeting 50,000 units. However, the Semi's economics have deteriorated: its price has surged from $150,000 to over $350,000, undermining its total cost of ownership (TCO) advantages. Early adopters like Ryder have cut orders and extended delivery timelines, citing “dramatic changes to product economics.”

The Semi must also contend with a rapidly evolving market. Rivals like BYD, Freightliner, and Volvo already operate electric Class 8 trucks in the U.S., offering real-world performance data and customer testimonials. Tesla's delays have allowed these competitors to capture early adopters, while U.S. tariffs on Chinese components have further complicated production planning. For the Semi to succeed, it must deliver not just performance but a compelling value proposition in a market where TCO is king.

Strategic Implications: Balancing Risk and Reward

Tesla's pivot to AI, robotics, and autonomy is a high-stakes bet. If robotaxi and Optimus achieve their projected growth, they could generate $300 billion in combined revenue by 2030, dwarfing the company's current EV sales. The energy segment, meanwhile, is a stabilizing force, with Tesla deploying 9.6 gigawatt-hours of storage in Q2 2025 and on track to generate $3.5 billion in annual gross profit by 2026.

Yet, the risks are equally profound. Regulatory delays, technical bottlenecks, and public skepticism could stall robotaxi's rollout. Optimus's transition from factory to consumer markets is unproven. And the Semi's high price point and crowded field make it a long shot to recapture lost EV market share.

Investment Advice: Navigating the Uncertainty

For investors, Tesla's current valuation—142 times projected profits—reflects high expectations. This premium is justified if the company executes on its moonshot bets but could become a liability if it misses key milestones. A prudent strategy might involve:

Hedging against regulatory and technical risks by diversifying exposure to other EV and AI stocks (e.g., Waymo, Boston Dynamics).

Monitoring robotaxi's regulatory progress in California and Europe, which could catalyze or derail its growth.

Assessing Optimus's scalability through production timelines and early adopter feedback.

In the short term, Tesla's stock may face volatility as it navigates Q3 2025's tax credit expiration and Q4's post-holiday market adjustment. Long-term, however, the company's success will hinge on whether its bets on autonomy and robotics pay off—transforming Tesla from an EV maker into a cornerstone of the AI and automation era.

Tesla's big swing moment is not just a test of engineering and execution—it's a defining chapter in the company's evolution. For those willing to tolerate the risks, the rewards could be life-changing. For others, the lesson may be that even the most visionary companies must adapt to stay ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:35.938870

The gathering, the second of its kind, was organized by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and brought together business leaders, government officials and other representatives from Japan, India and ISA member nations.
Of those, India and Japan are two of the largest economies and are widely seen as leaders in global solar and solar-linked technologies.
In 2022, the two countries launched a Clean Energy Partnership, with the goal of expanding cooperation on clean energy and energy security.
“It guts clean energy tax credits, kills American jobs and ships them overseas, raises electricity bills for families and small businesses, and weakens our energy independence,” said Andrew Reagan, president of the nonprofit Clean Energy for America, in a press release.","The latest data has made it official — India overtook Japan in 2023 to become the world’s third-largest generator of solar energy.

But at the International Solar Festival held at the Osaka Expo earlier this month, the focus wasn’t on competition but rather how India and Japan can partner to grow solar capacity together.

The gathering, the second of its kind, was organized by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and brought together business leaders, government officials and other representatives from Japan, India and ISA member nations. The goal was to tell the story of solar and its potential as a driver of economic growth to visitors from around the world.

“We wanted to have the International Solar Festival in Osaka because one of the key challenges is on getting the private sector to look at new frontier solar technologies, which is linked to the question of how Japan and India can collaborate meaningfully,” said Ashish Khanna, the director-general of the ISA.

The ISA, founded in 2015 at COP21 in Paris and based in India, has more than 100 member countries. Of those, India and Japan are two of the largest economies and are widely seen as leaders in global solar and solar-linked technologies.

In addition to promoting tech to the private sector, the alliance also seeks to address another challenge — the lack of progress on expanding solar generation and production in developing countries, despite massive potential. Case in point, the most recent analysis from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found that Asia, Europe and North America accounted for 90% of renewable capacity growth in 2024.

“Bridging the divide and closing the investment gap between countries and regions is critical,” said Francesco La Camera, IRENA’s director-general, in an emailed statement.

Expanding partnerships

The ISF in Osaka was just the latest in a series of energy- and climate-related discussions between Japan and India. In 2022, the two countries launched a Clean Energy Partnership, with the goal of expanding cooperation on clean energy and energy security.

India also joined the Japan-led Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI) in 2023. More recently, talks are ongoing about India becoming the next country eligible to receive funds under Japan’s joint crediting mechanism (JCM), one of the largest state-led carbon credit and offset programs in the world.

“The JCM is expected to generate employment opportunities in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies,” said Shamkant Mirashi, an India-based sustainability consultant. “By subsidizing these technologies, Japan can help equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional polluting sources.”

Then, in 2024, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided funds to support Osaka Gas’ joint investment in renewable energy projects with India’s CleanMax.

Despite this, there’s still much more to be done, says Khanna, as overall bilateral investment and trade in solar have been limited. That, he hopes, will soon change.

“All partnerships take time,” Khanna said. “We want to see the R&D and manufacturing ecosystem of Japan marrying with the entrepreneurial talent and market of India, a harmonization of alignment. How this translates into concrete business opportunities is something that we would like to facilitate more.”

One challenge is that most major Japanese companies and financial institutions have yet to make large investments into solar technologies in India, which Khanna says is disappointing, as solar provides a safe, reliable investment opportunity.

“Japan has not exercised enough the financial muscle of its pension funds and institutional investors,” said Khanna. “The time is now ... to create an ecosystem by which more concrete investment decisions are made.”

Part of that reluctance could be the fact that major players in Japan and the government itself are not exactly all-in on solar energy.

One criticism of Japan’s approach, via entities such as AETI but also the Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) has been a focus on pushing alternative Japanese technologies such as ammonia and biomass co-firing, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Critics say these alternatives are either not viable, short-term solutions or would have limited impact in reducing emissions. But Khanna did not necessarily see these efforts as distracting from solar.

“I think the answer for that is not either/or, but and,” said Khanna. “Green hydrogen and ammonia have huge potential if the economics can be sorted out, and India can be a source of green hydrogen for Japan.”

The elephants in the room

Two notable countries were absent at the ISF — the United States and China. Despite their lack of engagement in the solar alliance, both countries, in their respective ways, cast a long shadow on the potential for Japan-India solar collaboration.

While the U.S. has the second-highest solar capacity in the world and, under the Inflation Reduction Act passed during the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, has made strides in solar and cleantech manufacturing, the world’s largest economy is seeing dramatic cutbacks in global climate support this year.

The main driver is the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose recent budget reconciliation law passed by Congress would reduce solar tax credits, part of a sudden shift away from support for renewable energy projects.

“It guts clean energy tax credits, kills American jobs and ships them overseas, raises electricity bills for families and small businesses, and weakens our energy independence,” said Andrew Reagan, president of the nonprofit Clean Energy for America, in a press release.

Efforts set up under the Biden administration, like a partnership with Japan focused on expanding technology and supply chains for floating offshore wind, look unlikely to continue.

Instead, amid trade tensions between the two countries, the U.S. has been pushing Japan to buy more of its liquefied natural gas. In fact, new trade tariffs also could limit the export of solar components and panels to the U.S., while the Trump administration prioritizes the domestic expansion of planet-warming fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

China, meanwhile, has been praised for its rapid domestic expansion of solar, adding more capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024. But the industry has numerous ethical concerns, including well-documented links to forced labor and human rights violations in the Uyghur homelands in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where many solar components are produced.

“There is a significant risk that that solar panels are being built with Uyghur forced labor, potentially across every stage: from quartz mining and polysilicon refinement to module construction and the development of the plant itself,” said Elfidar Iltebir, president of the nonprofit Uyghur American Association.

Chinese companies, backed by state subsidies and access to cheap energy and labor, have been able to undercut solar manufacturing in Europe and Japan. Even India’s attempts to expand domestic production have run into issues, and the country remains reliant on Chinese components.

Exploring new technologies

With those issues plaguing the industry in the world’s top two economies, tie-ups between countries such as India and Japan become all the more important.

For Khanna, one path forward might be developing alternatives to photovoltaics, the most common solar technology used today.

“If the industry is disrupted, that can itself become a source of diversification,” said Khanna. “Perovskite, for example, doesn't need silica or ingots, and solid state batteries may not need lithium. The current supply chain can become a new supply chain if these technologies can be commercialized, and there is clearly a role for India, Japan and other countries to collaborate.”

A model already exists, says Khanna. One of India’s leading foreign collaborators is Shizuoka Prefecture-based Suzuki, which partnered with India’s Maruti to build the country’s largest automaker, and have even released an electric car together.

“What will be the Suzuki for solar in India,” asked Khanna. “Suzuki transformed the automobile sector, by taking a bet. Who will take that bet, that private sector leadership, for solar?”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/07/27/483555.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2025-07-27 01:58:57.117918

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Associated Press

President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

A recent breakthrough study published in npj Sustainable Agriculture presents an innovative approach to achieving food sufficiency through the integration of renewable energy technologies specifically adapted for Arctic conditions. This pioneering research elucidates how harnessing wind, solar, and geothermal energy can overcome the logistical and climatic hurdles that have long impeded reliable food cultivation and supply chains in the far North.

The profound challenges of Arctic agriculture stem from its extreme cold, permafrost soil, prolonged darkness during winter months, and short growing seasons. Traditional agrarian practices are fundamentally unsuitable for this environment without significant energy inputs for heating, lighting, and infrastructure maintenance. The research team led by Hailu, Najm, and Aspholm examines how renewable energy infrastructures can serve as sustainable power sources to enable controlled-environment agriculture, such as greenhouses powered by wind turbines and photovoltaic systems designed to operate under polar conditions.

Central to the study is the recognition that Arctic communities suffer from chronic food insecurity exacerbated by high costs and the carbon footprint of food imports. The authors propose an integrated energy-food nexus, whereby local renewable energy generation can operationalize vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics within insulated structures that mitigate the impact of external climate variability. Their models demonstrate how hybrid renewable energy systems can maintain stable indoor climates while minimizing reliance on fossil fuels, thereby significantly reducing environmental impact and dependency on distant food supply chains.

Wind energy emerges as a particularly promising resource due to the Arctic’s persistent, strong wind currents. The researchers detail the engineering adaptations required for turbines to endure extreme cold, ice accumulation, and low sunlight visibility. Innovations such as cold-resistant lubricants, blade de-icing technologies, and reinforced structural components are critical to maintaining turbine performance and longevity. These advancements not only ensure steady electrical output for agricultural applications but also contribute to localized grid resilience.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, often underrated in polar zones due to limited winter insolation, gains new relevance when combined with energy storage systems and efficient demand management. The study highlights the importance of maximizing solar utilization during the extended summers, while relying on energy storage solutions — including advanced batteries and thermal energy storage — to bridge periods of darkness. The synergy between wind and solar generation creates a complementary system capable of delivering continuous power across fluctuating seasonal conditions.

Perhaps the most novel aspect of the research involves tapping into geothermal sources, which remain underexploited in Arctic locales despite the presence of sub-surface heat reservoirs. By integrating shallow geothermal heat pumps, the system can provide reliable baseline heating necessary for maintaining optimal growing temperatures year-round. This approach not only leverages a clean energy source particularly suited to permafrost regions but also ensures thermal stability critical for plant growth and aquaculture systems.

The authors employ comprehensive techno-economic analyses to assess the feasibility and scalability of these renewable energy systems for community-scale food production. Their findings suggest that initial capital expenditures are offset by long-term reductions in fossil fuel consumption, supply chain vulnerabilities, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the localized production enabled by renewables enhances food sovereignty and resilience against global supply disruptions — a factor increasingly vital amid geopolitical and climatic uncertainties.

Another dimension addressed by the investigation pertains to the socio-cultural implications of renewable-powered Arctic agriculture. The study acknowledges the importance of aligning technological deployment with indigenous knowledge systems and community priorities. Co-development strategies involving local stakeholders ensure that energy-food innovations are culturally appropriate, economically inclusive, and environmentally respectful, thus fostering holistic sustainability outcomes.

Technological integration extends beyond energy generation to include advances in smart farming techniques. The authors describe how sensor networks, AI-based monitoring, and automation can optimize resource use efficiency within Arctic greenhouses. Precision irrigation, nutrient delivery, and climate control minimize waste and adapt dynamically to changing environmental parameters, further enhancing the viability and productivity of northern food systems powered by renewables.

The environmental benefits of this approach resonate beyond food security. By drastically curbing fossil fuel dependency, renewable energy-driven Arctic agriculture offers a pathway to mitigating local contributions to climate change — creating a positive feedback loop where sustainable food systems also help preserve fragile polar ecosystems. The research highlights potential reductions in black carbon emissions and soil degradation, pivotal for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.

Policy implications emanating from the work underscore an urgent need for coordinated Arctic energy and food security strategies that prioritize renewable technology deployment. The authors recommend targeted investments, incentivization of green innovation, and the establishment of supportive regulatory frameworks to accelerate transitions toward clean, resilient food production infrastructures in northern communities.

Beyond the Arctic, the principles demonstrated by this study carry transformative potential for other extreme environments confronted with similar constraints on energy and agriculture. Deserts, high-altitude settlements, and isolated islands could adopt tailored renewable energy-food systems inspired by the Arctic model, contributing to global efforts to create more equitable and sustainable food networks.

The convergence of climate science, renewable energy engineering, and sustainable agriculture represented here marks a milestone in addressing the multifaceted challenges of northern food security. This interdisciplinary endeavor paves the way for new paradigms in how humanity can sustainably inhabit and thrive in the planet’s most extreme frontiers.

As the urgency of climate adaptation intensifies, this research offers a compelling vision where Greenland’s glaciers, Siberian tundra, and Canadian Arctic communities may transform from food-deficient zones into sources of nutritional self-reliance, powered purely by the winds, sunlight, and earth beneath their feet.

In sum, the work of Hailu and colleagues presents a comprehensive blueprint for harnessing Arctic renewable energy resources to deliver sustainable and sufficient food production. This promising fusion of cutting-edge energy technology with controlled-environment agriculture not only addresses immediate nutritional needs but also aligns with broader goals of environmental stewardship, cultural respect, and economic development in the circumpolar North.

The Arctic’s frozen landscape no longer needs to be a barrier to food security; through innovation and sustainability, it can become a beacon of humanity’s ability to adapt and flourish even in the harshest of climates. The future of Arctic food sufficiency lies at the intersection of wind turbines, solar arrays, geothermal heat pumps, and intelligent farming systems, heralding a new era of resilience and prosperity.

TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND

PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.

In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.

AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM’s territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.

Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.

While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.

Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center’s power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.

PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.

To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-27 00:11:42+00:00,Jalopnik,The Pros And Cons Of Buying A High Mileage EV - Jalopnik,Logan K. Carter,,,,,https://www.jalopnik.com/1921830/pros-cons-buying-high-mileage-ev/,"Ten years ago, buying a used EV was a much riskier prospect since many of the early EVs had very low maximum ranges when new and less efficient battery cooling methods.
Buying a used EV, in most cases, means you will spend less money on repairs, less time at the shop, and less headache surrounding upkeep.
The cons of buying a used EV are difficult to predict, but statistics show that big issues are relatively uncommon.
Finally, make sure that the EV you are looking to purchase has all of its necessary charging accoutrements like charging cables and adapters.
To ensure the smoothest possible experience when purchasing a used EV, make sure the car you are buying has its charging cables.","Buying a used EV is a great way to save money, since most EVs depreciate at a higher rate than internal combustion vehicles and hybrids, but there are some important things to look out for. Fortunately, in the latter half of the year 2025, EVs have been relatively mainstream for around 15 years now, and their technology has improved at a rapid rate.

Ten years ago, buying a used EV was a much riskier prospect since many of the early EVs had very low maximum ranges when new and less efficient battery cooling methods. Over the course of several years and hundreds of charge cycles, those two factors led to significant battery degradation, and those low maximum ranges dropped down to barely usable levels for most drivers. The best option in that case was to pay to have a battery replaced, which oftentimes would cost more than the value of the car.

Newer EVs have longer ranges to begin with, and their superior battery cooling systems and more sophisticated battery management systems preserve the health of their batteries more effectively so battery replacements are a less-common occurrence. Here are some important things to consider when shopping for a high-mileage EV.

One of the best things about used EVs, as I already noted, is that they tend to depreciate faster than cars with more traditional powertrains like gas and even hybrids. Now, that isn't a good thing for the first owner of the car if they bought it when it was new, but it's great for the second or third owner who gets a screaming deal on a relatively new car.

Another benefit is that EVs have a fraction of the moving parts that gas-powered cars have. The drivetrain of gas-powered cars have over 2,000 moving parts that are likely to wear out or break over the course of several thousands of miles, where EV drivetrains have around 20 moving parts. If you've owned a high-mileage gas-powered car, you're likely familiar with how many tiny parts can suddenly go wrong, and how repairs can suddenly add up to significant sums of money. Buying a used EV, in most cases, means you will spend less money on repairs, less time at the shop, and less headache surrounding upkeep.

The cons of buying a used EV are difficult to predict, but statistics show that big issues are relatively uncommon. The primary concern is high-voltage battery longevity, which many recent studies have shown is very rarely an issue. The easiest way to determine the battery health of a used EV is to check the car's predicted maximum range on a full charge. If the car shows a maximum range prediction that's significantly lower than the car's EPA estimated maximum range, then the battery may be in poor condition. Modern EVs with liquid-cooled battery packs and advanced battery management systems rarely experience degradation significant enough to warrant a costly battery replacement, even over the course of hundreds of thousands of mies and upward of 15 years of use. A recent study by a UK-based vehicle telematics company shows that on average, EVs lose about 1.8% of their maximum range per year, and that most battery packs last between 15 and 20 years, so it's not a big concern yet since most EVs are newer than that.

Charging speeds are another concern to take into account; EV technology has rapidly progressed, so older EVs tend to have slower charging speeds than new ones. In day-to-day drives, the average American drives under 50-miles per day, so daily charging shouldn't be a necessity for most EVs. It's important to take into consideration your intended use-case and charging solution when shopping for an EV; if you travel long distances on a daily basis and cannot charge your vehicle at home each night or at your place of work, then maybe an EV isn't the right choice for you. Reliance on the public charging network can be burdensome, and if you plan to rely on the public charging system, then it will be important to consider the maximum rate of charge that an EV can achieve, since some can charge much faster than others. The same goes for new EVs though, so this issue isn't isolated to used or high-mileage EVs.

Many EVs are capable of over-the-air software updates, and some of their features can be dependent upon a monthly or annual subscription model, either of which could become outdated or no-longer supported by the manufacturer. If the EV you're shopping for has these features, it's important to confirm with the seller and make sure that you have the necessary log-in credentials, as well as confirm that the car has the most updated software possible. Some cars may require a dealer visit to receive updates, but this is not an issue that's unique to EVs; many modern internal combustion vehicles have the same requirements.

Finally, make sure that the EV you are looking to purchase has all of its necessary charging accoutrements like charging cables and adapters. New EVs usually come with charge cables to allow you to plug them in at home, or adapters that allow access to different public chargers. To ensure the smoothest possible experience when purchasing a used EV, make sure the car you are buying has its charging cables.

As with all other cars, there's no foolproof way to confirm that the used electric vehicle you're looking to purchase will run trouble-free for years. It's important to do research on the car you're considering, so use all sources possible to conduct that research including online forums and YouTube videos from long-term owners. Both of these sources are great ways to get first-hand information about what to expect from long-term ownership of the specific car you're looking to buy.

Many EVs have long warranties on their electric powertrains and batteries, and some companies allow these eight-to-10 year warranties are transferrable for the second owner and sometimes third owners, too. If you're concerned about an EV's long-term battery life, look for used EVs that are produced by companies that honor their powertrain warranties beyond the first owner of the car. Beyond factory warranties, you can also search for aftermarket warranties that can cover costly repairs, but again, do your research on the aftermarket warranty before purchasing it to make sure it meets your needs.

It's important to weigh the pros and cons of buying a particular vehicle, whether it's an EV or not, so do your research, make sure you have a reliable charging solution, and rest easy knowing that you've done everything in your power to make an informed decision.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-pros-and-cons-of-buying-a-high-mileage-ev/l-intro-1753452950.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:50.132755

The legislation extended tax cuts enacted in his first term, funds his concepts for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and slashes federal support for the social safety net to make up for revenue lost in the tax cuts.
Groups such as the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office said the tax cuts in the new law will add $2 trillion or more to the federal deficit over the next decade.
Those work requirements will impact 1 in 5 people nationally, said FranSha Anderson, executive director for the Arkansas State Independent Living Council.
""These Medicaid cuts are forever,"" Gess said.","Lynn Foster is certain the cuts to programs included in the tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month means the end of bird and bee tracking.

That may sound silly to some, Foster said, but the work done by the Environmental Protection Agency in placing bands on birds and following the migration of bees informs officials about the impact of projects on the environment. That work helped preserve habitats along the Mississippi Flyway migration route, a large funnel traversed by birds during annual migrations and studied by scientists, Foster said.

""That's how we get more knowledge than we have,"" Foster said.

Foster was one of five speakers addressing a town hall at the Central Arkansas Library System's Fletcher Library on North Buchanan Street. The event, attended by about 35 people in person and live streamed, was put on by Citizens First Congress, a coalition of 68 member organizations representing 32,000 people, and Arkansas Public Policy Panel, which focuses on social and economic issues.

The groups aim to have people contact members of Congress as appropriations bills to fund or cut the budget for programs as outlined in the bill signed by Trump on July 4 are written between now and the fall. It was one of a series of town halls around the country as part of the Families First: 50-State Day of Peaceful Action in opposition to the legislation.

The legislation extended tax cuts enacted in his first term, funds his concepts for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and slashes federal support for the social safety net to make up for revenue lost in the tax cuts. The full Arkansas congressional delegation backed the measure, which passed largely along partisan lines.

The Trump administration said the measure will lower the federal deficit and cut government spending. Groups such as the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office said the tax cuts in the new law will add $2 trillion or more to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Speakers talked about how the measure would reduce food benefits for the poor, slash Medicaid and impose expanded work requirements on recipients and push more money into immigration enforcement.

Immigration attorney Badria Mryyan, who works with the California-based Social Justice Collaborative, said people will see more raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents because the legislation increases funding for the agency.

The new law also allows local law enforcement, previously barred from making immigration-related arrests and conducting immigration investigations, to work more closely with ICE and make those arrests, she said.

""We're going to see more ICE raids,"" Mryyan said. ""We're going to see more ICE check-ins.""

The legislation also changes the work and reporting requirements for people on Medicaid, a joint federal-date program that helps cover costs for people with limited income and resources.

The new requirements mean Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month. The law will also require that people caring for a young child will have to apply for an exemption.

Those work requirements will impact 1 in 5 people nationally, said FranSha Anderson, executive director for the Arkansas State Independent Living Council.

Anderson told attendees at the town hall about her two children, who she described as disabled, noting that they both work, but may not qualify for Medicaid under the new requirements.

""Medicaid is a lifeline,"" Anderson said. ""I know it will be a harsh hit for me.""

And while benefits included in the bill, such as no tax on tips or overtime, expire in 2029, cuts to social programs have no expiration date, said Peter Gess, economic policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families.

""These Medicaid cuts are forever,"" Gess said.

In Arkansas, where 1 in 5 children are food insecure and 1 in 3 children in rural counties are in that situation, the new law will have a devastating impact, said Tomekia Moore, executive director for Arkansas Community Action Agencies Association.

The new law would remove $25 a month in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits from families, according to the Urban Institute. That's an average of $146 per month for families, the institute said in a report.

Cuts like those will hurt children who come from ""food insecure"" environments, Moore said.

""A hungry child doesn't learn. A hungry child doesn't grow,"" Moore said. ""A hungry child can't thrive.""

Protecting areas where birds migrate may not seem that important on the surface, Foster said, but Arkansas relies on tourism for parts of its economy. Across the board, the law will be bad for the state, Foster said.

""Arkansas benefits from a lot of these programs, but they won't be around,"" Foster said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/07/26/AP25185786516864_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:33.933977

Its anode-free lithium metal cells promise more range and faster charging speeds than traditional lithium-ion batteries.

The Volkswagen Group is going full steam forward with the development and commercialization of next-generation solid-state batteries for electric vehicles.

The VW Group’s battery subsidiary PowerCo will now provide $131 million to solid-state battery start-up QuantumScape. The new funding will go towards the development of a pilot production line in San Jose, the start-up said in a press release this week.

This amount is in addition to $130 million PowerCo promised to QuantumScape last year to license and mass produce solid-state cells using QuantumScape’s technology. However, the payments hinge on certain milestones and technical progress that the start-up has to reach.

The VW Group is among the largest backers of the start-up. Its partnership with QuantumScape dates back to 2012, and the German auto giant has a 17% stake in the battery start-up, worth about $459 million.

Under an updated, non-exclusive licensing agreement that the companies signed last year, PowerCo will be able to manufacture 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of solid-state cells per year, with the option to expand to 80 GWh—that much capacity is enough to power one million EVs per year.

PowerCo is building battery factories in Germany, Spain and Canada, which could also be some of the potential sites for the future mass production of solid-state cells.

Traditional lithium-ion batteries use a liquid chemical for the electrolyte to facilitate the movement of ions between charging and discharging cycles. Solid-state batteries swap that out for a solid electrolyte, often made of polymer, sulfides, oxides, or a ceramic-type material.

Battery companies believe this will unlock far more range, faster charging speeds, more performance and better fire safety. Moreover, QuantumScape’s QSE-5 cells are pretty unique compared to traditional lithium-ion cells.

It’s an anode-free lithium metal battery that uses a ceramic separator—the anode is the part of the battery that holds the charge when you plug in your EV. The anode is not pre-formed like traditional batteries—it’s created during the first charging cycle as the lithium ions deposit onto the current collector.

The whole point of this approach is getting rid of the expensive and dirty graphite—which is typically used to make anodes—and also simplifying manufacturing, reducing costs and improving energy density.

Quantumscape’s cells have an energy density of 305 watt-hours per kilogram, only slightly more than today’s lithium-ion cells which deliver between 200-300 wh/kg. The company says today's EVs which have 350 miles of range could get between 400 and 500 miles of range with the QSE-5 cells—although that number will vary depending on pack size.

It’s early to tell whether the Volkswagen Group’s huge bet on solid-state batteries will pay off. But the momentum is on their side, and these cells are closer to production than they have ever been.

Accident tolerant fuels may offer important technological advances to increase the safety of U.S. nuclear power plants. ATFs are being studied to determine their potential to perform better in normal operations and during transportation as well as in nuclear power plant accidents.

The NRC’s Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research recently released the report prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The Richland, Wash.-based PNNL is providing technical assistance about the proposed nuclear fuel and new fuel cladding designs that may replace current nuclear fuel rods made with zirconium-based alloys.

The 91-page highly technical report is called “Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation of Accident Tolerant Fuel Concepts” and outlines the latest information on fuel material properties and performance associated with storing and transporting spent nuclear fuel.

The federal government is evaluating the performance of nuclear power systems containing ATF. The NRC says the same performance requirements are being sought with irradiated ATF fuel as mandated for conventional zirconium alloy cladded uranium dioxide fuel.

3 Companies Testing New Nuclear Power Plant Fuels

The new report explores the current activities of the following companies in their developments with ATFs and fuel cladding designs:

Framatome—has tested cladding and enriched uranium fuel. It hopes to commercialize two ATF designs as part of the CEA-Framatome-EDF French nuclear fuel joint program. Framatome on July 17 opened its expanded operations in Lynchburg, Va. with a dedicated nuclear training center to support next-generation small and advanced reactor technologies. The company plans to hire 500 employees there.

Global Nuclear Fuels—has experimented with alloys, cladding and enriched uranium fuel. A joint venture led by General Electric, the company is working with GE to commercialize two ATF designs for use in boiling water nuclear reactors.

Westinghouse—has tested cladding and enriched uranium fuel. The company is simultaneously developing both near- and long-term ATF designs.

DOE Also Studying Innovations in Nuclear Reactor Fuels

The DOE is working on its Advanced Fuels Campaign with teams of researchers seeking new nuclear power plant fuels at five of its national laboratories. The federal collaborations are centered at the PNNL, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

According to DOE, ATFs offer several advantages over conventional nuclear energy fuel. ATFs are being developed to improve nuclear reactor safety “by maintaining structural integrity and reactor cooling for a longer duration during severe accident conditions,” DOE says. ATFs

Can withstand extreme heat/steam longer.

Last longer with better efficiently in a reactor core to possibly lengthen refueling from 1.5 years to 2 years while using 30% less fuel.

Generate less waste and lower fuel costs.

The main objective of the Advanced Fuels Campaign is to develop and use ATFs to significantly increase nuclear power performance and safety.

Further ATF Developments Expected

The NRC report also discussed whether its current regulations would apply to ATF storage and transportation. While it advised companies applying for licenses to provide justification data to support their applications, the NRC noted the federal government’s current regulatory framework for storing and transporting spent nuclear fuel would generally cover apply to ATFs.

The Frontiers Report 2025, released by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), highlights four critical areas where environmental degradation intersects with human vulnerability: legacy pollution, melting glacier microbes, undamming rivers and climate risks for an ageing population that is growing.

The report paints a vivid picture of how climate change is not only altering ecosystems but also exposing communities – especially the most vulnerable – to new and intensifying dangers. Some issues may be local or relatively small-scale issues today, but have the potential to become issues of regional or global concern if not addressed early, the report warned.

UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said action must be taken “to protect people, nature and economies from threats that will only grow with each passing year”.

Here’s what’s at stake and why it matters to all of us:

Melting glacier microbes

Climate scientists are saying many glaciers will not survive this century unless action is taking to slow the melting rate caused by climate change. That means those living downstream will face a tide of floods alongside threats posed by reactivated microbes in a warming cryosphere or frozen parts of the Earth.

Frozen in ice sheets, glaciers and permafrost are bacteria, fungi and viruses. While most are dead, some are dormant and some are active. As global temperatures hit record highs, these microorganisms will become more active in many ecosystems. Even if the melting can be slowed down by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, efforts must assess and prepare for possible threats from potential pathogens.

Also crucial is documenting and preserving cryospheric microorganisms, which can shed light on the history of climate and evolution, help in finding therapies for diseases and develop innovative biotechnologies.

Dismantling dams

In the Colombian Amazon, river water levels have dropped by up to 80 per cent, restricting access to drinking water and food supplies, leading to shuttering 130 schools, increasing children’s risk of recruitment, use and exploitation by non-State armed groups and resulting in increased respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and acute malnutrition among youngsters under age five.

Part of what is making the problem worse in Colombia and other hot spots around the world are the plethora of dams operating at a time when climate change is triggering droughts around the world. Drought is keeping more than 420,000 children out of school in Brazil, Colombia and Peru alone, according to a report by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

As such, there is a growing need to remove dams and other barriers to rehabilitate river ecosystems, a process increasingly initiated by local communities, Indigenous Peoples, women and youth. Rivers and streams can recover remarkably once barriers are gone, but other stressors, from pollution to climate change, need to be addressed in parallel. Understanding the restoration outcomes of barrier removal is necessary not only to guide future removals, but also to inform decisions about existing and future barriers.

Climate risks for the elderly

Older people face increased risks during extreme weather and suffer more from ongoing environmental degradation. As the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts ever more hot weather, the elderly are suffering disproportionately, as seen in rising numbers of deaths and illnesses amid recent heat waves around the world.

At the same time, the world’s ageing population is growing: the global share of people over 65 years old will rise from 10 per cent in 2024 to 16 per cent by 2050. Most of them will live in cities, where they will be exposed to extreme heat and air pollution and experience more frequent disasters.

Older people are already more at risk, so effective adaptation strategies will need to evolve to protect these older populations.

Legacy pollutants

Flooding has crippled communities in all regions of the world as the number of extreme weather events climb. Among the hidden dangers are legacy pollutants that have been secreted into the ground over time and released as extreme rainfall and floods wash away sediments and debris.

The Pakistan floods of 2010, flooding in the Niger Delta in 2012 and Hurricane Harvey off the coast of Texas in 2017 are all examples when floodwaters stirred up sediments, releasing heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants.

Evaluating sediments to understand hazards, rethinking flood protection to lean on nature-based solutions and investments in natural remediation of contaminated sediments are all options to deal with this problem.",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Collections/Embargoed/02-11-2023-UNEP-Kenya-drought-02.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 22:59:59.964647

Latin America faces huge challenges in waste management, but it also has innovative initiatives and committed communities.","From October 27th to 29th, Buenos Aires will host a key event for the future of the planet: the ISWA 2025 World Congress. With the participation of representatives from over 50 countries, the focus will be on solid waste and its role in the global environmental crisis. This year’s motto is clear: “Towards a future without waste or a planet with no future.”

Organized by the Argentine Solid Waste Association (ARS) and Messe Frankfurt, the meeting seeks answers to the triple planetary crisis: climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The challenge is to move towards concrete solutions from an inclusive and global perspective.

Circular economy, extended producer responsibility, and organic waste treatment are some of the topics on the agenda. Issues such as open-air dumps, textile waste management, and energy recovery will also be addressed. The goal is to build a waste system that does not generate negative impacts and promotes a regenerative economy.

Simultaneously, discussions will focus on financing mechanisms and innovation for sustainable projects. The event will offer workshops and sessions on initiatives like “Too Good To Waste,” promoted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which aims to accelerate the transition to more efficient management.

The link between waste and global warming

One of the central themes of the Congress will be the connection between waste and climate change. Poor waste management generates large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 80 times higher than carbon dioxide.

Although less persistent than CO₂ in the atmosphere, methane accounts for over 25% of the current global warming. Alongside livestock and the oil and mining industries, the accumulation of urban waste is one of its main sources.

Mitigating emissions of this gas is essential to halt the progress of the climate crisis. Therefore, the Congress will provide space for public policies and investments aimed at improving waste collection, separation, and treatment.

Promoting clean technologies, composting, biogas, and renewable energy derived from waste will be part of the explored solutions. These actions could help comply with the Global Methane Pledge: reducing its emissions by at least 30% by 2030.

What is the ISWA World Congress and why does it matter

The ISWA (International Solid Waste Association) World Congress is the most relevant international meeting on solid waste management. It has been held annually since 1972 and in 29 countries. Argentina hosted it for the first time in 2005, and now, two decades later, it does so again.

Its mission is to promote the exchange of knowledge, experiences, and strategies that help improve waste treatment worldwide. It also aims to strengthen cooperation among governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society to advance towards a circular economy.

During the event, spaces for debate will be created with the presence of experts, researchers, environmental leaders, and representatives of multilateral organizations. The sessions will focus on finding concrete solutions to local and global challenges.

Furthermore, the Congress seeks to promote sustainable investments, encourage inclusive policies, and foster responsible production and consumption models. All with a vision towards a cleaner, fairer, and more resilient future.

An opportunity to transform the future

The realization of the Congress in Buenos Aires represents a strategic opportunity for the region. Latin America faces huge challenges in waste management, but it also has innovative initiatives and committed communities.

The event can serve as a catalyst for more effective policies, regional integration, and international cooperation. With available knowledge and adequate political will, it is possible to build a management model that reduces impacts and creates opportunities.

In the face of a climate crisis scenario, every decision matters. How waste is managed can be part of the problem or part of the solution. This Congress invites us to rethink actions and bet on a more habitable planet.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/04/proyecto-de-reciclaje.jpg.webp,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:38.393946

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

Sarah Melotte and Julia Tilton // The Daily Yonder

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have “make-ready” incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that’s needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual report released in May. The report projects that the number of EVs on the road is expected to continue growing in the U.S. in 2025 and beyond, despite current political and trade headwinds imposed by the Trump administration.",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2025/07/tdy-mapping-fast-ev-ports-01.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:01:56.960221

One big difference between Hinkley and Sizewell, she argued, is that the design is now better understood and contracts will be tighter.","The power plant has been decades in the making, but the hard work starts now. So how will this megaproject be built, can it avoid the pitfalls of previous nuclear plants, and is it worth the money?

Sizewell C will comprise two nuclear reactors totalling 3.2GW — enough to power six million homes — with an expected 60-year lifespan. It will be a copy of Hinkley Point C, which is being built on the Somerset coast and uses a design from the French nuclear company EDF, the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR). Hinkley Point is overdue and over budget, while the EPR has been plagued by problems in other countries where it has been built. Small wonder, then, that some have asked whether replicating Hinkley is a good idea.

Rebuilding an industry

Pyke is here to tell people that copying Hinkley is exactly what we should be doing. “It’s better to build the thing you know how to build because … it will be cheaper.”

She added: “Hinkley was the first nuclear new-build for a generation … It has taken on the burden of relearning how to build nuclear in the UK.” Indeed, the last nuclear plant opened in the UK was Sizewell B in 1995. The B plant, still operational, will be next door to the new C plant.

Hinkley has helped build up a nuclear workforce that was in decline. Pyke recalled the first batch of university interns at Sizewell C. “The majority of them literally didn’t know that the UK had a nuclear industry. It had been that quiet,” she said.

How did it come to this? The industry fell into the doldrums after electricity was privatised in 1990. No private company was capable of taking on the risk of financing a new nuclear power station (Sizewell B was already in train). And the abundance of North Sea gas meant it was cheaper to build gas-fired power stations.

But by the 2010s, the need to wean ourselves off environmentally damaging fossil fuels had become more pressing. The government chose EDF to build Hinkley, but the project began construction before the design was fully finalised. EDF was on the hook for overruns as the budget spiralled to a staggering £46 billion (from an initial estimate of £18 billion).

When it came to Sizewell, a cash-strapped EDF was never going to take on such risk. So the government switched to a different type of financing model, called the “regulated asset base”, which means billpayers contribute to its construction cost up front, and the developer can make returns while it is being built.

The deal struck last week will see the government take a 45 per cent stake, with Canadian pension fund La Caisse holding 20 per cent, British Gas owner Centrica 15 per cent, EDF 12.5 per cent, and Amber Infrastructure the remaining 7.6 per cent.

The gargantuan cost will be 65 per cent funded by debt, and 35 per cent by equity. The government has pencilled in a total cost of £55 billion for contingency and inflation over the lifetime of the plant. Last week there was much noise around the fact that Sizewell’s price tag had ballooned from an estimate of £20 billion, in 2015 money. The new figure accounts for inflation and “some cost increase”, according to Pyke.

One big difference between Hinkley and Sizewell, she argued, is that the design is now better understood and contracts will be tighter. Many of Hinkley’s overruns were blamed on “cost-plus” contracts that allowed suppliers to ratchet up their bills. Pyke pointed to a recent deal for civil engineering at Sizewell: “It’s a contract which, roughly speaking, pays the contractors the actual cost of doing a day’s work. And it aligns profit to achieved milestones. So they’re not incentivised to run the job long.”

In any case, Pyke argued, talk of cost misses the point. Sizewell C will ultimately be an asset for the taxpayer. And the project will pay billions in tax over its lifespan. “The cost is an investment for society because it’s going to give us energy security and lower bills, as well as pay tax … it has much wider societal benefits.”

Amazon-style delivery

So how will Sizewell be built? Like Hinkley, it is in a remote spot that will require thousands of workers to be bussed in and out. The logistical challenges are nightmarish. The project will build accommodation for 2,500 workers, but will try to minimise the number of people who need to be on site daily.

An Amazon-style fulfilment centre will be constructed near Ipswich to hold equipment for each room in the power station, so that it can be installed in sequence, rather than the stop-start fashion at Hinkley, according to Pyke. “We’re having everything made early and stored. We have the time to quality check everything, assemble it in the right configurations and then have it delivered in its grouped configuration, sort of like Ikea.”

About 60 per cent of Sizewell’s materials will be transported by rail and ship, with a new jetty on the beach. Sizewell C will source 70 per cent of its goods from the UK, Pyke said, and pour millions into establishing a new further education college, a new rail station, and nature reserves to offset the damage of construction. Sizewell is expected to create 7,900 jobs during peak construction. Polling by Sizewell suggests 70 per cent of people in the east of England recognise it will be a boon for employment. Yet many locals are implacably opposed.

Alison Downes, executive director of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said that as a group, they had always tried to emphasise the wider problems with the project, beyond their self-interest. “One former EDF chief executive described the EPR design as too complicated — almost unbuildable,” she said. “The long delays at EPRs elsewhere in the world, the massive cost overruns, suggest that this project will be very difficult to build. And the Sizewell site is complex. Any savings are likely to be frittered away in more complicated groundworks.”

‘A super investment’

The actual cost of the electricity Sizewell will generate remains unclear. The government believes it could reduce Britain’s energy costs by up to £2 billion a year. Ultimately the goal is to provide steady, always-on power at times when wind or solar dips.

“Nuclear provides firm capacity and it has a very high load factor, meaning that it runs almost 24 hours a day,” explained Victor Yip, research associate at Aurora Energy Research. More big nuclear is needed, he added: “We have old gas plants that are retiring, while 85 per cent of the existing nuclear fleet will retire by 2028.” But there are clear drawbacks, he said. “Nuclear is really expensive and it takes a significant amount of underwriting to get these projects to the finish line.”

Indeed, the government has had to keep private investors sweet by capping their liabilities for any cost overruns beyond a certain level. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, said last week that even in the most pessimistic scenario, his company would make a 10 per cent return. “This is, I think, a super investment… there’s a lot to like about this project,” O’Shea told analysts last week. “We could increase [our] stake in the future.”

Much will hinge, of course, on whether Sizewell hits its targets. Here Pyke’s words sound like a hostage to fortune: “We’re aiming to bring it in as early as we can in the mid to late 2030s and we’re aiming to get it down as far below £38 billion as we can.”

The government has two broad scenarios: one where it is generating power by 2039; another by 2043. Downes said: “There are no guarantees at all about delivery on budget and on schedule.”

Building nuclear power stations is an unlikely path for Pyke, who started out as an M&A lawyer. Her parents were teachers and she was motivated by “growing up without much money,” she said. “I wanted a more comfortable life.”

Her co-chief, Nigel Cann, will handle the more technical side of Sizewell. But Pyke has become the face of the project since stepping up to the co-chief role in 2023. A CND member in her late teens, she said Sizewell appealed to her spirit of “social justice” because it democratised access to clean power.

“Electricity has become a necessity in the same way that water is a necessity. It needs to be provided in the fairest way possible to society.

“I do see it as a heroic endeavour,” she added. “Sizewell C is essentially a project for people’s kids. So that they have access to weather-independent electricity, and don’t have electricity bills that are dependent on the vagaries of international markets. That’s what it’s for. And I think that maybe we’ve been through quite a long period of not building for the future.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F88f681fb-f35e-4bce-af37-759da5cf3a29.jpg?crop=7078%2C3981%2C1114%2C947&resize=1200,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:36.329711

Volkswagen Group reported a sharp decline in profits for the second quarter and first half of 2025, even as vehicle deliveries rose, highlighting the challenges of transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) while facing higher U.S. import tariffs. This downturn underscores the economic pressures on automakers scaling up EV production, where lower margins on battery-powered models erode overall earnings.

EV Sales Growth Masks Profit Erosion

The company delivered 4.4 million vehicles in the first six months of 2025, marking a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Deliveries in the second quarter alone reached 2.27 million units, up 1.2%. Despite these gains, earnings after tax for the first half fell 38.5% to an unspecified total, with the second quarter seeing a 36.3% drop to €2.29 billion (about $2.69 billion), reports Auto Blog.

This contrast arises partly from the surge in EV sales, which carry slimmer profit margins than traditional vehicles. Volkswagen Group’s leadership acknowledged this shift.

“Our half-year figures present a contrasting picture: on the one hand, we achieved strong product success and made progress in realigning the company,” said Arno Antlitz, CFO and COO of Volkswagen Group. “On the other, the operating result declined by a third year-on-year – also due to higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models.”

Building on that, individual EV models like the Audi Q6 e-tron have shown sales growth, yet the broader trend drags down profitability. Automakers must invest heavily in battery technology and supply chains, often at the expense of short-term returns. This raises questions about balancing EV adoption with financial stability, especially as consumer demand for electric models grows but pricing pressures persist.

U.S. Tariffs and Brand Struggles Compound Losses

U.S. import tariffs emerged as a key factor in the profit slide, adding to operational costs. The company’s operating result for the first half dropped 32.8%, with the second quarter alone down 29.4% to €3.8 billion (approximately $4.4 billion). Sales revenue dipped slightly, by 0.3% for the half-year and 3% in the second quarter.

Premium brands within the group faced acute challenges. Audi’s U.S. sales declined 12% year-on-year, prompting provisions for restructuring that further strained finances. Porsche, another subsidiary, grapples with declining sales in major markets, leading to cost-cutting measures.

“Our business model, which has served us well for many decades, no longer works in its current form,” said Porsche CEO Oliver Blume.

These issues reflect broader regulatory and market shifts. Higher tariffs on imported components and vehicles increase expenses, potentially passed on to consumers or absorbed by manufacturers. For EV enthusiasts, this could mean elevated prices for models like Volkswagen’s ID series or Audi’s e-tron lineup, affecting affordability and adoption rates in the U.S. market.

Revised Outlook Signals Caution for EV Transition

Due to the second-quarter performance, Volkswagen Group adjusted its 2025 sales revenue forecast to match 2024 levels, abandoning an earlier projection of 5% growth. This revision highlights the unpredictable nature of the EV sector, where external factors like tariffs can swiftly alter trajectories.

The company is not alone in these struggles; Tesla reported a 16% profit drop in the second quarter, though its issues stem more from other factors. For EV owners and enthusiasts, Volkswagen’s results emphasize the need for supportive policies to ease the transition. Lower tariffs or incentives could bolster margins, enabling faster innovation in areas like range extension—often measured in miles (e.g., converting 400 km to about 249 miles) or charging infrastructure.

This situation also points to operational implications, such as streamlining production to improve EV profitability. Economically, sustained low margins might slow investments in new technologies, like advanced autonomous driving features or lighter battery packs that enhance efficiency. Regulatory changes, particularly around trade, will play a pivotal role in shaping the industry’s future.

Overall, Volkswagen Group’s half-year results illustrate the dual-edged sword of EV expansion: promising growth in sustainable mobility tempered by immediate financial hurdles. As the sector evolves, stakeholders must navigate these dynamics to ensure long-term viability.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8070-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:07.241035

In July, a used EV is claimed to be selling on Auto Trader in an average of 28 days after first being advertised - that's a day quicker than the market average across all fuel types and four days faster than EVs were shifted a year ago.

The online sales platform says interest in second-hand EVs has accelerated in the last week - since the Government announced the reintroduction of an Electric Car Grant (ECG) to discount the price of some new models.

With used electric vehicle prices already tumbling as a direct result of manufacturer-driven discounts, the arrival of a taxpayer-funded scheme that further subsidises some new EVs will push second-hand prices even lower, experts have suggested.

And there's one premium EV in particular that's now selling in just over a fortnight as prices have tumbled to be on par with - if not cheaper than - petrol equivalents.

Tesla Model 3s between three and five years old are currently the fastest-selling used car, taking just 17 days to move on in July. That's almost two weeks faster than the average used car.

A 2021 Model 3 with between 35,000 and 40,000 miles on the clock can be had on Auto Trader for less than £16,000 today.

For its biggest petrol-powered equivalent, the BMW 3 Series, the cheapest petrol engined example of the same age and mileage is £22,000 or more.

Underlining the huge crash in value of pre-owned EVs, three-to-five-year-old Jaguar I-Pace SUVs are the second quickest-selling motors of the month, taking just 18 days to find a buyer on average.

The I-Pace, which has been subject to mainstream media criticism due to links to a number of high-profile accidents, has depreciated at such a rate that below-average-mileage are changing hands for around £14,000.

It means you can pick up what was originally a £70,000 luxury motor for around the same price as a petrol supermini of the same age.

Auto Trader believes the surge in consumer appetite for second-hand EVs has been fuelled, in part, by the government's ECG.

It will soon be applied to some sub-£37,000 new models - granted they meet specific manufacturing sustainability criteria yet to be outlined by ministers.

It says searches for used EVs under the £37k price point doubled within a day of the announcement.

'The used market will be key to unlocking mainstream adoption, and with a clear electric strategy in place, all retailers should be able to capitalise on the broader opportunity the grant offers,' the only marketplace said.

Marc Palmer, head of strategy and insight at Auto Trader, added: 'The clear spike in electric vehicle demand this month is encouraging - whenever EVs make headlines, we consistently see a boost in consumer interest not only for new cars, but in the used EV market as well.'

Other EVs to make July's list of fastest-selling used motors are the Hyundai Kona EV and Volkswagen ID.3.

Again, this is based on examples between three and five years old.

They are selling in 20 and 21 days respectively.

Only in-demand petrol-engined compact crossovers including the Nissan Juke and Ford Puma are selling quicker than this.

Ian Plummer, the company's commercial director, commented: 'Pricing data shows a significant gap between new EVs and two–to-three-year-old cars as market forces have caused used EVs to match petrol and diesel alternatives to attract buyers.

'While the Electric Car Grant may boost new EV sales, used EVs remain appealing due to their affordability and it's unlikely the grant will either heavily or immediately impact used EV pricing and residual values.

'It was encouraging to see a strong surge of interest in new EVs on Auto Trader immediately post the grant launch, and some of this positivity also flowed into used EVs, as we know the majority of those considering electric will shop both new and used cars.'

As for the slowest-selling used motors, no EVs made the top 10 order.

The most sluggish of all is something of a shock - the Volkswagen Polo, a supermini that's traditionally very popular in Britain.

Year-old examples, which are holding their value well and therefore appear pricey against other options, are taking an average of 50 days - almost two months - to move on, Auto Trader said.

Shortly after Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander last Monday unveiled Labour's new ECG, industry experts claim it will be a major drain on public spending that will cause used EV prices to plummet.

Philip Nothard, insight director at analysts Cox Automotive told us: 'Heavy discounts on new EVs have already dampened demand for nearly new models available in the used car market.

'While driving down the cost of new vehicles will undoubtedly increase the EV adoption in the new market, these incentives fail to recognise the impact they will have on the used market.'

Nothard says the grant now threatens to increase depreciation of electric cars up to two years old.

'The used market is a crucial source of profitability for the automotive sector, so the strength and consistency of the industry is crucial to the success of the government's net zero ambitions,' he said.

'To ensure this, the government needs to consider more support for the used EV sector to put the brakes on the rapid pace of depreciation.'

British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association chief executive Toby Poston also warned that further stimulating new EV registrations without supporting the used market 'risks creating an even greater supply-and-demand imbalance, putting even more pressure on fast deflating second-hand values'.

What is the Electric Car Grant?

The Electric Car Grant is the Government's new big hope to drive sales of EVs in the run-up to the end of the decade as it continues to steer towards outlawing the availability of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.

It arrives three years after the previous Tory administration prematurely scrapped its Plug-in Car Grant (PiCG).

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed the ECG's availability on Monday 15 July, stating: 'The EV grant will not only allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money - it'll help our automotive sector seize one of the biggest opportunities of the 21st century.'

Only cars up to £37,000 qualify for the grant, which rules out premium models, including every Tesla on sale. No Audi, BMW or Mercedes EV will be eligible either.

Some 50 existing models are technically eligible for the grants solely based on their starting price. We've listed these below.

Manufacturers must apply to be eligible for the scheme with their sub-£37,000 cars on a 'first come, first served' basis.

This means that motorists will not need to fill in any additional paperwork to receive the grant, with all administration handled by the car maker, dealership, and the Government.

But because manufacturers must apply for the scheme, the Department for Transport has told us that we are unlikely to see an initial list of eligible EVs until the first two weeks of August.

The new scheme uses a two-tier system based on 'sustainability criteria' to determine the size of the subsidy provided.

Only the greenest models - considered 'band one' - receiving the full £3,750 amount. Band two cars with a lower eco rating will be eligible for a reduced amount as low as £1,500.

Bands are determined by each maker's Science-Based Target (SBT) - an industry-wide scheme, with manufacturers needing to meet carbon scores below a specific criterion to achieve the highest green standard. Volkswagen and Renault Group have both confirmed they are signed up with the SBT scheme.

ECG bands - which could later expand beyond two tiers - will be determined by how much CO2 is emitted in an EV's production, assessing the energy used during assembly as well as battery manufacturing.

An overall SBT score is weighted 70 per cent for the CO2 produced during battery manufacturing and 30 per cent for vehicle assembly emissions.

Threshold levels to achieve the full £3,750 discount or the lower banded £1,500 have yet to be made public. However, vehicles that don't meet a minimum level will not receive a grant at all.

This could be bad news for Chinese EV makers, which currently offer some of the most competitive prices but could fall foul of the emissions-based rules.

Speaking on the BBC's Today programme last week, Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said she did not expect any cars that are produced in China to be eligible.

'The grant is restricted to those manufacturers that reach minimum environmental standards,' she said.

'And, frankly, if you generate a lot of the electricity that powers your factory through coal power stations, then you are not going to be able to access this grant.'

According to The Telegraph, the Chinese embassy has hit hack and the scheme's stringent requirements.

It has called on the UK to follow World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and create a 'non-discriminatory environment for investment'.

WTO rules stipulate that members must not give favourable treatment to one country over another when it comes to trading goods and services.

An embassy spokesperson added: 'The Chinese side is closely following the situation and will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/22/17/100531629-0-image-m-14_1753201037941.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 21:00:44.899975

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

This marks the fastest progress since before the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by advancements in energy equity and sustainability, fueled by lower energy prices, subsidy reforms, and increased adoption of clean energy. However, the report warns that energy security remains a weak link, with only marginal gains exposing persistent vulnerabilities in global energy systems. As geopolitical tensions, trade frictions, and rising energy demand—particularly from AI-driven data centers—threaten to disrupt progress, the world faces a critical moment to balance equity, sustainability, and security in the race to a net-zero future.

A Rebound in Energy Equity and Sustainability

The ETI, which benchmarks 118 countries on their energy system performance and transition readiness, paints an encouraging yet uneven picture. Energy equity, which measures access, affordability, and economic benefits, saw a robust 2.2% year-on-year increase, nearing pre-pandemic levels. This rebound is largely attributed to moderating energy prices and structural subsidy reforms that have made energy more affordable, particularly in emerging economies. For instance, expanded access to electricity and clean cooking technologies has bolstered equity in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where Nigeria climbed from 109th place in 2016 to 61st in 2025, driven by financial investments and infrastructure improvements.

Sustainability scores also rose by 1.2%, reflecting lower energy and emissions intensities and a growing share of clean energy in the global energy mix, now at 14.8%. Countries like China, which reached an all-time high ETI ranking of 12th, have led the charge with massive investments in solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs), commissioning more solar photovoltaic capacity in 2023 than the entire world did in 2022. Emerging Europe, particularly Latvia, which entered the ETI top 10 for the first time, showcased strong gains in renewable energy capacity and equitable access, supported by a 59% drop in electricity prices. These advancements highlight the impact of targeted policies and clean energy adoption, though the report notes that global emissions hit a record 37.8 billion tons in 2024, underscoring the scale of the decarbonization challenge.

Energy Security: The Weakest Link

Despite progress in equity and sustainability, energy security—encompassing supply reliability, diversification, and grid flexibility—saw only a 0.4% improvement, signaling persistent vulnerabilities. The report cites import dependence, inflexible power systems, and limited diversification as key barriers, particularly in regions reliant on fossil fuel imports. Global energy demand surged 2.2% in 2024, driven by electrification, cooling needs during record heatwaves, and the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centers, placing unprecedented strain on grids. Only 28% of countries achieved simultaneous progress across all three ETI dimensions—equity, security, and sustainability—highlighting the difficulty of balancing these priorities.

Advanced economies like Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, which topped the ETI rankings, benefit from diversified energy mixes, robust infrastructure, and strong policy frameworks. In contrast, many emerging economies struggle with grid congestion and supply chain constraints, exacerbated by geopolitical disruptions and trade frictions. For example, the U.S., ranked 17th, excels in energy security due to its diversified portfolio but faces challenges in policy coherence and grid upgrades. The report emphasizes that modernizing grids, enhancing storage, and integrating digital technologies are critical to bolstering energy security and supporting renewable energy deployment.

Transition Readiness Lags Behind

While energy system performance improved, transition readiness—measuring factors like regulation, infrastructure, innovation, and investment—grew by only 0.8%, below its 10-year average of 1.2%. This slowdown raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of current gains. The report highlights that while countries like Luxembourg, Denmark, and Germany lead in regulatory clarity and political commitment, global readiness is hampered by inconsistent policies and fiscal pressures. Rising tariffs, volatile capital markets, and increased defense spending are diverting public funds from clean energy investments, particularly in developing economies where $2.2 trillion annually is needed through 2030 to align with net-zero goals.

Emerging Europe and Asia are narrowing the readiness gap, with regions like Latvia and China benefiting from infrastructure upgrades and clean technology investments. Brazil’s investments in its National Interconnected System, enabling solar power distribution, and Saudi Arabia’s rapid renewable capacity buildout are notable examples. However, the report warns that over 90% of clean energy investment in 2024 flowed to advanced economies and China, leaving developing nations like India and Nigeria underfunded despite their growing energy needs.

Challenges and Opportunities Ahead

The WEF report underscores that the energy transition is no longer just a climate issue but a cornerstone of economic competitiveness, national security, and industrial policy. The global clean energy sector attracted $2 trillion in 2024, supporting 16 million jobs, but this falls short of the $5.6 trillion needed annually through 2030 to meet net-zero targets. The rise of AI and data centers, which are driving energy demand, poses both a challenge and an opportunity, requiring innovative solutions like smart meters and time-of-use pricing to manage consumption. Saudi Arabia’s deployment of 11 million smart meters and Australia’s Clean Energy Training Hubs exemplify how technology and workforce development can enhance system efficiency and resilience.

Geopolitical and economic headwinds, including U.S. tariff policies and supply chain disruptions, threaten to stall progress. The International Monetary Fund’s revised 2025 global growth forecast of 2.8% reflects these pressures, which could delay infrastructure investments and increase financing costs. The report calls for five strategic priorities: stable yet adaptive policy frameworks, modernized grid infrastructure, workforce development, accelerated clean technology deployment, and increased investment in developing economies. These steps are critical to ensuring an equitable, secure, and sustainable energy future.

A Multi-Speed Transition

The ETI reveals a multi-speed transition, with advanced economies leading but emerging markets making significant strides. Sweden, Finland, and Denmark remain top performers, while China, Brazil, and India demonstrate that tailored reforms can drive progress in diverse contexts. However, the persistent lag in energy security and uneven investment flows highlight the need for global cooperation. As the WEF notes, “Achieving these goals cannot rely on single-market initiatives, but a new type of global and regional alliances needs to be forged.” Knowledge sharing and targeted financial support for developing nations will be essential to sustain momentum and close the gap between ambition and reality.

As the world navigates a complex energy landscape, the 2025 ETI offers a roadmap for progress. While equity and sustainability gains are cause for optimism, the stalled progress in energy security and slowing readiness underscore the urgency of collective action. With clean energy at the heart of economic and environmental goals, 2025 marks a pivotal year to accelerate the transition—or risk falling short of a net-zero future.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/Global_Energy_Transition_Gains_Momentum_in_2025_but_Security_Lags_Behind.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 18:02:49.044311

Unlike solar and wind energy, which rely on climatic factors outside of human control, the heat from the Earth’s core is a steady and constant commodity. It’s just a matter of tapping into it. And the race is heating up to determine the best technological approach to do just that.

Way back in 2021, Oilprice asked, “Why is the world still ignoring geothermal energy?” In the four years since that report, everything has changed. The promising clean energy source has – at long last – become a very hot topic. Rising from near obscurity, it’s now shaping up to be “the decade of geothermal.” That’s according to Cindy Taff, chief executive of geothermal company Sage Geosystems, in an interview in The Hill published in February of this year.

So what took so long? Geothermal is already easily accessible in places like Iceland, where heat from the Earth’s core already leaks up to the surface and can be easily captured and converted into electricity. But on most of the planet, temperatures useful for creating electricity are trapped far, far under the ground. The Earth's crust varies from about 3 to 47 miles in thickness, and most of those thinnest areas are inconveniently located way out in the deep ocean.

“The most audacious vision for geothermal is to drill six miles or more underground where temperatures exceed 750 degrees Fahrenheit,” reports the New York Times. “At that point, water goes supercritical and can hold five to 10 times as much energy as normal steam.” This ‘superhot’ geothermal “could provide cheap, abundant clean energy anywhere.”

Drilling a hole deep enough to enable cost-effective and commercial geothermal energy is no easy task. But research and pilot projects trying to figure out the best way to do it are finally taking off.

One potential method borrows hydraulic fracturing technologies that are already well-tested and widely in use in the oil and gas industry. Using fracking infrastructure, geothermal companies can crack open subterranean layers of rock to inject water into the fractures at high volumes and pressures, resulting in artificially made geothermal reservoirs. This technology is not yet cost-effective enough to be commercially viable, since traditional fracking equipment can’t withstand the necessary levels of heat, but it was one of the first “enhanced” geothermal technologies and is therefore more developed than some of the more nascent alternatives.

Another, more futuristic technological approach involves nuclear fusion. Researchers are currently investigating the utility of gyrotrons, a technology used in nuclear fusion to super-heat and maintain plasma with millimeter waves, to basically melt away rock to drill deeper and more efficiently into the Earth. Mathematical modelling from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggests that this technology “could blast a basketball-size hole into rock at a rate of 20 meters per hour,” according to IEEE Spectrum. “At that rate, 25-and-a-half days of continuous drilling would create the world’s deepest hole.” And now the gyrotron approach is ready to leave the lab and face real-world testing.

A Slovakian company called GA Drilling is also looking to plasma, but rather than using millimeter waves the technology uses a plasma torch for high-temperature drilling, which they say can reach 10-kilometer depths to “provide clean, inexpensive and nonstop available geothermal energy” at “any location on Earth.”

A geothermal technology breakthrough could reshape global energy industries and shore up energy security – just in the nick of time as energy demand surges on the back of data center growth. A recent report suggests that geothermal energy could meet up to 64 percent of the expected growth in data center energy demand as soon as the early 2030s. Plus, enhanced geothermal drilling technologies would democratize clean energy, as any country could theoretically tap into this universal heat source to become energy independent.

It has caused the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to declare: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.”

Well, hallelujah.

Except, here in Australia, we are still mired in the politics of climate and at risk of missing the window of opportunity for both environmental protection and economic benefit.

Regulatory hurdles, worker shortages and community blowback in regional Australia have all combined to feed the culture wars and the erosion of social licence that is fundamental to progress the energy transition.

As Ezra Klein, co-author of the viral book Abundance, has remarked of late, “We should be able to argue that the clean energy future should be fucking awesome.”

Yet, we are failing.

And in that we are betraying young people and those who are both most concerned about the impact of the renewables revolution on their communities and most at risk from the disasters that make it necessary.

This week the first sitting of the 48th parliament typified time-wasting point-scoring politics with former Nationals leaders Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack teaming up to push for the repeal of the legislated net zero target, undermining the current leader, David Littleproud, in the process.

This is irresponsible and gutless, and the Albanese government with its characteristic pragmatic caution must not allow its massive majority to be an excuse to curb ambition because it doesn’t need to try too hard to appear to be better

Instead, both governments and oppositions at state and federal level need to go back to basics and carefully build the case to step communities through the big changes ahead from the point of view of both an opportunity for affordable power and better jobs as well as a necessity.

We know that Australians care about climate.

Many have already been touched directly by climate disasters. Most will have seen their insurance premiums affected at the very least.

The 2022 election was certainly influenced by the floods, fires and storms that led up to it, and the Morrison government’s refusal to “hold a hose”.

And while the Coalition successfully channelled much of the 2025 election debate into cost-of-living pressure, even here in Goldstein, where the demographic is older than the national average, polling still consistently showed climate in the top three concerns of constituents.

Many Australians also understand that climate and environment policy and the economy are intrinsically linked.

In his recent address to the National Press Club, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry tied the two together, as he described failures in improving environmental management as “a wilful act of intergenerational bastardry”.

The government has revived plans for a federal EPA after parking its promised broader reforms to environmental laws towards the end of the last parliament apparently under pressure from business.

Henry argues for an overhaul that both protects and restores nature, through high-integrity incentives for nature restoration and carbon storage together with genuine cooperation between all levels of government and clear standards and decision-making.

He frames nature restoration as both an environmental and economic benefit, both of which are critical to the net zero transition.

Speaking of which, what was not talked about in Canberra this week?

While Joyce and McCormack try to ditch the 43% net zero 2030 emissions target (which is set as a floor not a ceiling because I negotiated that into the law with the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen), Australia’s net zero target for 2035 has not yet been set.

The government has been waiting for advice from the Climate Change Authority to set the new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which required factoring in the outcomes of both the Australian election and the 2024 US election.

Now that all of that is over, to what extent will the Albanese government take its power amid this circular debate?

Some in the business world, specifically the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, say a target of 65-75% would be “exceedingly challenging for the Australian economy”.

Yet expert analysis shows that a 2035 target of sub 75% or more (on 2005 levels) is aligned with more than 2C of global heating. And, according to the Climate Council, “climate-fuelled disasters are expected to cost the Australian economy $94 billion a year by 2060 if pollution levels remain high”. At least 8.8% of Australian homes will be uninsurable due to high exposure to climate disasters by 2100.

There’s no question it’s complicated, practically and politically.

But arguably, Labor has six years in power ahead. That’s a decent runway.

And pragmatically, three-quarters of millennials and gen Z voters, now the largest group of Australian voters, named climate change as a key voting issue for the 2025 election.

By 2028, there will be several hundred thousand more of them.

And they’ll expect something beyond more “intergenerational bastardry”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0324d78bfdda5a652cf9e565c23a62278a63fc4d/449_0_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6ded5be8b726ae0920f095df176e3ee9",N,,2025-07-26 19:01:34.899409

Polyzos said the team pinpointed parameters for successfully incorporating the thinner material into the roll-to-roll production process, despite its being more prone to wrinkling. Other experimental current collectors have generally required expensive and complex manufacturing processes that are incompatible with standard roll-to-roll methods.

ORNL’s study results, published in Energy & Environmental Materials, highlight the potential of the metal-polymer current collector to “revolutionize the roll-to-roll battery manufacturing process and significantly advance the performance metrics of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicle applications.”

Brian Morin, CEO of South Carolina-based Soteria, said ORNL has helped the company understand how to achieve rapid battery charging with the technology, despite increased physical resistance from the plastic film.

“We take 80% of the metal out, which makes it harder to do things quickly,” Morin said. “But they’ve shown that you can still get fast charge and discharge. Soteria’s testing has shown the polymer also makes the battery safer. If there is an internal short circuit that produces a brief rush of energy, it eats the plastic film, which pulls the metal away. Our current collector acts like a circuit breaker inside the battery and eliminates about 90% of lithium-ion battery fires caused by short circuits.”

The metalized polymer current collector research was funded through DOE’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office, or AMMTO. Other ORNL researchers involved in the project include Sergiy Kalnaus, Sabine Neumayer, Wheatley Steenman and Jaswinder Sharma.

Fears that the Trump administration is looking for ways to lift a longstanding ban on fracking for natural gas in the densely populated Delaware River Basin—which includes part of Pennsylvania—have prompted environmentalists to seek public support for a commitment to defend the regulation.

Activists are promoting a “Pledge of Resistance and Protection” of the watershed in response to what they see as a series of attempts by the administration and some of its supporters in Congress to hobble the Delaware River Basin Commission, an interstate agency that formally banned fracking in the region in 2021 after a moratorium that began a decade earlier.

“The Delaware River frack ban was put in place with public participation, backed by science and fact to be protective of the Delaware River watershed and its communities,” the pledge says in part. “We must continue to stand strong for our environment, and to uphold the pillars of law, science and facts that helped the DRBC make the sound decision that the watershed will not survive, nor will we, if fracking is allowed.”

The Trump administration hasn’t made specific moves to target the ban. But environmentalists’ confidence in the rule has been shaken after multiple actions by President Donald Trump to increase fossil fuel production, including declaring an “energy emergency” and directing agencies to roll back federal policies that “impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” such as natural gas.

Environmentalists were further spooked after U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a new Republican congressman from northeast Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in May that would require a federal review of the DRBC and other commissions in the Mid-Atlantic, including responsibilities that overlap with federal obligations, and recommend any reforms. Bresnahan criticized the fracking ban earlier this year at the event attended by the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Delaware River Basin extends across four states, but only two—Pennsylvania and New York—also contain the gas-rich Marcellus Shale. New York banned fracking statewide in 2014, citing health risks.

Environmentalists say that allowing the industry to drill in Pennsylvania’s part of the watershed would risk contaminating drinking water for some 15 million people, including in Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, with toxic chemicals used in fracking. The critics point to many instances of air and water pollution in heavily fracked areas such as southwest Pennsylvania, and they say that increased production will also worsen climate change.

The gas industry says it protects drinking-water aquifers from fracking chemicals by encasing drills in multiple layers of steel and concrete, and complies with all state and federal laws on fracking safety.

Pennsylvania’s gas industry and its supporters in the state legislature have unsuccessfully fought the DRBC’s frack ban through legislation and litigation for years, arguing that landowners in two watershed counties should be allowed to lease their property to companies active in the rest of the state’s Marcellus Shale. In February, a federal judge dismissed a suit by landowners in Wayne County, northeast of Scranton, seeking to overturn the DRBC’s fracking ban in their area.

The Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents Pennsylvania’s natural gas industry, said it wants the Delaware River Basin fracking ban to be lifted, but has not “formally communicated” with the Trump administration on the issue.

“The Marcellus Shale Coalition strongly supports lifting the DRBC’s unjust ban on safe, responsible natural gas development. This ban has long violated the property rights of Pennsylvania landowners and ignores nearly two decades of demonstrated, highly regulated shale development in the Commonwealth—including in the neighboring Susquehanna River Basin,” coalition spokesman Patrick Henderson said in a statement.

Still, a study released in 2019 by the University of Delaware found that the watershed represents only 3.3 percent of the Marcellus Shale. The study found that the financial value of potentially recoverable natural gas in that part of the field is dwarfed by the estimated value of the area’s drinking water supply, forests and recreation.

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there,” said Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center and one of the authors of the report. “The gas, which is a fossil fuel, is a non-renewable resource that can be exhausted pretty quickly. Protect the drinking water first because it’s much more valuable.”

In banning fracking, the DRBC “acted appropriately” to protect the interests of the people who live in the watershed, Kauffman said. He plans to update the study this year.

One Trump administration move involving the DRBC added to environmentalists’ jitters that more might be coming. The agency’s federal representative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, proposed a resolution last month to end future federal funding for DRBC work on climate change, and for its policy of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. The resolution was unanimously approved by governors of the watershed states—New Jersey and Delaware in addition to Pennsylvania and New York, all run by Democratic administrations.

The surprising agreement prompted speculation that the governors were picking their battles with Trump. The federal government has mostly failed to pay its share of DRBC’s running costs since the 1980s, and so the funding cut would have little effect.

DRBC’s executive director, Kristen Kavanagh, said the agency has received no federal funding through the Army Corps since the resolution. But she said the DRBC’s Advisory Committee on Climate Change, a panel of 18 experts, including academics and water-company executives, will continue its work. Its next scheduled meeting is Aug. 27.

Bresnahan’s commission review bill, meanwhile, has advanced in committee and awaits a full vote in the House.

His office did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the bill. But Tracy Carluccio with the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, who instigated the pledge, called the legislation a ploy to interfere with the running of an agency that has prompted a sharp improvement in water quality since its inception in 1961, and reinforced that through its ban on fracking.

“This attempt to poke around the DRBC’s inner workings is nothing more than a politically motivated witch hunt, designed to intimidate and disrupt the DRBC,” Carluccio said.

DRBC spokespeople declined to comment on the bill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also did not respond to requests for comment. But its administrator, Lee Zeldin, attended a meeting in Northeast Pennsylvania with Bresnahan and some pro-fracking state lawmakers in March, according to a press release from the congressman and a story from the River Reporter, a news site in a New York community just over the Pennsylvania state line.

READ: With Washington Stepping Back on Clean Energy, Harrisburg Must Step Up

Asked there whether the Trump administration would try to open up drilling in Northeast Pennsylvania, Zeldin said, “President Trump is someone I feel confident we can approach [with] any good idea [and] his response is going to be that he wants to get it done as quickly as possible,” the news site reported.

If the Trump administration finds a way to lift the Delaware Basin frack ban, it will also find activists pledged to resist it, said Carluccio. By mid-July, the document had about 1,100 signers online.

“We have found that people want to make positive commitments that affirm personal power,” she said. “The pledge is like an oath or a vow founded on a person’s allegiance to the issue. We know that there is strong and resolute dedication from people to never allowing fracking to occur here and the pledge is a public statement that each person makes to stake their ground.”",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/No-Fracking-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2025-07-26 19:02:52.515999

Electrified Materials, a subsidiary of American Resources Corporation, has received a federal permit to scale up its electric vehicle battery recycling operations.

The news, first reported by Charged Electric Vehicle magazine, centers on a newly granted Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permit, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana’s Department of Environmental Management. With this permit, Electrified Materials is now authorized to preprocess and recycle materials including copper, aluminum, iron, rare earth elements, and critical minerals.

Mark Jensen, Chairman and CEO of American Resources, emphasized the strategic value of this advancement, calling it “a key milestone in scaling our recycling and refining partnership with ReElement Technologies.” Electrified Materials specializes in processing lithium-ion batteries from EV motors and other sources turning discarded power systems into valuable raw materials for reuse.

This circular approach is vital to addressing one of the few environmental concerns surrounding EVs. While electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions and reduce greenhouse gas pollution especially when powered by renewable sources like solar the production and disposal of their batteries raise serious environmental questions. Mining for raw materials is resource-intensive and can lead to ecological damage. Improper disposal of used batteries poses risks of soil and water contamination due to their toxic contents.

By enabling advanced recycling methods, Electrified Materials aims to minimize these risks. The company will extract usable mineral concentrates from old battery packs, which will then be refined by ReElement Technologies into high-grade materials suitable for new batteries and magnets. This process closes a crucial loop in the EV lifecycle ensuring that fewer hazardous materials end up in landfills while reducing dependence on virgin raw materials.

Jensen also pointed to state-level support as a critical accelerator. “This permit, combined with the $900,000+ grant from the State of Indiana and our strategic alignment with ReElement, will accelerate our expansion and strengthen our domestic footprint,” he said.",https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-259.png,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:58.996880

If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.

PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.

TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND

Why the power grid is struggling to keep up

PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.

In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.

AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use

AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.

Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.

Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.

While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.

How AI is increasing your electric bill

Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.

PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.

To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.

Tips to reduce your electricity bill

Looking for ways to lower your electricity bill as prices surge? Here are some effective tips you can start using today:

Unplug electronics and appliances when not in use to avoid phantom power drain.

Upgrade to smart thermostats and LED lighting for greater energy efficiency.

Run major appliances (like washers and dishwashers) during off-peak hours.

Consider adding weather stripping or insulation to block drafts and improve cooling/heating.

Monitor your energy usage with smart plugs or an electricity usage monitor for real-time feedback.

Kurt's key takeaway

AI electricity demand is growing faster than the grid can handle. As more data centers come online to power tools like ChatGPT, the strain is showing up on your utility bill. Without major upgrades to infrastructure or smarter energy policy, prices could keep climbing. The tech may be smart, but the cost of keeping it running is getting harder for everyone else to ignore.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-26 20:31:50+00:00,The Telegraph,Ed Miliband eyes battery bonanza to cut wind farm costs - The Telegraph,"Szu Ping Chan, Matt Oliver",,,,,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/26/miliband-eyes-battery-bonanza-to-cut-wind-farm-costs/,"Ed Miliband will plough hundreds of millions of pounds into battery storage technology as the cost of ordering wind farms to shut down spirals out of control.
GB Energy think they’ve got a role to play in trying to fund the innovation.” The Energy Secretary is presiding over the drive as part of a £4bn push by GB Energy into emerging technologies.
The push into battery storage technology comes after Mr Miliband abandoned controversial plans to charge southern households more for electricity than those in the North amid a backlash from wind farm owners.
A spokesman for GB Energy said: “Long-duration energy storage is vital to a clean, secure, and affordable energy future for the UK.
“GB Energy sees opportunity to invest in both proven technologies like pumped hydro and emerging innovations such as flow batteries and liquid air storage.","Ed Miliband will plough hundreds of millions of pounds into battery storage technology as the cost of ordering wind farms to shut down spirals out of control.

GB Energy, which is backed by the taxpayer, will use a chunk of its newly minted budget to invest in energy storage systems as households and businesses are forced to foot the bill to prevent the creaking power grid from getting congested.

More than £700m has been spent so far this year on switching off wind farms to avoid overloading the grid as well as firing up alternatives to keep the lights on. This is up from about £450m over the same period in 2024, with the money ultimately coming from energy bills.

Officials are also keen to ensure clean power remains reliable during periods of high demand.

An industry source said: “How do you get around the fact that the wind blows one day, doesn’t blow the next? They have to keep switching off the turbines because they can’t store the energy. GB Energy think they’ve got a role to play in trying to fund the innovation.”

The Energy Secretary is presiding over the drive as part of a £4bn push by GB Energy into emerging technologies.

The push into battery storage technology is understood to be one of GB Energy’s three big priorities, with half its £4bn innovation budget being deployed to bring more of the UK’s net zero supply chain onshore.

The Government is hoping to create hundreds of new jobs in areas such as Scarborough, North Yorkshire, which is reinventing itself as a service hub for the offshore wind industry.

Experts say large amounts of energy storage will be needed for net zero, as countries move away from readily dispatchable gas or coal-fired power stations to intermittent sources such as wind and solar farms.

More storage on the grid should also help to prevent situations where grid operators are forced to pay wind farms to switch off when the network is too busy to accept their power.

Instead, battery operators would be able to snap the electricity up cheaply and store it for later.

There is particular need for so-called long-duration storage that can be deployed over weeks rather than days to counter periods of “dunkelflaute”, when cloudy skies and stagnant wind conditions reduce the output of renewables.

Under Mr Miliband’s plan for a clean power system by 2030, the amount of long-duration energy storage is expected to rise from about three gigawatts today to between four and six gigawatts – enough to power millions of homes.

Traditional lithium ion batteries are not ideal for this owing to their high cost and relatively short-term output, as well as degradation over time and the large numbers that would need to be built.

Possible alternatives include “flow” batteries, which store energy in liquid electrolytes, pumped hydro storage, compressed air storage, heat storage such as thermal bricks or molten salt, and caves that can be used to store hydrogen.

The push into battery storage technology comes after Mr Miliband abandoned controversial plans to charge southern households more for electricity than those in the North amid a backlash from wind farm owners.

Advocates claimed that zonal pricing would also have cut bills for all households overall by removing the need for £27bn of grid upgrades and axing the payments made to wind farms to switch off.

Wind turbines have been built faster than grid capacity over the past decade, leaving Britain’s infrastructure struggling to move electricity from Scottish wind farms to where it is needed in the South.

A spokesman for GB Energy said: “Long-duration energy storage is vital to a clean, secure, and affordable energy future for the UK.

“GB Energy sees opportunity to invest in both proven technologies like pumped hydro and emerging innovations such as flow batteries and liquid air storage. By stepping in early, we can unlock private capital, accelerate delivery, and back British supply chains.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000431149250_17534681248670_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:19.740717

Aidala,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/epas-office-research-and-development-villain-or-victim,"On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD).
The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process.
In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain.
The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs.
A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws.","On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD). The stated goal of the plan is to reduce budget expenditures, improve “science,” and have EPA’s research activities better support the work of the media offices, including the Office of Water (OW), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), and Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). The EPA press release refers to the effort as a continuation of “comprehensive restructuring” that includes a reduction in force (RIF) for the ORD and a subsequent savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. The release also announced the creation of a new EPA office, the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), with a mission to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” but provided no further information on the new office.

To Administration supporters, this is the latest chapter in the long overdue reorganization of federal programs to help reduce costs and trim back the “administrative state.” To detractors, it is yet another broad attack on regulatory programs in general, especially those at EPA, and specifically targets the scientific work of EPA and its research office. ORD personnel reorganization was among the many ORD-specific recommendations outlined in the Project 2025 document. Critics of the Administration’s efforts to cut EPA’s budget and staffing see the reorganization of ORD and its associated staff cuts as part of the larger attempt to reduce protections of the environment and health at EPA and other government agencies — as part of the agenda to “gut” EPA programs generally, even if some program offices (including OCSPP) gain positions.

ORD’s work, especially its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), has been controversial for many years and the subject of intense industry and trade group criticism. Established in 1985 and revised periodically, the IRIS Program is an attempt at a uniform, agency-wide database of human health assessments for chemicals found in the environment that serves as the basis for regulatory actions across EPA. The goal is that each EPA program be consistent in its assessments and able to act according to the specific legislative requirements driving the work of the respective EPA offices. The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process. At its best, the IRIS Program is hailed by supporters as being an essential part of bridge-building between different forms of environmental science and the various offices of EPA.

IRIS critics, however, have claimed for years that the program is overly conservative in its assessment assumptions, biased in its selection of information evaluated, and secretive in avoiding public scrutiny of its underlying work and assumptions. A January 27, 2025, letter organized by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and signed by over 80 organizations affected by the work of the IRIS Program asserts:

IRIS has often fallen short of scientific standards required of EPA and is out of step with global health agencies and regulators. IRIS fails to adequately incorporate high quality and relevant science and does not consistently utilize a “weight of the scientific evidence” approach. Also, the process IRIS uses to prioritize and select chemicals for assessment lacks transparency.

For years, ORD has been subject to legislation introduced in Congress in response to the assertion of critics, most recently the “No IRIS” Act introduced in the House and Senate in February 2025 (H.R. 1415 and S. 623, respectively). The IRIS Program has been reviewed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) at various times over the years and found to indeed have program deficiencies (e.g., timeliness, lack of guidance) cited by critics as evidence of its ineffectiveness. EPA has implemented actions to satisfy the recommendations made by GAO, but some stakeholders remain very critical.

Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations. In February 2025, partly in response to this sustained assault, EPA employees and supporters created Stand Up for Science. This grassroots movement turned non-profit organization has hosted rallies, created policy goals, and garnered media attention. Of note, the Stand Up for Science website hosts the public Declaration of Dissent, signed by EPA staff and members of the public, and invites visitors to add their name to the Declaration. The Declaration itself is addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and highlights five main concerns. Concern number four is “Dismantling the Office of Research and Development.” The Declaration states that the proposed ORD reorganization will make “EPA science more vulnerable to political interference,” and cites the proposed budget cuts for 2026 as leaving “ORD unable to meet the science needs of the EPA and its partners” and in a place that “will threaten the health of all Americans.”

What any reorganization of ORD or reform of science activities and policies will have to confront is the requirement for a scientific basis at the heart of any regulatory decision. Regardless of presidential priorities or allocated budgets, much of EPA’s work will remain dependent on the underlying science supporting whatever regulatory conclusions are proposed. Those programmatic conclusions will then be subject to public review and comment as part of the fundamental regulatory development process. In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain. The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs. A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws. That centralized science function was developed over time to reduce, and ideally eliminate, inconsistent science and avoid overlapping, unsupported, or inadequate requirements.

After the reorganization and budget allocations are settled, it is not clear what procedures or administrators will fill those needed functions of integration, coordination, and consistency. Debates, especially high-profile controversies, are often more about the derivative outcomes of an assessment masking as debates than about the underlying data and evaluation procedures. Reorganizing the pieces on the chess board will not resolve or avoid such debates in the future.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/bigstock-Washington-Dc-Usa--January--196171783.jpg.webp?itok=lGoNZsGM,N,,2025-07-26 22:59:38.414255

That led to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health and welfare, based on overwhelming scientific consensus and peer-reviewed research.
The Endangerment Finding has withstood multiple legal challenges, and although Trump's first administration considered reversing it, they ultimately held back.
The government is expected to undo the earlier finding that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.
""It's fatalistic to avoid taking the many actions that could cumulatively fix climate change, because none of them can individually solve the entire problem.""","A proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to change the so-called ""Endangerment Finding"" was sent to the White House on June 30, a spokesperson told AFP. An announcement is expected imminently.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 empowered the EPA to regulate ""air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.""

For decades, the law applied to pollutants like lead, ozone, and soot.

But as climate science around the dangers of heat-trapping greenhouse gases advanced in the 2000s, a coalition of states and nonprofit groups petitioned the EPA to include them under the law, focusing on motor vehicles.

The issue reached the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants and directed the EPA to revisit its stance.

That led to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health and welfare, based on overwhelming scientific consensus and peer-reviewed research.

""That 2009 finding formed the basis for all of EPA's subsequent regulations,"" Meredith Hankins, a senior attorney on climate and energy for the activist Natural Resources Defense Council, told AFP.

""They've issued greenhouse gas standards for tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles, smokestack emissions from power plants – all of these individual rulemakings trace themselves back to the 2009 Endangerment Finding.""

The Endangerment Finding has withstood multiple legal challenges, and although Trump's first administration considered reversing it, they ultimately held back.

But the finding is now a direct target of Project 2025, a far-right governance blueprint closely followed by the administration.

In March, the EPA under Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal reconsideration of the finding.

""The Trump Administration will not sacrifice national prosperity, energy security, and the freedom of our people for an agenda that throttles our industries, our mobility, and our consumer choice while benefiting adversaries overseas,"" he said.

The government is expected to undo the earlier finding that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare. It will argue that the economic costs of regulation have been undervalued – and downplay the role of US motor vehicle emissions in climate change.

In fact, transportation is the largest source of US greenhouse gas emissions.

""If vehicle emissions don't pass muster as a contribution to climate change, it's hard to imagine what would,"" Dena Adler of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University told AFP. ""It's fatalistic to avoid taking the many actions that could cumulatively fix climate change, because none of them can individually solve the entire problem.""

Since 1970, the US has emitted more vehicle-based greenhouse gases than the next nine countries combined, according to an analysis by the Institute for Policy Integrity that will soon be published in full.

In March, the EPA said it would lean on recent court rulings, including a landmark 2024 decision that narrowed federal regulatory power.

Still, legal experts say the administration faces an uphill battle.

""It will take a few years for the rule to be finalized and wind its way up to the Supreme Court for review,"" said Adler.

""If EPA loses before the Supreme Court, it gets sent back, and EPA then gets it back to the drawing board"" – by which time Trump's term may be nearing its end.

To succeed, the high court may need to overturn its own 2007 decision that led to the Endangerment Finding.

None of the justices who wrote the majority opinion remain on the bench, while three dissenters – John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito – still serve, and could spearhead a drive to upend the original ruling.

Even then, market forces may blunt the impact of any rollback.

""Utilities making long-term investments and companies purchasing capital goods expected to be used for decades won't base those decisions on short-term policy changes,"" said John Tobin-de la Puente, a professor at Cornell University's business school.",https://media.tag24.de/1200x800/b/s/bst191i85j6w0h26ic1jjizwier5jobx.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 21:01:51.810558

Several of the new laws signed this year address environmental, agricultural and wildlife-related issues in Vermont, including big game violations, nuisance suits against farmers, water pollution, forever chemicals and financial support for communities recovering from disasters.

Below are explanations on five environmental, agricultural and wildlife-related laws that took effect or began to take effect this summer.

The bill to law process will begin again in January, when lawmakers reconvene in Montpelier for the next legislative session and second half of the biennium.

Increasing big game violation fines, pond slider turtle crack down, more

What it does: Act 47 covers wide-ranging topics related to fish and wildlife laws. The act amends the definition of a big game violation and increases the penalties for it. For first-time offenders, the new minimum fine is $500, up from $400, and the new maximum fine is $2,000, up from $1,000. The maximum fine for subsequent convictions increased from $4,000 to $5,000, and the maximum prison sentence for repeat offenders increased from 60 days to 180 days. The law also repeals the state statute requiring the Department of Fish and Wildlife to compensate farmers for crop damage from deer or black bears. Additionally, it temporarily cracks down on the possession, sale and importation of pond slider turtles, save for a few exemptions, until regulations can be put into place.

The act also allows Vermonters with developmental disabilities to apply for free permanent fishing licenses and establishes Labor Day weekend as “free mentored fishing weekend,” where no more than four unlicensed anglers can fish with licensed anglers during the weekend. As of Jan. 1, 2027, the act will prohibit the “intentional” taking of reptiles or amphibians without permission from DFW. The law makes several other miscellaneous clarifications and amendments to fish and wildlife statutes.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effective dates, beginning June 5, 2025.

Protecting farmers from nuisance suits

What it does: Act 61 strengthens farmers’ protections from “nuisance suits.” The law asserts that an agricultural activity will not be considered a “nuisance” if it falls under the umbrella of “generally accepted agricultural practices” in Vermont. However, farmers must have “good standing” with the state for nuisance protections to apply. Nuisance protections also do not apply in the case of negligence or if the activity can be objectively shown to have negatively impacted one’s health, safety, welfare, use or enjoyment of the property. The plaintiff has the burden of proof and must have attempted to resolve the matter with the farmer via mediation at least once before bringing a court action.

When it goes into effect: July 1, 2025.

Improving compliance with federal Clean Water Act

What it does: Act 67 seeks to help bring Vermont into compliance with the federal Clean Water Act, which dictates how states must regulate water quality and the discharge of pollutants into water. The Act aims to clarify the responsibilities of the two state agencies that regulate agricultural water quality on farms, the Agency of NaturalResources and the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency determined Vermont was in violation of the Clean Water Act for not adhering to farm pollution regulations, especially those governing concentrated animal feeding operations (e.g. facilities with a large number of animals held in confined spaces).

When it goes into effect: July 1, 2025.

Phasing out PFAS products

What it does: Act 54 sets in motion bans on the sale and distribution of several consumer products with “intentionally added” PFAS – also known as “forever chemicals,” which can cause serious health issues – including cleaning products, dental floss, fluorine treated containers, firefighting personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators and respirator equipment. Vermont currently bans PFAS from items like food packaging and residential carpets and rugs, and is phasing out the chemicals in menstrual products, cookware and more.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effect dates, beginning July 1.

Financial support for flood-impacted communities

What it does: Act 57 provides greater financial leeway to Vermont communities recovering from disasters, such as the 2023 and 2024 floods. Under this law, municipalities will have five years to pay off emergency loans (versus just a year previously), can repay the loans in smaller chunks at the beginning of their repayment plan, can keep more revenue from their local option taxes, can set aside “unassigned funds"" for future emergencies and more.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effective dates, beginning June 11.

At the Africa Policy Dialogue (APD) Kickoff Workshop on “Catalyzing Green Jobs Through Low Carbon Transition” held on July 24, 2025, at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, Halilu’s vision resonated with attendees, igniting hope for young Nigerians, women, and rural communities eager for economic opportunities in a greener economy.

Constitution review must facilitate national unity, good governance, economic growth – Gov Yusuf

SPONSOR AD

The workshop, co-organized by the House of Representatives Committee on Renewable Energy, the Inclusive Knowledge Platform, and Advocacy for Policy and Innovation (API), brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and advocates to craft a sustainable framework for Nigeria’s low-carbon transition.

Represented by Dr. Yahaya Tanko, Head of NASENI’s Impact Desk, Halilu outlined a transformative agenda that places people—especially youth and women—at the heart of Nigeria’s green revolution.

At just 32, Halilu, the youngest leader in NASENI’s history, is redefining the agency’s role as a catalyst for job creation and environmental sustainability. Through Dr. Tanko, he shared NASENI’s ambitious projects, including Africa’s largest renewable energy industrial park, solar-powered smart irrigation systems, compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion and training centers, solar panel manufacturing plants, electric vehicle (EV) assembly lines, and energy-saving cooking stove production facilities. These initiatives, he emphasized, are not just about technology but about transforming lives.

“Every solar panel we produce, every irrigation system we install, every electric vehicle we assemble is a job created, a family empowered, and a community uplifted,” Dr. Tanko relayed on Halilu’s behalf.

With a projected 1.5 million direct and indirect green jobs, NASENI’s efforts are poised to reshape Nigeria’s economic landscape, particularly for young people and women who represent 60% and 27-37% of the renewable energy workforce, respectively.

NASENI’s projects align with Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, aiming for 30% renewable energy by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2060.

The establishment of solar panel manufacturing and EV assembly plants is tackling Nigeria’s over-reliance on imported equipment, a critical barrier to the renewable energy sector’s growth. Halilu stressed the need for local manufacturing incentives, warning, “Unless the proposed Nigeria Green Jobs Bill provides incentives to local manufacturers of solar panels, the renewable energy sector of the country won’t develop.”

His call for policy support resonated with attendees, including Hon. Afam Ogene, Chairman of the House Committee on Renewable Energy, who championed the National Inclusive Green Jobs Act (NIGJA) to ensure job quotas for youth and women.

Halilu’s vision extends beyond job creation to long-term sustainability. Through Dr. Tanko, he urged the workshop to develop a robust framework to safeguard renewable energy investments, emphasizing collaboration between government, private sector, and academia. “NASENI is not just building technology; we’re building systems that turn ideas into jobs and dreams into reality,” Tanko said, echoing Halilu’s 3C Strategic Framework of Creation, Collaboration, and Commercialization.

The dialogue highlighted the challenges Nigeria faces, including a 50% skills gap in the renewable energy sector and weak policy support for local manufacturing. Yet, Halilu’s leadership offers hope. By fostering partnerships with international investors from China and Germany and expanding NASENI’s solar manufacturing capacity from 22 to 50 megawatts—with plans to reach 100 megawatts at the end of 2025—he is positioning Nigeria as a renewable energy hub.

Halilu’s bold leadership at NASENI is lighting the way. His commitment to inclusive green jobs is not just a policy—it’s a promise to millions of Nigerians dreaming of a brighter, greener future. With the National Inclusive Green Jobs Act on the horizon and NASENI’s innovative projects gaining momentum, Halilu is proving that Nigeria can lead Africa’s green revolution, one job, one life, one community at a time.",https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NASENI.png,N,,2025-07-26 18:02:54.623703

Welcome back to another episode of TEN – Transport Evolved News! Thanks for being here!

While today’s show has its fair share of bad news, we’re gonna start with something to make electric motorcycle fans smile — Energica is back from the dead! Or at least, it’s no longer making death-saving throws.

The Italian electric motorcycle maker fell into insolvency late last year under its U.S. owner Ideanomics, leaving fans and customers in limbo. But this week, Energica’s YouTube channel shared some exciting news: a group of Singapore-based investors has made an offer to buy its assets and pull it out of court-ordered bankruptcy. The company says the investors are “enthusiasts that believe in and share the common values of Energica.” There are still hurdles ahead, but the court process is expected to wrap up in about sixty days. Watch this space — after all, every spell has a cast time.

Mercedes-Benz has confirmed it’s halting all EV sales in the U.S. come September 1 — and it’s already closed its U.S. order books.

This week, a spokesperson confirmed no Mercedes-Benz EVs — domestic or imported — will be sold in the U.S. from now on – at least, for now. That includes EQE and EQS models, even though some are built in Alabama. Mercedes will keep building EVs here — it’s just not going to sell them to U.S. customers. While it hasn’t directly blamed the White House, the timing is convenient, as the move aligns with the end of the U.S. Federal Tax Credits for EVs, which, ironically, Mercedes-Benz EVs didn’t even qualify for. Given Benz’s less-than-stellar EV sales lately, it’s not hard to see this as a convenient excuse. But hey, if you still want one, it’s slashing prices by as much as fifteen grand to clear out the last examples.

We love covering renewable energy and grid decarbonization, so when a massive new solar farm gets the green light, it’s worth celebrating.

This week, a six hundred megawatt utility-scale solar farm was greenlit in Texas. Already under construction, it’s expected to cost nine hundred million dollars and produce enough sun-juice to power half a million homes — at least on paper. But don’t be fooled. Canadian oil and gas giant Enbridge owns the facility and confirmed to electrek this week that every watt from the facility will be sold to Meta. Yup, Meta’s server farms — including its AI systems — are gobbling six hundred megawatts… just so Meta can say its green. Remember, big tech isn’t your friend — and while they flex their eco-credentials, everyone else’s grid stays more polluted.

General Motors posted second quarter results this week, beating Wall Street predictions with revenue of forty-seven point one billion dollars but earnings of three point zero four billion — down thirty-five percent year on year.

GM blamed over one billion dollars in lost earnings on President Trump’s tariffs and said it expects the third quarter to be worse. Still, Q2 EV sales jumped one hundred and eleven percent from this time last year, with GM vehicles now making up sixteen percent of all U.S. EV sales. Strong sellers include the GMC Sierra and Hummer EVs, with Cadillac’s lineup making up over a quarter of Cadillac’s sales. As for Chevrolet? The Equinox EV alone saw triple-digit growth, proving strong demand for affordable EVs still exists. With the next-generation Bolt EV coming later this year and future LMR battery tech promising cost savings, GM is painting a rosy picture for its shareholders. We’ll just have to wait and see how it plays out.

As my last story showed, demand for affordable EVs is strong in a market obsessed with adding costly features and complexity.

In the last year, we’ve seen Ford, GM, and Volkswagen already committed to more budget-friendly EVs — and this week, Subaru joined them. Autocar reports Subaru’s global EV product manager saying the company — which has just unveiled the Uncharted EV (a rebadged Toyota C-HR) — is considering a lower-priced model below its newest EV to better compete in Europe’s subcompact segment. We have zero details on what the vehicle could be or what it will offer in terms of specs, but since Subaru currently relies on Toyota for its EVs, any future budget model will likely be Toyota underneath.

As regulars know, I’m a big fan of using EVs for emergency backup power and to help stabilize the grid, reducing reliance on expensive, polluting peaker plants.

This week, a new project launched on the U.S. East Coast aiming to do just that: the first-ever grid reliability program, a joint venture between ChargeScape and PSEG Long Island. For those who don’t know, ChargeScape — jointly owned by BMW, Honda, Ford, and Nissan — uses AI grid analysis to dynamically control EV charging. Under this program, Ford and BMW customers in the PSEG Long Island area can enroll their EVs for grid support via both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and smart charging.In return, participants will receive various financial incentives.

The Governor of California has just signed two new bills into law that change electric bicycle regulations in the state.

AB 5-4-5 revises existing laws banning modifications that let e-bikes exceed legal speed limits — currently twenty miles per hour for class one and two e-bikes, and twenty-eight miles per hour for class three. The revision adds software hacks to the prohibited list and includes substantial penalties.The other bill, AB 5-4-4, clarifies U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission guidelines on reflectors. It now mandates all e-bikes used in California must have a rear red reflector or flashing rear light visible from five hundred feet (one hundred and fifty-two meters) when illuminated by another vehicle’s headlights. Since most other countries around the world already have rules like this…welcome to the party, California.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) just released a report on global renewable energy costs — and the news is very positive.

Last year, solar power was, on average, forty-one percent cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel, with onshore wind even cheaper at fifty-three percent. Of the five hundred and eighty-two gigawatts of renewables added to the grid last year, ninety-one percent — about five hundred and twenty-nine point six gigawatts — cost substantially less than any fossil fuel generation commissioned last year. Grid-tied utility-scale battery systems are also ninety-three percent cheaper than fifteen years ago, showing renewables are unstoppable. At least, they are except in the U.S., where President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy is cutting grid investment, cancelling permits, and propping up loss-making fossil fuel plants.

Speaking of the U.S. federal government, we heard troubling news this week about the EPA’s plan to overturn its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health.

That finding has guided EPA policy for sixteen years, but the agency is moving forward with efforts to erase it — effectively dismissing the documented impacts of human-driven climate change. Backing this up, a new letter from NHTSA to automakers revealed this week that the government is wiping away all penalties accumulated since 2022 for missing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (or CAFE) targets. This stems from a clause in the recent “One Big Beautiful Bill” that reduces all CAFE fines to zero, while simultaneously cutting incentives and programs aimed at encouraging cleaner vehicles and a move away from fossil fuels.

And after all of that, you might feel like you need some good news, and fam, I’ve got it for you. Not one, but two real-world EVs proving that EVs don’t need a new battery every few years.

Enter a Volkswagen ID.3 Pro S that’s been in the care of the German Automobile Club (or ADAC) for the past four years. It just received its official health check for crossing more than one hundred and sixty thousand kilometers (or one hundred thousand miles), and its battery state of health sits at ninety-one percent — that means it still retains ninety-one percent of its original battery capacity.Meanwhile, a twenty twenty-two Mustang Mach-E, used as a ride-hailing vehicle for more than a quarter million miles in and around Santa Cruz, California, was just given a ninety percent state of health report by one of Ford’s in-house Mustang Mach-E Engineers. So next time someone comes at you with tired FUD about EV batteries not lasting, just tell them about those two EVs!

And those are your news shorts! There will be more next week!

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the US — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through the process of getting solar panels installed, or getting a heat pump installed. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on the roof of our home, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union that allowed us to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit program— will disappear very soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it is super important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support the show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

For some time, solid-state batteries have been the holy grail of EV packs. They offer greater electrochemical stability than current lithium-ion tech, along with impressive energy and power densities.

Mercedes-Benz is among the automakers betting big on solid-state. This week, Markus Schäfer, the brand’s head of development, spoke with AutomobilWoche about the solid-state battery EQS prototype being tested in collaboration with U.S. company Factorial Energy. Early test results are very promising, and Mercedes says it expects to scale production of solid-state packs by the end of this decade.With potential range improvements of up to twenty-five percent, solid-state tech could unlock longer-range luxury and performance EVs — alongside more affordable smaller models.

And finally,

I don’t know about you, but when I travel for work and need to rent a car, I always worry I’ll get something large and unwieldy.

These days, I usually find an EV option, but it’s often a bigger model—an SUV or pickup—that’s frankly stressful to drive in an unfamiliar city. If you feel the same way, and you a re heading to Zurich or Bern, Switzerland, you’ll be happy to hear that Europcar has signed a deal with local automaker Microlino to add its compact two-seat microcar to it rental fleet. Perfect for zipping around an unfamiliar city, these pint-sized EVs cost CHF 39.90 per day, including unlimited mileage and charging. It’s still a little pricey, but it beats the hundreds of dollars you might pay renting a U.S. car after declining endless waivers at the local rental counter. Good job, Microlino—and good job, Europcar!

And on that note, we are done for today’s show!

A massive thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring the show.

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we would really appreciate it. I don’t know if you saw our livestream this week but we – like so many other YouTube channels – are being abused left right, and centre by the platform. Our revenue is dropping and the number of ads being squeezed into our videos is soaring, which itself drives video views away. Add to that an algorithm whose sole purpose is seemingly to make you angry and stay on the platform, and we’re not seeing our videos shared, and we’re not seeing income from those videos. If we can’t make up for that loss in ad revenue that so many of our colleagues are suffering – we, like other channels of late, will have no choice but to… not exist. So we need your support more now than ever. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand-ish subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month in our direction, would put us in a much better financial position.

Don’t forget we’re also available for third-party video production work in the Portland, Oregon area, and you can find our latest merch — including our Pride designs — at the merch store. Links below, and on our website at https://www.transportevolved.com . Also down below, you’ll find an Amazon affiliate link that helps support the channel when you use it.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

I just want to thank all of you if you’re watching today and the video has seemed a little jumpy and if there have been strange noises in the background: the Teleprompter has been misbehaving and I’m on my own in the studio today and haven’t had anyone to help fix it – and..err.. the local utility company has been doing construction work outside of the studio all day – and we don’t have soundproof windows. Sorry!

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what anyone says or tries to convince you. Living your authentic life, or coming from a different place or a different culture is not, as some are claiming, a sin.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power, usually those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. And at this time in historys, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

If you need to rest or step back, I also want you to know that’s okay. Take care of yourself. Then, when you’re ready, stand up for decency, community, and justice. Come back, peacefully, together, build connections that celebrate every voice, embrace diversity, and learn from the past to shape a better future.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be that positive change you want to see in the world. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

The newly introduced Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund is set to provide personalised career advice along with financial support for training.
This will open doors for workers looking to move into emerging fields such as offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture.
Through funds like the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, the Scottish Government has already committed over £120 million to the North East.
“The shift to sustainable energy generation and transmission represents a generational opportunity, and this funding will assist workers in making the most of their expertise in that growing sector.","Oil and gas workers in the North East are being offered new hope as a fresh initiative launches to help them pivot toward careers in the sustainable energy sector. The newly introduced Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund is set to provide personalised career advice along with financial support for training. This will open doors for workers looking to move into emerging fields such as offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture.

Around 200 individuals in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire are expected to benefit from the programme, which aims to equip them with the skills needed for jobs in the green energy space. The fund was designed through a collaboration between the Scottish Government and the UK Government’s Regional Skills Pilot, a £900,000 scheme explicitly targeted at the region. Delivery will be handled by Skills Development Scotland, with an additional £40,000 contribution coming from the Scottish Government.

This is part of a broader push to support a just transition to net zero. Through funds like the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, the Scottish Government has already committed over £120 million to the North East. These investments are helping to generate green jobs, foster innovation, and ensure the region’s workforce remains at the forefront of energy expertise for years to come.

Cabinet Secretary for Climate Action and Energy Gillian Martin said: “The North East has long been a titan in the oil and gas industry, and the valuable expertise within our workforce must be at the heart of the transition to new fuels and sustainable energy.

“This new Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund will support offshore workers to take on roles in the sustainable energy sector and has been designed and developed by the Scottish Government, supported by funding from the UK Government’s Regional Skills Pilot for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, and will be delivered by Skills Development Scotland.

“I am determined to ensure a positive impact and powerful legacy of Scotland’s clean energy revolution, which benefits communities across the North East of the country.”

Skills Development Scotland Chair Frank Mitchell said: “Scotland’s oil and gas workforce possesses a broad range of skills and experience, which is vital to the continued growth of the renewable energy sector.

“The shift to sustainable energy generation and transmission represents a generational opportunity, and this funding will assist workers in making the most of their expertise in that growing sector.

“Our careers advisers are available for anyone who needs support in considering their options, or whether applying for the fund is right for them.”

UK Government Minister for Energy Michael Shanks said: “Aberdeen has been the energy capital of Britain for decades, and while oil and gas will be with us for decades to come, we are determined to make sure that workers are supported to access the thousands of jobs in industries such as offshore wind and carbon capture.

“This funding will help deliver a fair and prosperous transition in the North Sea, unlocking the full potential of renewable energy and reaping the economic benefits from the skills and experiences of Aberdeen’s workforce.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_81edbbc97b4e402bba95354cffac8a99~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/11062b_81edbbc97b4e402bba95354cffac8a99~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-26 18:02:58.209279

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Albany Times Union

ALBANY — It’s now the public’s turn to weigh in on New York’s energy future, including environmental goals, rising electricity costs and the impending demand of the massive power requirements for artificial intelligence and chip fab plants.

A panel of state officials unanimously agreed Wednesday to release a draft of a 15 year state energy plan for public comment.

The plan was drafted by the State Energy Planning Board. The board’s 14 members include state agency commissioners, the State University of New York chancellor, leaders of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Public Service Commission, a representative of Con Edison and the head of the New York Independent System Operator, which manages and ensures the reliability of the state’s power grid.

The draft energy plan is not limited to just electricity projections, and also provided recommendations on public health, transportation and a confluence of related sectors.

“Energy systems are central to quality of life and economic growth, but also a grid that is affordable and reliable and clean,” said Doreen M. Harris, the authority’s president and CEO. “When you look at the plan, it is taking an objective look at how to achieve those various outcomes, each of which has significance with respect to the future of our state.”

Comments on the plan were universally positive at Wednesday’s meeting of the state Energy Planning Board, with agency leaders praising different components of the proposal.

“I’m very grateful for the collaboration that went into this effort to ensure that New York continues to stand up for a strong economy, for affordability and, of course, protecting our environment and our communities that rely on it,” said Amanda Lefton, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

Officials also cited the plan as essential to crafting the state’s energy policy in the wake of a measure passed by Republicans in Congress gutting renewable energy tax credits.

“We’re in a federal landscape that’s shifting in previously unimaginable ways, shifts that not only threaten our ability to address climate change and meet our energy needs, but serve to potentially negatively impact the economic wellbeing of the state,” said Rory M. Christian, chair and CEO of the Public Service Commission.

The proposal can be found on the New York Energy Plan website.

There are nine public hearings scheduled on the draft plan in August and September. One of the hearings is scheduled to take place in Albany on Sept. 10. Locations for the hearings haven’t been announced. Members of the public will also be able to submit written testimony until Oct. 6 on the plan’s site.

After the public comment period ends, the panel will vote on an updated plan including public feedback and updated recommendations factoring in the recent Republican spending and tax legislation.",https://waynetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Smart-meter-image-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:03:16.950840

Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told the ABC he thought that despite previous emissions fluctuations, the country would continue to reduce its carbon output.
""We have entered a new phase of China's emissions, a phase that features a stabilisation of China's emissions and increasingly large-scale integration of China's renewable energy power, which, I hope, will actually make the country reduce its emissions from this point on.""
Dr Gosens said China's increasing wind and solar power generation, combined with increasing domestic supplies of coal, created a ""double whammy"" for Australian coal exports.
He said that would tell the world a lot about where the global appetite to reduce emissions was at.","Climate experts say China's carbon emissions may have peaked, which could affect global climate targets, the fight against global warming — and the Australian coal industry.

China is currently the world's biggest emitter, accounting for some 30 per cent of global carbon emissions, but a report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) found that in the year to May 2025, China's CO2 emissions dropped 1.6 per cent.

China policy expert at CREA Belinda Schäpe said the trend had also continued in the months since.

Ms Schäpe told the ABC the finding was ""really unique"" because the only other times the country had recorded a year-on-year decline in CO2 emissions were during times of economic downturn, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's really quite a historic result,"" Ms Schäpe said.

""It's due to a really rapid increase in renewables build-out in China that has translated into an increase in power generation coming from clean sources and driving down the coal share in the power mix, and with that, bringing down emissions.""

She said China led the world in green energy uptake.

""In May [2025] alone, China built out 90 gigawatts of solar capacity, which is really huge. It translates to roughly 100 solar panels per second.

""We are now at a point where solar and wind capacity is actually bigger than all thermal power capacity. So not only coal, but also including gas, oil and other fossil fuel sectors.""

Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told the ABC he thought that despite previous emissions fluctuations, the country would continue to reduce its carbon output.

""It certainly suggests that after three decades of very rapid economic growth, and also growth in China's emissions, the emission peak point for China has come very close, if it has not happened already,"" Mr Li said.

""We have entered a new phase of China's emissions, a phase that features a stabilisation of China's emissions and increasingly large-scale integration of China's renewable energy power, which, I hope, will actually make the country reduce its emissions from this point on.""

If the world is to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere needs to come down, not stabilise, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Climate experts say a failure to limit global warming below that figure will result in catastrophic consequences for people and the planet.

China still building new coal plants

Despite the rapid installation of renewable energy plants across the country, China is still building new coal-fired power plants.

Beijing approved on average two coal-powered projects a week in 2022 and 2023, after power shortages in 2021.

Loading...

Belinda Schäpe said a backlog of these projects was now coming online, but they were using less coal.

""There's been a significant drop in coal imports … in June, there was a 25 per cent year-on-year drop in coal imports,"" she said.

""In June, China's power demand growth was actually 70 per cent higher than last year this time around, but solar and wind power generation met 89 per cent of that power demand growth.

""That's what we've been seeing over the last six months, really, where renewables, or solar and wind in particular, accounted for 24 per cent of total electricity generation.

'The writing is on the wall'

Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to continue phasing down the country's coal consumption in the next five years, between 2026 and 2030.

Jorrit Gosens, a climate change and energy policy fellow at the Australian National University, said Australia needed to rethink the future of coal mines.

""The writing is on the wall a little bit in the future economic potential of that industry,"" he said.

China imports roughly 30 per cent of Australian thermal coal exports, making it Australia's largest market.

Dr Gosens said China's increasing wind and solar power generation, combined with increasing domestic supplies of coal, created a ""double whammy"" for Australian coal exports.

""It should be expected that those export volumes will continue to decrease over the next few years.""

Other Asian markets of Australian coal, such as South Korea and Japan, would follow suit as they decarbonised, he said.

Dr Gosens pointed to the Mt Arthur coal mine in NSW, for which BHP could not find a buyer because of the shrinking demand of coal and its liabilities, like rehabilitation costs.

He said local community leaders and the federal government needed to transition communities historically reliant on coal mines into other industries.

""Currently, we're still seeing more resistance to change than embracing of that transition, which I think is a risky strategy given the demand for our product is not going to be determined by those local communities or by the federal government,"" he said.

""Our best bet really is to make sure that there are viable alternatives for when it does get to that point.""

Trump's America 'decoupling' from China on climate

US President Donald Trump's policy agenda has seen green energy subsidies replaced with coal subsidies.

Li Shou said it was clear that the two countries were now on different paths.

He said some conservative forces within China may use the US's withdrawal from clean energy as motivation ""for domestic inaction"", but he was confident that it would not change the country's policy direction.

""China has over the last decade or so become the superpower when it comes to wind technology — deploying and manufacturing wind, solar batteries and electric vehicles,"" he said.

""This will not change because of what is happening or not happening in the US and if anything, Beijing will just continue with this green path because doing these things is ultimately in the country's long-term economic interest.

""There has been a realisation on the Chinese side that they should continue and double down on their climate and environmental agenda, not because of the global situation and the US situation, but just for their own sake, to clean up the skies in major Chinese cities.""

China is set to announce its new climate reduction targets as part of the Paris agreement later this year.

He said that would tell the world a lot about where the global appetite to reduce emissions was at.

""Whether China chooses to coordinate with some of the other geopolitical powers will also tell us a lot about where the global climate agenda stands and to what extent countries, including China and Australia and the European Union, can still engage,"" Mr Li said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5bbcc310c8edfb8762b131d62dfeaf94?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=316&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-26 17:01:28.961977

Enbridge Inc. has made a significant move in the renewable energy sector by reaching a final investment decision on the Clear Fork solar project in Texas. The 600-megawatt (MW) solar facility, located near San Antonio, will be supplied entirely by Meta Platforms, Inc., which has signed a long-term contract for 100% of the renewable output. The project is expected to enter service in the summer of 2027, with an estimated cost of $900 million.

Enbridge's Executive Vice President Matthew Akman highlighted the growing demand for renewable power from blue-chip companies, stating, ""Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data center operations"" [1]. The project is anticipated to be accretive to Enbridge's cash flow and earnings per share starting in 2027.

Meta, known for its platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is committed to sustainability and has been a significant corporate purchaser of renewable energy. The company has previously stated that it aims to reach net-zero emissions across its operational portfolio by 2020, primarily through matching 100% of its data center usage with renewable energy [2]. The Clear Fork solar plant is part of Meta's ongoing efforts to support its operations with clean energy.

The project's timeline aligns with the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which requires wind and solar projects to be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the altered investment tax credit. This has prompted utility companies to accelerate their renewable energy projects to ensure they meet the new criteria [3].

Enbridge's investment in Clear Fork is part of its broader strategy to expand its renewable energy portfolio. The company's commitment to Indigenous partnerships is also evident, as seen in the recent acquisition by Stonlasec8 Indigenous Alliance Limited, representing 38 Indigenous communities in British Columbia, of a 12.5% ownership interest in Enbridge’s Westcoast natural gas pipeline system [1].

Wind Power Posts Strong Gains

Wind energy also posted significant growth, with installed capacity rising by 140%, from 21 GW to 51.7 GW. The momentum strengthens India’s position as one of the fastest-growing wind energy markets globally.

Investment Momentum Accelerates

Renewables attracted the lion’s share of power sector funding, with 83% of 2024 investments channeled into clean energy. India secured $2.4 billion in global energy development finance in a single year. Foreign direct investment (FDI) since 2020 has topped ₹1.6 lakh crore, including ₹42,000 crore in 2023 alone.

Low Cost: Onshore wind now costs less than $50 per MWh on average.","A life cycle assessment tracks every stage of a turbine’s life. It starts when raw materials are mined. Then factories shape steel, fiberglass, and plastic. Next, ships and trucks carry parts to the site. Builders use cranes and machinery to install towers and blades. Crews maintain turbines for decades. Finally, old parts are recycled or sent to disposal. Each stage adds carbon emissions.

Mining: Iron ore, copper, and other metals.

Manufacturing: Factories use energy to mold blades and towers.

Transport: Trucks and ships burn fuel.

Construction: Cranes and machines work on site.

Maintenance: Technicians use tools and vehicles.

End of Life: Recycling or disposal of parts.

Most studies find turbines emit 5–26 grams of CO₂‑equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO₂‑eq/kWh). That is a small amount compared to fossil fuels. Larger turbines often score lower because they spread emissions over more clean power.

Carbon Payback Time

Payback time is how long a turbine takes to make as much clean energy as the emissions it caused. Most turbines repay their carbon debt in just 6–12 months. After that, every kilowatt-hour is almost free of carbon cost. That is key because turbines last two to three decades. So most of their life brings only clean power.

Fast payback helps grid operators plan for quick climate gains. New wind farms can cut the need for old, polluting coal plants. This switch makes grids cleaner right away.

Comparison with Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuel plants burn coal or gas every hour. They release carbon at high rates. Wind turbines only emit during their build and transport. Once spinning, they add near-zero carbon. The gap is huge.

Energy Source gCO₂‑eq/kWh Wind (Onshore) 5–26 Natural Gas 437–758 Coal 675–1,689

Each new wind farm slashes more carbon than any new coal or gas plant could. That is why many countries boost wind capacity first.

Wind Energy in Europe

Europe leads in wind power. In 2024, renewables made up 47% of EU electricity. Wind alone was 17%. Solar and wind together reached 29%. Coal dropped below 10%. These changes cut EU power emissions by 24% in 2023. They also saved over $60 billion in fuel costs.

Renewable share: 47% in 2024

Wind share: 17% in 2024

Emissions drop: 24% in 2023

Jobs: 400,000 in wind sector

EU programs like the Green Deal and Net-Zero Industry Act support growth. Many major turbine makers are based in Europe. That helps local jobs and exports.

Five Key Facts

The clean energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it's a present reality.","The Pacific Northwest is undergoing a seismic shift in its energy landscape, driven by surging industrial demand, regulatory tailwinds, and the urgent need for decarbonization. Amid this transformation, Portland General Electric (PGE) has emerged as a standout player, leveraging strategic investments, regulatory agility, and technological innovation to outperform peers and position itself as a leader in the clean energy transition.

Earnings Outperformance and Industrial Load Growth

PGE's Q2 2025 results underscored its ability to navigate a complex market environment. The company reported non-GAAP net income of $73 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, reaffirming its 2025 guidance of $3.13–$3.33 per share. While GAAP net income dipped slightly from $72 million in Q2 2024, the decline was offset by robust industrial load growth. Demand from semiconductor manufacturing and data centers—driven by the energy needs of AI infrastructure—surged 16.5% quarter-over-quarter. This growth reflects PGE's successful alignment with the region's tech-driven economy, where companies like Intel and Amazon are reshaping energy consumption patterns.

The company's ability to monetize this demand is bolstered by its aggressive clean energy investments. PGE's 500 MW battery storage portfolio, including the Seaside Battery Project, is critical for balancing the intermittency of renewables while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. By 2025, these projects will position PGE to meet its 80% emissions reduction target by 2030—a timeline that outpaces many regional peers.

Regulatory Clarity and Strategic Reorganization

PGE's regulatory strategy is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. In July 2025, the company secured approval for a holding company reorganization from the Oregon Public Utilities Commission (OPUC). This structural shift is designed to streamline capital allocation, accelerate infrastructure projects, and enhance financial flexibility. By centralizing decision-making, PGE can respond more swiftly to the demands of grid modernization and the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs).

The reorganization also aligns with broader industry trends. As noted in PGE's filings, holding companies are becoming a preferred model for utilities seeking to manage the capital intensity of clean energy transitions. For example, Idaho Power, a regional competitor, has similarly pursued rate base growth through transmission infrastructure projects like the Boardman to Hemingway line. However, PGE's regulatory approach is more aggressive in leveraging federal tax credits, particularly under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to minimize customer costs. Its Seaside Battery and Distribution System Plan (DSP) cost recovery requests—approved for $46 million and $72 million annually—demonstrate a disciplined focus on affordability while securing necessary capital.

Clean Energy Transition and Grid Resilience

PGE's clean energy investments are not just about compliance—they're a competitive differentiator. The company's 2024 ESG report highlights that 45% of its energy mix already comes from non-emitting sources, a 7% annual growth rate since 2020. This progress is supported by a $1.265 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, with $135 million allocated to wildfire mitigation and vegetation management. These investments are critical in a region where climate risks are escalating, and regulatory scrutiny over liability is intensifying.

In contrast, regional peers like Idaho Power are still in the early stages of integrating DERs into their long-term plans. Idaho Power's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) emphasizes hydropower as a core asset, with supplementary investments in transmission and battery storage. While this approach prioritizes cost stability, it lacks the urgency and scale of PGE's renewable integration. The latter's AI-driven tools for load forecasting and predictive maintenance further enhance operational efficiency, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Comparative Advantages and Investment Implications

PGE's strategic positioning is evident in its ability to balance growth, affordability, and sustainability. Its dividend yield of ~3.2%—maintained despite reinvestment in infrastructure—signals confidence in its financial resilience. The company's five-year debt-to-equity ratio of ~1.0x and $1 billion in liquidity provide a buffer against rising interest rates and commodity volatility, which are pressing concerns for less capitalized peers.

Investors should also consider PGE's historical performance. From 2022 to 2025, the stock has shown a 63.64% win rate in three-day returns and 81.82% in 30-day returns post-earnings reports. Analysts project a one-year price target of $45.81, reflecting a 14.27% upside from its current $40.09 level. This optimism is justified by PGE's alignment with regulatory trends, its proactive approach to decarbonization, and its ability to capture value from industrial load growth.

Conclusion: A Model for the Future

As the Pacific Northwest grapples with the dual challenges of decarbonization and industrial electrification, PGE's strategic clarity and execution provide a roadmap for success. Its regulatory agility, clean energy investments, and focus on grid resilience position it to outperform peers while delivering consistent returns to shareholders. For investors seeking exposure to a utility that balances environmental stewardship with financial discipline, PGE represents a compelling long-term opportunity.

The clean energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it's a present reality. In this new era, companies that adapt as swiftly as PGE will define the future of the sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 18:03:19.187221

San José is home to about 25 data centers at the moment, city officials said.
Some residents of the region have raised concerns about data centers popping up near their neighborhoods with little transparency around the potential impacts, which may include harm to their community’s air quality, due to the massive diesel backup generators that often support data centers during power outages.","The cold war between San José and PG&E has officially thawed, as the city and the utility company today announced a partnership aimed at attracting big power users — data centers and others of that ilk — to the South Bay.

Officials say the pact is the first of its kind in PG&E’s service area, with the utility offering assurances to the city and developers that power will be ready for 10 large data center and industrial projects in the city’s north, south and downtown areas in the coming years.

The agreement also means San José will stop pursuing the latest plans to build its own power company — something the city council authorized looking into in 2023. The exploration of the city-owned power company was born in part out of frustrations with PG&E-caused delays, shutoffs and a desire to compete for development of data centers and other advanced industrial facilities in certain portions of the city.

“There’s nothing more devastating than having an investor or an employer say, ‘You know, we really want to build that factory or that data center and bring those jobs to your city, but we’re just not sure we’re going to be able to have the power we need by the time we need it to do it,’” Mayor Matt Mahan said Friday morning at a press conference outside the gates of PG&E’s Los Esteros substation near North San José.

In an interview with KQED, Mahan said the deal will allow the city and PG&E to offer “speed and certainty” to developers to help ensure data centers stay in Silicon Valley, keeping them as paying PG&E customers and contributors to San José’s tax base.

City officials estimate each data center could generate anywhere from $3.4 million to $6.8 million in annual revenue for the city through utility and property taxes.

“What we’re really talking about here is re-engineering our service delivery model to integrate the city and the utility’s teams into one,” Mahan said. “We can actually sign an agreement that says we’ll have 100 megawatts for you at this site by this date, and we will get it done and deliver.”

The agreement hopes to take advantage of and build on 2,000 megawatts of increased power capacity, expected to be provided by two different transmission line projects from developer LS Power Grid.

The lines would run from Newark into North San José energy centers, and from a Coyote Valley terminal in South San José, to the PG&E Metcalf substation and into downtown.

Officials said PG&E will also be investing $2.6 billion into improving and expanding its infrastructure in the South Bay between 2026 and 2035, to enable more reliable delivery of that increased power to customers, large and small.

Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E, said the historic partnership is about accountability.

“We have agreed to timelines and performance requirements that the city had for us. We’re up for that. PG&E is willing to stand behind our word and do what needs to be done to serve this new growth,” Poppe said in an interview.

“Having expectations and accountability matched with this massive new demand makes it an absolutely unique opportunity to power the prosperity of tech companies, their employees, the citizens of San José and our community right here.”

One of the major projects includes an envisioned large-scale development on roughly 159 acres of public land on the property of the San José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, adjacent to Los Esteros. The facility is jointly owned by the two cities.

The utility company has committed to supplying that land with 250 megawatts of power, enough to power multiple data centers, which are often sized to use about 99 megawatts to avoid stricter oversight for projects that use 100 megawatts or more.

Manuel Pineda, a deputy city manager for San José overseeing energy projects, said having an undeveloped piece of land so large, and pairing it with an energy commitment of that magnitude, is “unheard of.”

Pineda recently rejoined San José after running Silicon Valley Power, the city-owned utility in Santa Clara, which has seen massive growth in data centers over the past several years. This demand — Santa Clara’s more than 50 data centers have eaten through about 60% of the city’s power — has forced the city to approve projects to increase capacity. Earlier this year, the city announced a 5% increase in rates for its customers.

San José is home to about 25 data centers at the moment, city officials said.

Some residents of the region have raised concerns about data centers popping up near their neighborhoods with little transparency around the potential impacts, which may include harm to their community’s air quality, due to the massive diesel backup generators that often support data centers during power outages.

Mahan and Pineda emphasized that San José’s large layout means many data centers can be located in highly industrialized areas, like the fields abutting wastewater plants and energy facilities in the city’s Alviso district.

The city’s planning commission in April approved Microsoft’s plans to build two data center buildings across a 64.5-acre site at 1657 Alviso-Milpitas Rd., just east of Los Esteros.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/07/250725-SJPOWER-JG-1_qed.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 19:02:17.914987

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump_AI_Energy_Explainer_34331-a8d00.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:25.217023

However, LGES said it expected to improve profits in the second half by boosting production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset the sluggish EV demand, while cutting or delaying investment plans.

LGES is one of the few U.S. producers of LFP batteries, a battery chemistry long dominated by Chinese rivals.

The company said it is considering converting some EV battery production lines in the United States to cater to ESS in response to slowing EV demand.

It started production of LFP batteries at its Michigan factory in May, and aims to increase production capacity of ESS batteries to over 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) by next year, up a projected 17 GWh this year.

""When LGES operates the plant at full capacity, it could generate subsidies for nearly 2 trillion won ($1.5 billion US) ... unlike EV batteries, ESS involves selling full systems rather than just battery cells, which drives up average selling prices and margins,"" said Kang Dong-jin, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.

Kang added that LGES currently stands as the only player in the U.S. market capable of supplying LFP-based ESS, giving it an advantage with virtually no competition.

LGES said its operating profit more than doubled in the second quarter, thanks to U.S. subsidies on battery production and stockpiling by some customers there ahead of potential tariffs.

It reported an operating profit of 492 billion won ($358.73 million US) for the April to June period, versus a profit of 195 billion won a year earlier.

It’s all the waiting, the bureaucracy and red tape that causes the majority of delays. We want to build as fast as we can.”

Chang said he remained hopeful that the government would deliver on its promises for planning reform, but admitted he was disappointed by the slow progress through parliament of its planning and infrastructure bill. “They’ve identified the right problem but for some reason they have not pulled through.”

Fuse was the first big challenger to launch in the sector since energy prices surged in the autumn of 2021 and through 2022, driven by a combination of increased demand after the pandemic, limited gas supply and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In late 2021 and early 2022 a significant number of small UK energy suppliers went out of business due to the dramatic rise in wholesale gas prices. The increases made it unsustainable for some suppliers to continue offering the fixed-rate tariffs they had previously advertised, and at least 28 energy companies collapsed, affecting more than four million customers who were moved to new suppliers by the energy regulator Ofgem.

Chang said he understood it might take time for Fuse to gain the trust of consumers who were scarred by the failure of smaller energy providers, including Bulb, which was sold to Octopus Energy in 2022 after its collapse the previous year.

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Grid Modernization: Prioritize companies with robust renewable integration plans and digital infrastructure, like Terna.
Renewable Storage: Allocate capital to battery storage and pumped hydro projects, particularly in regions with high solar exposure.
As temperatures continue to rise, energy infrastructure must evolve to meet surging demand and avoid catastrophic outages.
Grid modernization, renewable expansion, and innovative storage solutions are not just climate imperatives—they are the bedrock of a resilient, profitable energy future.","As global temperatures climb to record levels, energy systems are being tested like never before. The 2025 European heatwave, which pushed temperatures past 40°C in multiple regions, exposed the fragility of aging power grids. Electricity demand surged by 14% in countries like Spain, while Germany saw prices spike by 175% in a single day. These events underscore a critical truth: without modernization and strategic investment, heatwave-driven demand risks will destabilize energy markets and strain economies.

The Grid Modernization Imperative

Italy's Terna offers a blueprint for resilience. The country's transmission system operator has committed €17.7 billion over five years and €23 billion by 2040 to upgrade infrastructure. These investments aim to connect 107 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and expand cross-border exchange to 39 GW. Terna's focus on AI-driven predictive systems, IoT sensors, and Digital Twins exemplifies how digitalization can optimize grid operations. By 2030, the company also plans to launch the Mechanism for the Procurement of Electrical Storage Capacity (MACSE), targeting 71.5 GWh of storage to address renewable intermittency.

For investors, Terna's alignment with the EU's green taxonomy—99% of its projects qualify for green financing—positions it as a low-risk, high-impact player in the energy transition. However, risks such as project delays or regulatory shifts must be monitored.

Solar and Storage: Europe's Lifeline in the 2025 Heatwave

During the 2025 heatwave, EU solar generation hit a record 45 TWh in June, mitigating daytime demand surges. Germany's solar fleet provided 33–39% of its electricity during peak hours, supported by 14 GW of battery storage. This highlights a dual strategy: scaling renewables while deploying storage to manage evening peaks.

Battery storage is no longer a niche asset. During the heatwave, price spreads exceeded 400 €/MWh, creating arbitrage opportunities for storage operators. The U.S. has seen similar dynamics, with coal and gas generation temporarily rising by 1.4% to meet cooling demand in 2024. Clean flexibility—via storage, interconnection, and demand-side management—is key to avoiding blackouts.

Innovation in Grid Resilience

The UK's Distributed ReStart project demonstrates how grid-forming inverters can restart the grid post-blackout using renewables. These inverters, capable of operating without external voltage, are critical for creating “energy islands” that stabilize systems during crises. Meanwhile, Poland's Transmission System Operator (PSE) is pushing for real-time data access from distributed energy sources and dynamic tariffs to manage load.

System services markets, such as inertia and voltage control markets in the UK and Germany, are accelerating the adoption of these technologies. Investors should watch companies like Siemens Energy and ABB, which supply grid-forming inverters and smart grid solutions.

The Investment Case

The data is clear: heatwave-driven demand will grow by 5.2%–20.3% by 2050 under current climate scenarios. To mitigate this, three investment themes stand out:

1. Grid Modernization: Prioritize companies with robust renewable integration plans and digital infrastructure, like Terna.

2. Renewable Storage: Allocate capital to battery storage and pumped hydro projects, particularly in regions with high solar exposure.

3. Interconnection Solutions: Support cross-border transmission projects, which help balance supply and demand across regions.

The EU's 2030 target of 60% renewable electricity and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for storage further validate this strategy. However, investors must also consider geographic diversification to hedge against regional climate risks.

Conclusion

The 2025 heatwave was a wake-up call. As temperatures continue to rise, energy infrastructure must evolve to meet surging demand and avoid catastrophic outages. Grid modernization, renewable expansion, and innovative storage solutions are not just climate imperatives—they are the bedrock of a resilient, profitable energy future.

For investors, the message is clear: prioritize companies and projects that align with grid resilience and climate adaptation.","The recent Dominion Energy outage in West Ashley, South Carolina, serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of aging power grids in the face of climate-driven disruptions. On Thursday, July 10, 2025, a single tree falling on overhead power lines caused a cascading outage affecting 1,641 customers, darkened traffic signals, and forced emergency crews to scramble. While Dominion restored power within two hours, the incident underscores a broader crisis: the U.S. electrical grid is increasingly vulnerable to both natural and technological shocks, from extreme weather to surging demand from data centers and AI infrastructure.

This vulnerability is not isolated to Charleston. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has flagged a growing risk from “near-miss” events, including sudden disconnections by data centers during voltage fluctuations and transformer failures in Texas. These disruptions highlight a critical inflection point: as climate change intensifies and digital infrastructure expands, grid modernization is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. For investors, this creates a unique opportunity to capitalize on utilities and infrastructure bonds positioned to lead the transition to resilient, climate-adapted energy systems.

The Grid Modernization Gold Rush

Federal and state governments are accelerating investments to fortify the grid. The U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program has already allocated $7.6 billion in 2025 for projects like underground power lines, battery storage, and microgrids. Meanwhile, California's Proposition 4 climate bond—a $10 billion initiative—dedicates $1.2 billion to coastal resilience and $325 million to transmission infrastructure, prioritizing projects that reduce wildfire risks and integrate renewable energy.

These programs are reshaping the energy landscape. For example, Dominion Energy's $2.5 billion Strategic Underground Program in Virginia has reduced storm-related outages by 40%, demonstrating the ROI of grid hardening. Similarly, Southern Spirit Transmission's $360 million HVDC line between Texas and the Southeast will enhance reliability during peak demand. Investors who recognize these trends early stand to benefit from a $500 billion grid modernization boom.

Undervalued Utilities: The New Energy Titans

Several utilities are emerging as key players in this transition.

Eversource Energy (ESV)

Why Invest? Eversource is a regional leader in grid resilience, with a $1.2 billion modernization budget in New England. Its demand response programs have already cut 44,000 kg of CO₂ emissions during peak periods, and its forward P/E of 22.13 and 3.19% dividend yield make it a compelling value play.

NextEra Energy (NEE)

Why Invest? With a $153 billion market cap, NextEra is pioneering offshore wind and solar integration. Its $15 billion debt issuance for undergrounding 1,230 miles of high-risk lines aligns with regulatory mandates, while its P/E of 27.99 reflects growth potential.

Avangrid (AGR)

Why Invest? A subsidiary of Iberdrola, Avangrid is investing $20 billion in grid modernization by 2030, including 16% year-over-year supplier investment growth. At a P/E of 24.8 and 3.5% yield, it's undervalued relative to its clean energy pipeline.

ConEdison (CONED)

Why Invest? ConEd's $100 million AI-focused investments, including tools like AiDASH for infrastructure monitoring, position it as a leader in data-driven grid resilience. Its 4.65% dividend yield and P/E of 21.33 make it a blue-chip staple.

Infrastructure Bonds: A Stable, Long-Term Play

For investors seeking fixed-income exposure, infrastructure bonds tied to grid modernization offer attractive yields and alignment with climate goals. California's Proposition 4 bond, for instance, allocates $850 million to clean energy projects and $325 million to transmission upgrades, with a 40% allocation to disadvantaged communities. Similarly, the U.S. Climate Alliance's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is financing microgrids and battery storage in states like New York and Washington.

These bonds are particularly appealing due to their low volatility and long-duration cash flows. For example, Proposition 4's $10 billion spending plan spans through 2039–40, providing a predictable funding stream for grantees and bondholders alike.

The Case for Smart Grid ETFs

For diversified exposure, ETFs like the Fidelity MSCI Energy Infrastructure ETF (FENY) offer broad access to the sector. FENY has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, driven by electrification and AI-driven demand for energy. Niche ETFs targeting smart grid technologies—such as those focusing on Siemens Energy's 5G-enabled meters or Enphase Energy's IQ Energy Management System—also provide high-growth opportunities, albeit with higher volatility.

The Bottom Line: Buy Resilience, Not Risk

The Dominion Energy outage in West Ashley is a microcosm of a systemic challenge: aging grids, surging demand, and climate-driven volatility. Yet, this crisis is also an opportunity. Utilities like Eversource, NextEra, and ConEd are leading the charge in modernization, while infrastructure bonds and ETFs offer stable, scalable ways to participate in the transition.

For investors, the message is clear: prioritize companies and projects that align with grid resilience and climate adaptation. As AI and data centers drive energy demand higher, the winners will be those who build the infrastructure to support them—without breaking the grid.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 17:02:48.725809

With a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share (a 7.2% year-over-year decline) and revenue guidance of $4.76 billion (a 3.9% YoY increase), AEP's performance will hinge on its ability to balance robust demand growth with cost pressures from infrastructure restoration and adverse weather. For investors, understanding these dynamics is key to assessing the utility's near-term resilience and long-term strategic positioning.

Sector-Specific Drivers: Demand Growth and Rate Revisions

AEP's revenue trajectory is being propelled by several structural and cyclical factors. Warmer-than-normal weather in most of its service territories has spurred a surge in cooling demand, a predictable seasonal tailwind for utilities. This is compounded by industrial load growth, particularly in energy-intensive sectors such as data centers and manufacturing, which are reshaping the energy landscape. For instance, AEP's 12.3% commercial load growth in Q1 2025—driven by 500+ customers requesting to connect nearly 80 gigawatts of new load—highlights the company's role in powering the digital and industrial economy.

Favorable rate revisions from prior quarters also provide a buffer. Regulatory approvals for rate increases, coupled with tariff modifications to accommodate large-load growth, have allowed AEP to pass through costs to customers while maintaining profitability. These adjustments are critical in a sector where capital-intensive investments in grid modernization and renewable integration require sustained revenue streams.

Earnings Pressure: Weather Disruptions and Cost Inflation

Despite these positives, AEP faces headwinds that could temper earnings. Adverse weather events—such as heavy rainfall, floods, and tornadoes—disrupted operations in parts of its 11-state footprint, leading to outages and infrastructure damage. The resulting restoration costs and elevated operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses are expected to weigh on margins. For example, AEP's Q1 2025 operating expenses rose 4.5% YoY, driven by emergency response efforts and accelerated grid hardening projects.

Moreover, the utility's capital expenditures are rising in tandem with its $54 billion, five-year investment plan. While these investments are necessary to support the 9% retail load growth projected for 2025, they also strain short-term profitability. AEP's FFO-to-debt ratio, while strong at 14.2%, will face scrutiny as the company allocates resources to balance infrastructure resilience with shareholder returns.

Strategic Resilience: AEP's Long-Term Positioning

AEP's ability to navigate these challenges hinges on its strategic resilience. The company's disciplined capital management—evidenced by a $2.3 billion forward equity offering and a minority interest transaction—has fortified its balance sheet, ensuring it remains well-positioned to fund growth without overleveraging. Additionally, AEP's focus on regulatory engagement has yielded favorable outcomes in key rate cases, such as its recent Ohio and Indiana regulatory filings, which could unlock incremental earnings in 2026.

The Zacks model underscores this resilience, predicting an earnings beat with a +10.63% Earnings Surprise Predictor (ESP) and a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). Historical data further supports this optimism: AEP has exceeded consensus estimates in three of the past four quarters, including a 10.79% beat in Q1 2025. This track record suggests the company's operational efficiency and cost controls may offset near-term pressures.

Investment Implications and Risk Considerations

For investors, AEP's Q2 earnings report presents a nuanced opportunity. The company's attractive dividend yield (3.5%) and low beta of 0.44 make it a defensive play in a volatile market. However, the risk-reward profile depends on how well AEP manages its capital allocation and regulatory timelines. Key watchpoints include:

1. Weather normalization: Will the frequency of extreme weather events moderate in 2025, or does AEP need to accelerate grid hardening costs?

2. Regulatory momentum: Can AEP secure timely approvals for rate cases and renewable integration projects to sustain its 6-8% long-term earnings growth target?

3. Sector dynamics: How will data center demand and industrial load growth evolve in a potential economic slowdown?

Conclusion: A Balancing Act with Strong Fundamentals

AEP's Q2 earnings outlook reflects the dual pressures of demand growth and operational costs in the utility sector. While the 7.2% EPS decline is concerning, the company's strategic focus on infrastructure investment, regulatory alignment, and cost discipline positions it to outperform expectations. For investors seeking exposure to a utility with strong cash flow visibility and long-term growth catalysts, AEP offers a compelling case—provided it continues to execute its capital and regulatory strategies effectively.

As the July 30 earnings webcast approaches, all eyes will be on AEP's management to articulate a clear path through these challenges. In a shifting energy landscape, AEP's ability to balance resilience with innovation will define its near-term investment potential.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 18:04:20.247335

The platform said buying a solar system by the end of the year would save the average homeowner $9,000 via the 30% federal tax credit.
""Without the federal credit, solar becomes significantly less accessible to middle-class homeowners seeking true energy independence,"" it stated.
""The solar industry expects a significant rush of installations in the second half of 2025,"" according to the site.
""The elimination of the residential solar tax credit represents a fundamental shift in federal energy policy, ending two decades of bipartisan support for home solar installations,"" EnergySage concluded.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated the federal solar tax credit, and experts are urging homeowners to act before it's too late.

What's happening?

The Inflation Reduction Act created incentives for people to invest in clean energy through 2034, but those benefits will now end Dec. 31, EnergySage reported.

The platform said buying a solar system by the end of the year would save the average homeowner $9,000 via the 30% federal tax credit. Solar panels will remain affordable in 2026 and beyond because of falling equipment costs and rising energy costs, but it will take 15 to 20 years for installations to pay for themselves instead of eight to 10.

EnergySage noted that this will impact working families the most, as 44% of households that installed solar power in 2023 earned less than $100,000. ""Without the federal credit, solar becomes significantly less accessible to middle-class homeowners seeking true energy independence,"" it stated.

Why is this important?

While the cost of solar energy fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.50 per watt in 2024, residents are paying more for power from the grid because of rising demand and utilities' power generation and infrastructure expenditures. EnergySage added that artificial intelligence-powered data centers are also causing an issue.

""Despite a growing number of these massive data centers coming online, Congress just ended the main incentive for this grid-stabilizing technology,"" the company stated. ""Without distributed solar generation to help balance the load, the grid becomes more vulnerable to load-shedding requests, brownouts, and rolling blackouts.""

Watch now: Does clean energy really cause blackouts?

Solar systems and battery backups reduce reliance on the grid and lock in rates at or near $0, but this change could increase electricity costs for the average household by $143 annually, per EnergySage.

It pointed out that the average 11-kilowatt setup costs about $20,000 instead of $28,160 with the credit. It takes two to four months to get solar installed. ""The solar industry expects a significant rush of installations in the second half of 2025,"" according to the site. ""This could lead to longer wait times and scheduling challenges for homeowners who delay their decision.""

What's being done about the end of the tax credit?

While it's too late to contact your representatives to push back against this bill, you can install solar panels to reap the rewards of the IRA before they vanish. (Companies have longer to act.)

If you're on the fence, EnergySage has a mapping tool that shows costs and incentives by state. This and other free tools will enable you to compare quotes and find vetted local installers. Not only will you save thousands of dollars, but you will also reduce the heat-trapping pollution that is pushing global temperatures higher and contributing to increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events.

Before Trump killed the tax break, it was scheduled to remain in effect through 2032. You can still get the credit, but you’ll have to act fast—it now expires on September 30. And not all buyers and EVs qualify.

Which Taxpayers and Vehicles Qualify for the Credit?

The Clean Vehicle Credit is limited to certain buyers and specific new and leased models.

You can claim the tax credit if your adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

Twenty vehicle models qualify for the credit, including Teslas and the popular Ford F-150 Lightning. For some models, only certain trim levels qualify. . The credit is available for vehicles meeting these requirements:

MSRP of less than $80,000 for pickups and SUVs, and less than $55,000 for all other vehicles

Final assembly took place in North America

At least 50 percent of the battery’s minerals and components are from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement with the U.S.

Gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds

Battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours

If the vehicle meets only one of the battery sourcing requirements, it may still qualify for a $3,500 tax credit.

The used-vehicle EV credit is available for 142 pre-owned cars and trucks. The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be at least two years old.

For used EV purchases, buyers must have adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.

Buy Now or Wait?

If you’ve already decided that you want an EV—and you qualify for the tax credit—it might make sense to buy before September 30. There are many great electric vehicles, sedans, SUVs, and trucks on the list.

But if you’re on the fence, don’t let the deadline rush into a purchase you may regret.

“The last thing you want to do is rush and buy something you’re not prepared for,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. “EVs are great, but [they] require a shift in mindset about how you operate them and where you’re going to charge them. And if you’re not ready for that, it can be a bit of a barrier.”

By waiting, you might even get a better deal. Industry analysts predict automakers will find ways to reduce EV sticker prices.

Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, said automakers can “eat the cost “or find a way to incentivize dealers to sell them at a massive discount.” Yoon said he’s more concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which could drive up the price of some EVs by 25 percent or more.

“Incentives and rebates are powerful and flexible strategies to adjust the price,” said Tom Voelk, automotive journalist and publisher of . “They can make buyers feel like they’re getting a great deal. Who doesn’t love something like $8,000 off the price of a $60,000 vehicle? And incentives work better for wealthy buyers who didn’t qualify for the federal tax credit.”

And consider this: While EVs may have a higher initial purchase price, they’re less expensive to operate and maintain than gas-powered vehicles. Over time, those savings can offset the upfront cost.

Matthew Phillips, CEO of Car Pros Automotive Group in Washington state, said dealers will get as competitive as they can, knowing that demand will drop after September.

“Manufacturers won’t give up on EVs, and some are already offering big rebates,” Phillips told Checkbook.

In June, the average EV incentives “reached an all-time high,” , 14.8% of the average transaction price, or nearly $8,500.

Consumer Reports found July incentives as high as 26 percent for the Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya, and Volkswagen ID4. The Kia Niro Electric has a 21 percent incentive, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6 are offered at 16 percent off.

This month, most major manufacturers are also offering zero percent financing on one or more of their electric models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Sierra EV, Honda Prologue, Kia EV6, Lexus RZ, Nissan Leaf, Toyota bZ4X, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model 3.

Note: If you choose to go electric, check with your electric utility to see if they offer credits or incentives for buying the vehicle or installing a home charger.

This Will Not Kill the EV Market

The demand for EVs is expected to drop after the tax credits expire. At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued. But manufacturers have invested billions in EV technology and recognize that the industry’s long-term future lies in electric vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 25 percent of the global market this year,

In its July report, Cox Automotive noted that it still believes new EV sales will continue to expand in the U.S. “but the growth trajectory has been curbed,” with volume expected to remain flat year-over-year. Cox said expectations for sales of new EVs in the U.S. for 2025 have been lowered from approximately 10 percent of total vehicle sales to an 8.5 percent share.

The road ahead may be bumpy, but Consumer Reports is optimistic about the future of EVs.

“The price to build these vehicles is only coming down over time,” said CR’s Harto. “So, in the short term, we might see some pullback, but I think we’ll continue to see better, cheaper electric vehicles coming onto the market over the next four or five years. And that’s really what’s going to drive the market: vehicles that meet consumers where they need to be with a better product at a lower price.”

In June, the average EV incentives “reached an all-time high,” , 14.8% of the average transaction price, or nearly $8,500.

Consumer Reports found July incentives as high as 26 percent for the Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya, and Volkswagen ID4. The Kia Niro Electric has a 21 percent incentive, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6 are offered at 16 percent off.

This month, most major manufacturers are also offering zero percent financing on one or more of their electric models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Sierra EV, Honda Prologue, Kia EV6, Lexus RZ, Nissan Leaf, Toyota bZ4X, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model 3.

Note: If you choose to go electric, check with your electric utility to see if they offer credits or incentives for buying the vehicle or installing a home charger.

This Will Not Kill the EV Market

The demand for EVs is expected to drop after the tax credits expire. At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued. But manufacturers have invested billions in EV technology and recognize that the industry’s long-term future lies in electric vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 25 percent of the global market this year,

In its July report, Cox Automotive noted that it still believes new EV sales will continue to expand in the U.S. “but the growth trajectory has been curbed,” with volume expected to remain flat year-over-year. Cox said expectations for sales of new EVs in the U.S. for 2025 have been lowered from approximately 10 percent of total vehicle sales to an 8.5 percent share.

The road ahead may be bumpy, but Consumer Reports is optimistic about the future of EVs.

“The price to build these vehicles is only coming down over time,” said CR’s Harto. “So, in the short term, we might see some pullback, but I think we’ll continue to see better, cheaper electric vehicles coming onto the market over the next four or five years. And that’s really what’s going to drive the market: vehicles that meet consumers where they need to be with a better product at a lower price.”

Charles Jensen, Detroit, MI

Clean energy generation—or energy generation without the output of harmful greenhouse gases—has become an increasingly hot topic in today’s race for productivity and the growing global emphasis on eco-consciousness. Some of the most widely used forms of clean energy are solar, wind and biofuel. Other expanding clean energy sources include hydroelectric power and geothermal energy, according to Constellation. Constellation also deems nuclear power to be a “clean” energy, which many would dispute.

Regarding clean energy production by country, it is vital to consider that while China leads the world in clean energy production, generating an astounding 951 terawatt-hours in the first quarter of 2025 alone (with the United States following at about 907 terawatt-hours/year in 2023), China and the U.S. do not have the highest proportion of clean energy to total energy generation when compared to other nations. Iceland, Norway, Paraguay and Brazil lead in having the majority of their total energy production come from clean energy sources, such as geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Norway.

So, how are the U.S. and China the leaders in clean energy production despite clean energy being a smaller portion of their overall energy generation? The answer lies in both nations’ large-scale demand for energy due to their size, population and productive efficiency.

While clean energy makes up roughly 30 percent of U.S. energy production, with the total energy production coming in at about 102.83 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2023, the sheer volume of clean energy production from the two countries is larger than any other nation. China’s clean energy production makes up about 38 percent of its total energy production, placing it just below the global average of 41 percent and the U.S. even lower at 30 percent as mentioned above.

Other countries are able to make the complete or nearly total shift toward using solely clean energy due to their relatively smaller size—both in population and land—as well as having relatively less demand for energy. Albania, Bhutan, Nepal and Lesotho utilize hydroelectric power without needing to use coal or natural gas because their demand for energy is so small that their existing renewable resources are able to meet their needs. With factors like population size and energy demand unlikely to decrease in China and the U.S., the current rankings of clean energy production will most likely not shift. In fact, according to Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), “the [clean energy] industry is now a key part of China’s wider economic and industrial development.”

To advocate for the spread of clean energy, reach out to your local legislators and understand the rules surrounding local energy generation facilities, support plans for the creation of clean energy facilities in your area, and emphasize the transition from traditional to clean energy in your own life.

But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive.
iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020.
Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy is preparing to disburse nearly $1 billion in solar and storage funding through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund.
Legal scholars warned the deal could have violated key provisions of Puerto Rico’s energy reform laws.
While one cargo was delivered to Puerto Rico in early 2025, no current-quarter shipments have been confirmed.","Puerto Rico’s government has pulled the plug on contract talks with New Fortress Energy after the island’s federally appointed oversight board declined to approve a proposed $20-billion LNG supply deal, upending years of negotiations and raising questions about the future shape of its energy transition.

According to a report by Hart Energy, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico withheld support for the contract earlier this month, citing concerns about cost, duration, and long-term fuel dependency. In response, the Puerto Rico government formally canceled negotiations with New Fortress, despite the company’s dominant position in the island’s LNG market.

New Fortress had been in line to supply fuel for the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), whose fleet includes aging oil- and gas-fired plants awaiting conversion or decommissioning. The canceled deal was expected to cover LNG imports for a period of up to 25 years, potentially extending New Fortress’s role as the island’s primary gas supplier well into the 2040s.

The collapse of the agreement leaves a significant vacuum in Puerto Rico’s energy planning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), natural gas, primarily LNG, accounted for approximately 34% of the island’s electricity generation in 2023, with petroleum making up the majority. Although full-year 2024 data is not yet available, analysts at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) had warned that Puerto Rico’s increasing reliance on LNG contracts could entrench fossil fuel use at the expense of federally supported renewable energy goals.

In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy is preparing to disburse nearly $1 billion in solar and storage funding through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund. As of July, however, local permitting constraints and utility interconnection delays had slowed the rollout of community-scale renewable projects.

The New Fortress deal had also come under scrutiny for bypassing competitive procurement rules. While the company already supplies LNG to the San Juan combined-cycle plant and EcoEléctrica’s Peñuelas facility, its attempt to lock in a 25-year sole-source contract drew criticism from public interest attorneys and environmental groups. Legal scholars warned the deal could have violated key provisions of Puerto Rico’s energy reform laws.

For New Fortress, which has not issued any public comment on the deal’s breakdown, the canceled contract represents a setback in its bid to expand LNG operations across the Caribbean. The company is still advancing its Fast LNG project in Mexico, with modular floating liquefaction units aimed at flexible export markets, including potentially Puerto Rico. While one cargo was delivered to Puerto Rico in early 2025, no current-quarter shipments have been confirmed. Without a long-term anchor contract, its foothold on the island may be more vulnerable than previously assumed.

Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau has not announced whether a new solicitation process will follow. With the island’s debt restructuring still underway and federal funding tied to grid modernization, the question now is whether energy planners will reframe the mix around renewables, or seek a scaled-down LNG alternative.

With or without these data centers, the huge price tag for these new power plants would fall to ratepayers and almost certainly result in future rate increases.

The first priority should be greatly expanding the utilities’ energy efficiency programs, to reduce the need for new power plants while lowering customer bills.
And if these data centers don’t materialize, these new gas plants could become stranded assets.","LG&E/KU have asked the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve construction of two new natural gas power plants, a utility-scale battery, and upgrades to a coal plant, at a cost to ratepayers of $3.7 billion.

However, there’s a fly in the ointment. The utilities claim they need these new power plants to serve hoped-for new AI data centers, but there is no assurance they will ever materialize.

With or without these data centers, the huge price tag for these new power plants would fall to ratepayers and almost certainly result in future rate increases.

Instead of approving these new plants, the PSC should press for a more responsible energy strategy. The first priority should be greatly expanding the utilities’ energy efficiency programs, to reduce the need for new power plants while lowering customer bills. This is widely recognized as the lowest-cost way to meet growing energy demand. This should include supporting customer investments in rooftop solar, battery storage, and other technologies that can be managed as a “virtual power plant.”

Second, LG&E/KU should renew the multiple solar power agreements previously approved by the Commission, but which the utilities cancelled in the past year. Third, data centers’ rate structures should require these massive facilities to use on-site renewable energy, battery storage, and flexible load tariffs; requiring the data centers to ramp down demand at times of peak load, to protect regular customers from black-outs during heat waves.

LG&E/KU forecasts that data center development will increase their load by 1,750 megawatts by 2032, a 30% increase above current generation. By one estimate, this would consume as much energy as all LG&E/KU residential customers combined! And if these data centers don’t materialize, these new gas plants could become stranded assets. But customers would still be on the hook for the next 40 years, paying off massive investments no longer needed.

More importantly, these proposed fossil fuel plants ignore a fundamental challenge, the accelerating climate crisis and how to best transition to a more resilient and affordable energy system.

The Commission should consider this wider context and the risks that the climate crisis poses for the commonwealth. One way to do this would be for the PSC to open a case to investigate the multifaceted risks of climate change in the context of Kentucky’s power system and how that appraisal should shape future decision-making.

Such an investigation would finally acknowledge this overarching issue in making all decisions about energy production. Indeed, all government decisions at this point should ask, how does this decision affect our ability to cope with accelerating climate change?

In the present case, the Commission should protect ratepayers by sending the proposers back to the drawing board to develop plans to transition to a more resilient and efficient energy system. The PSC welcomes public comments prior to and/or at their public hearing August 4. Comments can be emailed to: psc.comment@ky.gov, case number 2025-00045.

In the risk of accelerating extreme weather, the younger you are the more you have at stake. But rest assured that for our children and grandchildren the stakes couldn’t be higher.

However, as several studies have shown, it’s actually quite easy to maintain a healthy battery over time.

One particular Ford Mustang Mach-E, for instance, can still offer over 90% of its original range after driving 250,000 miles.

We’ve featured many owner stories about their electric cars’ battery life over the years, and they’re usually Teslas or some sort of Hyundai. Now, though, it’s time for another American fan favourite to get into the spotlight.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E wasn’t particularly to every brand enthusiast’s taste when it debuted in 2021, mainly because of its Mustang name, but that sentiment seems to have rescinded recently. However, this being Ford’s first proper purpose-built mass-produced EV, questions remain over its reliability in the long run, especially when it comes to the high-voltage battery.

Generally speaking, the Mustang Mach-E has proved to be a solid vehicle, and now there’s one out there that’s bound to smash any misconception about the long-term reliability of EV batteries.

David Blenkle bought his 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium a little over three years ago, and during his ownership, he racked up over 250,000 miles on the odometer. That’s really impressive, but even more impressive is the battery’s ability to still deliver plenty of range.

Photo by: Ford

When it was new, the 2022 Mustang Mach-E Premium with rear-wheel drive had an EPA range rating of 303 miles on a full charge. Now, Blenkle says he consistently gets around 290 miles of range out of the original battery, which means a degradation rate of just 4%. In other words, the battery still has 96% of its original capacity, which is practically the same as getting behind the wheel of a brand-new EV and driving it for around a year.

“The biggest misconception I encounter is about battery life and range, and then I show them my odometer,” David Blenkle said.

So, how does one manage to keep an EV’s main battery so healthy after so many miles? It’s rather simple, actually. In Blenkle’s case, just setting the charge limit to 90% seems to have done the trick, together with mainly using a home charger during the night. DC fast charging was very rarely used on this particular Mustang Mach-E, and some research shows that limiting the number of fast charging sessions may improve battery life.

A couple of dings and scratches have made their way onto David’s car over time, but other than that, nothing major has happened during his ownership. He has a consistent maintenance schedule where he gets regular tire rotations, routine multipoint inspections and new cabin air filters, but that’s about it. In fact, his original brake pads still have life left after a quarter of a million miles.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/jl0G7o/s1/2022-ford-mustang-mach-e-with-250-000-miles-and-still-on-its-original-battery.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 16:01:56.730714

In May, the EPA rescinded funding for hundreds of community projects across the country, citing a reevaluation of its Community Change Grant program.
The grant aimed to support climate resilience, clean energy job training, housing repairs, and public health improvements in Albany’s Arbor Hill, South End, and West Hill neighborhoods.
“The direct impact is the three disenfranchised communities — South End, Arbor Hill, and West Hill,” said Daquetta P. Jones-Johnson, CEO of Trinity Alliance.
In West Hill, Neighborhood Association President Tabora Marcus says the now-stalled funding would have gone toward critical home repairs for low-income seniors.","Local community leaders and Congressman Paul Tonko are seeking answers after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated a nationwide grant program that was expected to bring millions of dollars to disadvantaged neighborhoods in Albany.

In May, the EPA rescinded funding for hundreds of community projects across the country, citing a reevaluation of its Community Change Grant program. Though it’s still unclear whether Capital Region organizations are among the confirmed cuts, some Albany-based nonprofits say the uncertainty has already forced them to scale back.

“We’re not going to be silenced. We’re not going to give up. And we’re not going to let Albany be forgotten,” Bobbi Wilding, the Executive Director of Clean + Healthy NY, said during a roundtable discussion held Friday at the Underground Railroad Education Center.

The roundtable brought together leaders from several local nonprofits and U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY), who said litigation is underway involving more than 350 grantees nationwide.

The ALL(bany) Together Project, a coalition of eight nonprofits, had been awarded a combined $20 million as part of the EPA’s Community Change Grant program, funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The grant aimed to support climate resilience, clean energy job training, housing repairs, and public health improvements in Albany’s Arbor Hill, South End, and West Hill neighborhoods.

Among the groups impacted is the Capital Area Urban League, which had been using the funds to provide free electrician training programs.

“I think it’s imperative to restore the funding for programs like this so it could give people like myself — or others from the urban community — the opportunity to better themselves,” said Khyri Oliver, a program graduate who credited the training with helping him start his own business.

Trinity Alliance, the lead applicant on the grant, was awarded $10.9 million to build community infrastructure for clean power access, food and water distribution, and health services in disaster-prone areas.

“The direct impact is the three disenfranchised communities — South End, Arbor Hill, and West Hill,” said Daquetta P. Jones-Johnson, CEO of Trinity Alliance.

In West Hill, Neighborhood Association President Tabora Marcus says the now-stalled funding would have gone toward critical home repairs for low-income seniors.

“It’s really impactful for the neighbors — especially the vulnerable population, which is our seniors,” Marcus said. “People are losing their homes. They don’t have the money on fixed incomes to make repairs, and when they fall behind on taxes, the county can take their homes.”

The Arbor Hill Development Corporation had been awarded $1.8 million to support housing rehabilitation in the West Hill area.

Tonko called the grant’s cancellation a “wrongful termination” and said he is pressing the EPA for clarity.

CBS6 reached out to the EPA for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson said:

This target is considered crucial for limiting global warming and was part of the agreement made at the COP28 meeting in Dubai in 2023.

The rapid growth of renewable energy might give the impression that the world has made good progress on meeting its climate objectives. However, renewable energy has not even begun to replace fossil fuels at the global level.

As of now, it is catering mainly to the rising electricity demand, which has increased three times since 1990 and is projected to grow even higher.

Unabated use of fossil fuels across the world

While only around 10% of new electricity installed capacity in 2024 was fossil fuel-based, the use of fossil fuels, in absolute terms, is still growing, according to the IRENA report.

Between 2012 and 2023, global electricity generation grew by 2.5% every year on average, and renewable energy expanded at a rate of about 6% during the same time. This has led to a steady rise in the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix. However, fossil fuels currently account for more than 70% of global electricity production.

Story continues below this ad

In absolute terms, more fossil fuels are being burned today than 10 years ago to produce electricity. To make matters worse, the increase in the use of fossil fuels is expected to continue for at least a few more years. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions have reached record highs in recent years.

Moreover, electricity is still only a small slice of total energy use. Just 20% to 22% of the total energy consumed in the world every year is in the form of electricity. Only 30% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources. This means that about 6% of the world’s energy consumption comes from clean sources. More than 90% still comes from fossil sources.

Note that there are some countries, mainly in the Nordic region, where renewables account for a significantly higher share of total energy consumption. However, the special conditions existing in these countries are difficult to replicate elsewhere. According to projections, by 2050, even in the case scenarios, not more than 40% to 45% of the world’s total energy consumption would come from clean sources.

This means that energy transition, which involves moving away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, on its own, is unlikely to help tackle the climate crisis. That is why carbon removal interventions, which are yet to become viable, assume great importance in the fight against global warming.

Regional imbalance in growth of renewables

Story continues below this ad

There are other concerns with the manner in which the global energy transition is currently taking shape. So far, the bulk of renewable energy deployment has taken place in a handful of countries, while the others have been left behind.

The IRENA report pointed out that while renewable capacity increased by 15% globally in 2024, in Africa it grew by just 7%, and that too from a very low base. Africa is where the largest number of people without access live.

The IRENA report said 71% of the renewable capacity addition last year took place in Asia. This is slightly misleading as China alone accounted for more than 62% of global additions — that is, 364 GW of the 582 GW installed globally. The whole of Africa together got less than 1%.

For the last few years, China has been consistently installing more renewable energy than the rest of the world combined. Apart from developed countries, China, and some large players such as India, the renewable energy footprint has not grown at a fast pace.

Story continues below this ad

It is true that these are the countries that also happen to be the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Effective energy transition here would be more consequential from the climate change perspective than in, for example, Africa.

However, this kind of lopsided deployment of renewable energy, coupled with the fact that China has a near monopoly on the production and supply chains of most of the renewable systems, could leave many countries and regions behind once again.

Renewable energy, such as solar and wind, might be available universally — unlike, say, petrol that is found in only limited geographies — but the technologies needed to harness this energy are getting increasingly inaccessible.

China dominates the production and manufacturing of solar PV systems, for example, but also consumes more than half of it. Large buyers such as the United States and India corner most of what is exported. There is little supply for others.

Story continues below this ad

Also, manufacturing outside of China, which could have filled the gap, is struggling. This is because other countries are not able to compete with China’s economies of scale, low labour costs, or state subsidies.

China’s control over the renewable energy system has begun to appear similar to the OPEC countries’ hold over global oil supplies. Energy security has emerged as one of the foremost concerns of countries, pushing many of them to secure whatever option is available to them, irrespective of whether it is clean or not.

The transition to clean and renewable energy systems is not as simple as it is sometimes made out to be. There are several layers of complexity which make the goal of curbing global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius look increasingly unrealistic to achieve.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/Renewables.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 17:01:48.812134

Charging varies wildly across states

Part of the draw of EVs is that they can be cheaper to drive than gas cars, but turns out the cost of electricity varies massively between different states.

A student did an experiment in Canada where he discovered that the cost of running an EV can vary massively based on location and that if you live in a more rural area, gas cars are better for your wallet.

In the United States, the price of electrical charging varies from as high as 14.15¢ per mile to as low as 3.96¢, with the highest price of charging being found in Hawaii, and the carbon footprint varies across the US too.

Which US state is it cheapest to drive an EV in?

With the average price of regular gas in the US being 10.52¢ per mile, according to the AAA, as recently as the 18th July 2025, it is actually more expensive to charge your EV in California (10.59¢) and Hawaii (14.15¢) than fill up with gas.

In Vermont, it costs 7.73¢, in Illinois it costs 6.11¢ and in Florida it costs 5.09¢ to charge your EV, making it slightly cheaper to charge than fill up with gas.

While Washington is an impressive 4.34¢ and Louisiana is 4.49¢, nowhere is cheaper to charge your EV than in Idaho where it costs just 3.96¢ per mile.

Investment Implications: Risk and Opportunity The DTE case highlights two critical risks for renewable energy investors: regulatory fragmentation and project uncertainty.
These regions are likely to attract the bulk of clean energy investments, particularly as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivizes domestic infrastructure.
The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion in clean energy incentives will only be fully realized if states and municipalities align their policies.
Conversely, a victory for St. Clair County could exacerbate regulatory fragmentation, slowing the clean energy transition.","The legal battle between DTE Energy and St. Clair County over solar project regulations has become a pivotal case in the U.S. clean energy transition. At its core, the dispute reflects broader tensions between utility interests, state preemption laws, and local governance. For investors, the outcome could reshape the risk-reward calculus for renewable infrastructure projects in Michigan and beyond, influencing everything from permitting timelines to project financing.

The Regulatory Crossroads: State vs. Local Control

DTE Energy's lawsuit challenges St. Clair County's May 2025 regulations, which include stricter noise limits (45 decibels vs. the state's 55 decibels), visual obscurity requirements, and health department oversight for decommissioning. The utility argues these rules function as zoning laws, violating Public Act 233—a 2023 state law designed to preempt local restrictions and accelerate Michigan's 80% clean energy target by 2035.

This case mirrors a national trend where local governments increasingly impose restrictions on renewables, often citing health and environmental concerns. A 2025 report from Columbia University's Sabin Center revealed a 32% rise in public opposition to renewable projects in 2024 and a 16% increase in “severe” local restrictions, totaling 459 laws across 44 states. Wind projects, in particular, face more restrictions than solar, with 298 anti-wind laws compared to 248 anti-solar laws. Michigan alone has 62 local restrictions, the highest in the nation.

The Sabin Center also notes that local opposition often delays or cancels projects. For example, setback requirements can reduce solar resource efficiency by up to 38%, while 30% of solar and wind projects were canceled in 2024 due to local ordinances. These trends underscore the growing importance of regulatory clarity for investors.

Investment Implications: Risk and Opportunity

The DTE case highlights two critical risks for renewable energy investors: regulatory fragmentation and project uncertainty. If St. Clair County's regulations are upheld, it could embolden other localities to craft their own rules, creating a patchwork of requirements that complicate large-scale development. This would increase costs and timelines, deterring capital inflows. Conversely, a ruling in favor of DTE would reinforce state preemption, streamlining permitting and boosting investor confidence—a scenario akin to New York's 2020 law, which allowed the state to override local bans on renewables.

For Michigan, the stakes are high. The state's aggressive clean energy goals depend on rapid deployment of solar and storage projects. Yet, local opposition—often driven by misinformation or legitimate concerns about land use—threatens to derail progress. Investors must weigh the potential for regulatory stability against the risk of localized delays.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Prioritize Jurisdictions with Clear Preemption Laws: States like Michigan, California, and Illinois, which have enacted laws to limit local restrictions, offer more predictable environments for renewable projects. These regions are likely to attract the bulk of clean energy investments, particularly as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivizes domestic infrastructure.

Engage in Community Co-Creation: Investors should proactively address local concerns through transparent dialogue and community benefits agreements. For example, DTE's proposed Greenwood Township solar project could mitigate opposition by offering landowner compensation or shared revenue from energy production.

Diversify Geographically and Technologically: A diversified portfolio across solar, wind, and storage can hedge against regional regulatory risks. Projects in states with strong preemption laws (e.g., Ohio, Texas) should be balanced with those in states with emerging local opposition (e.g., New York, Nebraska).

Monitor Legal Precedents: The outcome of DTE's lawsuit could set a national precedent. Investors should track rulings in similar cases, such as Clean Energy Choice Coalition v. Village of Oak Park in Illinois, to anticipate shifts in regulatory frameworks.

The Broader Picture: A National Legal Battleground

The DTE case is part of a larger legal and political struggle over the clean energy transition. In 2025, 459 U.S. counties adopted restrictive policies, reflecting a surge in local governance efforts to assert control over energy development. While these actions are framed as democratic participation, they often lack scientific basis. For instance, St. Clair County's health department cited vague risks like “visual intrusion” and “noise pollution” without peer-reviewed evidence, a common tactic in anti-renewable campaigns.

For investors, the lesson is clear: regulatory risk is no longer confined to federal policy shifts. Local-level conflicts now play a decisive role in project viability. The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion in clean energy incentives will only be fully realized if states and municipalities align their policies.

Conclusion

DTE Energy's lawsuit is more than a legal dispute—it is a bellwether for the future of renewable energy investment in the U.S. If Michigan courts uphold Public Act 233, it will reinforce state authority and create a model for other states to follow. Conversely, a victory for St. Clair County could exacerbate regulatory fragmentation, slowing the clean energy transition.

Investors must navigate this uncertainty with a dual strategy: leveraging jurisdictions with strong preemption laws while engaging constructively with local stakeholders. The next few months will be critical. As the Michigan Court of Appeals deliberates on the PSC's interpretation of Public Act 233, the renewable sector—and the broader economy—will watch closely for signals of regulatory clarity.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 16:03:20.806114

Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board.
The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money.","As North Carolina lawmakers prepare to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a controversial energy bill, constituents are receiving mailers from a dark money entity with ties to Duke Energy’s industrial and commercial customers.

Citizens for NC Jobs registered with the state as a nonprofit in January and launched a Facebook page three days after lawmakers introduced the legislation in March. The group is specifically targeting Democrats who voted with Republicans to pass the measure, likely aiming to maintain the members’ support ahead of the override vote.

Senate Bill 266 eliminates Duke Energy’s 2030 carbon emissions limits and shifts costs and risks from the company’s shareholders and industrial customers – including power-hungry data centers – to residential users. Eleven Democrats in the House and three Democrats in the state Senate broke with their party last month and joined the Republican majority to pass the controversial bill.

The measure aims to make building large-scale methane gas and nuclear plants more economically attractive for Duke Energy by forcing customers to pay for them before the plants are operational through a financing mechanism called construction work in progress or CWIP. With CWIP, customers rather than shareholders would be on the hook for repayment if a project falls through. The consequences of CWIP continue to be evident in South Carolina, where Santee Cooper customers are still paying $9 billion for an abandoned nuclear reactor project at the V.C. Summer plant, which never generated power due to delays and cost overruns. After the Summer project collapsed, four executives from a partner utility company involved in the project were criminally sentenced for fraud and lying to federal investigators.

S. 266 would also shift costs from large-load customers to residential users. Currently, Duke Energy’s residential customers in North Carolina use just over 40% of all the power the company purchases, rather than generates itself, and they pay for about 41% of the costs. An analysis by EQ Research found that under S. 266 residential customers would continue to use the same 40% of purchased power but would bear almost 49% of the costs. This cost shift to smaller-load users is being considered as a growing number of power-hungry data centers are eying North Carolina for expansion.

Source: EQ Research

Another analysis released this week by BW Research found that S. 266 would also lead to a loss of over 50,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in unrealized state tax revenue due to a decline in power sector investments, and to a state energy capacity shortfall of as much as 12 gigawatts. The analysis used modeling by the North Carolina Public Staff, which advocates for customers’ interests at the state Utilities Commission.

S. 266 was introduced by former state Sen. Paul Newton, who retired from his job as Duke Energy’s North Carolina president in 2015. He claimed the bill would save the utility’s North Carolina customers $13 billion but did not release the analysis or explain how the figure was calculated. In response, a trio of North Carolina State University professors specializing in utility economics conducted their own analysis of the proposal and found it could potentially raise customers’ bills by $23 billion by 2050 due to volatility in the price of methane gas, upon which Duke Energy is becoming increasingly dependent.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed S. 266 earlier this month. He said the bill’s climate provision was “sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,” while the cost-shift section meant “families will pay more so that industry pays less.”

Legislators may vote to override the veto as early as July 29 when the Senate and House reconvene. The House passed S. 266 by a final vote of 75-36 and the Senate by a vote of 29-11. Overriding a governor’s veto requires a three-fifths supermajority of lawmakers present at the time the vote is called, so the margin needed can vary. Assuming full attendance, Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate, but House Republicans have only 71 members – one short of a supermajority.

Industrial interests tied to the mailers

Constituents of some of the Democrats who voted with Republicans on S. 266 have received mailers from an obscure nonprofit about the upcoming override vote that repeats challenged claims about cost savings to customers and asks recipients to call and thank their representative for supporting it.

The Energy and Policy Institute obtained a copy of the mailer targeting state Rep. Ray Jeffers, a Democrat who voted for S. 266. He represents parts of Durham County and Person County, where Duke Energy is among the largest employers and taxpayers.

The text on the mailer says it was paid for by Citizens for NC Jobs, a nonprofit that registered with the state in January 2025 and launched a Facebook page on March 13, three days after the legislation was initially introduced as S. 261. Newton, the former Duke Energy executive, resigned from the Senate to take another job, and the text was cut from his bill and pasted into a stripped-out S. 266 that had been introduced to speed rebuilding in the western part of the state after flooding from Hurricane Helene.

In paperwork filed with the state, Citizens for NC Jobs disclosed its registering entity as “WASLAW” and gave among its addresses that of Ward and Smith, a North Carolina law firm. Ward and Smith practice before the North Carolina Utilities Commission as counsel for two organizations representing the interests of Duke Energy’s large industrial and commercial customers: Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) and Carolina Utility Customers Association (CUCA). Susan Vick, a lobbyist for the groups, told EPI that her firm merely registered the paperwork for the nonprofit, has had no further contact, and was unaware of the mailers.

Citizens for NC Jobs’ registration paperwork also lists the exact same mailing and principal office address, down to the suite number, as the North Carolina Chamber, the state’s top business lobby. Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board. Last year, Duke’s state president Kendal Bowman co-chaired a Chamber fundraising campaign. The NC Chamber did not respond to EPI’s request for comment.

The NC Chamber has lobbied legislators to support S. 266. In an email obtained by EPI, NC Chamber lobbyist Alyssa Morrissey accused Gov. Stein’s veto statement of “cherry pick[ing]” data on the bill’s cost. In lobbying materials reviewed by EPI, the NC Chamber dismissed the N.C. State analysis as a “scare tactic” and urged a vote to override Stein’s veto. In another email obtained by EPI, Morrissey told lawmakers this week that utilities have addressed the methane gas price volatility issue, arguing that they have “various mitigation strategies” to manage it. However, an analysis conducted last year by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund showed that since 2017 methane gas has been the primary driver behind rising Duke Energy electric bills in North Carolina.

The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money. Over the past decade, Duke Energy has contributed over $2.5 million to North Carolina politics; among its top recipients were Newton’s campaign as well as that of state Sen. Dan Blue, one of the Democrats who voted for S. 266. Over the same period, the NC Chamber has contributed over $438,000 to North Carolina politics, and Newton and Blue were also among its top beneficiaries. On Aug. 13, Blue will be among the featured speakers at a Citizens for NC Jobs conference in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, along with U.S. Rep. Tim Moore, state Senate leader Phil Berger, and state House Speaker Destin Hall, all Republicans.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/S266-mailer.jpeg,N,,2025-07-26 16:01:59.603212

The U.S. Department of Energy has detailed information about the Clean Vehicle Credit on its .
At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.
In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued.","When President Trump signed his big budget bill into law on July 4, it eliminated the electric vehicle (EV) tax credits enacted under the Biden Administration—$7,500 for buying or leasing a new qualifying EV and $4,000 for buying a used one.

Before Trump killed the tax break, it was scheduled to remain in effect through 2032. You can still get the credit, but you’ll have to act fast—it now expires on September 30. And not all buyers and EVs qualify.

Which Taxpayers and Vehicles Qualify for the Credit?

The Clean Vehicle Credit is limited to certain buyers and specific new and leased models.

You can claim the tax credit if your adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

Twenty vehicle models qualify for the credit, including Teslas and the popular Ford F-150 Lightning. For some models, only certain trim levels qualify. . The credit is available for vehicles meeting these requirements:

MSRP of less than $80,000 for pickups and SUVs, and less than $55,000 for all other vehicles

Final assembly took place in North America

At least 50 percent of the battery’s minerals and components are from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement with the U.S.

Gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds

Battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours

If the vehicle meets only one of the battery sourcing requirements, it may still qualify for a $3,500 tax credit.

The used-vehicle EV credit is available for 142 pre-owned cars and trucks. The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be at least two years old.

For used EV purchases, buyers must have adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The U.S. Department of Energy has detailed information about the Clean Vehicle Credit on its .

Buy Now or Wait?

If you’ve already decided that you want an EV—and you qualify for the tax credit—it might make sense to buy before September 30. There are many great electric vehicles, sedans, SUVs, and trucks on the list.

But if you’re on the fence, don’t let the deadline rush into a purchase you may regret.

“The last thing you want to do is rush and buy something you’re not prepared for,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. “EVs are great, but [they] require a shift in mindset about how you operate them and where you’re going to charge them. And if you’re not ready for that, it can be a bit of a barrier.”

By waiting, you might even get a better deal. Industry analysts predict automakers will find ways to reduce EV sticker prices.

Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, said automakers can “eat the cost “or find a way to incentivize dealers to sell them at a massive discount.” Yoon said he’s more concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which could drive up the price of some EVs by 25 percent or more.

“Incentives and rebates are powerful and flexible strategies to adjust the price,” said Tom Voelk, automotive journalist and publisher of . “They can make buyers feel like they’re getting a great deal. Who doesn’t love something like $8,000 off the price of a $60,000 vehicle? And incentives work better for wealthy buyers who didn’t qualify for the federal tax credit.”

And consider this: While EVs may have a higher initial purchase price, they’re less expensive to operate and maintain than gas-powered vehicles. Over time, those savings can offset the upfront cost.

Matthew Phillips, CEO of Car Pros Automotive Group in Washington state, said dealers will get as competitive as they can, knowing that demand will drop after September.

“Manufacturers won’t give up on EVs, and some are already offering big rebates,” Phillips told Checkbook.

In June, the average EV incentives “reached an all-time high,” , 14.8% of the average transaction price, or nearly $8,500.

Consumer Reports found July incentives as high as 26 percent for the Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya, and Volkswagen ID4. The Kia Niro Electric has a 21 percent incentive, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6 are offered at 16 percent off.

This month, most major manufacturers are also offering zero percent financing on one or more of their electric models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Sierra EV, Honda Prologue, Kia EV6, Lexus RZ, Nissan Leaf, Toyota bZ4X, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model 3.

Note: If you choose to go electric, check with your electric utility to see if they offer credits or incentives for buying the vehicle or installing a home charger.

This Will Not Kill the EV Market

The demand for EVs is expected to drop after the tax credits expire. At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued. But manufacturers have invested billions in EV technology and recognize that the industry’s long-term future lies in electric vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 25 percent of the global market this year,

In its July report, Cox Automotive noted that it still believes new EV sales will continue to expand in the U.S. “but the growth trajectory has been curbed,” with volume expected to remain flat year-over-year. Cox said expectations for sales of new EVs in the U.S. for 2025 have been lowered from approximately 10 percent of total vehicle sales to an 8.5 percent share.

The road ahead may be bumpy, but Consumer Reports is optimistic about the future of EVs.

“The price to build these vehicles is only coming down over time,” said CR’s Harto. “So, in the short term, we might see some pullback, but I think we’ll continue to see better, cheaper electric vehicles coming onto the market over the next four or five years. And that’s really what’s going to drive the market: vehicles that meet consumers where they need to be with a better product at a lower price.”

The devastating flood that swept through Camp Mystic in Texas this month is every parent’s worst nightmare. Hours or days of fear and uncertainty, feeling powerless to help, and, for the families of the 27 campers and staff members who perished, the most painful news imaginable.

Although flash flooding is a recurring problem in the region, climate change exacerbates the problem. Scientists in Europe have already conducted a rapid assessment and determined that the storm dropped 7 percent more rain than it would have otherwise because of global warming. With 129 fatalities—including at least 36 children—and more than 170 people still missing, it is among the deadliest floods in the state’s history.

Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, posted a message to LinkedIn about the flooding on July 5, writing, “The news is heartbreaking. As a parent it’s hard to even process.”

The fact that so many children and young people lost their lives underscores the importance of educational groups like Science Moms, a nonpartisan organization started in 2019 by Hayhoe and other leading climate scientists and mothers. The group works to demystify climate change and motivate moms to demand plans and solutions that will protect the planet for their kids—and their kids from dangerous, climate-change fueled extreme weather events.

Joellen Russell, an oceanographer at the University of Arizona, says her identities as climate scientist and concerned mother merged long before she helped start Science Moms.

Russell was several months pregnant with her first child in 2007, when 12 states sued the EPA over the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Russell reached out to John Mike Wallace, her mentor and former colleague at the University of Washington, where Russell worked as a research associate after completing her PhD. “I wrote to him, and I said, ‘Hey, Mike, I’m pregnant. I’m waiting on this new little one, and you need to step up and help me, because we need to turn this bus,’” she recalls. “‘We need to make a change in the world.’”

Wallace wrote back right away saying he’d help. Russell, Wallace, and other scientists signed an amicus brief submitted in the landmark Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which the Supreme Court cited when they ruled the Clean Air Act covered carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Russell’s son Joseph was born a few months later.

United States emissions have dropped 15 percent since 2007.

Now, Russell says, she tries to lean into her humanness and her “momness” as an educator, scientist, advocate for truth. “I’m so thrilled that I have these two gorgeous babies, and I am really worried,” Russell says. “I don’t want them to have to lift this burden. They will, but if there’s anything I can do, I want to do it.”

Science Moms has partnered with Potential Energy, a nonprofit marketing firm “for planet Earth,” on a multimillion-dollar campaign to inform moms about climate change. Their most high-profile ad to date ran during the 2025 Superbowl, when millions heard the message: “Climate change is like watching them grow up: we blink and we miss it.” Months after the commercial aired, Erica Smithwick, a Science Mom and professor of geography at Penn State, still gets postcards from moms the ad resonated with.

A 2020 study by the Yale Program on Climate Communication found over half of the US population is concerned about climate change. An analysis by Potential Energy found approximately 70 percent of mothers say they’re concerned about climate change. According to Smithwick, moms are ideal environmental advocates because they cut to the core of complex issues. Moms already led advocacy groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (now Everytown for Gun Safety), and climate change will impact future generations most of all, so a mom-led climate science organization just made sense.

“Mothers throughout time have always put in that extra labor because they care about the health of their families,” Smithwick says. “Whether that’s smoking or seat belts or gun safety, all of those are things that I think moms do care about profoundly. When we think about climate change…we really are worried that our kids are going to get heat stroke, and we’re worried that our kids aren’t going to be able to go on vacation or play outside.”

Smithwick says she waited 15 years to take her two kids to Yellowstone National Park, where she has research​​ed forest resiliency. With the recent wildfires in the West, she thinks it may be too late for her children to see these landmarks without them being shrouded in smoke. Now, as a dangerous heat wave surges across the eastern United States, moms like Smithwick worry even more about the safety of their kids in a rapidly changing world.

Despite the gravity of the issues Science Moms communicate, Smithwick says they strive not to “problematize,” and instead move toward action.

The Science Moms website provides mothers with resources and connects them with individual scientists. The site features explainer-style videos and podcasts, guides for how to talk about climate change with family members, and a letter template for moms to reach out to local leaders and ask about plans to stop big polluters.

This year, Science Moms will be rolling out education campaigns related to extreme weather events. They want to ensure moms around the country are prepared for emergencies, including heat waves and hurricanes, in what may be the hottest summer on record. Russell lives in Arizona, one of the fastest warming states in the nation. In 2024, Arizona’s health department appointed its first chief heat officer, Eugene Livar, to lead the state’s Extreme Heat Preparedness Plan.

“We’re sitting in the hot seat, the bullseye of global warming,” Russell says. “We feel like we have an obligation to both, get prepared, get on it, reduce our emissions and help our people weather this.”

Russell says Science Moms will be focusing outreach toward purple and red-leaning states like Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, states where a large percentage of people have been skeptical about climate change information in the past.

According to Russell, the mission of Science Moms remains the same, regardless of administration. Science Moms aims to cut through misinformation and share facts backed up by science. “The sort of cacophony of shifts that are happening up at the higher level of the administration doesn’t really speak to what a lot of moms care about, whatever side of the political aisle they’re on,” Smithwick says.

Tragedies like the Texas flood show how challenging it is to walk a neutral political line, especially when attacks on science are primarily coming from one political party. The exact degree to which the Trump administration’s National Weather Service budget and staffing cuts may have played a role in the disaster is still a matter of debate.

“I think every time we have a tragedy like this, which is unimaginable in its own ways—this particular one—it’s unfortunately a reminder that we have to not look away from climate change,” says Emily Fischer, a professor in the department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University and one of the founding members of Science Moms. “We have to look straight at it and work together to prevent these kinds of disasters from getting worse.”

But she recognizes how difficult that can be, especially in a moment like this. “It’s really hard to shine the light on climate change after a tragedy,” she adds. “It feels icky in some ways, I think, but it’s actually super important.”

Writing on LinkedIn (in a personal capacity, not necessarily as a representative of Science Moms) Katharine Hayhoe said: “The more climate change supersizes our weather extremes, the more info we need to keep people safe. This includes experts, instruments, models, research, and assessments: everything that’s currently being reduced or cut by the US administration.”

Despite political and environmental uncertainty, Russell sees hope for the future in the eyes of her children. Climate change is a family affair, she says, one she shares with her son, Joseph—a budding climate educator who has passed out exams in her classes for years—and his younger sister, Maeve.

NuScale Power has the government support, the technology and the financial backing to succeed. Will that be enough?

NuScale offers exposure to what could be a transformative energy technology - if you can stomach the stock's volatility.

Nuclear power is having its moment again. After decades in the wilderness, small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a potentially transformative technology, backed by close to $1 billion in new U.S. federal funding and surging demand from AI data centers hungry for clean, reliable electricity.

At the center of this renaissance sits NuScale Power (SMR) - the only company with a U.S.-approved SMR design. Its stock has become a proxy for investors betting on the nuclear future - and judging by its 32% gain in the past month, optimism is high.

First to market, but is that enough?

NuScale's competitive moat stems from a hard-won regulatory victory. In May, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the Oregon-based company's uprated 77-megawatt reactor design, the second SMR design ever cleared by U.S. regulators. The plant design retains the safety features that made NuScale's technology attractive to regulators - natural convection cooling and passive safety systems - while boosting power density through larger individual modules. Each upgraded module produces 77 megawatts compared to the original 50-megawatt design, with six-module plants generating 462 megawatts total.

NuScale is now the only SMR developer with an NRC-approved design ready for deployment. Technically it's a ""standard design approval"" - one step below full certification - but it provides the regulatory foundation utilities need to reference the design in license applications and move forward with concrete project planning. This matters less than the practical advantage: NuScale can offer customers a pre-vetted design while competitors are still navigating the complex approval process.

This regulatory head start isn't trivial. In an industry where licensing can take longer than actual construction, having preapproved designs positions NuScale as an early contender for the U.S. Department of Energy's new $900 million SMR funding program. The DOE initiative, reissued in March, aims to support up to two first-mover SMR projects with $800 million in funding, while allocating another $100 million for broader industry support.

Financial reality

For all its technological promise, NuScale remains a pre-revenue company navigating the expensive transition from research to commercialization.

For all its technological promise, NuScale remains a pre-revenue company navigating the expensive transition from research to commercialization. In the nuclear industry context, this means the company doesn't yet earn income from electricity sales or operating plants, though it is beginning to generate revenue from engineering services and licensing fees for early-stage SMR projects. The first quarter of 2025 offered glimpses of this developmental progress: revenue jumped nearly nine-fold to $13.4 million from just $1.4 million a year earlier, driven by initial technology sales and engineering work for Romania's first SMR plant.

Losses remain substantial. NuScale posted a $35 million operating loss in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease from the prior year as R&D spending eased. More encouraging for investors is NuScale's financial runway. As of March 31, the company held about $492 million in cash and equivalents, plus $30 million in short-term investments. This war chest was bolstered by a $102 million stock sale in the first quarter of this year, providing what management estimates is more than three years of runway at current burn rates.

Moreover, federal backing runs deep. The DOE has provided more than $575 million to support NuScale's SMR development to date - an extraordinary level of public investment that underpins the company's financial position and validates its technology approach.

Volatile stock in an uncertain business

NuScale's stock performance tells the story of an industry caught between promise and uncertainty. After going public via a SPAC in 2022, NuScale shares languished before skyrocketing 445% in 2024. The momentum continued into 2025, with the stock doubling in weeks and gaining 120.6% in the first six months of the year.

NuScale's market capitalization tops $13 billion - remarkable for a company with no operating plants. The primary catalyst has been policy momentum, particularly Trump's aggressive pro-nuclear stance. A flurry of executive orders in May 2025 directed regulators to expedite reactor licensing and designated AI data centers as ""critical defense facilities"" requiring advanced reactor power. This enthusiastic federal endorsement sent NuScale and other nuclear stocks soaring.

A U.S. setback is a cautionary tale

NuScale's journey hasn't been without setbacks. The collapse of its first planned U.S. project - a six-module plant canceled in late 2023 - serves as a reminder that interest doesn't equal investment. Cost estimates for that project ballooned 53%, to $89 from $58 per megawatt-hour, prompting several municipal utility participants to withdraw and ultimately killing the venture.

This experience underscores the cost risk inherent in first-of-a-kind nuclear projects. While SMRs promise economies of scale through factory fabrication and modular construction, these benefits remain theoretical until proven in practice. The hope is that standardized manufacturing will drive down costs, but early projects inevitably face the learning-curve premium that comes with pioneering technology.

NuScale has pivoted from that U.S. disappointment to pursue international opportunities that could serve as crucial proof-of-concept projects. The company's flagship overseas venture in Romania is moving forward, with engineering design work underway for a six-module, 462-megawatt plant at Doicesti. Groundbreaking is expected by 2027, targeting operation around 2030 in partnership with Romanian utility Nuclearelectrica (RO:SNN).

The Romanian project could become the first operational NuScale SMR in the world, providing powerful validation for other potential customers. Success there would demonstrate that NuScale's design works as advertised and create a template for international export of U.S. nuclear technology.

NuScale has also forged a manufacturing partnership with South Korean conglomerate Doosan (KR:000150) to produce the first 12 reactor modules, addressing supply-chain concerns that have plagued other nuclear projects.

Racing for the lead

While NuScale enjoys its regulatory head start, competition is intensifying. For example, GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy - a joint-venture between GE Vernova (GEV) and Japan's Hitachi (JP:6501) (HTHIY)- is leveraging decades of experience with a small modular reactor now under construction in Canada. The project is expected to be completed in 2028; its success could quickly erode NuScale's first-mover advantage.

Meanwhile, privately held companies such as Holtec International and X-energy are also pursuing aggressive strategies, with X-energy securing Amazon.com (AMZN) as a strategic backer for five gigawatts worth of new SMRs by 2039. These partnerships with tech giants underscore the growing nexus between cloud computing and nuclear power that could drive demand.

For investors, timing is everything

The next 18 months will be crucial for NuScale.

For investors, NuScale represents both the promise and peril of betting on transformative technology. The company sits at the intersection of several powerful trends: surging electricity demand from AI, federal commitment to nuclear and corporate appetite for clean power. NuScale CEO John Hopkins has indicated a goal of securing the first ""tier 1"" customer by the end of 2025, potentially a utility or data-center consortium, to keep the timeline of delivering a plant by 2030 intact.

The next 18 months will be crucial for NuScale. Success in landing DOE funding, signing concrete customer contracts and maintaining project timelines could validate the stock's premium valuation. Conversely, delays, cost overruns or losing ground to competitors could trigger significant downside.

The investment case ultimately rests on execution. NuScale has the regulatory approval, the technology and the financial backing to succeed. Whether management can convert its head start into operating plants and sustained profitability is the defining question for investors willing to bet on nuclear power's next chapter.

With the first SMRs potentially online by the end of this decade, NuScale offers exposure to what could be a transformative energy technology - provided investors can stomach the inherent volatility of pioneering an entirely new nuclear sector.

MG wants to prove that's the case, and what's more, it can be done on the cheap.","MG Motor has announced that the second generation of its MG4 hatchback will feature a semi-solid-state battery. Solid-state batteries are the holy grail of EVs, a much more energy-dense construction that allows for all the things you ever wanted — faster charging, more range for the same weight, less risk of fire, you name it. Mercedes has already begun testing an EQS prototype with the technology. Big questions surrounding solid-state batteries, though, have been the price and whether or not they would be the exclusive domain of luxury brands.

The originally British but now Chinese-owned brand appears to have found a way to bring costs way, way down. Debuting August 4 in China, the MG4 will start at just $11,000 in that market, per InsideEVs. How did MG do it? By not making the solid-state pack entirely solid. The batteries, developed by QingTao Energy, still feature about 5% liquid electrolyte, resulting in a gel rather than a pure fluid like in a traditional lithium-ion battery. It's also not the world's greatest battery; it's actually less energy dense than Tesla's current batteries and even the semi-solid designs from the emerging American battery manufacturer Factorial.

That may sound like a downgrade, but the semi-solid battery still has one advantage: It doesn't lose performance in cold weather, an Achilles heel of the lithium-ion type. The new battery operates at full capacity all the way down to 19 degrees fahrenheit, and at this price, that makes the MG4 a pretty great EV option for daily use.

A traditional lithium-ion battery features both a cathode (a positively charged half) and an anode (negatively charged), which are awash in a liquid electrolyte that allows charged particles to move from one to the other, creating an electrical current. Solid-state batteries do away with the liquid, and the entire anode. Instead, when plugged in, the charged particles coming out of the solid lithium block pass through a ceramic separator and build themselves up into their own, temporary anode. When that's discharged by turning the car on, the anode particles flow back through the circuit, eventually depleting the anode altogether.

This design allows the overall size of the battery to be much smaller and lighter, as you don't have to lug an anode around everywhere. Weight, as we all know, is one of the big downsides of EVs. Get the weight down, and suddenly range gets way better even for the same amount of electrical storage.

That technology is coming soon; in addition to Mercedes, other companies like Volkswagen and Honda are developing solid-state batteries. But they require more pure lithium than a traditional battery, and given supply chain issues, that presents a problem of its own. Semi-solid-state is literally a halfway point between the two, and somewhat like PHEVs may provide a ""best of both worlds"" solution, at least for the near-term. MG wants to prove that's the case, and what's more, it can be done on the cheap. If it can, that's a big step forward for EVs as a whole.

This acquisition marks another significant step in Agilitas Energy’s mission to add resilient and clean power solutions across the United States.

The project is fully permitted, with construction slated to begin in 2025 and commercial operation expected by the end of 2026. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Once operational, Agilitas Energy’s solar project is projected to generate approximately 16,000megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 2,500 Rhode Island homes.

The project will participate in Rhode Island’s Net Metering Credit (NMC) program, providing credits that offset 100 percent of supply, distribution, transmission and transition charges for each kilowatt-hour produced. Because development began before the state’s eligibility deadline, the project is grandfathered under Rhode Island’s original rules, making it eligible for the full 100% credit value.

Projects developed after the cutoff face a 275-megawatt cap and receive reduced value credits, making this asset particularly attractive to off-takers. These credits will be sold to commercial, industrial, public or municipal customers within the Rhode Island Energy territory, offering them long-term energy savings and price stability.

In addition to net metering revenues, the solar project will generate New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Class I Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), contributing to the region’s Renewable Portfolio Standards and providing an additional revenue stream for Agilitas Energy.

Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans’ appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup.
But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.
About a quarter of New England’s electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.
“This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn’t get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,” Hudson said.","The remains of the Maine Yankee nuclear plant in Wiscasset are protected by a tall chain link fence topped with razor wire and a checkpoint manned by armed guards.

Surrounded by trees and fields, towering pylons from an electric substation are some of the only infrastructure still visible from the road leading down to Bailey Point.

But Don Hudson says 30 years ago it was a completely different scene: A huge dome covered a reactor that cranked out a third of Maine’s power, the largest single source of electricity in the state.

“That concrete dome would have dwarfed the other buildings which after a while you would have picked up,” Hudson said.

“The adjacent buildings that housed the spent fuel pool and all the apparatus needed to generate electricity,” he added.

Back then, Hudson was working with the Chewonki Foundation, an environmental nonprofit located across a narrow coastal channel from the plant.

“As a young man, I was opposed, strongly opposed to nuclear power, largely because it was right next door to the place I worked,” Hudson said.

He remembers the plant opening in 1972. Twenty-four years later, safety concerns and expensive repairs shuttered Maine Yankee.

Hudson chairs the community advisory panel group established first to help decommission the plant and now to advocate for removing fuel waste from the site.

And all these decades later, he’s still working to find a final resting place for 540 tons of spent nuclear fuel still stored in specialized concrete tubes at the former plant.

Without a national strategy to collect and manage America’s nuclear waste, Bailey Point will likely remain a storage facility that costs about $10 million a year.

And under current rules, the material will have to remain secure for 10,000 years, Hudson said.

“If we’re going to use nuclear power from here into the future, we need to resolve this issue with high-level radioactive waste,” Hudson said.

Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans’ appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup. Refocused attention on nuclear is being driven by tech companies hungry for electricity to fuel data centers and startups developing “small modular reactors” that could be deployed faster than traditional power plants.

Meanwhile, both the Trump and Biden presidential administrations have pushed policies aimed at encouraging new nuclear generation.

“Whether you’re looking from the federal level or the state level, or you’re the industry, or at the local level, I think you there are a lot of people that see the potential that new nuclear can provide that just other generation sources can’t,” said Kristy Hartman, a spokesperson for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group.

Nuclear plants are incredibly costly and take years to get approved and constructed.

But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.

That attribute could be attractive to states like Maine, with goals to use completely clean energy in the near future, Hartman said.

States “have these mandates and they have these decarbonization goals in particular and they are not going to reach the finish line with just the renewables that they originally set,” Hartman said.

About a quarter of New England’s electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.

But Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at the Acadia Center, doubts nuclear will make significant inroads in the region.

“Most of the modeling that we have reviewed largely suggests a future where solar, wind and batteries are really dominating the generating resource mix well into the future,” Dickerson said.

Even as New England states see prospects to rapidly build out offshore wind resources in the face of market forces and political obstruction, Dickerson still thinks nuclear will complement, not displace, renewable generation.

And Jack Shapiro from the Natural Resources Council of Maine said new reactors have a track record of construction delays and massive cost overruns.

“Building new nuclear will not occur in time to meaningfully contribute to emissions reductions, while renewables are being rapidly deployed today,” Shapiro said in testimony to the Legislature this winter.

Maine lawmakers rejected two bills aimed at smoothing the way for nuclear generation in the 2025 legislative session. But a third bill, to request informational bids for small modular reactors, was carried over for more debate next year.

Patrick Woodcock, CEO of the Maine Chamber of Commerce and a former energy official in Maine and Massachusetts, said all options should be considered to bring down escalating electric costs.

But he doesn’t think it is realistic to expect a new reactor in Maine in the near future. Any nuclear development requires approval from a statewide referendum, which could make developers think twice, Woodcock said. Plus, the state’s electric market is likely too small to justify the massive expense of building a new plant.

But regional projects to maintain or expand New England’s remaining reactors could be worth considering, Woodcock added.

“Ultimately this comes down to economics,” Woodcock said “Does this make sense for ratepayers? Does this make sense for our load growth trajectory? Ultimately that comes down to a specific proposal and we are a long way from seeing that in New England,” he added.

Back in Wiscasset, Don Hudson says he got more comfortable with Maine Yankee after seeing the plant in operation. But without a national strategy to manage spent fuel, he’s not convinced new reactors are a solution for future electric demand.

“This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn’t get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,” Hudson said. “It just doesn’t make any sense.”",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/maine-yankee-canisters.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 14:03:57.266730

PJM had said that its existing interconnection process, which FERC approved in November 2022, met the requirements of Order 2023.
But in its decision this week, FERC said that while parts of PJM’s process complies with Order 2023, the grid operator must revise others.
One of the first steps in building new power supplies is successfully passing through a grid operator’s interconnection process.
Before joining FERC, Christie served as a member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission for about 17 years.","The PJM Interconnection must make significant changes to its plan for meeting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s grid interconnection requirements, the agency said in a decision released Thursday.

The issue centers on FERC’s Order 2023, which set baseline requirements for grid interconnection rules. It requires a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study approach and made other reforms intended to cut down the interconnection backlog. The rule also set deadlines for regional transmission organizations and other transmission providers to complete interconnection studies, and imposed penalties for missing those deadlines.

PJM had said that its existing interconnection process, which FERC approved in November 2022, met the requirements of Order 2023.

But in its decision this week, FERC said that while parts of PJM’s process complies with Order 2023, the grid operator must revise others.

FERC gave PJM 60 days to propose changes to its interconnection rules. Some of them include:

Striking language that says PJM must only make “reasonable efforts” to meet certain deadlines;

Describing how network and substation upgrade study costs will be allocated;

Explaining how network system upgrade costs will be shared;

Requiring transmission owners to use operating assumptions in their interconnection studies that reflect the planned charging behavior of battery storage projects; and,

Requiring that interconnection studies include an evaluation of grid-enhancing technologies.

FERC’s order comes amid a spike in PJM’s capacity costs, which reflect tight supply and demand conditions in its footprint in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, and the District of Columbia.

One of the first steps in building new power supplies is successfully passing through a grid operator’s interconnection process.

PJM has paused its review of new interconnection requests as it works through a backlog of interconnection requests. The grid operator expects to begin using its reformed process to start evaluating new requests next year.

PJM has approved about 46 GW of interconnection requests for generating projects that have yet to be built, according to the grid operator. It expects to finish reviewing an additional 63,000 MW of interconnection requests through 2026.

Getting new power supplies online is urgent, and interconnection reforms can help, according to FERC commissioners.

“We only have to look to the news in terms of soaring energy demands and the cost consequences for real consumers to see how much this work tangibly matters,” FERC Commissioner Lindsay See said during the agency’s open meeting Thursday. “We’re going to continue to commit to work with [grid operators and utilities] on fast, innovative and fair solutions to get more sources connected and doing their job, delivering power quickly.”

More work on interconnection reform is needed, but acting on PJM’s compliance plan — the last major pending FERC Order 2023 compliance plan — is a “step in the right direction,” FERC Commissioner David Rosner said.

Roser highlighted a separate decision that shows how frustrating the interconnection process can be. In that decision, FERC approved an 18-month extension of the commercial operation deadline for a key part of a 180-MW wind farm under development by ENGIE North America in Iowa. The new deadline is June 1, 2028.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator started studying an interconnection request for the North Hills wind farm in 2017, according to FERC’s decision. The project was hit with multiple delays, including from a Jan. 20 executive order from President Donald Trump ordering a pause on new leases and permits for wind projects, FERC said.

Also, import tariffs and the threat of tariffs on goods from Mexico, China and Canada, as well as on steel and aluminum imports, caused procurement delays, according to the agency. ENGIE said it expects to have completed an offtake agreement for power from the project in the third quarter.

“The [interconnection] delay was so long that the original equipment that they expected in their application is no longer manufactured, and so they have to ask for a waiver for more time,” Rosner said. “It’s just taken too long, and … we have, unfortunately, examples like this all the time that show us these problems, and the only way to solve those problems is with speed.”

Here are three other takeaways from FERC’s open meeting.

Christie to leave in early August. FERC Chairman Mark Christie said he plans to leave the agency in early August. He aims to help issue key orders, some of which face statutory deadlines. In a media briefing, Christie declined to say what those orders may be, noting FERC commissioners are barred from discussing contested cases the agency is considering.

When Christie leaves, FERC will have three sitting commissioners, enough for a quorum needed to issue orders. However, the three remaining commissioners — Rosner and Judy Chang, Democrats, and See, a Republican — may have conflicts from their previous work that could keep them from participating in certain cases, which would prevent votes on them until at least one of the agency’s two empty seats are filled.

President Donald Trump named Laura Swett, an energy attorney and former FERC staffer, and David LaCerte, an official with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to fill the empty seats. The nominations must be cleared by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the full Senate, a process that can take months.

Before joining FERC, Christie served as a member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission for about 17 years. During the open meeting, Christie said one of his guiding principles as a utility regulator is to consider the people who, unlike lawyers and lobbyists, aren’t present at agency deliberations but who are affected by commission decisions.

“When you’re on a commission like this, when you’re on the Virginia commission, when what you do affects what people have to pay in their monthly bills — and God knows we have millions of people struggling to pay their bills these days,” Christie said. “When it affects whether their lights are going to stay on, you have to remember those people who are not in the room.”

FERC approves IBR reliability standards. FERC approved two North American Electric Reliability Corp. reliability standards that require inverter-based resources — wind, solar and battery systems — to ride through frequency and voltage excursions like faults on the transmission system instead of tripping offline.

The final rule largely adopted a proposal FERC issued in December. FERC directed NERC to review concerns raised by some stakeholders about the rules’ exemption provisions and potentially propose changes to them. Some stakeholders contend that without the changes, existing IBR projects may be forced into early retirement and projects that are under construction may be canceled before reaching operation, according to FERC.

“While providing latitude to address these two concerns raised by commenters, NERC and industry should be mindful of the commission’s overarching concerns … that a comprehensive and timely resolution is needed so that IBR performance no longer poses a threat to the reliable operation of the bulk-power system,” FERC said.

FERC eases hydro permitting requirements. During the meeting, See highlighted FERC’s July 3 decision to adopt two “categorical exclusions” that exempt certain hydroelectric activities from environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.

Categorical exclusions are types of actions that a federal agency has determined generally do not significantly affect the human environment. By adopting the two exclusions that are already used by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, it won’t take as long to get approvals for certain maintenance, replacement and safety enhancing projects at hydro facilities, according to See.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jdk-Yii3_oAUM3aevims0pa2AZtqhH1-IxPBaSScjBg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTU1OTg1MTUyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-26 12:03:34.910453

That’s what a coalition of consumers and environmental advocated said Friday after PJM Interconnection, which runs the power grid in Pennsylvania and parts or all of it in 12 other states, held a capacity auction.

A capacity auction is a mechanism to guarantee future electric supply. This year’s auction could result in rates going up another 5% next year, on top of hikes this year.

Advocates cite three reasons for the increase: “The ever increasing demand from data centers, lower reliability from gas-fired power plants and the continued delay in clearing primarily new clean energy and battery storage resources,” said Robert Ruth, Pennsylvania policy director for climate and energy at the National Resources Defense Council.

But PJM blamed the higher costs on the retirement of some older power plants and said it is doing everything it can to bring more energy supply into the grid. It also said it’s changing some rules and using AI to find ways to lower prices.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has a different theory. Last year, he filed a complaint with federal regulators over the auction process, calling it “the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.”

Shapiro said he was successful in getting PJM to lower its auction cap, shaving $8.3 billion from an earlier possible result. However, the governor said reform is still needed.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2022/10/GettyImages-1350713242.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-26 16:02:32.125101

Tesla needs 'actual new' models to generate excitement again

Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk ""let the cat out of the bag,"" as he put it, earlier this week, saying that one of the long-awaited cheaper Tesla electric vehicles would look a lot like a pared-down version of the Model Y.

The notion that at least one of the more affordable Tesla models - the company keeps mentioning cheaper vehicles, plural, in its communications with investors - would be fundamentally a Model Y has been around for months.

The confirmation of sorts came as Musk made off-the-cuff remarks on the post-results call this week - right after another Tesla executive said that the company didn't want to get into a discussion about what the car would look like - but that is likely to do little to pull Tesla (TSLA) out of its sales slump.

That's because to really get people excited about the brand again, Tesla needs ""actual new vehicle models,"" not just updates to existing ones, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in an interview.

""It's been over five years now since Tesla made its first Model Y delivery, and the only new model the company has brought to market in that time has been the Cybertruck,"" Nelson said.

Musk and other executives did not mention the Cybertruck at all during the call. Their emphasis was entirely on robotaxis and a future robotaxi network, and on the company's Optimus robot.

A revamped Model Y, launched earlier this year, appears to have done little for Tesla sales.

Tesla delivered 384,122 EVs in the second quarter, down from 444,000 in the same quarter of 2024. The company groups Model 3 and Model Y sales together and does not offer sales breakdowns by country or region.

On the call, Musk went as far as promising to offer robotaxi services to roughly half the U.S. population by the end of the year.

""Meanwhile, competition has increased, overall EV sales growth is waning - and the tax-credit expiration won't help - and consumers have since shown much greater interest in hybrids, so Tesla is really paying the price for dragging its feet on new models over the last few years,"" Nelson said.

Lower-priced vehicles are usually money losers, as well. Several carmakers have either done away entirely with entry-level cars or sent their production lines overseas to try to boost slim profit margins.

Some see those cheaper cars as gateway vehicles to a brand. But brand loyalty is not as strong as it used to be, as consumers have been increasingly squeezed by higher prices and interest rates.

The average price of a new car in the U.S. has hovered around $48,000 this year, and that's before tariff costs are factored in. In June 2020 it was about $39,000, according to Edmunds.com. General Motors Co. (GM) said this week it plans to raise prices of its North American vehicles by between 0.5% and 1%.

For Tesla, the economics of a lower-priced vehicle would be highly dependent on consumers also subscribing to Full Self Driving (Supervised), Tesla's suite of advanced driver-assistance systems meant for city driving, which is available as a one-time purchase for $8,000 or as a $99 monthly subscription.

Many people might be ""reluctant"" to go for that, Nelson said.

In the post-results call with analysts, Musk said that the ""biggest obstacle"" for the cheaper Model Y is that people want to buy the car but don't have enough money to make the purchase.

""Literally, that is the issue. Not a lack of desire, but lack of ability. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better,"" he said.

But Wall Street is not so sure about the desire part of the equation. Interest in EVs in general has waned, and the Tesla brand has been badly damaged by Musk's involvement in right-wing politics in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Musk then went on to presumably alienate some supporters of President Donald Trump by very publicly feuding with the president and vowing to start a third political party in the United States.

Several investment banks have dialed down sales expectations for Tesla. While a small sales boost could come from a cheaper Model Y entering volume production later this year, there's a bigger drag ahead, as federal tax credits for EVs are slated to end in late September.

Morgan Stanley on Thursday tweaked its sales forecast lower for the second half of the year and for 2026, saying the move was ""a result of the removal of EV consumer tax credits,"" partly offset by the cheaper Model Y reaching volume production this year. The investment bank expects sales of 1.85 million Teslas next year, down from a previous expectation of 1.89 million.

The FactSet consensus is for sales of 1.65 million Tesla vehicles this year, below the 1.79 million sold in 2024 and the 1.81 million in the year before that. The consensus for 2026 is at 1.95 million.

And while consumers might appreciate the option to buy a cheaper Model Y, Wall Street largely has set its sights on robotaxis and the Optimus humanoid robots as the real future moneymakers at Tesla.

The ""overwhelming key to the Tesla story over the next year is the success of its Unsupervised FSD technology and robotaxi traction,"" Stephen Gengaro at Stifel said in a note Friday.

A successful expansion of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, plus a potential rollout in a few other markets ""is likely a catalyst for the shares,"" Gengaro said.

Meanwhile, Tesla's stock continues to underperform the broader equity market. The stock is down about 21% this year, including an 8% wallop on the first trading day after the most recent quarterly results. The S&P 500 index SPX has gained around 9% in 2025.

Now, master plan number two, if you go back, they are dropped in 2023, April 5th, the day after my uh my birthday. That's how I remember it. Um lots of talk about the green economy. I would think his next master plan will lean into robots and AI. How do you view Tesla here? Is it still a car maker first? Or is it a, is an AI play that should be put on the same pedestal as anvidia?

Yeah, you just mentioned the the great problem here with AI. When we look at valuation, investors also do not know exactly how to value it. Is it an EV maker? Is it more than that? Um, I think we are in the transition phase. So, it's a very critical phase for Tesla at the moment. The thing is, it's not anymore just an EV play, but it's also not a robo taxi robot company already. So, we we have struggles here, and especially with Tesla, we have to be a little bit careful. There is a lot of um, yeah, broken promises down the road, right? A lot of huge um promises, but but then delayed launches and and and it doesn't really realize all that much. So, I think we have to be a little bit careful here. And for us to being able to be a buyer here, we would need really some food, we would need to see some food on the ground, and we would need to see some realization first.

Ali, um, you know, on the earnings call last night, I was looking for something that would hint to me earnings estimates have bottomed in Tesla for this year and next year. We've been tracking that a lot. You could track this on the Yahoo Finance platform. Just go to the Tesla ticker page, click analysis and you can find these numbers. But they have continued to trend lower really over the past year. I didn't get that from this earnings call. It was unclear to me. Has the auto business bottomed? Uh, is Elon really going to truly go all in on robo taxis? Because if he is, this is going to be a very costly endeavor with an unproven top-line benefit.

Yeah, Tesla seems to be a company that's stuck between what it was, what it is, which is that pure EV play, and really what it wants to be, which is this AI powerhouse leaning in on robots, autonomous driving. But that is definitely far out down the line, and we still have murky timelines there for when we could see these rollouts be more aggressive, and ultimately, when that's going to be a profitable part of the business. The EV side of Tesla's business, that's the bread and butter. That's what makes them money. And we're seeing sales slow in the US, in Europe. There's a heck of a lot of competition on that front. So, I get why investors are frustrated. And now with Trump's one big beautiful bill, that's going to be removing those EV tax credits. So that's going to weigh on demand for Tesla's business. That's also going to impact the energy side of the business because those solar tax credits are going to be removed. And that's something executives also talked about on the call. So there just seems to be a lot of hurdles here for a company that's looking way out into the future. Now, the Tesla bulls, they are still bullish and they are banking on that future for Tesla, on the potential, on the possibility. But I wonder when the patience is going to start dissipating for investors. We've already sort of seen that. But there there just needs to be a little bit more clarity on timelines, on profits, before we really start to see a rebound here in shares.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AUCAfkl6yPKE0pKGDmVHsA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/7121b330-68a2-11f0-bef5-0d7c7d358884,N,,2025-07-26 12:02:37.965784

Costs of electric vehicles in the US could drop by $6,000+ with LFP batteries.

The Chinese EV industry dominates with over 80% of new EVs using LFP technology.

GM, Samsung, and LG plan to convert US battery plants to produce LFP batteries for mass-market EV models.

Electric vehicle costs in the US could drop by $6,000 or more. Ford, GM, and Tesla have all invested heavily in LFP battery production in the US, partnering with LG, Samsung, and in the case of Ford, using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL. Stellantis has also partnered with CATL to build an LFP factory in Spain.

Lithium-iron Phosphate or LFP is cheaper than the original Lithium-ion NMC that the EV industry was built on, but until quite recently, this technology was not suitable for use in most EVs. Major technological advances, mainly in China, have improved LFP batteries to the point where they're replacing Lithium-ion batteries around the world.

The dominance of the Chinese EV industry -- with BYD recently surpassing Tesla as the biggest EV maker -- is based on its LFP dominance to a large extent. Over 80% of new EVs in China use LFP, and this technology is gaining traction in Europe and other markets where China has a footprint. The only notable LFP in the US was in the Model 3 discontinued last year, as well as in mass storage batteries. However, it's all about to change.

GM, Samsung, and LG

Cost savings in mass-market models

Korean battery giants Samsung and LG plan to add LFP manufacturing capacity to their US plants co-owned by GM. These plants currently produce NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) batteries. This move is the result of pressure from GM to lower EV costs to boost lagging uptake.

GM's strategy seems to envisage a two-tier system, with its mid-range, mass-market models using LFP, and its premium vehicles staying with NCM. Models like the Bolt, Equinox, Blazer EV, and Silverado EV will get LFP batteries, while the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq will keep using NCM. GM is known to be keen on LFP EVs under $30,000. Moving from NCM to LFP can cut battery costs by 20 to 30%, or at least $6,000 per vehicle.

GM's move is in line with expectations in the industry, where cost pressure on EV are rising. The move to LFP for volume vehicles will likely happen across all carmakers with EVs in their lineups.

Converting existing plants

Samsung and GM have a $3.5 billion joint venture facility in Indiana set to begin production of NCM batteries in 2027, and will convert part of this capacity to LFP. Samsung is currently securing supply chains and redesigning equipment for this move.

LG will convert its existing plants in Tennessee and Ohio to allow LFP manufacturing there.

Ford Michigan plant

Bringing manufacturing back

Ford has publicly acknowledged China's technological lead in EVs and their batteries, and it faced massive criticism when it started building a battery factory in Michigan in 2023 that would depend on Chinese technology. Ford defended its decision to use CATL's tech under license at the plant because it would bring back manufacturing expertise long ceded to China. This initiative will not only create jobs in the US, but also give Ford access to the technology it needs to compete globally.

Ford plans to launch the LFP batteries in a series of affordable EVs from 2027 on. It isn't clear how much of a role CATL will play in the Ford venture, beyond the original licensing agreement.

Tesla's Nevada battery factory

From big batteries to cheaper cars?

Tesla, with its major presence in China, has long had relationships with CATL and BYD outside the US. A lesser-known, but quite massive, part of its business is producing enormous electricity supply systems (ESS), massive batteries that can charge during oversupply and feed the grid when power supplies are lower. Although its new Nevada plant is believed to use CATL LFP equipment and technology for these large storage cells, it could provide an indirect pathway into the US market.

This possible relationship is currently more in the realm of conjecture, but Tesla, like all EV makers, is under pressure to lower prices. This pressure will get more urgent once the EV tax rebate falls away at the end of September.

LFP batteries

Invented in Texas, perfected in China

LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) batteries were invented in Texas in 1997, and are cheaper than the ones using nickel and cobalt, because they use widely available materials. Until a couple of years ago, LFP was not really suitable for EVs, because they did not have the same energy density as lithium-ion batteries.They were used in mass storage, where size and weight were not an issue. But Chinese companies like CATL and BYD have invested heavily in this more affordable technology and managed to increase the density in specifically designed batteries, bringing range, size, and weight into parameters that make them ideal for EVs.

These companies now control most of the patents and manufacturing expertise needed to make LFP batteries.

LFP vs NMC-based

Both LFP and NMC batteries have advantages and drawbacks.The advantages of LFP are:

Raw materials are cheaper and easier to find

Cheaper to manufacture

Does not use cobalt, often sourced from conflict areas

Can handle heat and high voltage better

Degrade slower

Less prone to overheating or catching fire

Disadvantages of LFP are:

Lower energy density

Shorter range for same size battery

Slower charging in cold weather

Advantages of NMC:

More energy density

More power and range

Can charge faster

Disadvantages of NMC

Degrades in heat and with high voltage

Relies on conflict materials

More expensive

LFPs are still very new

LFPs have only really been an option for EVs from around 2020, and the technology is rapidly improving. BYD, for example, has developed its Blade Battery, which allows LFP to get the same power and range as NMC-type batteries. GM has just unveiled a manganese-rich battery which it considers a game-changer; others are working on graphene, while the elusive solid-state battery should go into production pretty soon.",https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tesla-model-s-plaid.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 15:02:28.863466

With legislation set to eliminate popular tax credits, experts are urging Americans to act quickly before the money is no longer on the table.

What's happening?

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), eligible individuals could access tax credits and rebates for electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels.

Many of the credits were instant rebates at the point of sale, making these changes easier and more affordable for everyday people.

But under the Big Beautiful Bill, many of those incentives will vanish, starting in September 2025. That means anyone planning eco-friendly improvements could lose out on thousands of dollars unless they act sooner rather than later.

Advocates at clean energy groups have warned that the new legislation would significantly undermine recent progress.

Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, stated that the plan ""doesn't just burden families, it undermines our country,"" emphasizing that it cuts consumer-facing credits that have helped households save thousands and improve energy efficiency.

Why is the IRA important?

This isn't just about saving money — it's also about protecting your health and improving your home.

Fortunately, some aspects of the IRA have survived, including rebates for heat pumps, insulation, and induction stoves.

The latter is a smart upgrade for households. Gas stoves release pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, which scientists have linked to asthma and other health risks, especially in children.

Induction stoves offer a safer, faster, and more cost-effective solution. And right now, the Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program can knock up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.

But with the uncertainty surrounding government policy on these rebates, it's best to act soon.

If they do disappear, portable plug-in induction burners start at just $50 and work on any standard outlet. This tech is also great for those who rent or don't have the budget for a full range.

What can I do to make the most of the IRA incentives?

If you've been thinking about upgrading your home, now's the time to act. Rebates and tax credits are still available for weatherproofing your home, upgrading your HVAC system, installing electric appliances, and more. Many of these improvements can lower your utility bills in the long run — and help cut pollution at the same time.

Induction stoves, for example, boil water nearly twice as fast as gas or traditional electric ones, use less energy, and don't release harmful fumes into your kitchen. That makes them a smart choice for your wallet and your health.

“This project reflects who we are and who we want to be,” Gilgour said.","Mineral Area College (MAC) is moving forward with its large-scale solar energy project, which is expected to save the school hundreds of thousands of dollars annually while significantly reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing sustainability efforts across the campus.

The project, approved by the MAC Board of Trustees in January 2025, is being built on approximately eight acres of college-owned property located behind the softball fields on the main campus in Park Hills. The Board selected A.P.C. Solar as the contractor in a competitive bidding process. Construction is underway, with the system expected to come online by the start of the Fall semester. When completed, the system will produce about 3 megawatts of direct current (DC) power and is projected to generate up to 80% of the electricity needed for the facilities it serves. College officials estimate the project will yield annual savings of approximately $300,000 in electricity costs.

“We believe this is not only a smart financial investment, but a necessary step to modernize and position the college for a sustainable future,” said MAC President Dr. Joe Gilgour. “It allows us to lower our utility costs while aligning with our responsibility to be good stewards of both public funds and the environment.”

The project is funded through a bond issue approved by district voters in April 2024. By pursuing direct ownership of the system rather than using a lease or power purchase agreement, the college will be eligible for direct-pay federal tax credits offered through the Inflation Reduction Act. These credits, combined with the anticipated utility savings, could allow the college to recoup the full project cost within 10 to 12 years.

In addition to financial benefits, the solar array is expected to reduce the college’s greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually—the equivalent of removing nearly 1,000 cars from the road. The college stated that it selected the site to minimize visual disruption and avoid any negative ecological impact, noting that the field behind the athletic complex had been previously unused.

College leaders say the project also supports MAC’s educational mission. The array is expected to provide opportunities for hands-on learning in areas such as environmental science, electronics, facilities management, and workforce development. Administrators are exploring the possibility of incorporating real-time solar data into science and technology courses, and faculty are being encouraged to develop new coursework related to renewable energy.

“This isn’t just a cost-saving measure—it’s a teaching tool,” said Gilgour. “Our students will have the opportunity to learn about solar technology not just from a book, but by observing and analyzing a system that’s producing real power right here on campus.”

Although the college does not currently have a formal sustainability plan, the project represents a significant step toward achieving its long-term environmental and operational goals. Officials say it will improve the school’s eligibility for future grants, raise its profile in sustainability initiatives, and serve as a model for other rural institutions considering similar investments.

The solar array is part of a broader strategy to reduce the college’s reliance on fossil fuels, lower operational costs, and reinvest savings into student services and infrastructure improvements.

“This project reflects who we are and who we want to be,” Gilgour said. “It’s forward-thinking, fiscally responsible, and rooted in the support we received from our community. We’re grateful for the opportunity to take this next step.”

Once completed, the system will be one of the largest solar installations among Missouri’s community colleges and is expected to be fully operational before the end of the Fall semester.

As data centers expand to process trillions of computations daily, the demand for reliable, scalable power infrastructure has surged. This creates a unique investment opportunity in underappreciated stocks that are strategically positioned to benefit from the AI-energy nexus. Among the most compelling plays are Argan (AGX), a leader in gas and renewable energy infrastructure, Constellation Energy (CEG), a nuclear power innovator, and DoorDash (DASH), a high-growth delivery platform leveraging AI to transform local commerce.

The AI-Driven Energy Landscape: A $Trillion Opportunity

AI's insatiable hunger for energy has forced a reevaluation of power infrastructure. Data centers alone are projected to consume 3% of global electricity by 2030, a 50% increase from 2023. This demand is driving a shift toward hybrid energy solutions—combining gas-fired plants for baseload reliability with renewables for sustainability. Companies that bridge this gap, like Argan and Constellation Energy, are poised to outperform traditional utilities.

Argan (AGX): The Infrastructure Engine Behind AI Growth

Argan Inc. (AGX) has emerged as a critical player in the energy transition, with a 36% year-over-year increase in project backlog to $1.9 billion in Q1 2026. This includes $1.26 billion in gas-fired projects and $532 million in renewables, reflecting its balanced approach to meeting AI infrastructure needs.

AGX's financials underscore its strength: revenue rose 23% to $193.7 million, driven by a 45% surge in Power Industry Services. Its gross margin expanded to 19%, up from 11.4% in Q1 2025, as higher-margin projects gained traction. The company's $546.5 million in cash and investments, coupled with $315 million in net liquidity, provides flexibility for share repurchases and dividend hikes.

Key projects like the 1.2 GW Sandow Lakes Power Station and a 700-MW gas plant highlight AGX's role in supporting data hubs. CEO David Watson's emphasis on long-term gas demand—driven by turbine bookings through 2030—adds visibility to future growth. However, supply chain delays and regulatory risks remain challenges. For investors, AGX offers a compelling leveraged bet on AI-driven energy demand, with a P/E ratio of 12.8 and a forward dividend yield of 1.2%.

Historical data shows that AGX has demonstrated a strong tendency for positive short-term performance following earnings releases, with a 71.43% win rate over 30 days, indicating investor confidence in its financial performance.

Constellation Energy (CEG): Powering AI with Nuclear Innovation

Constellation Energy (CEG) is uniquely positioned to capitalize on AI's energy needs through its nuclear fleet and strategic acquisitions. In Q1 2025, CEG secured a 20-year, 1.1 GW virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) with Meta, supplying carbon-free power from its Clinton Plant starting in 2027. This deal locks in premium pricing of $80–90/MWh, significantly above current market rates, and highlights nuclear energy's value for AI data centers requiring uninterrupted power.

CEG's financials reinforce its momentum: adjusted operating earnings grew 17.6% to $2.14/share in Q1 2025, and the company reaffirmed its $8.90–$9.60/share full-year guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act's production tax credits (PTC) add downside protection, with revenues from nuclear units expected to rise as incremental GWs are contracted.

The acquisition of Calpine, a natural gas generation leader, further diversifies CEG's energy mix, creating a coast-to-coast fleet. This move is projected to boost adjusted operating earnings by over 20% in 2026 and $2.00/share through 2029. CEG's stock has surged 45% since March 2025, trading at a P/E of 22.8, but its robust balance sheet and $1 billion share buyback program suggest room for further upside.

Historical analysis reveals CEG has shown a moderate positive trend post-earnings, with a 62.50% win rate over 30 days, reflecting steady investor interest despite slightly lower returns compared to AGX.

DoorDash (DASH): AI-Driven Commerce and Delivery Evolution

While not an energy provider, DoorDash (DASH) exemplifies how AI is reshaping local commerce. The company's 2025 AI-powered tools—such as the Item Description Generator and AI-Powered Camera—enhance merchant efficiency and customer engagement, driving a 44% increase in sales for participating restaurants. These tools are part of a broader strategy to transform DASH into a ""super-app"" for local commerce, with advertising revenue projected to grow from $1B to $2.6B by 2027.

DASH's recent acquisitions, including Deliveroo and Symbiosys, have expanded its global footprint to 40 countries and bolstered its adtech capabilities. Partnerships with Aldi and Starbucks further diversify its revenue streams, reducing reliance on food delivery margins. Despite regulatory challenges—such as Canada's drip pricing lawsuit—DASH's market cap of $92.29 billion and 279.23 P/E ratio reflect high growth expectations.

Strategic Entry Points and Market Momentum

The AI-energy infrastructure sector is still in its early innings, offering strategic entry points for investors with a 1–3 year horizon. Argan and Constellation Energy represent low-volatility, high-margin plays with clear tailwinds from AI-driven energy demand. DoorDash, while more speculative, offers exposure to AI's transformative impact on local commerce.

For AGX, a pullback to $28–$30 (from its current $32.50) could present a buying opportunity, given its strong backlog and dividend yield. CEG's stock, currently at $88, is undervalued relative to its 2026 earnings potential, making it a core holding for long-term energy portfolios. DASH, despite its high P/E, is justified by its advertising growth and AI-driven monetization, though investors should monitor regulatory risks.

AGX's strong post-earnings performance, with a 71.43% 30-day win rate, suggests that strategic entry points around earnings dates could enhance returns. Similarly, CEG's 62.50% win rate indicates that its post-earnings momentum supports its inclusion as a core holding.

Conclusion: Building the Future, One Megawatt at a Time

The convergence of AI and energy infrastructure is reshaping industries, creating opportunities for companies like Argan, Constellation Energy, and DoorDash to lead the charge. As data centers expand and local commerce evolves, these stocks offer a mix of strategic positioning, financial strength, and innovation.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

President Trump’s recent proclamation will permit 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 in Louisiana, to bypass new federal emission limits.

Last week, Trump issued “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” This created a two-year exemption from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) May Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or the HON rule.

“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”

The facilities in Louisiana now exempt from the HON rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar

Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II, Plaquemine

Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge

Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville

Westlake Vinyl, Westlake

BASF Corp., Geismar

Rubicon, Geismar

Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles

TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville

Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace

Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles

DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Congressman Troy A. Carter, Sr. said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.

U.S. Rep. Troy A. Carter, Sr. sharply criticized Trump’s proclamation this week for granting a two-year exemption to 12 petrochemical companies in Louisiana, calling the decision “appalling” and a threat to public health.

“As the U.S. Congressman from Louisiana—where most of these petrochemical facilities are located—I find it appalling that this administration shows so little regard for the health of communities, families, and workers living near these plants.

Carter, a Democrat representing Louisiana’s 2nd Congressional District, emphasized that industry and communities can coexist only when “the safety and well-being of people come first.”

“Granting twelve petrochemical companies in Louisiana a two-year exemption from a 2024 rule that aimed to reduce pollution and cancer risk is reckless. That rule was designed to lower emissions of toxic chemicals, such as ethylene oxide and chloroprene, by over 6,200 tons per year and reduce cancer risk by up to 96% for nearby communities.

“Polluters and violators should not get a free pass. We can protect jobs and protect people—but profits should never come at the cost of public health. I am committed to holding these companies—and this administration—accountable,” he said.

Many facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers in Laplace being the most prominent.

In February 2023, the EPA and DOJ sued the company, alleging that its neoprene operations pose an imminent threat to public health due to cancer risks associated with chloroprene emissions.

The Biden administration has demanded that Denka reduce chloroprene and ethylene oxide emissions at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days, unlike the two years allotted for other facilities. Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.

Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed. In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant, forcing it to halt operations. The EPA identified five census tracts in LaPlace with the highest chloroprene exposure in the U.S., all linked to the Denka plant.

Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.

In July 2023, a fire at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine burned for two days. The plant has experienced multiple emergencies since 2019, including four unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, a flammable and toxic compound that can cause kidney damage with prolonged exposure.

In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and led to school lockdowns until the smoke cleared. Federal records indicate that the plant has a history of spills, accidents, and injuries.

Before Trump took office again, the EPA enforced financial penalties on facilities that violated safety and environmental rules. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals over an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that caused a fire burning 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to produce synthetic materials and jet fuel.

Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, argued the agency is authorized but not mandated to enforce the Clean Air Act, based on a 2007 Supreme Court ruling.",https://lobservateur.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/03/denka-plant.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 10:59:33.346380

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

Sarah Melotte and Julia Tilton // The Daily Yonder

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have ""make-ready"" incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that's needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency's annual report released in May.

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity.

The regulations passed concerning the CO2 output from coal plants effectively make them illegal and must be shut down by 2030.
But coal plants provide 24/7 baseload power and cannot be replaced with wind and solar.
Nowadays, natural gas power plants are half the price of coal plants, provided there is pipeline infrastructure.
The EPA has now federally mandated that coal-burning power plants be kept operative despite state regulations and wishes.","Members of our Community Editorial Board, a group of community residents who are engaged with and passionate about local issues, respond to the following question: The Environmental Protection Agency recently signaled it no longer believes Colorado can mandate utility companies close their coal-fired power plants as part of the state’s strategy to reduce emissions. Your take?

The EPA’s signal on coal plants stems from its ability to regulate CO2 output from industrial plants under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act. The CAA language, originally intended to control true pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOX and NOX), was written so broadly as to include anything that would “reasonably endanger public welfare.” Justice Scalia, in dissent, said this language would include “frisbees and flatulence.” Calling CO2 a pollutant is akin to calling water a pollutant. Yes, too much CO2 in the atmosphere will certainly kill us, but, as we’ve seen a lot this summer, too much water will do the same. Before humans started pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, the concentration of that essential gas was at a planetary low. If it had fallen much further, photosynthesis would have stopped, and along with it, life on Earth.

That said, the Supreme Court ruling isn’t outrageous. The problem is that prematurely decommissioning coal plants doesn’t make our lives better. The regulations passed concerning the CO2 output from coal plants effectively make them illegal and must be shut down by 2030. Hurrah, right? Coal is dirty, and we should get rid of it anyway. But coal plants provide 24/7 baseload power and cannot be replaced with wind and solar. Even if you believe in miracles that Colorado reaches our 2030 climate goals (zero chance of that), it makes no sense to shut down base load generation until we have a replacement. In late May, the Department of Energy issued an emergency order to delay the shutdown of a coal plant. A few days later, power demand surged, and a blackout was averted only because that plant was still operating.

I understand the desire to reduce CO2, but let’s not cut off our nose to spite our face. Nowadays, natural gas power plants are half the price of coal plants, provided there is pipeline infrastructure. It is unlikely that any new coal plants will be built in the U.S. Ally Sullivan, a Polis spokesperson, stated that utilities plan to transition to “more stable clean energy.” That phrase is oxymoronic. There might be valid reasons to use more wind and solar power, but stability is not one of them. There is nothing stable about wind or solar. They are intermittent. If and until we have viable energy storage, they cannot replace baseload power. Coal power remains essential in the U.S.

Making s’mores is a summer ritual for millions of Americans. Next week, my grandson, Ellis, will come out to Colorado. My wife and I will be sure to tutor him in the fine art of roasting marshmallows. The confection must be held above the flame so that the sugar glazes to a golden brown on all sides. If held too close to the fire, it ignites and is transformed into blackened ash, carbon waste, and one must start over.

The residue of burned coal is coal ash, carbon waste, and currently, 1.6 million tons of coal ash is spread across 15 acres between Valmont Butte and Leggett reservoir in Boulder. It seeps into the groundwater, according to Xcel Energy, at “acceptable levels.”

One hundred years ago, the Valmont smokestack was the pride of a growing city; now it stands as a reminder that, with fossil fuels, we are too close to the flame. Coal is used to convert water into steam, which produces electrical energy. Coal was the engine of the Industrial Revolution and propelled the Front Range into the 20th Century. But we inhabit a new century and face a new moment.

Trump and other climate deniers must not lead us into a future fueled by coal. Trump, through executive order, seeks to promote “Clean Coal.” We know such phrasing from “1984” as “doublespeak,” language that distorts or reverses the intended meaning of words. George Orwell would agree, there is no such thing as “clean coal.” Trump has doubled down on doublespeak. In his administration, the EPA has become the AEP, Abolish Environmental Protection. We must weigh the needs of the environment against the need for increased energy production and finally admit that coal is among the worst sources of pollution in the world and has pushed climate change to the crisis point. The Trump cabal wants to keep the coal burning and loosen environmental protections. The EPA has now federally mandated that coal-burning power plants be kept operative despite state regulations and wishes.

In 1966, Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” detailed the impact of human activity on the natural world. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency was formed, followed by the passage of the Clean Air Act. Soon after, public service companies went to court to seek variances against regulation. People pushed the government, and the government responded. In the Trump Administration, we are going backwards … again.

Like the first celebrants of Earth Day, we must put Earth first. This is urgent. All other concerns orbit around this priority. Toast your summer marshmallows, not the planet.

The Environmental Protection Agency has signaled it may reject Colorado’s plan to count coal plant retirements toward meeting clean air goals under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The law requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining how they will reduce specific pollutants to meet federal air quality standards. Once approved, SIPs become enforceable under federal law. While the CAA doesn’t address climate change or carbon emissions directly, it does regulate regional haze — a visibility issue affecting national parks and wilderness areas that many states have used as an indirect way to support coal plant closures. Colorado followed that precedent, including planned retirements in its SIP as a practical way to meet federal goals.

The EPA now claims the CAA doesn’t allow states to include coal closures as credit toward meeting haze targets — despite decades of precedent under both Republican and Democratic administrations. It also suggests the closures may violate the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, arguing they amount to an uncompensated seizure of private property. But coal plants are already heavily regulated, and states routinely impose such requirements without raising constitutional issues. The EPA appears determined to avoid any federal fingerprints on coal plant closures, framing them as purely local decisions — even though the legal basis for including them in the SIP remains strong.

If the EPA rejects Colorado’s SIP, it is legally obligated to impose a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) within two years unless a revised plan is approved. What happens next is uncertain. The agency might argue that further regulation isn’t needed, or be legally compelled to impose costly retrofits and pollution controls to meet the same air quality targets. Either outcome serves no one well — not Colorado, not the utilities operating the coal plants, and not even the federal government. Rejecting the SIP risks an inefficient path forward, especially when the state’s plan relies on a plant already scheduled for closure. It’s a counterproductive move driven more by political optics than practical outcomes.

The good news is that Colorado’s energy transition is well underway, with or without federal approval. Utilities like Tri-State are retiring coal plants simply because it no longer makes economic sense. Maintenance is costly, retrofits expensive, and natural gas remains cheap and flexible. Even more promising, renewables like wind and solar are now the lowest-cost sources of new energy. Tri-State’s plan to shut down the Craig coal units by 2028 reflects this shift.

Still, it’s a bittersweet transition. Natural gas, while cleaner than coal, is far from carbon-free. And companies like Xcel Energy will surely weigh regulatory risk against operational cost — not just act out of principle. What’s ultimately at stake is precedent. Colorado’s closures are secure, but if this legally untested EPA stance takes hold, it could constrain future climate action and render the Clean Air Act even less relevant in a rapidly changing energy landscape.

Now imagine if new nuclear power plants come onto the grid in 15 years.
Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and too slow to deploy.
And not only would nuclear power not support renewable energy generators on the grid, it would also actually work against these clean, low-cost technologies.","As the last coal plants in Colorado shut down, nuclear power proponents are campaigning to replace them with nuclear reactors. An advisory committee for the city of Pueblo recommended that Xcel replace its Comanche 3 coal plant with an “advanced nuclear power plant.” Bolstering that effort, the Colorado Legislature recently passed a bill redefining nuclear as a “clean energy resource.”

Colorado’s only experience with nuclear power was not a good one. The Fort St. Vrain reactor near Platteville operated from 1979 until 1989, when it was shut down due to safety problems. It took three years to decommission the plant at a cost of $125 million, which, like the $200 million of plant costs, was passed on to Xcel ratepayers. A special facility has stored 244 canisters containing the reactor’s high-level radioactive waste for the past 36 years. Ultimately, they will need to be transported over Colorado roads to an as yet unidentified deep geologic site to be stored for thousands of years.

Should Colorado give nuclear power a second look? I argue no for three key reasons.

High cost and high risk

According to the financial firm Lazard, the cost of the electricity produced by a nuclear power plant (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) is three times that of solar and wind. The only new reactors recently built in the U.S., Vogtle Units 3 and 4, were completed seven years behind schedule at a cost of $36.8 billion — more than two and a half times the original budget. That high cost has resulted in higher electricity bills for Georgia Power ratepayers.

There is much talk today about developing new, untested small modular reactors, or SMRs (defined as 300 megawatts or smaller in size) to ostensibly lower the cost, and this is the technology being promoted in Pueblo. The problem here is that virtually anything — be it a power plant or a container of pretzels from Costco — is cheaper per unit item the bigger it is. Nuclear plants have gotten much larger over time because of this economy of scale. The Vogtle units are each 1,100 MW. A 300 MW plant will have a higher capital construction cost per kilowatt, and its delivered electricity cost will also be significantly higher. The one SMR design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NuScale, which was scheduled to be built in Idaho, was canceled because its projected capital cost had risen to $20,000 per kilowatt — more than 10 times that of utility-scale solar with battery storage.

Very long lead times

The total time from concept to operation for a new nuclear power plant is about 15 years, compared to solar and wind plants, which take one to two years. Fifteen years is a long time to wait to address climate change and air pollution. And during that time, you could spend far less money deploying solar and wind and preventing all those emissions.

Bad fit for Colorado’s renewables-based electric grid

Nuclear proponents argue that because nuclear plants run 24 hours a day, they can fill in the gaps when solar and wind are not available. But let’s take a closer look at that claim. Xcel plans to provide 80 percent of its electricity from solar and wind in just the next five years. Although Colorado is very sunny year-round, grid operators must be prepared for occasional “dark lull” periods of four days or more when local solar and wind resources are limited by the weather. Xcel plans to burn stored natural gas in low-cost combustion turbines during these brief periods.

Now imagine if new nuclear power plants come onto the grid in 15 years. Like all nuclear plants in the U.S., they will need to be run at full power 24 hours a day to sell enough electricity to pay off their high debt. So, what happens when an occasional dark lull occurs, and solar and wind power drop off? The utility won’t be able to boost nuclear plant output because it will already be at full power. Furthermore, because it will duplicate power already being provided by solar and wind, it will cause that renewable electricity to be wastefully curtailed.

Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and too slow to deploy.

On one hand, the recently signed federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” pulls back from recent progress that has been made in clean energy production, limiting our energy options instead of supporting an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy.

That means fewer jobs, less economic growth and an electric grid that will become increasingly strained under continued and unprecedented demand for more power.

On the other hand, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and President Donald Trump were in Pittsburgh recently to announce a whopping $90 billion in energy and technology investments in Pennsylvania.

Among them is a plan from Westinghouse Electric Company to build 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors across the U.S. – expected to generate $6 billion in investment and 15,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

There is widespread support for more investment in safe, reliable nuclear power.

Pennsylvania has a strong nuclear legacy and generates the second most nuclear energy in the country.

To lead the new nuclear resurgence, we’ll have to exceed our current pace. As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance.

That means setting aside party labels and advancing commonsense energy policy that is solution-driven and puts Pennsylvanians first.

Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Only through a comprehensive approach to our energy policy can we ensure our power supply is reliable, clean and affordable – not just today, but for future generations.

Portland General Electric (NYSE: ) presented its latest investor presentation on July 25, 2025, highlighting the company’s strategic focus on clean energy transition and robust industrial load growth. The vertically integrated energy company serves approximately 950,000 retail customers and covers roughly half of Oregon’s population, including the high-tech ""Silicon Forest"" corridor.

PGE’s stock has faced challenges recently, closing at $39.73 on July 25, 2025, near its 52-week low of $39.55, despite posting better-than-expected earnings in Q1 2025. The company’s shares saw a modest 4.2% gain on the presentation day, with minimal after-hours movement.

Strategic Initiatives

PGE outlined a comprehensive investment thesis centered on clean energy transition, grid modernization, operational efficiency, and capitalizing on its high-growth service area. The company is particularly focused on meeting increasing demand from semiconductor manufacturers and data centers.

As shown in the following investment thesis overview:

The company is advancing plans to form a holding company structure, with an application filed with Oregon regulators in July 2025 and an estimated effective date in mid-2026. This restructuring aims to provide greater flexibility for non-regulated investments and transmission development.

Financial Performance Highlights

PGE reported 2024 revenue of $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.01 (GAAP) and $3.14 (adjusted non-GAAP). For 2025, the company has provided adjusted non-GAAP guidance of $3.13-$3.33 per share, reaffirming its long-term earnings growth target of 5-7%.

The company’s financial performance shows improvement after a challenging 2023, with accounting ROE trending upward from 7.5% in 2023 to 8.8% in 2024, though still below the allowed ROE of 9.5% (9.34% for 2025).

The following chart illustrates PGE’s long-term financial performance:

Dividend growth has remained consistent, with a 5.7% CAGR from 2016 to 2025 (estimated). The company maintains its long-term dividend growth guidance of 5-7%, aligning with its earnings growth targets.

As shown in the following dividend growth chart:

Capital Expenditure & Growth Plans

PGE’s five-year capital expenditure forecast totals $6.5 billion, driving an expected 7% average rate base growth from the 2024 base year of $7.0 billion. With potential incremental RFP (Request for Proposal) opportunities, this growth could increase to 9%, reaching a rate base of $10.9 billion by 2029.

The capital expenditure plan is detailed in the following chart:

The company’s rate base growth projection is illustrated here:

PGE maintains strong liquidity of $980 million as of June 30, 2025, and plans equity financings of approximately $300 million per year to support its capital program.

Demand Growth & Service Area

One of PGE’s most compelling growth drivers is the robust industrial load expansion in its service territory. The company reported an 8.2% CAGR in industrial load from 2019-2024, with semiconductor and high-tech customers representing approximately 50% of industrial load, followed by data centers and AI at 25%.

The following chart details this demand growth:

Oregon ranks as the fifth-largest data center market nationally, with over $40 billion in ongoing high-tech investment expected to create approximately 6,300 jobs in the region. This trend aligns with the company’s Q1 2025 results, which showed a 16.4% increase in industrial load, contributing to total load growth of 4.6%.

Clean Energy Transition

PGE has made significant progress toward its decarbonization goals, with the company more than one-third of the way toward the emission reductions needed to meet its 2030 target. The company aims to reduce emissions by 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and achieve 100% clean energy by 2040.

The company’s emission reduction trajectory is shown here:

In 2024, PGE completed construction of the Clearwater 311 MW wind energy facility and integrated 292 MW of battery storage. The company’s current resource mix includes 45% non-emitting energy sources, as shown in the following chart:

PGE is also investing in transmission infrastructure to support its clean energy goals, with projects focused on ""last mile"" connections, Pacific Northwest regional upgrades, and interregional projects.

Operational Excellence & Customer Focus

The company highlighted improvements in key operational metrics, including a Lost Time Incident Rate of 0.26 in 2024 (improved from 0.29 in 2023) and second-quartile performance in System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).

PGE has maintained strong customer satisfaction, ranking #1 in 2024 for customer experience and maintaining the top-ranked renewable power program in the United States for 15 consecutive years.

As shown in the customer focus highlights:

Outlook & Guidance

Looking ahead, PGE reaffirmed its 2025 adjusted earnings guidance of $3.13 to $3.33 per diluted share. The company expects long-term load growth of 3% annually through 2029, driven primarily by continued industrial expansion.

Key regulatory proceedings include a Seaside ARM (Automatic Rate Mechanism) with a requested effective date of October 2025 and a Distribution System Plan ARM with a requested effective date of April 2026.

PGE’s resource planning includes a reprice opportunity for its 2023 RFP in Q3 2025, with project in-service dates expected in 2027. The company also plans to issue a new RFP to the market in Q3 2025, with final contracts expected in the second half of 2026.

Despite the positive outlook presented, investors should note that PGE’s stock has underperformed recently, trading near its 52-week low despite beating EPS expectations in Q1 2025. The revenue miss in Q1 ($928 million vs. expected $976.05 million) may be contributing to investor caution despite the company’s strong industrial growth narrative.

“Kerr County is an extreme example of what’s happening everywhere,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association.
In Kerr County, FEMA’s maps showed 2,560 properties (6.5 percent) in a flood zone.

The country watched in horror as torrential rain drenched Texas earlier this month, sweeping at least 135 people to their death. Kerr County alone lost 107, including more than two dozen children at Camp Mystic.

From afar, it would be easy, even tempting, to think that floods like these could never happen to you. That the disaster is remote.

It’s not.

As details of the tragedy have come into focus, the list of contributing factors has grown. Sudden downpours, driven by climate change. The lack of a comprehensive warning system to notify people that the Guadalupe River was rising rapidly. Rampant building in areas known to flood, coupled with incomplete information about what places might be at risk.

These are the same elements that could trigger a Kerr County type of catastrophe in every state in the country. It’s a reality that has played out numerous times already in recent years, with flooding in Vermont, Kentucky, North Carolina and elsewhere, leaving grief and billions of dollars in destruction in its wake.

“Kerr County is an extreme example of what’s happening everywhere,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association. “People are at risk because of it, and there’s more that we need to be doing.”

The most obvious problem is we keep building in areas prone to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, produces readily available maps showing high-risk locales. Yet, according to the latest data from the nonprofit climate research firm First Street Foundation, 7.9 million homes and other structures stand in a FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area, which designates a location with 1 percent or greater chance of being inundated in any given year.

In Louisiana, a nation-leading 23 percent of properties are located in a FEMA flood zone. In Florida, it’s about 17 percent. Arkansas, New Mexico, and Nebraska are perhaps less expected members of the top 10, as is New Jersey, which, with New York City, saw torrential rain and flooding that killed two people earlier this month.

Texas ranks seventh in the country, with about 800,000 properties, or roughly 6.5 percent of the state’s total, sitting in a flood zone. Kerr County officials have limited authority to keep people from building in these areas, but even when governments have the ability to prevent risky building projects, they historically haven’t. Although one study found that some areas are finally beginning to curb floodplain development, people keep building in perilous places.

“There’s an innate draw to the water that we have, but we need to know where the limits are,” said Freudenberg. “In places that are really dangerous, we need to work toward getting people out of harm’s way.”

Kerr County sits in a region known as Flash Flood Alley, and at least four cabins at Camp Mystic sat in an extremely hazardous “floodway.” Numerous others stood in the path of a 100-year flood. When the Christian summer camp for girls underwent an expansion in 2019, the owners built even more cabins in the water’s path.

“It’s an unwillingness to think about what the future—and the present—have in store for us,” said Rob Moore, director of the Water and Climate Team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC, about Americans’ tradition of floodplain development. ”It’s a reluctance to own up to the reality we live in.”

Many people don’t even know they are in harm’s way. According to the NRDC, 14 states have no flood disclosure laws, and in eight they deem the laws “inadequate.” FEMA maps are also flawed. For one, they can be politically influenced, with homeowners and communities often lobbying to be excluded in order to avoid insurance mandates and potential building costs. And experts say the science underpinning the maps is lagging too.

FEMA “only maps main river channels and coastal storm surge areas,” explained Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications research at First Street Foundation. The agency, he added, specifically doesn’t model heavy rainfall, isn’t great about indicating the risk of urban flooding, and is behind on accounting for climate change.

First Street built a flood model that tries to fill in those gaps. It found that 17.7 million people are at risk of a 100-year flood, a number that’s more than double what FEMA’s hazard area covers.The state rankings also change, with mountainous areas susceptible to inland flash flooding jumping up the list. West Virginia moves into first, with a staggering 30 percent of properties built in flood-prone areas. Kentucky climbs from 19th to sixth.

Texas remains at seventh, but the portion of properties at risk goes to 15 percent. In Kerr County, FEMA’s maps showed 2,560 properties (6.5 percent) in a flood zone. First Street’s model nearly doubled that.

“There’s a ton of unknown risk across the country,” said Porter, who says better maps are among the most important goals that policymakers can and should work toward. First Street has partnered with the real estate website Redfin to include climate risk metrics in its listings.

Rob Moore says political will is essential to making that type of systemic change when it comes to not only flooding, but other climate risks, such as wildfires or coastal erosion. Strengthening building codes and restricting development in high-risk areas will require similar fortitude.

“Governments and states don’t want to tell developers to not put things in a wetland, not put things in a floodplain,” he said. “We should be telling people don’t put them in a flatland, don’t build in a way that your home is going to be more susceptible to wildfire.”

Until then, hundreds of communities across the country could—and likely will—be the next Kerr County.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6883d21df4bf4fa0a2819967/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Kerr-County-Tragic-Flood-Science-2224716293.jpg",N,,2025-07-26 08:00:33.659775

Only one in five Scots believe the energy transition away from oil and gas will create jobs, a new poll has revealed.

The nationwide survey, conducted by YouGov for the GMB and Prospect trade unions, shows that Scots have more at stake in the drive to cut emissions than anywhere else in the UK, but share far less confidence it will deliver economic or climate benefits.

The UK and Scottish governments have insisted that a just transition will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean technologies for former oil and gas workers as the industry declines, but the poll of 2,100 people across the UK reveals most Scots are unconvinced.

The survey suggests that 17 per cent of Scots work in the energy sector or know someone who does - a far higher proportion than anywhere else in the UK. But less than half, 47 per cent, feel positive about the transition from oil and gas to renewable energy - lower than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - while 21 per cent feel negative, more than any of the other home nations.

Only 17 per cent of Scots think the transition will increase job opportunities, the lowest level of optimism across the country.

Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, said: “Experienced and skilled workers across oil and gas know better than anyone what the scale of this transition will demand and what is at stake.

“Promises of green jobs tomorrow mean nothing when real jobs are being lost today and, so far, this transition has been something done to our workers and their communities not with them.

“These workers understand change and know how to make it happen but their expert voice has been drowned out by the din of politicians and campaigners making a noise instead of a plan.

“The insight and expertise of workers must be front and centre in this transition and, if it is not, this transition will fail.”

Prospect general secretary, Mike Clancy, added: “The government have raised the ambition on energy policy, which is welcome.

“Now they need to be bigger and bolder when it comes to energy jobs and put energy workers at the heart of this agenda.”

The Scottish Government is also under increasing pressure to reverse its ban on new nuclear power as the construction of new small modular reactors in England is poised to create thousands of well-paid jobs and apprenticeships.

Scottish Labour net zero spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, said: “Scotland can be a global clean energy superpower, but both the Tories and the SNP have been squandering this opportunity.

“Under the SNP green jobs targets have been missed, supply chain jobs have been sent abroad, our seabeds have been sold off on the cheap, and just transition funding has been frittered away with little to show for it.”

Scottish Conservative energy and net zero spokesperson, Douglas Lumsden, said: “With the SNP repeatedly missing their own emissions targets, it’s little wonder public confidence is collapsing in their ability to deliver the renewable jobs they keep promising.

“Warm words on green jobs are cold comfort to the thousands of skilled oil and gas workers who have been chucked on the scrapheap by both Labour and the SNP.”

Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “We’re clear in our support for a just transition for Scotland’s valued oil and gas sector, which recognises the maturity of the North Sea basin and is in line with our climate change commitments.

“Communities, workers, and trade unions are at the heart of Scotland’s renewable energy transition, and we are committed to ensuring local voices are central to any decisions we take, this includes the voices of the workforce within our oil and gas industry.

My district is a hardworking and rapidly growing community of over 778,000 South Texans. It is home to SpaceX’s Starbase, two liquefied natural gas facilities, and the Port of Brownsville, the only deepwater port on the United States – Mexico Border, not to mention a multitude of land ports of entry that are economic drivers on not just the state scale, but on the international scale.

With all that we have to offer, our region finds it wholly unacceptable and disgusting that metropolitan areas such as Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth (Arlington), and Austin are afforded hearings for their populations, but the Rio Grande Valley, an entire region of the state, won’t have a physical hearing before our legislature decides to cheat the system and silence our voice. I am not asking for you to move heaven and earth, we are only asking for the Rio Grande Valley have the same opportunity as people in other parts of Texas – not have to travel hundreds of miles to do so.

Therefore, I urge the Texas House and/or Senate Select Committees on Congressional Redistricting to hold an official and in-person field hearing in the Rio Grande Valley that is accessible to all voters in our region. I remind the committees that the voters of Texas are watching closely, and they will remember this on election day. We will not be silenced.",https://gonzalez.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-26 09:00:52.433110

DTE Energy's recent lawsuit against St. Clair County, Michigan, over solar regulations offers a microcosm of the broader tensions between local control and state-level clean energy mandates.

DTE Energy's recent lawsuit against St. Clair County, Michigan, over solar regulations offers a microcosm of the broader tensions between local control and state-level clean energy mandates. For investors, this case underscores the critical interplay between legal uncertainty and the long-term viability of renewable infrastructure.

The Legal Battleground: Local Autonomy vs. State Mandates

At the heart of DTE's lawsuit is a clash over the interpretation of Public Act 233, a 2023 Michigan law designed to streamline large-scale solar development by preempting local zoning restrictions. St. Clair County's regulations—such as stricter noise limits (45 decibels vs. the state's 55 decibels) and requirements for visual obscurity—have been challenged as overreaching. DTE argues these rules effectively function as zoning laws, violating the intent of Public Act 233 to accelerate the state's transition to 80% clean energy by 2035 and 100% by 2040.

This dispute mirrors national trends. In New York and California, courts have increasingly affirmed state and local authority to enforce clean energy goals, even in the face of fossil fuel industry pushback. For example, New York's recent court victories for all-electric building laws highlight how judicial systems are becoming battlegrounds for the energy transition. Conversely, California's struggles with federal tax policy changes—such as shortened timelines for claiming solar incentives—show how external political shifts can disrupt state-level progress.

Implications for Utility Stocks and Renewable Infrastructure

The outcome of DTE's case could ripple across the sector. If the Michigan Supreme Court rules in favor of DTE, it may set a precedent limiting local governments' ability to impose restrictions on renewable projects, thereby accelerating solar deployment in the state. This would benefit utilities like DTE, which have invested heavily in solar and battery storage, but could also expose them to regulatory backlash from communities feeling disempowered.

Conversely, a win for St. Clair County might embolden other localities to adopt similar regulations, creating a patchwork of rules that complicate large-scale development. This scenario could slow the pace of renewable adoption, particularly in states where local governments hold significant sway. For investors, this duality highlights the need to assess not just technological or market risks but also regulatory volatility—a factor often overlooked in traditional ESG analyses.

National Trends and Investor Opportunities

The U.S. energy transition is increasingly defined by state-level innovation. In New York, streamlined permitting processes under the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act have cut project approval times from years to months. In contrast, California's permitting delays and federal policy uncertainties underscore the fragility of state-level gains in the face of national political shifts.

For investors, these dynamics present both risks and opportunities:

1. Regulatory Arbitrage: States with clear, supportive policies (e.g., New York, Colorado) offer safer bets for renewable infrastructure. Conversely, states with fragmented or contested regulations (e.g., Michigan, Texas) require deeper due diligence.

2. Legal Resilience: Utilities with strong legal teams and diversified portfolios—like NextEra Energy or Brookfield Renewable Partners—are better positioned to navigate regulatory uncertainty.

3. Policy Hedges: Investors might consider hedging against policy risks by allocating capital to companies with federal tax credit exposure (e.g., those benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act) or those operating in multiple jurisdictions.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Diversify Jurisdictional Exposure: Avoid overconcentration in states with high regulatory risk. Prioritize regions with stable, pro-renewable policies and active permitting pipelines.

Monitor Legal Landscapes: Track court decisions and legislative updates in key states. Tools like regulatory calendars or legal risk indices can help identify emerging threats.

Leverage Policy-Linked Instruments: Consider green bonds or project finance structures tied to state-specific incentives, which can offset regulatory volatility.

Engage with Policy Advocacy: Long-term investors may benefit from supporting industry coalitions that push for regulatory clarity, such as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

Environmental Justice, Reproductive Justice The environmental movement (often youth-led and women-led) is a feminist fight by its very nature.
“I believe in the alignment of reproductive justice, racial justice, health justice, and environmental justice.
I just think there’s this wonderful alignment that’s taking place,” Loretta Ross, reproductive justice pioneer and founding member of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, told FEMINIST.
The organization Green Amendments for the Generations (GAFTG) is working state-by-state alongside community partners to get new state-level Green Amendments passed.","Reproductive justice means fighting for a safe, healthy environment for all children. Environmentalists are among those leading this fight.

At least 137 people are dead after devastating flash-flooding in Texas in early July, including many children. As climate change induced disasters grow more common and the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections, several organizations are pursuing creative legal strategies to defend children’s fundamental right to a safe, healthy and stable natural environment.

Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, is currently suing the Trump administration to protect young people’s environmental rights. The firm has represented youth plaintiffs in climate litigation for over 10 years.

Green Amendments for the Generations, an independent 501(c)(3), is working to enshrine environmental rights explicitly in state constitutions across the country. The two organizations have a synergistic relationship, according to Green Amendments founder Maya van Rossum, J.D., and Our Children’s Trust litigator and co-director Mat dos Santos, J.D.

Environmental Justice, Reproductive Justice

The environmental movement (often youth-led and women-led) is a feminist fight by its very nature.

The three guiding principles of reproductive justice are the right to have a child, the right not to have a child and, importantly, the right to raise your children in a safe and healthy environment. Pollution and climate change, among other violations, are a clear threat to this third principle.

Almost 40 percent of older members of Gen Z doubt whether to have children because of the threat climate change poses, making the climate crisis a widespread reproductive justice issue.

The reproductive justice framework is a defining feature of contemporary feminist thought. It was coined by Black feminists to emphasize how every human rights issue impacts reproductive decision-making, especially for women of color and other vulnerable communities.

“I believe in the alignment of reproductive justice, racial justice, health justice, and environmental justice. I just think there’s this wonderful alignment that’s taking place,” Loretta Ross, reproductive justice pioneer and founding member of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, told FEMINIST.

As pollution and climate change disproportionately impact Black and brown communities, women, younger generations, low-income people and people in the Global South, environmentalism remains intertwined with the fight for economic and racial equality as well as gender and reproductive rights.

Youth v. Gov

On behalf of 22 young people, Our Children’s Trust filed Lighthiser v. Trump in May as part of its multi-case Youth v. Gov effort, asserting that three of the president’s pro-fossil fuel executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life, health and safety.

The organization is suing under the Fifth Amendment for the right to life. They are also making an Ultra Vires claim (they claim Trump is acting outside his executive authority), and under the State-Created Danger Doctrine, claiming government inflicted harm.

“Children right now are suffering from extreme heat, illness, asthma, the flooding that’s happening in Texas. People are literally dying, being deprived of that most basic right [to life] … It is unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and we want to stop it,” dos Santos told Ms.

Children right now are suffering from extreme heat, illness, asthma, the flooding that’s happening in Texas. People are literally dying, being deprived of that most basic right [to life] … It is unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and we want to stop it.

Mat dos Santos, J.D.

On July 16, hundreds gathered outside the U.S. Capitol to hear from Lighthiser plaintiffs and members of Congress at a press conference hosted by Our Children’s Trust and several organizational partners.

The same day, the Children’s Fundamental Rights to Life and a Stable Climate System resolution was introduced by Sen. Merkley (D-Oreg.) and Reps. Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Raskin (D-Md.). More than 50 additional senators and representatives joined the resolution as cosponsors.

“As I speak, my rights to life and liberty are being violated. As I speak, more and more greenhouse gases are getting trapped in our atmosphere. As I speak, my health and safety is put in further jeopardy.” said lead plaintiff Eva Lighthiser, 19, at the press event.

Plaintiff Lander Busse, 20, told Ms. that his family’s “culture and way of life” in Montana “has been degraded” by climate change.

“Whether it’s the streams that we fish in,” he continued, “or the game we hunt so that we can put food on the table for our families, all of that is in jeopardy because of the impacts of climate change and the prioritization of fossil fuels in this administration.”

“We’re more optimistic than ever for the success of our case,” added Busse. “I’m an undefeated climate litigant at this point, so we’re going for the federal and we’re hoping to keep that record.”

The Green Amendment Movement

Lighthiser and Busse were also plaintiffs in Held v. State of Montana, in which the Montana Supreme Court ruled that state law restricting consideration of climate change in environmental reviews violated youth plaintiffs’ right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit saw success largely because Montana has a Green Amendment.

Green Amendments are constitutional amendments in the Bill of Rights section of a constitution explicitly declaring the legal right to a safe, healthy and stable natural environment for all people. Such amendments are a powerful legal tool to advocate for climate action, environmental justice and multigenerational protection from dangerous ‘forever’ chemicals, pesticides and endocrine disruptors that impact reproductive health.

Thus far, only Montana, Pennsylvania and New York have Green Amendments. The organization Green Amendments for the Generations (GAFTG) is working state-by-state alongside community partners to get new state-level Green Amendments passed.

I want my children to have a happy, healthy future. The laws as written aren’t going to do that. They are going to sacrifice my children, and all children, to horribly degraded environments.

Maya van Rossum, J.D.

Led by Maya van Rossum and her daughter, Anneke Walsh van Rossum, J.D., GAFTG is creating new legal tools for environmental advocates. The organization has ongoing efforts in 32 states and federally.

Founded in 2014 after van Rossum’s victory suing Pennsylvania under the Commonwealth’s Green Amendment, GAFTG seeks to make environmental rights enforceable across the country.

“You have a right to free speech, but you don’t have a right to clean water and clean air,” van Rossum said, “You may have an inalienable human right, but it’s not enforceable under the law. Do you really have the right then?”

“Helping people understand that there is this fundamental failing in our system of environmental laws that needs to be addressed, and that the best way to address this is through constitutional reform, is part of the work [of Green Amendments for the Generations],” van Rossum added.

GAFTG-supported Green Amendment proposals even have provisions specifically protecting future generations. Van Rossum says this is intentional.

“Legally, that generational protection really raises the bar in terms of the quality of environmental protection that people can advocate for, and are entitled to,” van Rossum said. “Protecting the quality of water for the next week, month, year or even 10 years, opens the door to tremendous amounts of pollution, as compared to having a legal obligation to protect water over 50 years, 100 years, generationally.”

Van Rossum added that her push for multigenerational protection is also motivated by her identity as a mother.

“I have children, and I want my children to have a happy, healthy future. The laws as written aren’t going to do that. They are going to sacrifice my children, and all children, to horribly degraded environments,” van Rossum said. “We have a responsibility to make sure we are doing all we can to ensure the safety and security of future generations.”

We, feminists, often discuss the essential right to contraception and abortion. Intersectional feminists, particularly women of color and disabled women, have encouraged our movement to resist forced sterilization, eugenics and other forms of reproductive oppression, and to incorporate all human rights into the feminist movement.

The first and second components of reproductive justice—the right to have children and the right not to—are, of course, essential. Even so, those components are only part of a whole.",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 08:00:18.461418

The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs.
A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws.","On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD). The stated goal of the plan is to reduce budget expenditures, improve “science,” and have EPA’s research activities better support the work of the media offices, including the Office of Water (OW), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), and Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). The EPA press release refers to the effort as a continuation of “comprehensive restructuring” that includes a reduction in force (RIF) for the ORD and a subsequent savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. The release also announced the creation of a new EPA office, the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), with a mission to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” but provided no further information on the new office.

To Administration supporters, this is the latest chapter in the long overdue reorganization of federal programs to help reduce costs and trim back the “administrative state.” To detractors, it is yet another broad attack on regulatory programs in general, especially those at EPA, and specifically targets the scientific work of EPA and its research office. ORD personnel reorganization was among the many ORD-specific recommendations outlined in the Project 2025 document. Critics of the Administration’s efforts to cut EPA’s budget and staffing see the reorganization of ORD and its associated staff cuts as part of the larger attempt to reduce protections of the environment and health at EPA and other government agencies — as part of the agenda to “gut” EPA programs generally, even if some program offices (including OCSPP) gain positions.

ORD’s work, especially its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), has been controversial for many years and the subject of intense industry and trade group criticism. Established in 1985 and revised periodically, the IRIS Program is an attempt at a uniform, agency-wide database of human health assessments for chemicals found in the environment that serves as the basis for regulatory actions across EPA. The goal is that each EPA program be consistent in its assessments and able to act according to the specific legislative requirements driving the work of the respective EPA offices. The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process. At its best, the IRIS Program is hailed by supporters as being an essential part of bridge-building between different forms of environmental science and the various offices of EPA.

IRIS critics, however, have claimed for years that the program is overly conservative in its assessment assumptions, biased in its selection of information evaluated, and secretive in avoiding public scrutiny of its underlying work and assumptions. A January 27, 2025, letter organized by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and signed by over 80 organizations affected by the work of the IRIS Program asserts:

IRIS has often fallen short of scientific standards required of EPA and is out of step with global health agencies and regulators. IRIS fails to adequately incorporate high quality and relevant science and does not consistently utilize a “weight of the scientific evidence” approach. Also, the process IRIS uses to prioritize and select chemicals for assessment lacks transparency.

For years, ORD has been subject to legislation introduced in Congress in response to the assertion of critics, most recently the “No IRIS” Act introduced in the House and Senate in February 2025 (H.R. 1415 and S. 623, respectively). The IRIS Program has been reviewed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) at various times over the years and found to indeed have program deficiencies (e.g., timeliness, lack of guidance) cited by critics as evidence of its ineffectiveness. EPA has implemented actions to satisfy the recommendations made by GAO, but some stakeholders remain very critical.

Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations. In February 2025, partly in response to this sustained assault, EPA employees and supporters created Stand Up for Science. This grassroots movement turned non-profit organization has hosted rallies, created policy goals, and garnered media attention. Of note, the Stand Up for Science website hosts the public Declaration of Dissent, signed by EPA staff and members of the public, and invites visitors to add their name to the Declaration. The Declaration itself is addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and highlights five main concerns. Concern number four is “Dismantling the Office of Research and Development.” The Declaration states that the proposed ORD reorganization will make “EPA science more vulnerable to political interference,” and cites the proposed budget cuts for 2026 as leaving “ORD unable to meet the science needs of the EPA and its partners” and in a place that “will threaten the health of all Americans.”

What any reorganization of ORD or reform of science activities and policies will have to confront is the requirement for a scientific basis at the heart of any regulatory decision. Regardless of presidential priorities or allocated budgets, much of EPA’s work will remain dependent on the underlying science supporting whatever regulatory conclusions are proposed. Those programmatic conclusions will then be subject to public review and comment as part of the fundamental regulatory development process. In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain. The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs. A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws. That centralized science function was developed over time to reduce, and ideally eliminate, inconsistent science and avoid overlapping, unsupported, or inadequate requirements.

After the reorganization and budget allocations are settled, it is not clear what procedures or administrators will fill those needed functions of integration, coordination, and consistency. Debates, especially high-profile controversies, are often more about the derivative outcomes of an assessment masking as debates than about the underlying data and evaluation procedures. Reorganizing the pieces on the chess board will not resolve or avoid such debates in the future.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/epa03.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:04:01.223977

States like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island rely heavily on offshore wind to meet their emission targets.
He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as visually unappealing, environmentally harmful, and economically inefficient.
Scientists and marine experts overwhelmingly agree that offshore wind is not a threat to ocean life.
So, I urge the board to move forward with the SouthCoast Wind Project.”","“I’m a resident of Portsmouth. Not only am I a resident of Portsmouth, with a view of the Sakonnet River. I’m blessed where I live. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the Northeast. I’ve traveled throughout the world. I spent considerable time at McCorrie Point with my family, friends, and others. I even spend evenings there.

“I have a question for the siting board. Have you visited any sites along the Sakkonet in Portsmouth? You don’t have to answer, but I will make a suggestion. Please go to McCorrie Point so that you understand what you’re about to approve. I don’t have an opinion, but I can tell you that it doesn’t make sense. You are not crossing a river just to cross it. You’re traversing that river from its mouth to Brayton Point, the entire river, a class A, class one waterway, the only one in Rhode Island, and one of the few. It is imperative that we get this correct.

“What’s going to happen is - I’m not a scientist, I’m a statistical analyst by trade. I’ve done data science and analytics, so I look at numbers. I’m going to ask the siting board to consider this: Would you ever approve a project that you knew was destined for failure and would never be used? You don’t have to answer that, but ask yourself while sitting at McCorrie Point, and then let’s talk about where we are today.

“Why is offshore wind no longer favored under the current administration? They were voted in, whether you like it or not. I’m going to go through a couple of bullet points:

“One. Executive Order halts offshore wind expansion. In January of 2025, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order that withdrew the entire outer continental shelf from the future of offshore wind leasing. Not only did he do that, he paused all new and renewable lease permits and rights of way for wind energy on federal lands and waters. Next, he’s also initiated a review of the existing leases with potential cancellation/modifications.

“Two. New federal oversight delays projects. All wind and solar projects on federal lands and waters must now receive personal approval from the Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum. This change adds significant regulatory delays and uncertainty to project timelines. I’m just telling you what the lay of the land is, compared to when we first started these conversations. High costs from tariffs and subsidy rollbacks - tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and turbine components have increased project costs. That’s going to turn into increased electric rates.

“I’m no fool. New tax legislation, signed by the President, is rolling back clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, making it financially harder for offshore wind developers.

“Now let’s talk about what has been done to the industry: industry pullbacks and writedowns. Ecuador recorded a $955 million write-down on its U.S. offshore wind portfolio. Citing administration policy changes, they’re divesting. Shell withdrew from the Atlantic Shores project off New Jersey, and this one. Projects like SouthCoast Wind have been delayed by years, losing hundreds of millions of expected value. SouthCoast wind knows it’s in trouble. They already said they are likely going to delay by four years.

“I only have a few more points—impact on the state climate goals. States like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island rely heavily on offshore wind to meet their emission targets. The targets were made under a different administration. I don’t know if the targets are right or wrong. What if we’re wrong? We’re going to ruin a river. That’s going to delay timelines, create potential energy supply gaps, and pose challenges to meet the climate mandates.

“We’ve heard that from our president’s mouth. He favors fossil fuels and nuclear over renewables. He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as visually unappealing, environmentally harmful, and economically inefficient.

“This administration’s philosophical stance will make it very difficult for wind projects. So again, I’m going to ask the siting board: Would you approve a project before you know whether the energy source in that ocean will come to fruition for 20 years? I ask you. The most important thing you can do is take your beach chair down there to McCorrie Point, take a nice visit, and understand the threat of putting that power line up that river for a project that’s deeply in trouble.”

“I’m a resident and property owner, if that matters, of Rhode Island. I’m here to voice my strong support for the SouthCoast Wind Project. Rhode Island and the broader New England region are facing a real challenge. Electricity demand is rising, yet our grid is aging, and we remain too dependent on expensive, polluting, fossil fuels, especially peaker plants that are extremely expensive to run and very harmful to public health. There’s no question we need new, reliable sources of power that can be built now and serve well into the future.

“SouthCoast Wind offers a practical and much-needed solution. It will deliver 1200 megawatts of emission-free, reliable electricity to the New England grid, enough to power 800,000 homes, including 125,000 Rhode Island homes.

“That’s more than a quarter of the homes in the entire state. That’s not just impressive, it’s essential. We won’t have enough capacity to meet our energy needs without projects like this. From an affordability standpoint, this project makes sense. Offshore wind offers long-term fixed price contracts. That means Rhode Islanders are better shielded from market shocks and price volatility. We’ve already seen how global instability can cause our energy bills to skyrocket. If we rely only on solutions like natural gas, we are at risk of fluctuating, unpredictable energy costs. SouthCoast wind will help insulate us from that. It replaces costly fossil fuel generation with stable American-made energy, ultimately saving Rhode Islanders money.

“The project also adheres to strict regulatory standards and has been subject to extensive, rigorous environmental permitting reviews. The underground and undersea cables will be installed using horizontal directional drilling, a proven method that avoids disruption to our beaches and coastal ecosystems. This is safe and well-established infrastructure, far less invasive than pipelines or new fossil fuel facilities.

“I also want to address that there has been a lot of misinformation about environmental risks that are rooted in myths and propaganda funded by outside groups aligned with the fossil fuel industry. Scientists and marine experts overwhelmingly agree that offshore wind is not a threat to ocean life. These projects have been built and operated successfully, in some cases for decades, in other areas of the world, like Europe and Asia. The biggest environmental risk we face is doing nothing, continuing to burn fossil fuels, and delaying the better solutions we desperately need.

“Let’s also not forget about the economic opportunity. As you’ve heard, this project supports local jobs, builds Rhode Island’s workforce, and creates a strong supply chain of jobs and businesses in our coastal communities. This is not going to harm our fishing industry. It’s going to enhance and strengthen our coastal economies. It’s an investment not just in energy infrastructure, but in the future of our coastal communities. No other energy resource is going to bring this level of economic development to our region.

“We know more power generation is needed. The question is how we build it. As a relatively young person who wants to raise a family here in Rhode Island, I want to see Rhode Island empower and embrace innovation, low-cost energy, and real solutions to air quality and public health. We have the opportunity to move forward on a solution that will, without any doubt, offer cleaner air, more cost stability, enhance our energy security, and create economic growth for our coastal communities.

“There’s no backup plan or project that comes close to offering the solutions our region desperately needs. There’s no nuclear project, no other project that offers this kind of economic investment and other benefits for the region. So, I urge the board to move forward with the SouthCoast Wind Project.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8OJ!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F947a5048-fbaf-40d1-9844-858805075e1a_2000x1125.jpeg",N,,2025-07-26 15:01:38.953274

For a primer on the important ""infill"" housing-related California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) reforms, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""California Legislature Enacts Major CEQA Reforms for Housing-Rich 'Infill' Projects,"" July 2, 2025. Additional alerts on other aspects of Assembly Bill (AB) 130 and Senate Bill (SB) 131 will be available on Holland & Knight's West Coast Land Use and Environment blog, Breaking Ground. A two-part webinar series is scheduled for Aug. 20 and Aug. 27, 2025, and will feature analysis of the new laws and a Q&A with Holland & Knight attorneys.

In addition to the important ""infill"" housing-related CEQA reforms explained in the aforementioned Holland & Knight alert, AB 130 and SB 131 contain a variety of CEQA reforms that are unrelated to housing. These new laws were signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom on June 30, 2025, and went into effect immediately. The purpose of this Holland & Knight alert is to focus on provisions of SB 131 that establish new statutory CEQA exemptions that apply to a variety of qualifying non-housing projects.

The statutory CEQA exemptions established by SB 131 are summarized as follows:

Advanced Manufacturing Projects. Pursuant to SB 131, CEQA no longer applies to a project that consists exclusively of ""advanced manufacturing"" that is proposed to be located on a site that was zoned exclusively for industrial uses but does not also qualify as ""natural and protected lands."" SB 131 generally defines the term ""natural and protected lands"" to include the following:

state and national park lands

protected marine areas

national recreation areas

national monuments

national wild and scenic rivers

ecological reserves and wildlife management areas

hazardous waste sites (absent applicable regulatory clearances)

regulatory floodways (absent applicable regulatory clearances)

lands subject to a conservation easement

wetlands and land within 300 feet of a wetland

environmentally sensitive areas within the coastal zone

lands protected as preserve areas or reserve lands pursuant to a habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan

lands within a very high fire hazard zone (absent adopted fire hazard mitigation measures)

prime farmland and farmland of statewide importance

land zoned or designated for agricultural preservation or protection by an approved local ballot measure

To define the term ""advanced manufacturing,"" SB 131 refers to a definition of the same term set forth in Public Resources Code Section 26003 that defines ""advanced manufacturing"" broadly to include, among other things, microelectronics and nanotechnologies, semiconductors, advanced materials, integrated computational materials engineering, additive manufacturing, industrial biotechnology, improvements in manufacturing processes that are often referred to as ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" manufacturing systems and which integrate computation predictability and operational efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing systems that are not required to be implemented pursuant to state or federal laws and regulations.

By its terms, however, the current version of Public Code Section 26003 will expire on Jan. 1, 2026, when it will be replaced by a different version that does not define the term ""advanced manufacturing."" A legislative fix will therefore be necessary to ensure definitional clarity beyond Jan. 1, 2026.

Daycare Centers. SB 131 exempts daycare centers from CEQA review, provided that the daycare center would not be located in a residential area or on a site that qualifies as ""natural and protected lands."" The term ""daycare center"" is defined broadly to include licensed childcare centers, child daycare facilities other than a family daycare home, infant centers, preschools, extended daycare facilities and school-age childcare centers.

Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics. SB 131 also provides a CEQA exemption for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, provided such facilities do not exceed 50,000 square feet in total space or would be located on ""natural and protected lands."" In summary, SB 131 defines the term ""rural health clinic"" to mean a facility that would primarily furnish outpatient health outside of ""urban areas,"" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, where there are insufficient numbers of needed healthcare practitioners. This exemption also covers ""federally qualified health centers,"" a term generally defined to mean ""rural health clinics"" that receive federal grant funding.

Nonprofit Food Banks. SB 131 provides a CEQA exemption for nonprofit food banks and food pantries that solicit, store and ""distribute sufficient food to their defined service area,"" provided the facility would be located on a site that is zoned exclusively for industrial use but does not qualify as ""natural and protected lands."" However, SB 131 does not define the phrase ""distributes sufficient food to their defined service area."" Thus, to reduce the likelihood of legal challenge, lead agencies that rely on this CEQA exemption should be careful to include substantial evidence in the administrative record of the anticipated food demand within the food bank's service area and of the food bank's ability to satisfy such demand.

Parks and Nonmotorized Trails. Under SB 131, any activity or approval necessary for or incidental to planning, design, site acquisition, construction, operation or maintenance of public parks or nonmotorized recreational trail facilities are exempt from CEQA, but only if such facilities are funded in whole or in part by bond funds allocated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024, which was approved by California voters in the November 2024 election (Proposition 4).

State Climate Adaptation Strategy Updates. Existing law requires the California Natural Resources Agency to update every three years the state's climate adaptation strategy to identify the state's vulnerability to climate change and priority actions needed to reduce climate-related risk and achieve climate resilience. SB 131 completely exempts future climate adaptation strategy updates from CEQA review.

Housing Element Rezonings. Existing law requires cities and counties every eight years to approve Housing Elements that are capable of accommodating their respective share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA),then rezone land within their jurisdictions as necessary to accommodate RHNA units. Housing Element rezoning pursuant to Government Code Section 65583(c) is now exempt from CEQA, provided the rezoning would not permit construction of a distribution center or oil and gas infrastructure or would otherwise permit development within ""natural and protected lands."" When combined with AB 130's new infill housing CEQA exemption, it is possible that some infill housing projects would entirely avoid CEQA review at both the long-term planning and project levels.

Agricultural Employee Housing. Though SB 131 predominately addresses non-housing projects, this CEQA exemption builds off another CEQA exemption for agricultural employee housing found in Public Resources Code Section 21159.22 but adds further restrictions mandating that in order to use the SB 131 agricultural employee housing CEQA exemption, an agricultural employee housing project must be any of the following:

funded by the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program

funded by the Office of Migrant Services within the Department of Housing and Community Development

funded by a local government, or

owned or operated and funded by a public or nonprofit entity, or that receives state, federal, or local public funding

Please note that this exemption does not apply to a project consisting exclusively of the repair or maintenance of an existing farmworker housing project.

Certain Water and Sewer Infrastructure Projects. SB 131 exempts from CEQA review various water and sewer projects that primarily benefit a small, disadvantaged community water system or a state small water system by improving water quality, water supply or water supply reliability, as well as encourages water conservation and provides drinking water service to existing residences within a disadvantaged community. There are various qualifying criteria, such as not affecting wetlands or an environmentally sensitive habitat area within the coastal zone, not having unusual circumstances that would cause a significant effect on the environment, not having a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historic resource and ensuring that construction impacts are fully mitigated. This exemption imposes a skilled workforce requirement or prevailing wages depending on various factors. SB 131 extended expiration of this CEQA exemption to Jan. 1, 2032.

Community Water Systems. A project that consists of a community water system funded by the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024 or the State Water Resources Control Board's Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience program that does not otherwise include any construction activities is now exempt from CEQA until Jan. 1, 2030, if the project results in long-term net benefits to climate resiliency, biodiversity, and sensitive species recovery or includes procedures, as well as and ongoing management for the protection of the environment. This exemption imposes a skilled workforce requirement or prevailing wages depending on various factors.

Wildfire Risk Reduction Projects. Given the prominence of wildfire risk in California, especially in light of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires, the legislature stepped in with a new CEQA exemption for wildfire risk reduction measures. As long as a wildfire risk reduction project is in compliance with all other applicable laws, ordinance and zoning requirements, all of the following wildfire risk reduction projects are now exempt from CEQA:

projects consisting of a prescribed fire or fuel reduction to reduce wildfire risk by reestablishing the fire return interval appropriate to the ecosystem for biodiversity or other benefits (but entirely excluding projects located on coastal sage scrub habitat or any other sensitive habitat), provided the project 1) does not exceed 50 contiguous acres, 2) is located within a half-mile of a subdivision of 30 or more dwelling units, 3) is subject to consultation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife, 4) avoids impacts to riparian areas and water quality, and 5) provides for the identification and protection of potentially impacted tribal cultural resources

projects consisting of ""defensible space"" fire clearance of up to 100 feet (as measured from the center line of the roadway) for a public roadway identified as an egress and evacuation route for a subdivision or community of 30 or more dwelling units to remove flammable vegetation or trees of less than 12 inches in diameter as measured at chest height

projects consisting of the establishment or enhancement of residential home hardening or the establishment of wildfire defensible space within 200 feet of a legal structure located in a high or very high wildfire hazard zone

projects consisting of the establishment of a fuel break extending up to 200 feet from structures, including the clearance of flammable vegetation and trees less than 12 inches in diameter as measured at chest height

Linear Broadband Projects. SB 131 amends Public Resources Code Section 21080.51 to clarify the CEQA exemption for above-ground or subsurface linear broadband projects within, or within 30 feet of, a right-of-way, including but limited to a local street or road right of way. To qualify for this updated exemption, above-ground projects must install improvements aerially along an existing utility pole right of way, and subsurface projects must restore the surface to preexisting conditions. Moreover, qualifying broadband projects must 1) include monitors during construction activities to avoid or address impacts to cultural and biological resources, 2) comply with mitigation requirements lawfully imposed through the local agency permit process and 3) comply with applicable laws related to wetlands preservation, endangered species, and other applicable state and federal laws.

Conclusion

Newly enacted SB 131 decrees several statutory exemptions from CEQA that will facilitate the development of a variety of socially and environmentally beneficial projects that have often been stymied in the past by CEQA lawsuits. This Holland & Knight alert, however, summarizes only the new exemptions, and the application of each is highly dependent on the specific facts associated with each individual development project.

The coalition, officially named the Minerals for National Automotive Competitiveness Collaboration (MINAC), has its sights set firmly on securing a domestic source of battery materials—key to the heart of the American automotive revival.

Announced on Wednesday, the partnership features the likes of Alaska Energy Metals and Canadian ventures Graphite One, Electric Metals, and RecycLiCo. According to a report by ABC15, Marc Winterhoff, Lucid’s interim CEO, said, ""Domestic supply chains strengthen manufacturing resilience, fortify sustainable supply chains, and accelerate job growth."" These are not just ambitions on a corporate whiteboard; the ensemble’s vision includes setting up streamlined mineral production and sees cooperation for commercialization and consumer adoption as prerequisites for the future of U.S. manufacturing.

ABC15's coverage pointed out that the partners convened in Washington, D.C., on July 23, a gesture underscoring the strategic significance of the collaboration. The roundtable flaunted prominent Arizonian political faces, including Governor Katie Hobbs and representatives across the political spectrum, from Sen. Dan Sullivan to Rep. Andy Biggs.

Onboard this ambitious collaboration are companies carving niches in the critical mineral market: Alaska Energy Metals helms a nickel project in Alaska while Electric Metals USA Limited develops Minnesota's high-grade manganese deposit. Graphite One brings graphite production facilities to the table, expecting operation by 2028. Lastly, RecycLiCo is set on refining mined ore and upcycling lithium-ion battery materials through cutting-edge technology.

US President Donald Trump’s negative impact on clean energy has been intense this year, but this week he took it to a new level.

His administration on Wednesday canceled $4.9 billion in federal financing for the Grain Belt Express, a transmission project that’s faced backlash from Republicans over ties to wind energy.

The same day, NextEra Energy Inc., one of the world’s biggest suppliers of wind and solar power, saw its shares tumble 7% as analysts worried Trump’s elimination of clean-energy tax credits would hurt the company.

And Tesla Inc., once the apple of Trump’s eye, warned of difficult times ahead after losing electric-vehicle incentives.

Go back a bit further for another prime example. The administration halted construction of a $5 billion wind farm off New York’s coast, then reversed the decision after reaching a deal with the governor that could allow new natural gas pipelines in the state.

Source: BloombergNEF, Grain Belt Express project website.

Note: Route is approximate and for illustrative purposes only.

That one really hurt: The farm’s developer, Equinor ASA, this week took a $955 million writedown on its offshore wind projects in the US and said it was unlikely to develop the second stage of Empire Wind.

Meanwhile, companies that profit off fossil fuels are doing great. Shares in the big independent power producers that own gas plants rose after an auction to ensure electricity supplies on the largest US power grid set record-high prices.

GE Vernova Inc., whose shares almost quadrupled on the strength of gas turbine sales, saw the stock climb further after saying its turbine backlog had grown by 10%.

There doesn’t seem to be a limit to how far Trump will carry his war on clean energy.

As analysts from ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a note about the cancellation of the Grain Belt Express financing: “Could the White House be expanding its ‘green new scam’ battlefield into transmission?”

The disastrous flooding in the Texas Hill Country is at the confluence of two crises: climate change and a torrent of U.S. debt. They are related, and the federal response is making both worse.

First, climate change: Current average global temperatures have exceeded 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. This is the low end of the threshold established in the Paris agreement to avoid tipping points on the planet. Warmer air holds more moisture, and heat and low humidity increase the risk of drought and wildfires. We are experiencing more frequent, severe and costly storms, droughts and fire events in the U.S. and across the globe; a new abnormal. The floods along the Guadalupe River and East Coast are the latest examples of extreme events.

Like the Texas flood waters, the costs of climate disasters are rapidly rising. In 2023 there were 28 separate weather and climate disasters with damages of $1 billion or more. The total cost of disaster in 2023 was $94.8 billion. The Asheville, North Carolina, floods in 2024 are estimated to have cost between $48 billion and $53 billion. The estimated cost of this year’s Los Angeles fires is between $135 billion and $150 billion. Guadalupe River flood damage is estimated between $18 billion and $22 billion.

The Trump administration has responded by waging a war on climate science. Virtually every climate science program in every agency has been eliminated or drastically cut including: NOAA, the National Weather Service, the EPA, NASA, Energy and FEMA. These are the programs that conduct climate research, provide early severe weather alerts, hurricane and fire warnings, and emergency management preparedness. They are also cutting funding to state and local governments for disaster relief while shifting more responsibilities to them. In addition, they have also cut tax credits for clean energy while increasing subsidies for fossil fuels. These policies are literally throwing gas on the fire and then cutting funds for the fire department. See “We can’t manage what we refuse to measure,” The Herald, June 7.

Second, debt, deficits and the budget: To be sure, current spending levels are unsustainable. The federal government has spent $1.34 trillion more than it has collected in fiscal year 2025. In 2024 the total was $1.83 trillion.

The national debt is the accumulation of all borrowing along with interest, currently in excess of $36 trillion. As reported by the The Economist: “Over the past 12 months America’s budget deficit has been an astonishing 6.7 percent of (gross domestic product) … and the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio will in about two years exceed the 106 percent reached after the second world war.”

Interest on that borrowing increases each year, thereby increasing the deficit and squeezing out spending for all other needs. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill will make matters worse. By all objective accounts, it will increase the national debt more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. That will create structural deficits constraining all other spending priorities such as defense; climate disasters such as floods, heat, and hurricanes; fiscal downturns and growth.

The BBB also abolishes billions for green energy, solar and wind, electric vehicles, heat pumps and other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. It is estimated that it will increase energy costs, and increase carbon emissions by roughly 10 percent by 2030.

The July 5 Economist magazine feature story was “Big beautiful … bonkers” in which it described the BBB as a “big beautiful fairy tale … a showcase for fiscal incontinence and ideological exhaustion.”

It is based on rosy forecasts, unrealistic growth projections and low-balling deficit impacts. “The White House has devised a fiscal fantasyland to dispense with such tiresome facts, in which the BBB initiates such breakneck growth that revenues soar and debt plummets,” it said.

The administration and Republican-majority Congress are exhibiting the same disregard for math as they do for climate science. The Economist continues: “The bloating of the deficit — at a time when interest rates and inflation risks are high — is being waved away by a Republican Party that preaches about fiscal discipline when out of power, and spends with reckless abandon when in it.” Nowhere is this more apparent than failing to respond to growing climate emergencies across the nation.

The U.S. deficit requires serious attention. So does climate change, including adaptation to increasingly severe weather events, improvements to infrastructure and responding to disasters.

We are ignoring the laws of science and math at our peril. Tightening our belt in the wrong places — around our neck instead of our waist — is dangerous and expensive for the economy and environment.

Paul Roberts is retired and lives in Everett. His career spans five decades in infrastructure, economics and environmental policy including former Chair of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency Board and advising Washington cities on climate change.

Eco-nomics

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions — carbon dioxide and methane chiefly — generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions — clear plans and actionable strategies — to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.",http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png,N,,2025-07-26 08:00:37.834353

LaCerte is the White House liaison and senior advisor to the director for U.S. Office of Personnel Management, where he helped shepherd candidates through the nomination process and advised on personnel policy for the agency that administers employment for the 2 million federal workers.

The five FERC commissioners serve five-year terms. LaCerte, who was nominated last week by President Donald Trump, would be replacing FERC Chair Willie L. Phillips, who was tapped by President Joe Biden and resigned before his term expired on June 30, 2026.

His nomination will be vetted, probably in the fall, by the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The panel has nine Democratic members and 11 Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge. If the committee recommends LaCerte, 45, the full Senate will have to vote on his confirmation.

LaCerte has very little experience in utility law and administration, wrote Dan Farber in Legal Planet, an environmental law policy collaboration of faculty at the University of California Berkeley School of Law and UCLA School of Law.

“For this administration if you’re looking for someone to reform something and cut red tape that is what David is known for,” said Mary-Patricia Wray, a Baton Rouge lobbyist who has worked with LaCerte as a legal and regulatory expert on behalf of her clients.

A former Marine who was involved in the Afghanistan conflict, LaCerte joined the state veterans’ department in 2010 and was appointed secretary by Gov. Bobby Jindal in June 2014, during a time when state government was cutting agency budgets. But even under budget pressure, LaCerte was able to build veterans cemeteries and increase benefits for disabled vets.

He resigned from the post in October 2015 amid an investigation into his office. In February 2016, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor and the State Inspector General's Office released a scathing joint report accusing the department of misspending thousands of dollars and failing to report crimes against veterans.

LaCerte called the report “garbage” and filed a defamation lawsuit against Auditor Daryl Purpera and Inspector General Stephen Street.

The lawsuit was tossed out in May 2025 by Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal on a summary judgment basically finding that while the allegations were not proven to have been his fault, LaCerte was a public figure at the time as were the Legislative Auditor and the Inspector General and therefore immune from defamation claims.

After his state employment, LaCerte practiced employment law with the New Orleans firm of Sternberg, Naccari & White before joining the Office of Personal Management during the first Trump administration.

He worked at the Office of Personnel Management during the first Trump administration. The office is the chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the federal government.

LaCerte was acting managing director at the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.

He joined the Houston-based Baker & Botts law firm in 2023 providing regulatory advice to large corporations.

LaCerte contributed to Project 2025, the 920-page conservative manifesto to change how the federal government operates. His role was to advise the project’s authors on the mechanics of combining agencies and shrinking the size of government.

Climate change—to which Bolivia has contributed very little—has also played a role in drying out forests.
Numerous scientific studies have established a link between climate change and worsening drought conditions, as well as rising temperatures, which contribute to longer and more intense fire seasons.
Those strategies for growth are “increasingly incompatible with a safe and sustainable future under climate change,” Palummo told Inside Climate News in an email.
They find themselves torn between the need to grow economically and the escalating impacts of climate change that are not of their own making.","Last year, record wildfires fueled by dry conditions incinerated large swaths of Bolivia’s forests, wetlands and other ecosystems, burning an area larger than the state of Indiana.

The blazes decimated ecosystems, affecting thousands of families, many of whom are Indigenous and reliant on forests and waterways for their livelihoods, food, water, culture and medicine.

A new report by Javier Palummo, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights’ special rapporteur on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, documents the extensive human rights toll of the fires. The sweeping and highly critical review also identifies how the Bolivian government contributed to the dry conditions that created the circumstances for the fires to rage longer and faster than before.

According to the analysis, tensions between the national and local governments hindered emergency responses while policies aimed at aggressively expanding industrial agriculture have dried out large areas of the country, leaving ecosystems vulnerable to fire.

Those policies included laws that legalized past illegal land clearings, authorized the use of fire in agricultural activities and opened Indigenous territories to intensive agriculture and livestock operations.

“The expansion of agribusiness in Bolivia is closely linked to the increase in forest fires and deforestation,” the report said.

Neither Bolivia’s Ministry of Environment and Water nor the country’s consulate in New York responded to requests for comment. But the national government has long championed poor countries’ right to develop while calling on rich countries—the largest contributors to climate change—to provide financial support for developing countries’ conservation efforts.

The report follows Palummo’s December visit to Bolivia, where he toured impacted areas and met with government officials, communities and civil society groups.

Citing research from Global Forest Watch, Oxfam and academics, the report said agricultural and livestock expansion were responsible for nearly all of Bolivia’s deforestation in recent years. Soybean production and cattle ranching have boomed over a 23-year period ending in 2019, with about 7 million hectares of forest converted to single-crop plantations during that time. Much of that activity happened in Santa Cruz province, the epicenter of last year’s fires.

Deforestation is linked to more frequent and intense fires because tree loss disrupts the forests’ natural cooling and water cycling process. Trees draw water through their roots and release moisture from their leaves. Clearing land throws this cycle out of balance, resulting in drier, more drought-prone conditions.

According to the report, Bolivia’s fires reached an unprecedented scale last year, with hot spots emerging earlier than usual and fires spreading more rapidly than ever before. In all, 10 million hectares burned with dangerous smoke reaching as far south as Buenos Aires in Argentina.

Climate change—to which Bolivia has contributed very little—has also played a role in drying out forests. Numerous scientific studies have established a link between climate change and worsening drought conditions, as well as rising temperatures, which contribute to longer and more intense fire seasons.

Rich nations like the United States and countries in Europe are some of the biggest historical emitters of the greenhouse gases warming the planet. Those countries also previously decimated much of their forests and other ecosystems to generate wealth. The United States, for example, has lost 90 percent of its original forests since the 17th century, replacing much of that land with single-crop plantations and urban development.

Those strategies for growth are “increasingly incompatible with a safe and sustainable future under climate change,” Palummo told Inside Climate News in an email.

“This is a classic climate injustice,” he said, with nations that have contributed relatively little to global warming facing some of the worst climate disasters. They find themselves torn between the need to grow economically and the escalating impacts of climate change that are not of their own making.

“The situation underscores how countries like Bolivia are essentially caught in a trap: the traditional extractive path to development is now directly imperiling their people due to the climate crisis,” Palummo said.

He pointed to other structural factors that he said are worsening the problem, including foreign investment protections that complicate efforts to fight climate change and long-term under-investment in rural and Indigenous territories that hinder governments’ ability to respond to disasters.

In Bolivia, Indigenous communities that have largely opposed the degradation of the forest were the most severely affected by last year’s fires, according to the report.

“Because of fires and the climate crisis, indigenous peoples have suffered losses that are difficult to calculate,” the report said, emphasizing the link between the peoples and their territories. “The loss of land and natural resources not only compromises their subsistence economy, but also represents a direct threat to their survival.”

The report noted “enormous concern” about the uncontacted Ayoreo Indigenous peoples who reside in a region affected by the fires.

Last year, Inside Climate News reported from the Bolivian Amazon on one Indigenous community’s fight against the fires, and the industrial agricultural plantations that have infringed on its territory.

Palummo in his email said Indigenous and rural communities face a double vulnerability: They are disproportionately impacted by climate change and also largely excluded from the benefits of industrial extractivism.

“In our region the extractive model tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few,” he said, referring to Latin American countries. “The revenues it generates rarely translate into structural improvements for the broader population, especially not for those living in the territories directly affected by extractive activities.”

Yet those communities hold critical knowledge of ecosystems and sustainable development possibilities, Palummo said. “These perspectives are not only culturally relevant, but have proven effective in sustaining ecosystems over generations.”

Among the report’s other findings:

More than 145,000 children and teenagers were affected by forced displacement, school closures, families’ lost livelihoods and exposure to smoke. Their ailments included respiratory problems, inflamed eyes, dehydration and diarrheal diseases. Thousands more adults were treated for similar health problems linked to the effects of the fires.

Fires destroyed staple crops, while cows, pigs and other animals raised for food were burned alive or starved because pastures were destroyed.

Fire-ravaged areas paralyzed subsistence hunting and fishing, with animals either fleeing or dying. Food cultivation is expected to face long-term challenges due to fire damage. Thousands of families required food assistance and other aid.

Rivers polluted by the widespread use of agrochemicals and illegal goldmining were further contaminated by the fires’ ash and debris while scorched earth impeded the soil’s ability to absorb rainfall and replenish groundwater.

The report also noted that dozens of endangered and endemic species—including blue-bearded parrots, tapirs and giant armadillos—along with other wildlife lost habitats or died in the flames and smoke. Incinerated grasslands and old-growth forests released climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Bolivia’s responses to fires included issuing disaster declarations, deploying fire brigades and the military more than 800 times and distributing humanitarian aid and medical care.

“These reactive approaches, based primarily on emergency interventions, tend to overlook the structural causes driving the recurrence of wildfires, such as land-use change and unsustainable agrarian dynamics,” the report said.

The report called on Bolivia to adopt a national fire management plan that includes ecosystem-based knowledge, is aimed at preventing fires from starting in the first place and incorporates the participation of Indigenous and rural communities.

The report also recommended that Bolivia repeal laws and policies that incentivize land-use change and deforestation, and that the government commit to performing environmental and social-impact assessments for all activities impacting people and ecosystems.

In his emailed statement, Palummo notes that the report makes the case for rich countries to meet their commitments to international climate financial funds. Countries like Bolivia need more resources to move from extractive development models while navigating growing climate risks, he said.

Bolivia’s fires were among many disasters in 2024, Earth’s hottest year on record. Palummo emphasized that the report offers lessons for nations around the world.

“This is not just an environmental issue, but a human rights issue,” Palummo said in his email. “The right to a healthy environment, to health, to water, and even to life and livelihood are at stake when climate-fueled disasters strike. It’s a warning that resonates far beyond Bolivia’s borders.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2173500102-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 05:59:02.796616

The future of mobility is electric, and it should have been here by now, considering that Morris & Salom’s Electrobat cars were running on Philadelphia’s streets in 1894. In 1909, an electric car beat a gasoline car in Boston’s busy traffic by 15 minutes. But electric cars are still at the 25% sales mark globally, and like most averages that figure is misleading.

When 70% of all electric cars are made in China, and 65% are sold there, the picture looks distinctly ICE-y – short for internal combustion engine – for the rest of the world. Then consider market leader Tesla’s woes. Its quarterly revenue has slumped. Half-yearly sales in Europe are down 33%. But more worrying for it is the drying carbon credits market under Trump. So far, Tesla’s made billions selling these credits to makers of ICE cars. It earned $2.1bn from them in just the first nine months of 2024. Tesla also has to worry about the phase-out of the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers in Sept.

Carbon and tax credits are nothing but subsidies for the EV business in US and Europe, and the Chinese EV miracle was also built on subsidies. By some accounts, China spent $231bn over a decade to prop up the industry, which now has spare capacity of 3mn cars, leading to cut-throat competition at home and dumping outside. That raises an important question. If EVs have truly come of age, why do they need state support? In 1900, US had only 8,000 cars. By 1915, there were over 2mn. Henry Ford’s Model T – launched for $850 in 1908 and priced at just $300 in 1917, thanks to economies of scale – brought the horseless revolution without any state help.

Regardless of who is in the White House, our access to important minerals like copper, a critical resource for clean energy development, depends on a delicately balanced supply chain that can be disrupted by an array of geopolitical or economic considerations. However, this announcement put a bright spotlight on the need for onshoring critical mineral production across America to help meet the rapidly growing energy demand.

For some, critical mineral development is wrought with hand-wringing and reflexive opposition by those who ignore the strength of our nation’s environmental protections and stringent regulations. What needs to be considered in greater detail, however, are the economic and energy security implications of turning a blind eye to fully bringing this production online in the U.S.

Take for instance, the fact that the demand for copper is expected to double by the year 2030. Or the fact that copper plays a vital role in the nearly six million line-miles of our electric grid, as well as manufacturing for a number of energy components. As we figure out ways to double power generation in the U.S., we’ll inevitably need more power lines, and obviously more copper. However, supply will fall 30% short of the amount required by 2035, according to the International Energy Agency.

Thankfully, one of the first actions President Trump took in his second term in office was to issue an Executive Order taking immediate actions to boost American mineral production.

While the majority of copper supplies come from Chile, Canada and Mexico - China leads the world in copper refining, with over half the world's smelting capacity. The good news - we can and should source more domestically. Americans can look to places like the Santa Cruz mine in Arizona or the Twin Metals project in Minnesota which are modern, innovative and domestic projects with strong environmental records.

Further, projects like these will support economic development across rural communities. Northeast Minnesota, where multiple companies are proposing to develop mining projects, is home to the world’s largest known undeveloped source of copper, nickel, cobalt, platinum group metals and more. The Duluth Complex mineral deposit in this area contains an estimated four billion tons of resources, estimated to be worth more than $1 trillion. New copper-nickel mining projects proposed in this area will create hundreds of millions in revenue through state and federal taxes and royalties and will generate several thousand high-paying jobs. The average salary for these mining jobs is more than $100,000 per year, and each one will generate another 1.5 spinoff jobs in related industries. However, these proposed projects have faced setbacks due to the lengthy, duplicative, and expensive permitting process and unending litigation by opposition groups.

Never has the phrase “time is money” been more appropriate. Regulatory delays greatly increase project costs. Overall, a typical mining project loses more than one-third of its value, as a result of bureaucratic delays in receiving the numerous permits needed to begin production. Meaningful permitting reform to get projects moving should involve leveraging innovative American technology, increasing transparency for permitting data, establishing clear timelines for projects, deploying AI to automate and streamline reviews, and implementing a compliance-based permit-by-rule permitting process.

Given that demand for copper and energy worldwide is expected to soar and that the U.S. is in dire need of boosting our economic and national security, the options are clear: Will the U.S. unleash the American miner and allow them to develop energy and critical mineral resources on our own soil, or will we continue down the same old dangerous path and continue to depend on foreign adversaries?

Already, the United States is home to some of the most rigorous environmental standards in the world. We know how to develop our nation’s rich resources safely and responsibly. It’s clear the Trump Administration understands what it will take to enable these high-tech, innovative energy and critical mineral projects to move forward, and Congress can work to cement good policy into law.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/data-center-e1753438072135.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-26 08:00:46.629858

The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.
In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas.
The rural charging catch-22 Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure.
Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.","Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to slow federal funding for building electric vehicle chargers across the country, the number of ports is growing, although rural areas are seeing less investment, per data from the EV charging data analytics firm Paren shared with The Daily Yonder.

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have “make-ready” incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that’s needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual report released in May. The report projects that the number of EVs on the road is expected to continue growing in the U.S. in 2025 and beyond, despite current political and trade headwinds imposed by the Trump administration.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/d1/ed1b91e7-02a9-54dd-934a-9fd3fb69ec81/6883e679691ce.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-26 05:59:07.162086

In 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency ordered factories that use a chemical called Ethelyn Oxide to sterilize medical equipment to install proven air pollution control controls by 2026.

“Everyone here is at risk,” said John Hitchins.

He and his neighbor fought for the new EPA regulation after learning the effects of the chemical used in the sterilization process.

“It’s known to cause cancer,” Hitchins said. “This is bad stuff, and I want to make sure my kids aren’t exposed to it, or, at least, very little as possible.”

This year, three companies operating four plants in metro-Atlanta applied for an exemption to the new rule: Becton Dickinson and Company, Sterigenics and Sterilization Services of Georgia.

The Trump Administration’s EPA approved their application, giving them an extra two years to comply with regulations.

An executive order issued last week argues the pollution control technology needed for compliance does not exist in a commercially viable form, and the new rule could make medical devices unavailable to patients.

The Southern Environmental Law Center’s air program leader, Keri Powell, wants to know why these companies need more time to comply.

“We can’t see their application,” Powell said. “The EPA and the Trump Administration won’t turn them over. It’s a secret.”

Channel 2 Action News asked the three companies why they applied for an exemption.

BD said it needs more time to install the equipment. We are waiting for a response from Sterigenics and Sterilization Services.

“According to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, these plants have now installed the equipment. They have tested and they are operating the equipment. So, the idea that they don’t have the technology to comply with the federal law is mystifying,” said Powell.

Neighbors who live near Sterigenics said to expect lawsuits to challenge the exemptions.

“We’re going to do everything we can in our power,” Hitchins said.

He said metro-Atlanta isn’t alone. The executive order lists more than 30 other plants across the U.S. and Georgia that have received exemptions to the new Ethelyn Oxide regulations.

The plants in Georgia are in Cobb, Fulton, Newton, Morgan, and Richmond counties.

Should nuclear power be a part of the energy mix?,"Peter McGuire, www.mainepublic.org, peter-mcguire",,,,,https://www.mainepublic.org/climate/2025-07-25/electricity-demand-is-on-the-rise-in-maine-should-nuclear-power-be-a-part-of-the-energy-mix,"""As a young man, I was opposed, strongly opposed to nuclear power, largely because it was right next door to the place I worked,"" Hudson said.
Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans' appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup.
But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.
About a quarter of New England's electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.
""This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn't get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,"" Hudson said.","The remains of the Maine Yankee nuclear plant in Wiscasset are protected by a tall chain link fence topped with razor wire and a checkpoint manned by armed guards.

Surrounded by trees and fields, towering pylons from an electric substation are some of the only infrastructure still visible from the road leading down to Bailey Point.

But Don Hudson says 30 years ago it was a completely different scene: A huge dome covered a reactor that cranked out a third of Maine's power, the largest single source of electricity in the state.

""That concrete dome would have dwarfed the other buildings which after a while you would have picked up,"" Hudson said.

""The adjacent buildings that housed the spent fuel pool and all the apparatus needed to generate electricity,"" he added.

Back then Hudson was working with the Chewonki Foundation an environmental nonprofit located across a narrow coastal channel from the plant.

""As a young man, I was opposed, strongly opposed to nuclear power, largely because it was right next door to the place I worked,"" Hudson said.

He remembers the plant opening in 1972. Twenty-four years later safety concerns and expensive repairs shuttered Maine Yankee. Hudson chairs the community advisory panel group established first to help decommission the plant and now to advocate for removing fuel waste from the site.

And all these decades later, he's still working to find a final resting place for 540 tons of spent nuclear fuel still stored in specialized concrete tubes at the former plant. Without a national strategy to collect and manage America's nuclear waste, Bailey Point will likely remain a storage facility that costs about $10 million a year.

And under current rules, the material will have to remain secure for 10,000 years, Hudson said.

""If we're going to use nuclear power from here into the future, we need to resolve this issue with high level radioactive waste,"" Hudson said.

Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans' appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup.

Refocused attention on nuclear is being driven by tech companies hungry for electricity to fuel data centers and startups developing ""small modular reactors"" that could be deployed faster than traditional power plants.

Meanwhile, both the Trump and Biden presidential administrations have pushed policies aimed at encouraging new nuclear generation.

""Whether you're looking from the federal level or the state level, or you're the industry, or at the local level, I think you there are a lot of people that see the potential that new nuclear can provide that just other generation sources can't,"" said Kristy Hartman, a spokesperson for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group.

Nuclear plants are incredibly costly and take years to get approved and constructed.

But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.

That attribute could be attractive to states like Maine, with goals to use completely clean energy in the near future, Hartman said.

States ""have these mandates and they have these decarbonization goals in particular and they are not going to reach the finish line with just the renewables that they originally set,"" Hartman said.

About a quarter of New England's electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.

But Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at the Acadia Center, doubts nuclear will make significant inroads in the region.

""Most of the modeling that we have reviewed largely suggests a future where solar, wind and batteries are really dominating the generating resource mix well into the future,"" Dickerson said.

Even as New England states see prospects to rapidly build out offshore wind resources in the face of market forces and political obstruction, Dickerson still thinks nuclear will complement, not displace, renewable generation.

And Jack Shapiro from the Natural Resources Council of Maine said new reactors have a track record of construction delays and massive cost overruns.

""Building new nuclear will not occur in time to meaningfully contribute to emissions reductions, while renewables are being rapidly deployed today,"" Shapiro said in testimony to the Legislature this winter.

Maine lawmakers rejected two bills aimed at smoothing the way for nuclear generation in the 2025 legislative session. But a third bill, to request informational bids for small modular reactors, was carried over for more debate next year.

Patrick Woodcock, CEO of the Maine Chamber of Commerce and a former energy official in Maine and Massachusetts, said all options should be considered to bring down escalating electric costs.

But he doesn't think it is realistic to expect a new reactor in Maine in the near future. Any nuclear development requires approval from a statewide referendum, which could make developers think twice, Woodcock said. Plus, the state's electric market is likely too small to justify the massive expense of building a new plant.

But regional projects to maintain or expand New England's remaining reactors could be worth considering, Woodcock added.

""Ultimately this comes down to economics,"" Woodcock said ""Does this make sense for ratepayers? Does this make sense for our load growth trajectory? Ultimately that comes down to a specific proposal and we are a long way from seeing that in New England,"" he added.

Back in Wiscasset, Don Hudson says he got more comfortable with Maine Yankee after seeing the plant in operation. But without a national strategy to manage spent fuel, he's not convinced new reactors are a solution for future electric demand.

""This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn't get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,"" Hudson said. ""It just doesn't make any sense.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7dedece/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4707x2471+0+262/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F04%2F7e%2F0d78aad84d0f8ac49dbb76bb05bf%2Fmy-isfsi-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:03:41.487785

About Kaliber Motors: Kaliber Motors is a technology-first EV company delivering intelligent mobility solutions for the commercial sector.","IRVINE, CA, UNITED STATES, July 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Kaliber Motors announces its latest proprietary breakthrough in energy architecture for electric vehicles with the patenting of the Inteli-Charge Modular Hybrid Battery System. Engineered to accelerate fleet uptime and reduce vehicle charging downtime, Inteli-Charge combines high-C-rate lithium iron phosphate (LFP) modules with standard-capacity modules, all governed by an AI-enhanced predictive Battery Management System (BMS). Unlike conventional EV packs limited by uniform charge rates, Inteli-Charge decouples energy replenishment from full-pack cycling, enabling tactical, high-speed charge top-ups mid-route without added system cost. This hybrid solution delivers partial charge recovery in under 10 minutes without compromising long-term battery health or cost-efficiency across fleet operations. Launching with the Kaliber Panther, the company’s last-mile, AI-integrated walk-in delivery platform, Inteli-Charge translates rapid mid-route ultra-fast charging into real-world uptime and a competitive operational edge.

“Vehicle uptime is the new battleground in fleet efficiency,” said Steven Braido, CEO of Kaliber Motors. “Inteli-Charge rewrites the playbook, not by increasing pack size or chasing peak charge speeds, but by sequencing and managing energy availability intelligently in both charge and discharge cycles. Our architecture gives operators the tactical edge they’ve been waiting for.”

Kaliber’s battery system uses a dual-class configuration of LFP cells, combining high-C-rate modules for ultra-fast top-offs with standard-capacity units designed for full-cycle recovery during idle periods. Kaliber’s proprietary Battery Management System (BMS) coordinates energy flow in real time, leveraging vehicle telemetry and AI-driven predictive logic to match power delivery to route demands and terrain.

While many manufacturers chase costly solid-state technologies or all–high-C-rate battery architectures, Kaliber delivers fast-charge performance without either trade-off. Solid-state systems often exceed $300 to $500 per kilowatt-hour and remain commercially immature, while full high-C-rate packs introduce unnecessary thermal strain and escalating cost challenges. Inteli-Charge sidesteps both extremes by leveraging mass-produced, stable LFP chemistry to balance charge velocity, durability, and system cost, delivering modules as low as $90 to $120/kWh and supporting large-fleet electrification without inflating system-level costs.

Beyond charging speed, Inteli-Charge introduces intelligent thermal management, hot-swappable module architecture for streamlined servicing, and cloud-connected diagnostics for fleet-wide optimization. Its fallback logic ensures uninterrupted energy on demanding routes, activating high-C modules precisely when needed and conserving peak power for surges and gradients. This multi-layered strategy translates directly to reduced ownership costs and extended battery lifespan across high-throughput commercial deployments.

Kaliber Motors continues to expand its intellectual property portfolio in support of autonomy-ready and AI-driven logistics platforms. The Inteli-Charge patent marks another milestone in Kaliber’s mission to deliver real-world, next-gen EV infrastructure that is modular, intelligent, and built for scale.

It is like they are trying to remove climate change out of existence by scrubbing out the words off government websites.
Global Change Research Program, a 35 year-old effort to track global climate change that was established by Congress.","When the catastrophic flooding happened in Texas along the Guadalupe River, President Trump responded that “nobody ever saw a thing like this coming” and that “this is a once-in-every 200 year deal.” Not to be outdone, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the Texas floods as a “1000-year event”.

What is striking about these responses is their lack of comprehension of climate science and climate change. Extreme floods and sea level rise have become almost routine. It makes you wonder if we have all been inhabiting the same planet. It is not like climate science is something new. In 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen persuasively presented the risks of climate change in testimony to the U.S. Senate. Since that time, an overwhelming international scientific consensus has supported and reinforced Hansen’s perspective.

Global warming has made events like the Texas flood much more common and more extreme. I was struck by the similarities between the Texas flood and Hurricane Helene which devastated North Carolina last year. I also think of the 2023 floods in Vermont. However, instead of seeing the Texas disaster in the context of many other similar events, the Trump regime remains in climate denial.

Trump has called climate change “a hoax.” With his mantra of “drill baby drill,” his administration is actually committed to worsening global warming as quickly as possible. He has increased subsidies for fossil fuels. It is like they are trying to remove climate change out of existence by scrubbing out the words off government websites. Their motto could be “backwards at warp speed.” It is like a death wish.

The Trump regime accepted no responsibility for the Texas flooding. They did not see the mass layoffs at Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration or the National Weather Service as having anything to do with their lack of preparedness and the government’s inadequate and late response. At least 135 people died from the flood and three remain missing.

Since the Texas flood, there has been an assessment of blame going on. On July 3, the National Weather Service issued its first alert predicting rainfall totals of six inches in twelve hours. That initial forecast proved to be an underestimate. The National Weather Service office in nearby San Antonio was missing both a chief meteorologist and a warning coordination meteorologist.

The National Weather Service issued two more warnings early on July 4, but the warnings failed to get through to the residents who lived near the water. The water rose more than 25 feet in 2 hours. There was a lack of coordination between the National Weather Service and the locals. Kerr County Texas locals had tried to get FEMA funding for a flood warning system for years, but the State of Texas had turned down the request.

In 2019, the owners of the girl’s camp, Camp Mystic, that suffered so many casualties had performed a multi-million dollar renovation. For reasons that are unclear, the camp did not move its most vulnerable cabins out of the flood zone. They built more cabins inside it.

Immediately after the flood, FEMA’s response was poor. Homeland Security Secretary Noem didn’t authorize FEMA’s deployment of Urban Search and Rescue Teams until Monday, July 7, more than three days after the flooding began. Normally, FEMA would have been at the site of the flooding much sooner.

Also, almost inexplicably, Noem fired hundreds of contract workers at FEMA emergency centers on July 5, a day after the flooding started. On July 6 and 7, FEMA did not answer nearly two-thirds of calls to its disaster assistance line. Noem also had recently enacted a new cost-cutting scheme where she had to sign off personally on any expense over $100,000. Noem’s red tape delayed FEMA response time.

While politicians like Texas Governor Greg Abbott attempt to squirm out of responsibility by saying only losers try and understand to assess blame, if we, as a society, want to prevent more such events, understanding matters.

What is crazy is that the Trump regime is actively moving to disband federal agencies that help Americans cope with our ever-more frequent climate catastrophes. Trump has called for the elimination of FEMA “as it exists today,” although he has gone back and forth on that. He cancelled a $4.5 billion program that helps protect hard-hit communities from flooding.

He plans to increase the amount of damage a storm has to do before the federal government will declare a disaster. This will make it harder for states to be eligible for federal assistance. This is consistent with his plan to send disaster relief back to states that lack the resources to do recovery.

The Trump regime’s response to climate is rooted in a hatred of science. The climate scientist, Andrew Dessler, has written: “They hate science because it leads to regulation, so they want to do everything they can to stop science from being used to regulate.”

I think they also hate science because it is the ultimate woke discipline. Science is a repository of secular truths which conflicts with the conspiracy theories and religious beliefs that motivate so many MAGA followers.

Not only does the Trump regime want to dismantle federal agencies that respond to disasters, they want to purge our collective ability to understand climate and weather prediction.

They have fired hundreds of scientists who were working on the next version of the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally-mandated report used to prepare endangered U.S. communities for extreme weather and sea-level rise. They also have taken apart the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a 35 year-old effort to track global climate change that was established by Congress.

The Trump plan will cause forecasting havoc and it will lead to needless death. They are looking to close the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, the National Severe Storm Laboratory and the High-Impact Weather Research and Operation. Without question, reducing accurate and timely weather warnings endangers the public.

Humans are heating up the planet, melting the vast ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. We can expect many more Texas-style disasters which I guess we are supposed to meet with an Alfred E. Neuman “what me worry” response. Disaster relief has become a passe concept.

“This collaboration represents a meaningful step in advancing our sustainability objectives by reducing environmental impact, strengthening compliance and driving greater efficiencies across our operations,” says Sara Cook, sustainable development manager at United States Cold Storage. “We are proud to collaborate with Divert, a company that shares our commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship, and we look forward to building a longstanding relationship.”

As a part of this program, unsold and non-donatable food and beverage products from USCS’s California locations are brought to Divert’s Integrated Diversion and Energy Facility in Turlock, Calif. The facility leverages Divert’s depackaging and anaerobic digestion solutions to process the material into carbon-negative renewable energy and nutrient-rich soil amendments. In doing so, the process prevents the material from going to landfill, where it would emit greenhouse gases.

“Creating reliable and flexible diversion pathways to support our customers across the food value chain represents a massive opportunity to drive environmental and operational impact,” says Andrew Johnston, VP and GM of industrials at Divert. “Our collaboration with USCS demonstrates how the cold storage industry can turn a challenge into a value-generating solution — meeting compliance requirements, reducing emissions, and unlocking positive ESG and business outcomes.”

Divert’s solutions will help USCS make better-informed resource management decisions across its operations. In addition, the program supports compliance with California’s Senate Bill 1383 (SB 1383), which mandates redirecting organic waste from landfills and encourages the use of anaerobic digestion to create renewable energy.

And this, of course, also comes on the heels of that arbitration ruling last week, last Friday, I believe, that lets Chevron gives Chevron the stake, the Guyana stake from the Hess acquisition.
Bigger picture, Ines, looking at oil prices, are we still looking for lower prices by the end of the year, Ines?","US reportedly making a shift from its strategy on Venezuela's oil sector, starting with Chevron, and Yahoo finances and NES Frey joins us now with details.

Yeah, Josh. And this is quite a reversal from what the Trump administration had as a strategy back in May, when it revoked the right for Chevron to pump oil in Venezuela. It is now reversing that. And now, now Chevron will be able to pump oil in Venezuela. Analysts are saying that this is a positive for the company. This is a positive catalyst, even though the stock hasn't reacted much today. Year to date, the stock is up about 7%. But what analysts saying that this creates additional cash flow for the company? Chevron had been pumping about 200, more than 200,000 barrels per day out of Venezuela before that initial permit was revoked back in May. And this, of course, also comes on the heels of that arbitration ruling last week, last Friday, I believe, that lets Chevron gives Chevron the stake, the Guyana stake from the Hess acquisition. So, overall, a positive couple of weeks for Chevron. But this announcement from the Trump administration is really kind of highlighting the delicate balance that the Trump administration is, is doing with these sanctioned countries like Venezuela, and the need to keep energy prices low because this reversal comes on the heels of a deal between Caracas and Washington. Some Americans that have been detained in Venezuela, they will be brought back to the US. And Venezuela has agreed to that. And then also some Venezuelans, more than 200 Venezuelans in El Salvador, will be taken back to Venezuela. So, again, this kind of balancing act between keeping energy prices low, but also putting pressure on sanctioned countries like Venezuela, a similar situation with a country like Iran. And also with Trump wanting the war to end in Ukraine, and the type of pressure that is put on Russia as well.

Bigger picture, Ines, looking at oil prices, are we still looking for lower prices by the end of the year, Ines?

Look, we are looking at lower prices by the end of the year. I'm going to just pull up the chart just to show you where we're at right now. Part of the what analysts are talking about is some volatility that we could be seeing going into September. This is because those OPEC Plus increases that OPEC has announced, those will be absorbed in the market by then. The Trump, Trump's 50-day ultimatum for Russia to end the war with Ukraine, that expires at the beginning of September. And then you also have EU price caps on Russian oil that is set to go into effect at the beginning of September as well. So you may see some volatility in September. But the thesis overall hasn't really change, as with respect to supply in the market, that you will be seeing an increase of supply in the market. Of course, part of this has to do with those OPEC Plus barrels that are coming into the market.

All right. Thank you, Ines. Appreciate it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mbm_Okp5zSZQvcS6IJd.mQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-07/6bd44650-6996-11f0-affb-d25e97ba34c8,N,,2025-07-26 13:05:44.057853

The company posted a notable decline in profits and its largest revenue drop in over a decade, a stark contrast to its years of meteoric growth. While the company managed to meet earnings per share expectations, the underlying numbers reveal a company grappling with a confluence of challenges, from production woes to a tarnished brand image. This has led to a volatile stock performance, with shares tumbling after the earnings announcement.

The Cybertruck: A Bold but Costly Gamble

A significant contributor to Tesla's current financial strain is the long-awaited and highly controversial Cybertruck. While the futuristic pickup has certainly generated a massive amount of buzz, its production has been plagued by delays and unexpectedly high costs. The Cybertruck's unconventional design and stainless-steel exoskeleton have created unique manufacturing challenges, leading to a slower-than-anticipated production ramp-up. This has had a direct impact on Tesla's bottom line, with the company pouring billions into a vehicle that has yet to generate a significant return on investment. As Newsweek reports, Tesla's profits have plummeted, and the Cybertruck's difficult birth is a major contributing factor. The high price tag of the Cybertruck also limits its market, and it's unclear if it will ever achieve the mass-market appeal of Tesla's other models.

EV Market Headwinds and the Looming Tax Credit Cliff

Beyond its internal struggles, Tesla is also navigating a more challenging electric vehicle market. The initial frenzy of EV adoption has cooled, and the market is now facing a period of slower growth. As Cox Automotive notes, the EV market is a complex mix of growth and challenges, with increased competition from both legacy automakers and new EV startups. This has put downward pressure on prices and profit margins across the industry.

A more immediate threat to Tesla and the entire US EV market is the impending expiration of federal EV tax credits. As Plugin America clearly states, the current federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs will end after September 30, 2025. This ""tax credit cliff"" is expected to have a significant impact on EV demand, as the upfront cost of EVs will increase for many consumers. For Tesla, which has relied on these credits to make its vehicles more affordable, the end of this program could lead to a further decline in sales.

Brand Damage and the Limits of New Models

Tesla's more recent models, like the updated Model 3 and Model Y, have received generally positive reviews. Car and Driver praises the 2025 Model 3 for its improved ride comfort and swift acceleration, and other reviewers have noted the upgraded interiors and features. However, these solid improvements are being overshadowed by the significant damage to the Tesla brand.

The company's brand reputation has taken a serious hit, largely due to the public persona and controversial statements of its CEO, Elon Musk. As one analyst bluntly put it, the damage to the brand could be ""100% irreversible."" This has led to a decline in consumer sentiment and a tangible impact on sales, particularly in key markets. While the new models are undoubtedly good cars, they may not be enough to win back customers who have been alienated by the brand's increasingly polarizing image.

Wrapping Up

Tesla finds itself at a critical juncture. The company's Q2 earnings shortfall is not an isolated event but rather a symptom of deeper issues. The costly and slow rollout of the Cybertruck, coupled with a cooling EV market and the looming expiration of tax credits, has created a perfect storm of challenges. Furthermore, the significant damage to the Tesla brand, once its greatest asset, is proving to be a major obstacle to future growth.

A turnaround for Tesla is possible, but it will require more than just producing good cars. The company will need to address its production inefficiencies, navigate the post-tax-credit market, and, most importantly, find a way to repair its fractured brand image. The road ahead for Tesla is uncertain, and the next few quarters will be crucial in determining whether the company can reclaim its position as the undisputed leader of the electric vehicle revolution. The mixed analyst ratings, with a consensus ""Hold,"" reflect this uncertainty. For now, the once-unflappable EV giant appears to be on shaky ground.

Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.
Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

The Grain Belt Express, a high-voltage direct current transmission line, was intended to connect wind and solar energy capacity across Kansas and Missouri.
According to the DOE, their decision to cancel the loan guarantee comes after a thorough review, determining that the conditions necessary to issue the guarantee are not likely to be met for federal support.
Despite the cancellation of the federal loan, Invenergy, the company behind Grain Belt Express, plans to proceed with private funding.
“While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee, a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings,” said Grain Belt Express in a statement.","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Energy has terminated its $4.9 billion commitment for the Grain Belt Express Phase 1 project.

The Grain Belt Express, a high-voltage direct current transmission line, was intended to connect wind and solar energy capacity across Kansas and Missouri. It was initially supported by a taxpayer-funded loan guarantee of up to $4.9 billion, granted by the Biden administration in November 2024.

According to the DOE, their decision to cancel the loan guarantee comes after a thorough review, determining that the conditions necessary to issue the guarantee are not likely to be met for federal support.

The move was praised by Illinois State Representative Adam Niemerg (R-Dieterich).

“We need sound energy policies that prioritize the needs of American citizens,” he said. “We need energy policies focused on accessibility, affordability and reliability, and under the Trump Administration—that is exactly what we are getting.”

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey also supported the decision, as he issued a civil investigative demand to Grain Belt on July 2 to obtain documents related to the project.

“Grain Belt Express has repeatedly lied to Missourians about the jobs it would create, the benefits it would deliver, and the land it seeks to take,” he said at the time of the demand.

Despite the cancellation of the federal loan, Invenergy, the company behind Grain Belt Express, plans to proceed with private funding.

“While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee, a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings,” said Grain Belt Express in a statement.",https://fox2now.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/07/GBX-Phase-Map-JPG.webp?w=1280,N,,2025-07-26 12:04:53.791734

The tech sector’s energy appetite drove the cost of generating capacity to record levels in the US’ largest power market, the PJM Interconnection, highlighting the value of dispatchable power — and particularly gas-fired generation.

And data center developer Crusoe finalized a deal this week to buy 29 natural gas turbines from GE Vernova — enough to supply 1 gigawatt of electricity — to help power its rapidly expanding AI infrastructure build-out.

“The greatest barrier we collectively face to our country's leadership on AI today is timely access to reliable electric power,” Advantage Data Centers Executive Vice President Jeff Tench told a US Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing Wednesday. “I have seen the scale and speed of hyperscale data center development grow dramatically. Five years ago, a 30 megawatt facility was considered large. Today, 100 MW is the starting point, with campus developments commonly reaching 500 MW or more, and we have multiple customers seeking 1 GW or more for AI infrastructure, which is the equivalent of all electrical power used here in Washington, DC.”

'Left No Choice'

That trend, along with years-long waits for links with the power grid, has data center developers building their own gas-fired power plants.

Tench said Advantage had planned to interconnect with the local utility to obtain 100 MW of power for a data center it developed in Loudon County, Virginia, but was “left no choice” after the utility said it could not connect them to the power grid for another five to seven years.

“The planning cycles for our data center developments can sometimes span multiple years. … We had already committed hundreds of millions of dollars into the development project,” Tench testified. “In this particular case, we were fortunate in the fact that our property sat on top of a high-volume, high-pressure natural gas line. And we scrambled. We designed, built and commissioned a power plant operating completely independent of the grid within 18 months, and that data center is up and running with a very important customer of ours today.”

Tench said the site “was only big enough to handle a turbine plant, and there would have been no way to bring in wind and solar in that particular case.”

Capacity Prices Skyrocket

Utilities in PJM, which serves about 65 million customers in a territory spanning all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, must buy capacity from generators and demand response resources that clear the PJM capacity auction.

In this week's auction, the region-wide price for the 2026-27 delivery year jumped 22% to the federally approved cap of $329.17 per megawatt day (MWd). In the previous delivery year, capacity prices jumped 833% to $269.92/MWd, following three consecutive auctions that resulted in prices well below $100.

Capacity of 134,205.3 MW cleared the 2026-27 auction, including 63,377 MW of gas-fired generation. The results demonstrate ""a near inability to provide supply adequate to clear the market overall — regardless of price,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a Jul. 23 report.

The bank noted that ahead of the auction, bilateral capacity trades were in the high $200s/MWd. That activity “could trend higher above the ceiling level of $329/MWd for 2028-29, the subsequent auction after this next December. We would model flat at the cap for at least the next two auctions.”

In a July filing with the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM’s independent market monitor, Monitoring Analytics, said the electricity market’s tightness is “almost entirely the result of large data center load additions, both actual historical and forecast.”

Talen Scores Windfall

Sustained high capacity prices benefit incumbent merchant generators, most of which operate large fleets of gas-fired power plants. Talen Energy's stock opened almost 9% higher on Jul. 23 after the auction's results were released.

Talen owns 9,662.7 MW of capacity in PJM, 56% of which burns gas, about 21% nuclear and about 14% coal. The Houston-based company said 6,702 MW of its capacity cleared the auction, which will bring in about $805 million in capacity revenues for the 2026-27 delivery year, which runs from Jun. 1, 2026, through May 31, 2027.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d037f64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6681x3508+0+473/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F48%2Fde%2Fe8f87fe74c19b7b08c718a607f56%2Fss-2040785909-ai.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 13:05:49.540023

The new upgraded facility will be at its current Gothenburg site.

Alongside the site’s existing diesel engine test cells (both heavy and light duty), JM has now expanded its H2ICE capabilities, scaling up its ability to now test with engines for the first time, building on previous test capability for H2 combustion engine development. The test area is set to be operational in autumn 2025.

It will test the performance of catalysts within the wider engine aftertreatment and control systems, providing key insights in the development of hydrogen mobility solutions. This follows on from JM’s partnership with Cummins, and technology partners PHINIA and Zircotec, which launched Project Brunel in November 2021. This collaboration was successfully concluded in March 2025 by delivering proof points towards significant improvements in H₂ICE engine performance and durability.

The new testing capabilities will include:

Its own hydrogen supply & storage area (H2@max 500 bar) with ​ compressor and intermediate storage tank

Control/safety system for compressor/storage

Hydrogen flow meter and analyzer

Test cell upgrade - supporting H2ICE engines up to 600kw (800hp)

Safety system, multiple gas sensors, new fire detection sensors

The adaption of conventional exhaust measuring instruments

The upgrade of our testing capabilities in Gothenburg to include H2ICE is a real show of our backing to this technology, as we seek to unleash the potential of hydrogen mobility. Across Europe and elsewhere, we cannot rely on battery electric vehicles alone to solve our challenges.

MGCGA (Make Gas Cans Great Again)

The EPA said it has received years of complaints about how gas cans currently function. Legislation dating back to 2007 changed the way gas cans are manufactured.

The EPA finalized a rule that year that required portable fuel container manufacturers to reduce evaporative emissions by sealing in gasoline vapors. It went into effect in 2009, and the EPA stated that due to confusion, manufacturers stopped installing vents altogether.

In 2008, Congress passed the Children’s Gasoline Burn Prevention Act, which requires gas cans to be child-resistant.

Then, in 2020, Congress passed the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act, which mandated the use of flame mitigation devices in cans to prevent flashback ignition. The EPA said that further complicated nozzle and spout designs.

“The confusion surrounding gas cans has been a frustration for years. We are proud to address this issue head on,” Lee Zeldin, EPA Administrator, said in a statement. “Moving forward, Americans should have gas cans that are compliant, but most importantly, that are effective and consumer friendly.”

Why this started

These regulations began when regulators noticed that gas cans were a significant contributor to air pollution.

The California Air Resources Board adopted new gas can regulations back in 1999, with Chairman Dr. Alan Lloyd saying, “Our research shows that these cans are a major source of pollution.”

Another report showed emissions from a single old-style gas could be 60 times higher than a car’s gas tank if both were left open next to each other.

It reached the point where some states, such as Utah and Iowa, even hold gas can exchange programs.

Manufacturers will now be able to produce gas cans in a manner similar to how they were made a few decades ago.

“Gas cans used to POUR gas,” Zeldin said in a post on X. “Now they just DRIBBLE like a child’s sippy cup. The Trump EPA’s message to gas can makers: VENT THE DARN CAN and let it FLOW BABY FLOW!”

Other legislation

This move from the EPA follows the introduction of the “Gas Can Freedom Act of 2025” by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, in February.

That bill would repeal the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act and would further prohibit the Consumer Product Safety Commission from imposing child-resistance standards on gas cans.

The bill was sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, but it has since seen no movement. Changing certain consumer goods has been a staple for the Trump administration.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CLEAN-Gas-cans_Custom_featuredImage_Fri-Jul-25-2025.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 07:01:05.050983

Who’d have guessed, the volatile Elon Musk has a starring role in Kansas’ economic future — and Kelly’s legacy.","Just two years ago, Democrats were on the verge of achieving their long-awaited green energy revolution.

Biden had reversed Trump’s fossil fuel initiatives and set an ambitious goal for all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emissions. He signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a landmark climate package that delivered historic investments for cutting emissions.

Electric vehicles (EV) led the way, an industry turbocharged by IRA’s generous tax credits for vehicle purchases, home chargers, battery manufacturing, and billions for new production facilities.

Electric vehicle sales surged in 2023, reaching 14 million globally with 1.4 million sold in the United States, a whopping 67% year-over-year increase. They accounted for 10% of U.S. light vehicle sales, with Tesla holding over half the EV market share.

Eager to capitalize, Gov. Laura Kelly brokered a deal with Panasonic to build a massive $4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in De Soto, aimed at supplying Tesla’s new factories in Texas. A multibillion dollar tax incentive package secured Panasonic’s investment, made possible by the bipartisan APEX Act passed by the state Legislature.

Kelly described the deal as transformative, the largest economic development project in Kansas history, expected to create 4,000 jobs and thousands more through related businesses.

Trump posed little threat. The intense backlash after the Capitol riots and mounting legal challenges cast serious doubt about his future.

And despite lingering concerns about his age, President Biden was expected to win reelection and help Democrats take back the House. The anticipated “red wave” never materialized in the midterms, signaling waning strength of the Republican brand.

Yet, what felt inevitable crumbled.

Trump returned stronger, calling the shift to EVs a “transition to hell,” framing it effectively as a “government assassination” of auto jobs and unionized workers.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk joined Trump, which eventually led to a major loss in the company’s market share and a sharp stock sell-off.

The enthusiasm for EVs seemed driven as much by political momentum as by consumer demand. When that momentum slowed, so did the market.

Overall sales slumped in 2024, dropping to 8% of U.S. light vehicles sales. Buyers remained concentrated among the affluent and college educated, with limited penetration into the broader public. Biden’s zero-emissions goal appeared naïve and disconnected from middle- and working-class realities.

Democrats were swept in November.

Trump recently signed his Big Beautiful Bill, which terminates EV tax credits and phases out incentives for battery production.

Just as Biden had undone Trump’s policies, Trump unraveled Biden’s.

Because federal control routinely alternates between the parties, companies are constantly exposed to shifting regulations and the prospect of brand polarization; ask Disney, Bud Light, now Tesla.

Getting the politics wrong carries serious consequences.

Now that circumstances have changed so dramatically, would Kelly still place such a large bet on EVs?

Would Panasonic? After all, many clean energy projects have been canceled, including battery plants in Georgia and Arizona.

EVs are excellent cars; the market will grow – just more slowly now. That slower pace has Kansans concerned about the direction this might take, and whether Tesla comes out ahead.

Who’d have guessed, the volatile Elon Musk has a starring role in Kansas’ economic future — and Kelly’s legacy.

Work has begun on-site at Parc Cybi, Holyhead, to strengthen the grid infrastructure for Morlais, a flagship tidal energy project run by local social enterprise, Menter Môn Morlais Ltd.

Backed by the North Wales Growth Deal and funding from both the Welsh and UK Governments, the £16 million Cydnerth project will futureproof Morlais by increasing its grid capacity from 18MW to an eventual 240MW.

Initial construction will involve the installation of underground cables to transmit clean electricity from the Morlais substation from the coast at Ynys Lawd (South Stack) to the national grid.

Cllr. Gary Prichard, Leader of the Isle of Anglesey County Council and Lead Member for Low Carbon Energy Programme, said:

“This is a significant milestone for Morlais and North Wales. The project can now leverage Growth Deal funding to ensure its expansion, enabling economic opportunities, strengthening local supply chains and supporting local jobs. It will ensure North Wales is a key player in the future of tidal energy and clean electricity.”

Andy Billcliff, Chief Executive of Menter Môn Morlais Ltd, added:

“This is an important and welcome step toward realising the full potential of Ynys Môn’s tidal resources and establishing the area as a hub for sustainable energy. The work at Parc Cybi is crucial to that goal. As a local organisation, we’re committed to delivering economic benefits for our community, while safeguarding the environment. We are grateful for Growth Deal support through Ambition North Wales which is essential as we progress Morlais.”

North Wales-based Jones Bros Civil Engineering UK has secured the contract for the construction and cabling work for Cydnerth.

Contracts Director for Jones Bros, Eryl Roberts, added:

“We’re pleased to have been appointed to deliver Cydnerth, the next phase of infrastructure for Morlais, such an innovative renewable scheme right here on our doorstep here in North Wales. As with all our projects, we pride ourselves in providing local supply chain and employment opportunities and are excited to be working on site to deliver this important scheme.”

Cydnerth is part of the North Wales Growth Deal’s Low Carbon Energy Programme, which represents a £1 billion investment in the region's economy, with £240 million of this funded jointly by the Welsh and UK Governments.

Rebecca Evans MS, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, said:

“The start of construction on the Cydnerth project represents another major milestone in North Wales' journey to becoming a renewable energy powerhouse. Backed by Welsh Government funding through the North Wales Growth Deal, this will unlock the full potential of Morlais tidal energy and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to the low-carbon transition.

“By increasing grid capacity from 18MW to 240MW, we’re not just supporting clean energy generation – we're creating lasting economic opportunities and high-quality jobs for local communities.”

Wales Office Minister Dame Nia Griffith said:

“It is great news that this major infrastructure project in Holyhead is now underway. The Cydnerth project helps cement North Wales’s growing reputation as a clean energy hub.

“I’m delighted that UK Government funding is supporting the project and helping us deliver our clean energy and economic growth missions.”",https://businessnewswales.com/wp-content/uploads/C_1958_0047.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 06:59:55.702599

American startup Hertha Metals has announced the successful testing of a new approach to steel production that minimizes emissions without increasing costs compared to traditional methods.

Hertha has developed a unique technology that converts low-grade iron ore of any format directly into molten steel or high-purity iron in a single step.

The company cites the key advantages of its one-step process.

Access to cheaper and more abundant raw materials.

Reduced energy consumption and emissions. The Hertha furnace is 30% more energy efficient than traditional steel production methods and requires much less energy than other electrochemical alternatives. Running on natural gas, the unit also cuts emissions by at least 50%. Designed as a flexible fuel system, it can run on pure hydrogen without any equipment modifications;

Modular scalability. The Hertha system integrates directly into existing plants, without the need to build entirely new facilities.

Since the end of 2024, the company has been continuously operating a pilot plant in Houston with a capacity of 1 ton per day. Next year, Hertha will begin construction of a larger demonstration plant in Texas with an annual capacity of over 9,000 tons. Initially, the startup plans to supply high-purity iron (over 99.97%) to the US rare earth magnet market.

Shields reiterated the warning about green energy solutions being pursued across the region in his email response Thursday to Spotlight on Maryland.","The Mid-Atlantic region’s power grid operator is sounding the alarm about state policies accelerating the shutdown of fossil fuel generators as demand for electricity surges and drives up prices to record highs for consumers.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has claimed there’s no evidence that his accelerated green energy agenda is increasing electricity bills for residents, despite concerns from PJM Interconnection that a shrinking energy supply is colliding with rapid economic growth.

Spotlight on Maryland asked PJM on Thursday whether Maryland’s energy generation shortfall specifically increased demand on regional energy costs, which drove up its capacity auction prices to a record high earlier in the week.

Jeffrey Shields, the senior manager of external communications at PJM, provided a lengthy response by email.

Existing supply has been leaving the system due primarily to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics,” Shields said. “In any market, when demand is up and supply is down, there will be an increase in pricing.”

“PJM has been warning of this eventuality for several years now, specifically as it relates to the impact of these supply/demand fundamentals on our ability to reliably operate the power grid,” Shields added.

On Tuesday, its capacity auction price for 2026 had jumped to $329.17 per megawatt (MW) – a 22% increase from the previous year and more than 1038% higher than the $28.92 per MW clearing price in 2023, when Moore took office.

What’s a capacity auction – and why it matters

PJM conducts annual auctions to ensure utilities can secure enough electricity when demand spikes, such as during heat waves or severe storms. The price determined in these auctions affects the cost of electricity for customers across 13 states and Washington, D.C.

As traditional power plants retire faster than replacements come online, PJM says the system is becoming more fragile – and expensive.

“Generators are retiring in Maryland due to a mixture of economic and policy justifications and without replacement generation in place,” PJM warned in a two-page brief after last year’s first record-breaking capacity auction. Maryland, which already imports the majority of its energy, has lost 6,000 MW of electricity since 2018, while adding only 1,600 MW, the brief said.

Moore continues green energy push

At an unrelated event in Baltimore on July 17, Spotlight on Maryland asked Moore if his green energy agenda is disrupting the state’s energy market and costing Marylanders, as they are experiencing a tough state economy.

Not at all,” Moore said. “There is no data that can actually reinforce that being able to say we believe in solar, and wind, and nuclear, and all the different, all-of-the above energy assets, that in any way, is actually hurting ratepayers. In fact, it’s actually helping.”

“The best thing you can do is provide more options for ratepayers. If you provide more options, it’s simple supply and demand, it brings prices down. So what we are interested in is making sure the ratepayers are supported and we can do that while also protecting the environment,” Moore added.

But PJM contends that current green energy initiatives aren’t keeping up with the demand – and new supply is lagging. Shields noted that while PJM has approved 46,000 MW of new generation, much of it remains unbuilt due to global supply chain issues, state and federal permitting delays, and financing challenges.

Offshore wind faces federal setback

Moore has made offshore wind a . He signed three green energy bills in April 2023, including the Maryland Promotion Offshore Wind Energy Resource Act, or the POWER Act. During the bill signings, the governor announced his accelerated net-zero emissions target for Maryland, aiming to reach 100% carbon-free energy generation by 2035 – a full decade ahead of the state’s statutory requirement.

The governor said that offshore wind for the state to replace fossil fuel plants with clean, renewable energy.

“The POWER Act will nearly quadruple our offshore wind goals so we can build off the great work of our partners at Tradepoint Atlantic, our partners at Orsted, and our partners at US Wind to make Maryland the offshore capital of the United States,” Moore said in April 2023.

Spotlight on Maryland reported in early July that the sites previously scheduled to open in summer 2025 remain mostly unchanged since the governor broke ground at the facilities.

When Spotlight on Maryland asked Moore how offshore wind will increase the supply that he says his administration is seeking to accomplish in his all-of-the-above generation approach, he said:

Well, when you’re talking about all-of-the-above energy options, that includes solar, that includes wind, that includes nuclear, that includes all of the various options that we have on board to make sure we are increasing supply,” Moore said. “If you are having increased demand, as we are seeing in the state of Maryland, you have to increase supply.”

“If you do not increase supply, then you will end up having jacked up prices, and that means all the ratepayers get hosed, so what we are trying to do is just provide every single option possible and make it available to people at a scalable way that both brings prices down and bring inventory up,” Moore added.

Moore’s unclear response comes as the two weeks ago that Maryland regulators fix its offshore wind permits, which it said were issued incorrectly. The EPA added that failure to reissue permits in compliance with its terms could void Maryland’s offshore wind approval.

New York utility regulators revoked their permits for a multibillion-dollar offshore wind project last week, citing a shift in federal energy priorities and the need to protect the state’s electricity ratepayers.

“What we’ve seen over the last several months from the federal government hasn’t been a simple change in policy, but a wholesale departure from long-established norms,” said Rory Christian, New York Public Service Commission chairman. “In time, the winds of national policy will shift. When they do, we will be ready. But in the meantime, we have to focus our attention on building the clean energy infrastructure we need.”

PJM’s warning to policymakers

The grid operator outlined three key points for Maryland policymakers to focus on in its publication to reduce record-high energy costs, warning them not to shut down energy sources until replacements are in place.

Avoid efforts meant to push generation off the system until an adequate quantity of replacement generation is online and operating,” PJM said.

Shields reiterated the warning about green energy solutions being pursued across the region in his email response Thursday to Spotlight on Maryland.

Meanwhile, Del. Chris Tomlinson, R-Carroll and Frederick Counties, said he is not confident Maryland is on the right path to protect ratepayers, instead remaining overly focused on green energy solutions as the rest of the nation shifts.

“I don’t think any of the bills that we passed are going to make a dent in what we are seeing on our [electricity] bills month after month,” Tomlinson said. “I don’t ever like to think there is no hope, so I don’t want to say that, but unfortunately, I think it is going to have to get worse until Democratic leadership finally wakes up and says we are going to have to make major changes.”

Recently, Kevin Williams at Inside EVs got an unwelcome present from the city of Ferndale, Michigan: a parking ticket. His great crime? Backing into a parking space instead of parking nose-in. While I disagree with this kind of law (backing in is safer and more efficient), all’s fair with warning, right? In this case, not so much, as it was posted on an EV charging space. Given that many if not most EVs have charging inlets on the back of the vehicle, you’ve basically got no choice but to back in for charging.

Instead of recognizing that this was a case of necessity (a valid legal defense for most crimes and infractions), the jobsworth police officer decided to forego intelligent use of prosecutorial discretion and write him a ticket. And, because he was too busy with work, he forgot to appeal the ticket in time and had to just pay it to avoid having a warrant out for his arrest. Worse, this is something that other EV drivers on PlugShare have complained about, so it’s not the first time this particular form of entrapment has come up in Ferndale.

The Bigger Problem Here

While I totally agree with him about the stupidity of marking an EV charging space as pull-in only, there’s a deeper problem here. Instead of intelligently designing EV charging infrastructure, most charging companies and property owners just copy Tesla, even though Tesla got this very wrong over a decade ago.

To understand why I’m questioning the judgment of the god-king Elon, I must first go through a quick review of the history of fueling vehicles. When the electric starter was invented and fossil-fueled vehicles overtook EVs in the early 20th century, there was no real fueling infrastructure for long trips. Gas vehicles were technically capable of cross-country trips, though, so people did find ways to come up with gasoline.

At first, people taking adventurous trips across the continent had to call ahead to pharmacies and make sure the pharmacist could come up with a jug of gasoline for them in advance. That way, when they got to town, they could drop in, pay for the gas, fill up, and then get to the next pre-arranged fueling site. This was obviously not ideal, and the pharmacists figured out that there was money to be made selling gasoline. So, they started by regularly stocking it for people passing through, and then started having curbside pumps.

At this point, there was a lot of freedom in gas station design. Theoretically, an aspiring pharmacist-gasman could lay out the fueling station any way he wished. Back-in and nose-in spaces to pumps were and still are theoretically possible. But, over the decades, trial and error eventually led to the common pull-through gas pump layout we see in most places today.

Instead of figuring out why gas stations are the way they are, Tesla and Elon Musk decided they wanted to reinvent the wheel (or, uh, the fueling station). Instead of pulling through next to an island under a canopy, Superchargers were placed so that people had to back in and plug in the car. To be perfectly fair, Nissan did the opposite, putting charge ports in the front of the Nissan LEAF, but planned for people to nose into parking spaces to charge and not usually charge from the side of the vehicle.

Because Tesla was successful, most other companies offering charging simply copied this design. Cars could nose in or back in, charge, and leave. Early EVs weren’t good at all for towing, and even today, there are only 2 or 3 models most people would feel comfortable using for cross-country towing. So, the construction of spaces where you pull in or back in to charge continues today.

I Get Why They Do This, But It’s Time To Stop

I understand that integrating EV charging into existing parking lots is made easier by this approach. If you can just add EV charging infrastructure to existing parking spaces, you save a lot of money and open up your options of host businesses to deal with. Opening up a charging station next to existing amenities means you don’t need to build a convenience store, bathrooms, and other expensive things for the needs of the driver and passengers.

That having been said, the EV industry has come a long way since 2010–2014. Instead of a small cult-like customer base, EV companies are starting to break into the wider market. EVs are available in all shapes and sizes, from small commuter cars to half-ton pickup trucks to medium- and heavy-duty vehicles that carry dozens of tons of important cargo. Home and equipment yard charging can still handle most non-over-the-road needs, and rapid charging has become something that’s mostly for people who drive more than a battery’s worth of miles in a day.

The limits of the parking lot approach to charging station layout are starting to catch up with us. The few people now using electric pickups to tow trailers long distances are finding that unhooking and rehooking a trailer at every charging stop is a huge pain in the ass, especially for those using weight distribution hitches. Add extreme cold or 100-degree humid days, and it becomes a form of torture we don’t even impose on enemy combatants or those in Trump’s camps.

The time for haphazard station planning — where saving a buck and making the station fit in somewhere rules over usefulness — is over. There are still plenty of places that can use that kind of parking lot charging, especially for those who can’t charge at home. But we need at least as many well thought out stations designed from the ground up to serve everyone going down a highway now.

These stations need slots for small, light-duty passenger vehicles, but they also need places to charge tow vehicles without unhitching. They also need space and cable length for EVs with charging ports on any part of the vehicle. Having a megawatt charger or two for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles is also extremely important.

But, this truth can be narrowed down to one sentence: Proper Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance (the six Ps). Planning for yesterday’s charging needs won’t cut it. Planning for all of today’s needs and a few years’ worth of tomorrows is what needs to happen. But, for now, we still have charging companies and site hosts who are so inattentive and lazy that they’re setting up EV drivers for tickets. So, I wouldn’t hold my breath on smarter things happening just yet.

In a blog post that went up this morning, Google announced its first-ever long duration energy storage venture, in support of the Energy Dome system.
Many other forms of energy storage, including Energy Dome, are source-agnostic.","Google is making a big move into a new type of CO2-based battery for long duration energy storage, and that should send shivers up the spines of fossil energy stakeholders everywhere. It means that more wind and solar energy than ever before can be put to use in local grids or shunted straight into data centers and other energy-sucking facilities. Come to think of it, the new CO2 battery could also spell trouble for Tesla’s Megapack utility-scale batteries, too.

The Case For Long Duration Energy Storage

Long duration energy storage poses a unique new threat to fossil fuel power plants, specifically those fueled by natural gas. A flood of inexpensive natural gas was the main driver of coal’s decline in the US during the early 2000s, when the cost of wind and solar energy was relatively high. But now, wind and solar have become competitive with natural gas in many markets.

One key contributing factor is the availability of energy storage, which smooths out the on-again, off-again nature of wind and solar resources. So far, that job has fallen upon utility-scale lithium-ion batteries such as those marketed by Tesla under the Megapack brand.

However, if energy storage is going to spur further competitiveness in the wind and solar industries, it has to level up. Lithium-ion batteries typically last about four hours or so. That’s enough to handle daily grid balancing chores and short term emergencies in markets where conventional power plants also play a role, but it’s not sufficient to support a grid saturated with wind and solar energy.

The US Department of Energy has consistently made the case for long duration energy storage systems that can deliver electricity for at least 10 hours, ideally stretching into days, weeks, and entire seasons. Now that the data center construction boom has taken off, the case for long duration storage is stronger than ever.

The Energy Dome Solution: Using CO2 For Good

The US is far from meeting the long duration scenario. Despite the strong performance of Tesla’s Megapack and other battery-type storage systems on the market, pumped storage hydropower still accounts for more than 90% of utility scale storage in the US, long duration or otherwise.

Considering the site selection limitations of hydropower, that should leave the field wide open for new go-anywhere long duration systems. That’s easier said than done. Scaling up to commercial application has been a difficult challenge, but the Italian startup Energy Dome is among those ready to break the barrier.

Energy Dome surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar back in 2022, when its supercrtical CO2 storage system caught the eye of BloombergNEF. As explained by Energy Dome, the “supercritical” part of the system refers to compressing CO2 into a liquid state. Unlike other gases, CO2 can be compressed at ambient temperatures, eliminating the need for expensive cryogenic features.

The closed loop charging cycle starts with CO2 gas held in a dome-like structure. To charge, it is withdrawn compressed into its liquid state. When power is needed, the CO2 is evaporated and run through a turbine to generate electricity. The cycle completes when the spent CO2 returns to the dome.

Long Duration Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Energy Dome claims to beat lithium-ion batteries by a wide margin, currently aiming for a duration of 8-24 hours. The company aims to hit the 10-hour mark with its first project in the US, the “Columbia Energy Storage Project” under the wing of the gas and electricity supplier Alliant Energy to be located in Pacific, Wisconsin.

Earlier this month, Alliant won approval from Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to move forward with the project, which is also supported by the WEC Energy Group, and Madison Gas and Electric.

“Utilizing cutting-edge technology designed by Energy Dome, the Columbia Energy Storage Project will boost grid stability, improve resilience and deliver enough electricity to power approximately 18,000 Wisconsin homes for 10 hours on a single charge,” Alliant explains.

Google Has A (Mixed) Message For Fossil Fuels

The Alliant project will be up and running in 2027, which is just around the corner. Energy Dome also has a project under contract in India, but apparently Google has already seen more than enough. An Energy Dome demonstration project has been shooting electricity into the grid in Italy for more than three years, and the company recently launched a new 20-megawatt commercial plant in Sardinia.

In a blog post that went up this morning, Google announced its first-ever long duration energy storage venture, in support of the Energy Dome system. “Today, we’re adding another technology to our portfolio: long duration energy storage (LDES),” Google reported. “Through a new long-term partnership with Energy Dome, we plan to support multiple commercial projects globally to deploy their LDES technology.”

There being no such thing as a free lunch, that doesn’t necessarily mean all renewables, all the time. Some forms of energy storage are renewables-specific, like concentrating solar power. Many other forms of energy storage, including Energy Dome, are source-agnostic. When Energy Dome draws electricity from the grid to compress CO2, they use whatever is in the mix of the day.

Still, Google states that its primary goal is renewable energy storage, leveraging the excess capacity of wind and/or solar projects wherever its corporate footprint falls. “With this commercial partnership, as well as an investment in the company, we believe these projects can unlock new clean energy for grids where we operate before 2030, helping meet near-term electricity system needs and moving us closer to our 24/7 carbon-free energy goal,” Google explained.

Ummm…About That Megapack…

Of course, no story about energy storage is complete without a mention of Tesla, which has become a household name in the storage field through its Powerwall home-scale batteries as well as the Megapack. Google is among the offtakers supporting Tesla’s Megapack business, but today’s blog post and press release make it clear that Google is moving on.

In the blog post, Google explains that Energy Dome has the potential to scale much faster than other new storage systems in its current portfolio. Google also takes note of its own extensive use of 4-hour lithium-ion batteries for utility-scale storage, but they move from that into an emphatic endorsement of research from the Electric Power Research Institute, indicating that “LDES technologies can cost-effectively integrate a growing volume of renewables onto power systems and contribute to more flexible, reliable grids.”

“The LDES Council estimates that deploying up to 8 terawatts (TW) of LDES by 2040 could result in $540 billion in annual savings globally, thanks in part to their ability to optimize grids,” Google emphasizes.

“By bringing this first-of-a-kind LDES technology to market faster, we aim to rapidly bring its potential to communities everywhere — making reliable, affordable electricity available around the clock and supporting the resilience of grids as they integrate growing amounts of renewable energy sources,” adds Google’s Director of EMEA Energy, Maud Texier in a press statement.

The new agreement with Energy Dome covers projects in Europe, America, and the Asia-Pacific region. I’ve reached out to Energy Dome for more details on any projects to be located in the US, including the Wisconsin project, so stay tuned for an update.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/energy-dome-long-duration-energy-storage.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 09:00:31.617999

Report predicts many US solar and wind projects won’t make it

Xcel Energy believes the portfolio supports its broader five-year investment plan for Texas and New Mexico, announced in October 2024, which is meant to modernize and expand the region’s energy infrastructure. Many of the proposed projects will be built at existing power plant sites, which can reduce development timelines by leveraging existing infrastructure to interconnect new generation to the grid.

What’s in it?

In 2024, Xcel Energy invited developers to submit proposals for new power projects using “any type of technology.” According to Xcel Energy, power forecasts showed the region has a future need of over 3GW of accredited capacity, which would translate to more than 5GW of additional nameplate capacity by the end of the decade. The utility said the current peak demand in its Texas-New Mexico service area was a little more than 6GW at the time of the request for proposals (RFP).

The RFP process resulted in a mix of energy solutions, including wind, solar, battery storage, and gas power sources, and the projects will be developed through a variety of ownership structures. Some will be built and owned by Xcel Energy, others built by developers and then sold to the company, and some operated under long-term agreements to purchase the power they produce. The portfolio also includes extending the lives of existing natural gas units at Nichols, Maddox, and Plant X.

The selected portfolio includes extensions of 521MW of existing generation as well as the addition of 17 new power projects that will add 5,168MW of new nameplate capacity and 3,121MW of accredited capacity to the SPS system by 2030. Technologies selected include 3,200MW of dispatchable generation and energy storage and 1,968 MW of wind and solar generation, establishing a foundation for long-term system reliability, economic development, and a resilient energy supply. Specifically comprised of:

2,088 MW of natural gas,

1,273 MW of wind,

695 MW of solar,

1,112 MW of battery storage capacity.

To help meet New Mexico’s 50% renewable energy requirement by 2030, two solar projects in the portfolio will be dedicated to New Mexico customers.

Xcel Energy will seek approval of the portfolio from state regulators in the second half of 2025, and the company also plans to issue another all-source RFP to secure additional resources to be operational by 2032.

Xcel Energy owns and operates a fleet of conventional plants in this region, along with two large wind energy facilities.

Through the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit 2025, we call on and propose that all levels of the Indonesian government set more ambitious, science-based climate targets aligned with 1.5°C.
This strong signal of commitment can also attract green investment and future climate financing commitments.","Ahead of the COP-30 climate change negotiations in Brazil, we—the people of Indonesia Net-Zero Summit 2025—call on Indonesia to strengthen its strategy and take concrete action to address the climate crisis, while leading global efforts to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C, as agreed in the Paris Agreement, ratified by Law No. 16 of 2016.

Recently, President Prabowo Subianto declared Indonesia’s commitment to achieving 100% renewable energy within the next 10 years. Last year, he also expressed optimism that Indonesia would achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This is a positive policy statement and sends a strong signal regarding the direction of Indonesia’s climate policy and energy transition—one that we warmly welcome.

This year, Indonesia will update its climate strategy and commitments for the 2031–2035 period through the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 3.0 document—or, for Indonesia, the Second NDC. In accordance with the Paris Agreement, the NDC is updated every five years, with more ambitious targets than the previous NDC. The NDC reflects the future direction of Indonesia’s national development.

Through the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit 2025, we call on and propose that all levels of the Indonesian government set more ambitious, science-based climate targets aligned with 1.5°C.

Concretely, we encourage the target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and a national emission target of 6% by 2030 and 21% by 2035 below 2019 levels (excluding absorption and/or emissions from the forestry and land use sector [FOLU]). This commitment must be based on the principle of fair share and developed in a transparent and accountable manner. This commitment must also be supported by credible and actionable sectoral planning, appropriate implementation, and improvements to the financial ecosystem that support the decarbonization of all economic sectors. In line with this, international climate assistance, both financial and technical, is essential.

Indonesia has all the assets to lead: a wealth of natural resources worth protecting, vast sources of clean and renewable energy, a strategic position, diplomatic strength, and a demographic bonus of young people eager for change. However, leadership doesn’t come automatically. It must be built on strategic vision and bold decisions.

Amidst a turbulent world—from wars and energy crises to food crises to widespread disinformation—the climate crisis continues to worsen. Unfortunately, the world’s attention is increasingly scattered. We live in an era of great distraction, where commitment to the future is often eclipsed by the frenzy of short-term interests.

However, it is precisely amidst these distractions that we are being tested. Can Indonesia stay focused? Are we bold enough to lead?

No economy grows on Earth without dying. Strong climate targets can be a driving force for inclusive economic growth and promote social justice for all Indonesians. Climate responsibility is not an obstacle to development. On the contrary, it is a 21st-century opportunity and a means to achieving the Vision of a Golden Indonesia 2045.

Data from the 2021 Low Carbon Development Initiative document from the Indonesian National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas RI) states that in the energy sector, a firm commitment and implementation of renewable energy could create nearly 5 million new jobs in the solar energy sector and up to 11 million jobs in the energy sector overall. The world is now entering a clean energy boom, which is expected to reach a value of over USD 2 trillion annually by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Since 2022, global investment in clean energy has surpassed investment in fossil fuels and continues to increase. Furthermore, according to Bappenas RI’s 2021 LCDI data, in the FOLU sector, establishing an ambitious net-zero emission target could generate economic benefits of USD 1.5 trillion by 2045.

According to the Ministry of Finance, Indonesia needs approximately IDR 4,000 trillion to fund climate action. A strong climate commitment in the Second National Development Planning (NDC) will be an important signal that Indonesia is serious and capable, not only of addressing the climate crisis but also of strengthening its economic competitiveness globally. This strong signal of commitment can also attract green investment and future climate financing commitments.

It is time for a just transition to a low-emission, climate-resilient economy to become a key pillar of economic security, food security, energy security, and the creation of millions of green jobs. It is time for the protection and preservation of forests and oceans to be seen not as a burden on development, but as an opportunity and strategic strength for Indonesia on the global stage. And it is time to make climate diplomacy a key anchor of Indonesian foreign policy, not merely as a result of international pressure, but as an implementation of the constitutional mandate of the 1945 Constitution, and an expression of our strategic national interests and global responsibility to current and future generations.

We must also be honest with ourselves: without a paradigm shift, without cross-sectoral policy reform, and without strong political will, Indonesia will not be able to face the pressures and growing impacts of the climate crisis in the coming decades.

Therefore, we propose that net-zero should not only be a government target, but a collective vision for the entire Indonesian nation. Net-zero must become an economic, political, and development agenda, as well as a source of national pride.

Finally, we need climate nationalism—where love for the nation is manifested through protection of the environment and the future of future generations. We are confident and optimistic that Indonesia can be a role model in realizing this needed climate nationalism. Amidst intertwined global crises, our nationalism today is not just about sovereignty, but also about the courage to protect the earth on which we stand and the future of future generations.

Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.
Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.","Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to slow federal funding for building electric vehicle chargers across the country, the number of ports is growing, although rural areas are seeing less investment, per data from the EV charging data analytics firm Paren shared with The Daily Yonder.

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have “make-ready” incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that’s needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual report released in May. The report projects that the number of EVs on the road is expected to continue growing in the U.S. in 2025 and beyond, despite current political and trade headwinds imposed by the Trump administration.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/07/25/tdy-mapping-fast-ev-ports-01.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 09:00:13.542492

India has set the target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with solar energy being a large part of it.","The world is getting warmer, and developments like record-breaking heatwaves to devastating floods prove that climate change is a pressing concern. The solution everyone’s talking about is net-zero emissions, but what does that actually mean?

Net zero means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere with the amount we remove from it. The goal is to reach this balance by 2050 to prevent dangerous climate change. The global net zero targets to accomplish by 2050 is to keep global warming below 1.5°C. This may sound simple but this is a big challenge. Now, this is where solar energy comes in, one of the most viable tools to deal with this challenge.

The Reality of Global Emissions

According to Climate Trace, global greenhouse gas emissions for February 2025 reached 5.04 billion tonnes CO2e. Energy-related CO2 emissions reached an all-time high of 37.8 Gt CO2 in 2024, which is an 0.8% increase from the previous year.

This is not about numbers, it’s about the fundamental systems that power our world. The energy sector drives three-quarters of all global greenhouse gas emissions. The story these numbers tell is clear, we’re not just missing our climate targets, we’re moving further away from them.

A challenge like this also creates opportunities and that’s exactly what’s happening with renewable energy, particularly in India.

India’s Renewable Energy Revolution

India is writing one of the world’s most impressive renewable energy stories. The country now has 226.9 GW of renewable energy capacity as of June 2025, and the pace of growth is accelerating. In 2025 alone, India has reached 110.9 GW of solar capacity which is more than many other countries.

What makes this transformation remarkable is how quickly we’ve scaled our clean energy ecosystem. A decade ago, this wouldn’t have been possible but today, it is part of our reality. Non-fossil-based sources now generate 49% of India’s total power installed capacity, and these numbers are growing. The country is on its way to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

One of the key reasons solar power is at the forefront of India’s clean energy transition is its increasing cost-effectiveness. States like Rajasthan and Gujarat have already demonstrated how large-scale solar development can drive both environmental and economic progress by building massive solar parks and generating thousands of jobs. Madhya Pradesh is also emerging as a strategic player in this shift, with several operational solar parks and many more in the pipeline. Upcoming manufacturing initiatives, including GREW Solar’s solar cell facility, will further strengthen the state’s position in India’s renewable energy ecosystem.

The transition to solar energy is not just about replacing coal plants, it’s also about building energy security, reducing import dependence to strengthen our clean energy ecosystem.

How Solar Energy Drives Net-Zero Goals

Solar energy helps with the climate problem in multiple ways. One of the most direct ways is replacing fossil fuels with solar for energy production as it reduces carbon emissions. What makes solar even more beneficial is its energy production efficiency. A single solar panel produces about 20 times more energy during its lifetime than was needed to manufacture it.

But solar is not just one of the cleanest ways to produce energy, it’s also affordable. Solar costs less than coal or gas making it an attractive option for businesses. This makes choosing solar the natural choice rather than being policy-driven.

Solar is also being used to power a whole network of clean technologies. Battery systems can store solar energy for use at night or during cloudy days. Solar-powered facilities can split water molecules to create green hydrogen, which can then decarbonize heavy industries like steel and cement production. Electric vehicles charged with solar power complete the clean energy circle, creating transportation with zero emissions from start to finish.

As more solar projects get built, manufacturers produce more panels, it drives down the costs of solar further. Lower costs lead to more installations, which creates more manufacturing demand, and this improves technology and reduces costs even more. This cycle then keeps on driving solar energy’s growth

The Challenges We Still Face

Despite all this progress, solar energy growth has its challenges. One of the technical challenges is grid integration. Solar power produces electricity only when the sun is out, this is why we need better energy storage systems and smarter grid planning that can help balance supply and demand in real-time.

The other challenge is the financial aspect. While solar panel costs have reduced, large-scale projects require huge capital. This is one of the main reasons so many developing countries struggle to get financing for renewable energy projects.

Supply chain issues are another complex challenge. Solar panels need specific materials and manufacturing processes. Since most of the production is concentrated in a few countries, this creates a problem. One of the solutions is to build more resilient, distributed supply chains that help scale solar globally.

Land use is another complication. Utility-scale solar projects need significant land areas which can create issues for agriculture or conservation needs. However, innovative solutions like agrivoltaics combine solar panels with farming, setting an example for how we can address multiple needs together.

GREW Solar’s Role in the Net-Zero Journey

Solar energy is one of the ways to combat climate change issues and it is the foundation of our clean energy future. It is technologically advanced, economical and has an accelerating growth rate, making it one of the best clean energy sources.

At GREW Solar, we’re proud to be part of this transformation. Our plans to scale to 10.0 GW of solar module manufacturing and 6.0 GW of cell manufacturing by 2026 are targets that will contribute to India’s net-zero goals. Every module manufactured with sustainable manufacturing practices helps in making the clean energy transition cleaner.

The path to achieving the net-zero goals that our country has set will require a joint cooperation between industries, governments, and the people. With solar energy, we can build a better, more prosperous future for everyone.

FAQs

How do solar panels contribute to net zero?

Solar panels help with net zero goals by replacing electricity that would normally come from fossil fuels. When solar panels generate power it means less greenhouse gas emissions. Over their lifespan, solar panels prevent far more emissions than were created during their manufacturing.

What is the goal of solar energy?

The main goal of solar energy is to provide clean energy by replacing fossil fuels as our primary energy source while reducing air pollution. It also helps bring solar power to areas that don’t have electricity and creates job opportunities in the clean energy sector.

What is the goal of net zero?

Net zero means balancing the amount of greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere with the amount we remove from it to prevent climate change from getting worse. To achieve this will require cutting emissions while also removing carbon from the air through forests and clean technology.

What is India’s new goal for solar energy capacity by 2030?

India has set the target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with solar energy being a large part of it. This goal is part of India’s sustainability commitment to reduce its carbon footprint.",https://thegrewsolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Grew_blog.png,N,,2025-07-26 07:59:40.848624

This LawFlash breaks down how the bill may affect financing strategy and compliance planning for the nuclear industry.

Tax incentives available to the nuclear industry fared relatively well in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. Though the bill significantly impacts the future of renewable energy tax incentives enacted and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA), which we discuss in detail in our broader Lawflash about the bill, nuclear avoided the most impactful cuts.

Earlier versions of the bill threatened a more significant scaling back of the IRA-era tax incentives available to the nuclear industry. For example, the draft passed in the US House of Representatives on May 22, 2025 provided for a highly accelerated sunsetting of nuclear-related tax credits and the sale thereof. Furthermore, the version released by the US Senate Finance Committee on June 16, 2025 denied production tax credits available to the existing nuclear fleet if they used nuclear fuel imported from Russia or China.

While these steeper cuts and additional limitations were removed in the final version of the bill, there are important new opportunities, limitations, and changes to nuclear industry-related tax incentives to be aware of, which we describe below.

WHAT ‘SURVIVED’

The zero-emission nuclear power production credit under Section 45U (the Nuclear PTC), which we discussed in more detail in a previous LawFlash, was mostly left unchanged by the bill. However, the Nuclear PTC is now subject, along with most other surviving IRA-era tax credits, to broad “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules, discussed briefly below. The Nuclear PTC is not, however, subject to the much broader “effective control” and “material assistance” provisions under the FEOC rules.

The technology-neutral clean electricity production and investment tax credits under Code Sections 45Y and 48E (the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC), respectively, remain generally available to new nuclear facilities that “begin construction” prior to 2034 before phasing out over three years. The bill also added a new 10% “adder” for nuclear facilities that are located in “nuclear energy communities.” The Clean Electricity PTC and ITC are, however, now subject to the broad FEOC rules discussed below.

The ability to sell IRA-era tax credits under Code Section 6418 was left mostly untouched, as the bill focused on changes to the underlying tax credits themselves rather than the transferability thereof. However, the bill did add a prohibition on transferring credits to “specified foreign entities.”

WHAT CHANGED

Opportunities

The bill added a new bonus credit incentive, or “adder,” with respect to the Clean Electricity PTC under Code Section 45Y for “advanced nuclear facilities” located in “nuclear energy communities.” Qualification for the nuclear energy community adder increases a facility’s otherwise applicable PTC rate by 10% (or two percentage points if the facility does not satisfy a separate prevailing wage and apprenticeship standard). The adder for advanced nuclear facilities is not available to the Clean Electricity ITC.

For these purposes:

A “nuclear energy community” is any metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that has, or any time since 2010 has had, 0.17% direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power, including through a number of proscribed industries, such as advanced nuclear facilities, advanced nuclear power research and development (R&D), and the manufacture or assembly of advanced nuclear facility components. It is anticipated that the Internal Revenue Service and the US Department of Energy will release an approved list of nuclear energy communities, as they have done for other “energy community” designations.

An “advanced nuclear facility” is defined as any nuclear facility the reactor design for which was or is approved by the NRC after 1993 as described in Code Section 45J(d)(2) (a standalone tax credit available for energy production from advanced nuclear power facilities). However, this designation appears to be available beyond just “advanced nuclear facilities” because it is deemed satisfied if the NRC authorizes construction by issuing a site-specific construction permit or combined license with respect to a nuclear facility, regardless of when the design of such facility was approved.

The bill allows companies that generate electricity from “advanced nuclear facilities” (as discussed above, without the exception noted for NRC-authorized construction) to be structured as master limited partnerships (MLP) starting in 2026. The shares of an MLP are publicly traded, but it faces only one level of federal income tax.

PITFALLS

Under prior law, the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC were set to begin sunsetting starting the later-of (1) 2034 and (2) two years following the calendar year in which annual US greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production dropped by 75% as compared to 2022. The bill removed the second prong, such that the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC begin to sunset in 2034.

The bill added an FEOC regime as a restriction on claiming most IRA-era tax credits, including the Nuclear PTC and the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC. These include both project- and company-level restrictions.

A fulsome discussion of the new FEOC regime is beyond the scope of this LawFlash. At a (very) high level:

“Specified foreign entities” (SFEs)—which are very generally a wide range of persons and entities with ties to China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran—are ineligible to claim both to the Nuclear PTC and the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC. Furthermore, taxpayers not compliant with certain ownership or control restrictions with respect to SFEs are deemed “foreign influenced entities” (FIEs) and are also denied such credits. However, the more onerous “effective control” provisions of these rules do not apply to the Nuclear PTC.

Qualified facilities that receive “material assistance” from SFEs and FIEs are ineligible to receive the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC. Material assistance is determined using a cost-based formula measuring the portion of direct project or component costs that is sourced from SFEs and FIEs. The “material assistance” threshold increases over time, effectively applying greater limitations on SFE- and FIE-sourced components for projects that begin construction in successive years.

Nuclear facilities hoping to utilize the Nuclear PTC or Clean Electricity PTC and ITC will need to navigate these FEOC rules carefully to ensure they are eligible for the tax credits. This will involve a focus on both taxpayer-level and project-level ownership and capitalization, as well as project-level sourcing, contracting, and documentation.

Complicated transition rules apply to the new FEOC provisions. However, new nuclear projects are unlikely to be able to take advantage of any grandfathering given how quickly the new FEOC rules become fully effective (mostly by 2026).

WHAT TO KEEP AN EYE ON

As noted above, the sunsetting of the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC depends on when a project “begins construction.” Guidance relating to when a project has “begun construction” has played a large role in the renewable energy industry for more than a decade, as such standards have dictated various tax credit deadlines and grandfathering rules.

Such “begun construction” guidance is likely to be impacted by the July 7, 2025 executive order issued by President Trump (the EO), which directs the secretary of the US Department of the Treasury to take action, within 45 days, “to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.”

The EO goes on to state that such efforts are to include “issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Though the EO focuses on the application of the begun construction guidance to the wind and solar industries, it is unclear whether such a narrow focus of the EO will mean that a different “begun construction” standard will apply to other technologies. New guidance could be released as soon as mid-August.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9266_0649.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 08:00:29.469873

“America is energy dominant and an AI powerhouse, and Grain Belt Express will be America’s largest power pipeline”, Grain Belt Express said.
“The Grain Belt Express transmission line is a critical energy security project, supported by a broad, multi-state coalition of stakeholders”, stated the letter, shared on Grain Belt Express’ website.
Grain Belt Express made it into the Dashboard under the Briden government on February 20, 2024.
Rigzone emailed comment requests to Invenergy and Grain Belt Express about Bailey’s threat to have the project junked.","The Department of Energy (DOE) has terminated a conditional award of up to $4.9 billion in loan guarantee for phase I of the proposed Grain Belt Express, a two-phase transmission line project that would span Kansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.

The cancellation stems from a review of agreements signed by the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) during the last weeks of the Biden administration.

“After a thorough review of the project’s financials, DOE found that the conditions necessary to issue the guarantee are unlikely to be met and it is not critical for the federal government to have a role in supporting this project”, the DOE said in a statement online.

“DOE is conducting a review of every applicant and borrower - including the nearly $100 billion in closed loans and conditional commitments LPO made between Election Day 2024 to Inauguration Day 2025 - to ensure every single taxpayer dollar is being used to advance the best interest of the American people”, the DOE added.

“This ongoing review positions LPO to move forward with a lower risk tolerance in lending practices and an uncompromising focus on expanding access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people.

“DOE remains focused on advancing projects that expand American energy dominance and deliver on President Trump’s commitment to lower energy prices for the American people”.

Grain Belt Express LLC, owned by Chicago, Illinois-based Invenergy LLC, indicated in a statement the project would push through with private funding.

“America is energy dominant and an AI powerhouse, and Grain Belt Express will be America’s largest power pipeline”, Grain Belt Express said. “While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee [cancellation], a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs”.

On July 11 Grain Belt Express vice president Jim Shield wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright urging the DOE to proceed to financial close amid attacks by Missouri Attorney-General Andrew Bailey and Senator Josh Hawley. Shield told Wright conditions in the conditional commitment had been met.

“The Grain Belt Express transmission line is a critical energy security project, supported by a broad, multi-state coalition of stakeholders”, stated the letter, shared on Grain Belt Express’ website.

“It is an open-access line that will deliver all forms of American energy based on customer demand and available market power, enhancing the ability of the largest grid operators to share power, including from generators directed to operate under DOE’s 202(c) authority”, the letter added.

“This 800-mile power pipeline is capable of delivering four nuclear power plants’ worth of electricity. It is the highest capacity and second longest line in U.S. history.

“By connecting four U.S. grid regions - also a historic first - the Grain Belt Express will deliver cost savings and strengthen reliability for 29 states and DC, more than 40 percent of Americans, and 25 percent of Department of Defense installations”.

The project obtained certificates of “public convenience and necessity” from Kansas and Missouri in 2019, Illinois in 2023 and Indiana in 2013.

According to the government’s online Permitting Dashboard, the environmental review and permitting process for phase I is expected April 2026. Enlistment on the Dashboard gives a project the benefits of transparency and efficiency under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). Grain Belt Express made it into the Dashboard under the Briden government on February 20, 2024.

On May 7, 2025, Grain Belt Express said it had awarded $1.7-billion contracts to Quanta Services and Kiewit Energy Group Inc. Construction is expected to start next year, it said then.

In response to the DOE’s cancellation of support, the office of Bailey, the Missouri attorney-general, said in a statement the project is “a multi-billion-dollar green energy scam that threatened Missouri’s farmers, landowners, and rural communities”.

“If Invenergy still intends to force this project on unwilling landowners, we will continue to fight every step of the way”, Bailey said.

Rigzone emailed comment requests to Invenergy and Grain Belt Express about Bailey’s threat to have the project junked.

Separately, Hawley, a Republican senator for Missouri, also claimed victory, saying it was he who had secured a pledge from Wright to “halt” the project. Hawley has also accused the project of land grabbing.

In the letter to Wright, Shield, the Grain Belt Express vice president, said, “Senator Hawley and AG Bailey have pursued an unwarranted and unhinged crusade against the Grain Belt Express through media attacks and letters to you seeking rescission of the Grain Belt Express’ conditionally approved DOE loan guarantee, as well as AG Bailey’s own separate consumer protection investigation and request to the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) to reopen its Grain Belt approval”.

“Recent false accusations from Senator Hawley and AG Bailey saying that the Grain Belt Express will cost America billions instead of saving us billions, whether mistaken or purposefully declared, are misleading at best”, Shield added.

“The questions raised by AG Bailey were all considered and decided by the MPSC through a long and rigorous regulatory process that started in August of 2022 and appealed to exhaustion in the Missouri courts reaching finality on April 28, 2025”.

Missouri Farm Bureau president Garrett Hawkins said in a statement about the DOE cancellation, “This move demonstrates a long-overdue recognition of the voices of rural communities who have consistently and clearly expressed their deep concerns about the project’s impact on their land, livelihoods, and private property rights”.

In support of the project, environmental watchdog Sierra Club said of the DOE decision, “Missouri is a coal-dependent state, in the midst of a transition to cleaner sources of power. The Grain Belt transmission line would deliver 2.5 gigawatts of around-the-clock electricity - mostly from wind - to Missouri in the first phase of the project”.

“The project would provide options to Missouri towns for where they can buy power if looking for cheaper and cleaner electricity”, Sierra Club added.

Gretchen Waddell-Barwick, director of Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter, said the project “played by the rules, received multiple state approvals, and withstood legal challenges”.

Offshore Wind - City Limits,"Max Micallef, Jeanmarie Evelly",,,,,https://citylimits.org/opinion-nys-solution-to-heat-waves-polluted-air-offshore-wind/,"For decades, air pollution from the fossil fuels to power our homes has contributed to rates of asthma and lung disease all across the city.
One of the most powerful is offshore wind.
Because offshore wind uses free fuel, it offers long-term price stability, even during extreme weather.
Offshore wind delivers all three, and the time to act is now.
Max Micallef is the New York State advocacy manager of clean air initiatives at the at the American Lung Association.","“We don’t have to choose between reliability and affordability on one side, and public health protections on the other. Offshore wind delivers all three, and the time to act is now.”

As extreme weather grips the nation in early summer, New York has seen heatwaves breaking a 137-year-old record and record rain.

This is just a preview of what’s expected to be one of the hottest seasons on record, leaving many New Yorkers sweltering, short of breath, and struggling to stay safe. Our bodies, especially our lungs, are being pushed to the limit as climate-driven heat and pollution continue to rise.

In the face of soaring temperatures, many people crank up their air conditioning to stay cool and protect their health. Ironically, this short-term, necessary solution is making the problem worse.

In most homes and workplaces, those AC units rely heavily on fossil fuels, the same fuels responsible for overheating our planet in the first place. The result? A vicious cycle where more heat means more energy use, more air pollution, and even hotter conditions, particularly in low-income neighborhoods already burdened by environmental and health inequities.

Even before this latest heatwave, our communities have been facing a crisis. For decades, air pollution from the fossil fuels to power our homes has contributed to rates of asthma and lung disease all across the city. Now, with the Trump administration actively working to roll back environmental protections, the urgency is even greater. New York must step up, not just with words, but with concrete solutions we can build and scale right here at home.

This March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would rollback several air quality regulations around power plants, such as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This also includes clean cars and truck rules that limit tailpipe emissions.

These rollbacks mean increased toxins such as mercury, which can cause neurological damage, particularly in children, and pollution linked to asthma, lung cancer, and heart conditions, released into our air by fossil fuel power plants and heavy-duty vehicles.

Burning fossil fuels to produce energy has created a public health crisis in New York, across the nation, and around the world. Here at home, the pollutants released into our air have contributed to asthma attacks and lung disease, putting lives at risk and increasing healthcare costs for everyday New Yorkers.

This year, the American Lung Association gave over 11 New York counties a grade of C or below for air quality in its annual “State of the Air Report.” As of 2021, over 315,000 children and 1.3 million adults in the state were living with asthma, which is directly impacted by environmental conditions like air pollution. These health emergencies are preventable and the costs are hitting families where it hurts most: their health and their wallets.

It doesn’t have to be this way. We have solutions, right now, that can break the cycle, clean up our air, and deliver reliable, affordable energy. One of the most powerful is offshore wind. And the best part is that we’re building it just off New York’s coast, creating a clean energy supply while supporting a smooth transition to green jobs and strengthening our state’s economy.

Right now, South Fork Wind Farm, 35 miles east of Montauk Point, is powering 70,000 homes with clean, pollution-free energy at the same rate as fossil fuels. Because offshore wind uses free fuel, it offers long-term price stability, even during extreme weather. Once the upfront cost of building turbines is covered, this renewable energy source becomes affordable, stable, and resilient.

More offshore wind projects are actively under construction, and once completed, they’ll provide over a million homes with clean, affordable, reliable energy throughout New York. If the state meets its goal of producing 9 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2035, that would bring $34 billion in capital investment, create thousands of jobs up and down state, and provide enough pollution-free energy to power 5 million homes.

Without this transition, New Yorkers will continue to pay the price both in rising electric bills and worsening public health. It’s time for our state government to clean up our act, and our air.

We don’t have to choose between reliability and affordability on one side, and public health protections on the other. Offshore wind delivers all three, and the time to act is now.

""When it does ignite, it will burn extremely hot, extremely intense,"" explained Aurora Fire Rescue Firefighter and Paramedic Paul Shoemaker.

That, added to some already allocated funds, means the department will be able to buy five more EV blankets.","When an electric vehicle catches on fire, it's an especially dangerous situation for everyone, including firefighters. But thanks to a grant, Aurora Fire Rescue has access to more resources to help fight EV fires.

""When it does ignite, it will burn extremely hot, extremely intense,"" explained Aurora Fire Rescue Firefighter and Paramedic Paul Shoemaker. ""There could be up to 35, maybe even 40 different types of gases that come off of these, and all of them are very toxic to the respiratory system for the firefighters and to the bystanders that would be standing around these vehicles.""

He is an expert on EV fires, and he says fighting them is tricky and sometimes not possible, like in the case of a deadly crash earlier this year. A Tesla caught fire after a high-speed collision, but all Aurora Fire could do was let it burn out.

That didn't sit well with them, so they bought a special blanket they can use to help them contain an electric vehicle fire if they ever have one again. Shoemaker said they recognized the blanket's benefit to the citizens of Aurora.

But Aurora is Colorado's third largest city, and the blanket can only be used once. So, they decided to apply for money to get more.

The E-470 safety foundation has an annual grant that it gives out to the community. This year, they gave Aurora Fire Rescue $2,500 to buy more EV blankets. That, added to some already allocated funds, means the department will be able to buy five more EV blankets. One for each Battalion Chief.

""We really strive to have a safe roadway. And so, I think it's very important that the first responders are equipped,"" said Joe Donahue, Executive Director of E470 Public Highway Authority.

If there were ever an EV fire on E470 in Aurora, Aurora Fire Rescue would respond, and they say that this grant and the blankets they will buy with the money will keep citizens safe everywhere in the city and on the tollway.

""Out on 470, we don't have a water supply. This is going to allow us to put them over the top of the car, delay that chemical reaction, get the fire apparatus on scene and be able to apply water to it and rapidly cool it down,"" said Shoemaker.

E470 says all the money they give out is raised. None of it comes from tolls.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/26/bfd21c76-be2e-4028-8cc1-ef9dbe5fcc4d/thumbnail/1200x630/f0127ef193df2ad021afba80b1ad64e8/e470-e-blanket-5pkg-frame-1474.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 14:04:20.514857

And frankly, a lot of what we’ve done is to go backwards on providing this electricity that is of need and is good for the planet.” AI data centers demand high rates of electricity.
But Beth Daley, executive editor and general manager of The Conversation, U.S., said she’s also concerned about the financial costs to residents living near the energy-guzzling data centers.","Executive orders have stalled the development of offshore wind farms. A federal tax credit for electric vehicles is set to end. And a reported $22 billion in clean-energy projects have been canceled so far this year.

President Donald Trump and his administration have firmly pushed back against momentum once felt in the renewable energy industry. But one form of eco-friendly energy has continued a steady rise across the country and the world: solar power.

Environmental activist Bill McKibben wrote recently in the New Yorker that “solar power is now growing faster than any power source in history.” However, the federal government’s reluctance to lean in toward clean energy means other countries, like China, are positioned to lead the way instead.

That’s a major policy misstep, according to Dr. Gaurab Basu, a physician and assistant professor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

“An energy transformation is happening around the world, and if we want to have affordable, abundant, clean energy, it’s here for the taking,” said Basu. “With the demand for electricity now with AI and with electrification, we need a lot more electricity. And frankly, a lot of what we’ve done is to go backwards on providing this electricity that is of need and is good for the planet.”

AI data centers demand high rates of electricity. They also drain resources from local communities. But Beth Daley, executive editor and general manager of The Conversation, U.S., said she’s also concerned about the financial costs to residents living near the energy-guzzling data centers.

“Currently, the way utilities charge customers, they share the costs among the public,” Daley said. “If state regulators are going to allow utilities to follow this normal way of splitting the cost of new infrastructure among all its consumers, the public is going to have to wind up paying to supply data centers with all that power. Now, do they get something out of it? Sure, we’re all using AI, too — but you can make the argument that Meta is actually getting more out of it than the customers in a particular geographic location.”

Basu said he’s also thinking about how to mitigate the long-term concerns he has about AI data centers. He compares the public’s eagerness to embrace AI to disruptive technologies like the internet and social media, and the need to define rules and boundaries.

“How do we make sure we create the right safeguards and optimize the value and minimize the harm? We are not doing appropriate accounting,” Dr. Basu said. “How much water will it take actually? The equipment warms up so much that they have to put it in water to keep it cool; it’s an extraordinary amount of resources. I think thoughtfulness and being careful and really being averse to some of the harms here is really important.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has shut down the Environmental Protection Agency’s research arm, the Office of Research and Development. Daley said this move will have far-reaching consequences for all Americans.

“They analyze the dangers posed by toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, drinking water pollutants, watershed destruction – you name it. They also issued grants that funded universities and private companies to work on them for solutions. It’s a big loss,” Daley said. “I don’t think we’re going to see rivers on fire again. I think we’re going to see some big increases in pollution and harm to people because our eyes aren’t on the prize.”

The Tesla Electric + Sunrun Flex plan offers fixed electricity rates and some of the most competitive compensation for excess solar energy returned to the grid. This integrated approach aligns solar production and battery storage with retail energy pricing to maximize savings, streamline management, and provide advanced backup power during outages—a feature that has become increasingly important in Texas due to severe weather and frequent grid disruptions.

“By pairing Tesla’s retail energy plan with Sunrun Flex, we’re creating the most comprehensive home energy solution on the market,” said Mary Powell, CEO of Sunrun. “Our partnership puts customers first by combining expertise in solar and storage with seamless backup and cost predictability.”

Tackling Texas’ Complex Energy Market

Texas homeowners face a challenging retail energy landscape, with over 100 providers offering varying rates and plans that are rarely optimized for solar systems. The Tesla Electric + Sunrun Flex plan aims to simplify this complexity. Tesla manages battery settings and solar crediting, ensuring customers achieve the highest possible value from their solar energy while enjoying rollover credits for unused power.

Enhanced Backup and Virtual Power Plant Access

Every Sunrun Flex system is paired with Tesla’s Powerwall battery, providing homeowners with reliable backup power during outages. Powerwall units can also participate in Tesla’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP), where connected homes share excess energy to help stabilize the grid and meet demand spikes.

“With Tesla Electric, we’re building energy plans that unlock the full potential of home solar and storage,” said Colby Hastings, Director of Residential Energy at Tesla. “This partnership offers Texans optimized rates, reliable backup power, and a smart way to support grid stability.”",https://i0.wp.com/driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Powerwall-and-Solar.jpg?fit=1000%2C770&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-26 13:06:28.333851

The No. 1 US EV maker on Wednesday released a Q2 earnings report that again showed significant financial impacts amid cooling EV demand and backlash to CEO Elon Musk’s foray into right-wing politics.

The EV maker reported $1.2 billion in net income, down 16% YoY. Automotive revenues fell 16%, as well, while overall revenue was down 12%.

In an update for investors, the company attributed its falling profits to lower revenue from regulatory credits Tesla sells to other automakers, an increase in operating expenses, and a decline in vehicle deliveries, among other factors. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries fell 13% YoY in Q2.

As The Verge noted, Tesla is likely to see its revenue from regulatory credit sales largely go away, thanks to a Trump administration plan to cancel fines for automakers that exceed fuel-efficiency goals.

Investment research firm CFRA lowered its 12-month price target for Tesla shares by $20 to $300, and maintained its hold opinion.

Tesla’s earnings call “confirmed many of the concerns we had raised regarding the Tesla story, with management stating that the recently passed tax bill is going to have a material impact on its business,” Garrett Nelson, VP and senior equity analyst at CFRA, wrote in a research note. “We continue to view the near-term challenges facing the company as underappreciated by investors.”

Looking ahead: Tesla executives shared updates on plans to start volume production of a new, much-anticipated affordable EV model in the second half of this year, as well as on the planned expansion of its robotaxi service.

Musk has put Tesla’s robotaxi business and humanoid robots at the center of the company’s growth plans. Tesla debuted a limited robotaxi service with human safety operators in the vehicles in Austin last month, and is working to expand it in other markets in the near future.

“We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two,” Musk said on Tesla’s earnings call. “We are getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places.”

He predicted that Tesla will offer robotaxi services “in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year.”

In a statement, Will Rhind, founder and CEO of investment firm GraniteShares, said that Tesla’s “slow progress on the low-cost EV model and the robotaxi business is a little surprising.”

“The company indicating that it will ramp up production starting later this year is encouraging, but the lack of structure and detail around what these initiatives will look like makes me cautious,” he added.

Musk, noting the upcoming expiration of EV tax credits that has analysts widely predicting slower EV adoption, acknowledged that Tesla could be in for “a few rough quarters” ahead.

GM: Meanwhile, General Motors on Tuesday reported Q2 net income of $1.9 billion on revenue of $47.1 billion, down 35.4% and 1.8% YoY, respectively. The automaker maintained its full-year guidance.

The results reflected a $1.1 billion hit GM took as a result of tariffs. GM executives expect the impact to be even greater in Q3, Reuters reported.

Amid the changes in trade policy, GM in June announced $4 billion in investments in its US assembly plants. “This will help us satisfy unmet customer demand, greatly reduce our tariff exposure, and capture upside opportunities as we launch new models,” CEO Mary Barra wrote in a letter to shareholders.

Though Barra said that GM now sees a “longer runway” for internal combustion engine vehicles, she reiterated the automaker’s plans to push ahead on electrification.

“Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our north star,” Barra said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/363f7bf85484518549db25cc10ca2d0c10259348-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-26 01:58:49.429658

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a press release Thursday.
The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.
However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The U.S. Department of Energy selected four sites for AI data center and energy generation projects to help the Trump Administration accelerate the development of AI infrastructure.

Oak Ridge Reservations, Idaho National Lab, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and Savannah River Site were all selected. They're expected to invite private sector partners in to develop the projects.

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a press release Thursday. “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs.”

The DOE said it received enormous interest in response to its April request for information which helped the department decide which sites to choose. Details regarding project scope, eligibility requirements and submission guidelines at each site are expected to be released in the coming months. Private sector partners could be selected by the end of the year.

Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn took to X to praise the announcement.

""I’m thrilled to learn @ENERGY chose Tennessee for new large-scale data centers, and I look forward to seeing all the advancements made in the Volunteer State,"" Blackburn wrote.

The announcement follows the White House's release of the “AI Action Plan,” vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The ""AI Action Plan"" says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

Most of us are familiar with the bullet points version of OBBB: a permanent extension of tax cuts for individuals, a temporary elimination of the tax on tips and overtime, reductions to Medicaid and a $3.3 trillion increase in the national debt.

Other bullet points will get fleshed out, ex post facto, following hastycongressional approvaljust before the July 4 holiday. Maybe you do have to pass it to know what’s in it.

Take electric vehicles, for example. The final version of OBBB ends the tax credit that props up EV sales in this country. Those credits expire Sept. 30.

On this aspect of the legislation, Congress got it right. If EVs are too expensive, then automakers need to figure out a way to make them less expensive. This doesn’t happen with subsidized or protected industries, which tend to lack innovation and produce high-end prestige products that lack mass appeal.

If it was U.S. government policy to subsidize the very first cell phones or flat-screen TVs, would they have gotten smaller, cheaper and better? Or would you still need two strong movers to carry the TV up the stairs?

The Biden administration never understood this. Its policy was to offer tax credits and subsidies for a market that wasn’t there. All those unused charging stations serve as an appropriate legacy for this policy.

If the previous administration wanted to make EVs more widely available, it should have reduced rather than increased the tariff on Chinese electric cars. This would have flooded the market with cheaper EVs and forced domestic automakers to respond.

But it was never about getting more EVs on the road. It was about appeasing the environmental lobby and building favor with unions. As the 2024 election showed, the second part of that bet failed when Trump carried the Rust Belt. Rank-and-file automakers were always distrustful of EVs.

If anything, OBBB didn’t go far enough in taking the training wheels off of EVs.

U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Tarkio, pushed for language in the House version that would have added a $250 annual registration fee on EVs to support the Federal Highway Trust Fund.

The fee did not survive in the Senate’s version of the bill, but this is an idea worth reconsidering. EVs use the same roads as gas-powered vehicles, but EV drivers do not pay a fuel tax to support the Highway Trust Fund, which is experiencing a shortfall.

It’s time to end the free ride for EVs.",https://newspressnow.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/edmunds-electric-hybrid-cars-market-share.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 01:58:57.286470

In addition to GM, Redwood Materials is working with Toyota, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars on battery recycling initiatives in the U.S.
Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by Straubel.
In February 2023, Redwood Materials received a $2 billion loan commitment from the Department of Energy to expand battery materials recycling to support the growing EV market in the U.S.","Dive Brief:

General Motors and battery recycler Redwood Materials have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to accelerate the deployment of stationary energy storage systems built using both new modules and second-life batteries from the automaker’s electric vehicles, according to a July 16 press release.

The plans are part of a new business unit launched by Redwood Materials in June named Redwood Energy that’s focused on assembling and deploying low-cost stationary energy-storage systems to help meet growing power demands of AI data centers and other applications.

“Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate,” Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said in the release. “To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home.”

Dive Insight:

Redwood Materials plans to establish a domestic supply chain to manufacture batteries to support energy storage applications via its Redwood Energy unit.

The company currently repurposes around 20 gigawatt hours of batteries annually, which is the equivalent of 250,000 EVs or roughly 90% of all lithium-ion batteries and battery materials currently recycled in North America, according to its website.

GM is already providing the battery recycling company with used batteries to help power what Redwood calls “the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America” at an installation in Sparks, Nevada, per the release. The electricity produced by the microgrid is being used by AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and CEO of Redwood Materials, in the release. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

According to GM’s press release, U.S. electricity demand is being driven by the increasing power demands of AI data centers. By 2028, the percentage of the national grid’s electricity used by data centers is expected to triple from 4.4% to around 12%. This creates the need for additional energy storage units to help offset power outages and reinforce the grid during peak demand or when power delivery is limited.

In May 2024, Redwood Materials announced it would recycle cathode anode materials and production scrap from GM’s Ultium Cells battery joint venture plants in Warren, Ohio, and Spring Hill, Tennessee. The recovered materials will be processed and used to produce new batteries.

In addition to GM, Redwood Materials is working with Toyota, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars on battery recycling initiatives in the U.S. The efforts are intended to make EV batteries more sustainable, as well as lessen reliance on imported critical raw materials, most of which are currently sourced from processors and refiners in China.

Last September, Redwood Materials and BMW announced plans to recycle second-life batteries from the automaker’s network of nearly 700 locations in the U.S., including dealerships and distribution centers to recover critical minerals, including nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper. Redwood aims to return 95% to 98% of these critical minerals back to the domestic battery supply chain.

Redwood Materials was founded in 2017 by Straubel. He was the co-founder of Tesla and the company’s former CTO. Straubel was nominated to Tesla’s board of directors in April 2023.

In February 2023, Redwood Materials received a $2 billion loan commitment from the Department of Energy to expand battery materials recycling to support the growing EV market in the U.S.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9CSMByThbAILofDxyjauHTiX4RrXaWkwtPtgMnXoP5E/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDctMjJfYXRfMi4wMS4xMVBNLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-26 01:59:07.150472

It also would also prevent the Trump administration from opening new public lands to drilling and mining.
However, opponents of Trump’s shift in environmental policies argue they want to highlight potential ramifications from the administration’s efforts.
“We are done letting fossil fuel executives write the rules while our communities pay the price,” Omar said in a statement on the proposed legislation.
Climate think tank C2ES found in an independent analysis that U.S. emissions will be 8 percent higher because of the new Trump law.","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other critics of the Trump administration’s environmental policies are renewing a push for legislation that would end energy subsidies that the critics say will “destroy the planet.”

The proposal, dubbed the End Polluter Welfare Act, is a revival of past environmental advocacy efforts from Sanders and others, but it adds in targeted responses to President Trump’s agenda-setting One Big, Beautiful Bill Act signed into law this month after passage by GOP majorities in the House and Senate.

“Donald Trump has sold out the young people of America and future generations,” Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nominations in 2016 and 2020, said in a statement Friday. “The fossil fuel industry, with the support of Trump, is more concerned about their short-term profits than the wellbeing of the planet.”

“No more polluter welfare for an industry that is making billions every year destroying the planet,” Sanders added.

The Hill reached out to the White House, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of the Interior for comment.

The latest progressive-driven proposal would cut more than $190 billion in federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry over the next decade, including $20 billion in bonuses designated for coal, oil, methane and pipeline companies through Trump’s massive tax and spending overhaul. It also would also prevent the Trump administration from opening new public lands to drilling and mining.

Other lawmakers who have signed onto the legislation include Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). It has more than 20 additional House backers.

“Fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their product harms the climate, but have made obscene profits while communities are left to clean up the mess,” Mahyar Sorour, a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club, said in a statement. “Taxpayers cannot afford to write a blank check to Big Oil and Gas companies through subsidies, corporate giveaways, and sweetheart deals.”

Republicans, under Trump’s tight control, hold majorities in the House and Senate, so it’s unlikely the legislation will gain much traction ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle. However, opponents of Trump’s shift in environmental policies argue they want to highlight potential ramifications from the administration’s efforts.

“We are done letting fossil fuel executives write the rules while our communities pay the price,” Omar said in a statement on the proposed legislation. “The End Polluter Welfare Act will finally hold polluters accountable and eliminate these harmful subsidies once and for all.”

The “big, beautiful bill” is projected to significantly ding the country’s efforts to reverse the effects of climate change and add more emissions that will exacerbate global warming.

BESS store electricity and release it when demand is high or when renewable sources such as solar and wind are not producing power.

Yet, as deployment accelerates, so do public concerns. Questions around fire safety, emissions, long-term environmental impacts, and community siting practices have become increasingly common.

As a neighbor to a proposed Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), it’s natural to have questions and concerns. This FAQ is designed to provide honest, fact-based answers about the environmental and safety issues that matter most to local communities.

What is a Battery & Energy Storage System (BESS)?

A BESS stores electricity in large batteries and releases it to the grid when needed. It does not generate electricity but helps ensure power is available during periods of high demand or when other sources are not contributing.

How common are fires at battery storage facilities, and how are they managed?

Fires at BESS facilities are rare but possible, primarily due to thermal runaway (overheating). According to the Electric Power Research Institute, battery-related fires remain low, even as BESS capacity has grown significantly nationwide. Texas, for example, has not experienced a BESS fire despite having more than one hundred facilities.

Modern BESS are equipped with comprehensive fire prevention and management technologies, including fire suppression, ventilation, thermal monitoring, and remote shut down protocols.

In many states, including Texas, developers are required to coordinate with emergency responders, who receive site-specific training and response plans.

Do battery fires release toxic chemicals, and can that risk be prevented or controlled near populated areas?

If a battery fire does occur, it can release toxic chemicals, including hydrogen fluoride and carbon monoxide. However a study conducted by the Fire and Risk Alliance determined that no battery fires from 2012 to now “resulted in contaminant concentrations that would pose a public health concern or require further remediation,” Facilities use remote monitoring and shutdown systems to quickly detect and limit hazards, while communicating critical information to emergency responders.

While first responders initially struggled in combatting battery fires, local departments are now better prepared to respond to any such risks, possessing specialized training, evacuation plans, and necessary equipment to protect nearby communities and contain fires before they get worse. Through studies and training programs by the U.S Fire Administration, preparedness will continue to evolve.

Setback regulations in some populated areas (e.g League City, Katy, etc.), require BESS to be 200 ft and 750 ft, respectively, away from residential areas, providing additional protection.

Are BESS safe to install near homes, schools, or neighborhoods?

When properly designed and regulated, BESS can operate safely near residential areas. Systems include safety features and emergency protocols to protect nearby residents if an incident occurs.

Do battery storage systems create noise or visual impacts in communities?

BESS systems typically produce low noise levels, comparable to the average HVAC or air conditioning unit, and are often inaudible to nearby homes.

Visually, BESS units are typically housed in container-style enclosures and secured with fencing. While such installations may sometimes stand out compared to the existing landscape, developers have been working to reduce any resulting visual disruptions, choosing neutral colors and designs that align with the local environment.

What happens during extreme weather—floods, wildfires, hurricanes? Are BESS systems stormproof?

Modern BESS are designed to withstand severe weather conditions. Facilities are anchored to concrete pads to prevent displacement during storms. In extreme heat, internal thermal management systems prevent overheating from occurring. In thunderstorms, surge protection and lightning arrestors shield batteries from damage and lightning.

What are the environmental impacts of producing batteries for BESS?

Manufacturing batteries requires raw materials and energy, and mining can have environmental impacts, including soil and water contamination and habitat destruction, if not managed responsibly. However, studies, including from MIT, indicate that while clean energy technologies require more minerals, they emit a fraction of the emissions of fossil fuel systems over their respective lifetimes.

Will a battery system reduce outages or improve energy reliability for my neighborhood?

By storing excess energy and dispatching it to the grid in times of high demand, grid operators can ensure that there is enough energy for everyone, making rolling blackouts that can harm your neighborhood more infrequent. According to ERCOT, which manages the electric grid for most of Texas, the risk of a power demand emergency dropped from 16% last year to just 0.5% this year thanks to the enormous growth of BESS and solar energy.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/center/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 00:00:08.304431

INTRODUCTION

Industrial plants are experiencing two different forces; as energy costs have been increasing and there has been a stricter towing of environmental standards. The traditional approach to management has been unable to keep up with real-time complexity through the use of traditional management practices: scheduling, reactive maintenance and rule-based control. A scalable solution is provided by ML: predicting demand, anomaly detection in real-time, optimizing operations, and predictive maintenance. The real-world applications of ML technologies evolve together with the technologies themselves and generate impressive results in terms of energy savings, uptime, and financial investment payback.

Energy Forecasting and Demand Response

Efficient energy is all about determining what, and at what time to utilize. In complex consumption data identification, ML is an expert.

●Forecast accuracy: ML models are better at making forecasts compared to conventional methods of forecasting. According to Spacewell, forecasting applications with the help of AI facilitate balanced demands and production schedules in real-time so that participating in the demand-response programs can be effective.

●Demand response: ML enables facilities to move heavier loads, such as kiln firing, large compressors or power-peaking-machines to non peak times. Using the smart grid connection, operators can maximize the energy cost and get a grid incentive.

●Impact: Using smarter forecasting and load shifting can slash peak charges and stabilize power consumption load and, in many cases, can be paid off within 12-24 months (ROI: Return on Investment).

Prescriptive and Predictive Maintenance

Unscheduled stoppage in the industrial side of things has been costing companies and businesses up to $1.4 trillion per year. Maintenance systems powered by Machine Learning assist in failure predestination and optimum maintenance.

●Predictive maintenance: IoT sensors are utilized to gather vibrations, acoustic emissions, temperature and runtime measurements. ML Models bring up anomalies prior to slip-up.

Reports indicate that unplanned downtime has been reduced by up to 50 percent with maintenance costs savings of between 10 and 40 percent.

Real-world examples:

General Electric installed AI-based predictive maintenance in its facility and attained several uptime benefits. Aquant and Gecko Robotics combine robotics and ML technologies to detect the problem, e.g. corrosion, before it becomes a critical situation. One of the Business Insider reports notes savings of up to 23% of the annual service expenses of such companies as Coca-Cola and Siemens Energy.

● Prescriptive maintenance: The recent development with anomalies detected, the systems suggest the corrective measures, which can be replacement, lubrication, and even a shutdown, as well as enable conversational AI assistants to query the system. This practice is likened to having a GPS of maintenance since uncertainty is cut down, and efficiency is intensified. System Optimization: Heating, Ventilation, Cooling and Operations HVAC and production-line reduction are one of the low-hanging fruits that ML should be integrated into.

● A.I. Controlled HVAC: Based on the idea of Google DeepMind, that saved 40% of the energy used to cool down data centres by dynamically adjusting cooling systems with the help of deep learning techniques, such models can be used to manage large-scale HVAC facilities within an industrial plant.

● Intelligent Microgrids and Storage: Hybrid microgrids have onsite renewables (solar, wind), combined with battery storage. The HybridOS 11 platform of FlexGen utilizes ML in controlling the storage performance and the integration of renewable energy. Amazon employs ML to optimize battery storage functions that are related to renewables, in order to minimize emissions as well as to boost efficiency.

● Real-time Energy Arbitrage: Real-time energy arbitrage relies heavily on the power of ML algorithms to manage energy reservoirs to purchase, store and dispatch electricity according to market prices or market signals such as grid supply/demand.

Energy Benchmarking and Anomaly Detection

The fact that ML can learn the normal consumption and identify anomalies is revolutionary when it comes to efficiency.

●Anomaly detection: ML systems are highly sensitive and will detect leaks, inefficiencies or unusual patterns of operations so that early action can be taken on them.

● Efficiency Benchmarking: asset-level performance across time and peer is compared in multivariate ML systems and can be used to observe which are laggards and when to focus on upgrading.

● Cyber Resilience: In its most recent review, TEA Springer observes that the ML-based means in the energy sector involve shielding against cyberattacks, in addition to efficiency enhancement.

Economic Outlook and Market Trends

The modernization of AI in the field of energy is becoming intense.

● Market Growth: The global AI-in-energy market surged from $5.24 billion in 2024 to $6.79 billion in 2025—a 29.7% year-on-year rise and is projected to reach $17.03 billion by 2029 (CAGR 25.8%).

● Policy Support: The new industrial strategy has provided the UK with up to 2.8billion on advanced manufacturing R&D, along with financing of AI-powered clean energy schemes, with an aim of cutting industrial electricity in half in 2027 onwards.

Case Studies And Proof Of Concept

1. GE Predictive Maintenance The ML used in the AI programs of GE examines historical and real-time sensor data and allows predictive maintenance and significant increases in uptime.

2. Digital Oil & Gas Maintenance

A Bitstrapped-developed project also provided cloud-based ML simulations of offshore facilities that allow predicting failures and observing per-unit facility asset happenings all over the US.

3. Maintenance Of Energy-intensive Equipment

A scholarly paper revealed that solar or hybrid-powered plant fastened with ML and IoT reduced idle time and enhanced energy performance, by delivering predictive maintenance.

4. Smart Battery Management Platforms

The ML models developed by Amazon optimize the use of storage space in terms of ensuring adequate charge/discharge inhibition and that the HybridOS 11 of FlexGen is optimizing energy flows within micro-grids.

5. Predictive-prescriptive Fusion

Waites Sensor Technologies integrated vibration sensors and LLMs, which allows technicians to query equipment status like, “What are the most problematic machines?”

Challenges and Enablers

The adoption of ML-power energy is not a smooth one. But through specific strategies, obstacles can be broken.I. Data Readiness Good data lies in the basis. It is difficult to find a granular IoT connection with legacy systems in most facilities. High resolutions, time stamped, structured data are essential to Machine

Learning (ML).

II. Upfront Investment

Capital is required to install sensors, improve infrastructure, and construct cloud or edge platforms. The ROI is usually attained within 12-24 months as verified by peer cases studies.

III. Workforce Adaptation

Technicians should have ML literacy and practical skill. There is also the fear of displacement of jobs. Nonetheless, research implies that ML augments human functions by making the work more cognizant and pro-active.

IV. System Integration

At real time, EMS needs to combine ML knowledge with an industrial control system (e.g., SCADA, PLCs). The adoption is hindered by fragmented systems. Integration is frequently streamlined with help of strategic partnering with vendors (Siemens, Schneider, GE, etc.)

V. Security and Governance

ML systems enhance connectivity and this enlarges the cyber-attack surface. AI in energy standards are gaining momentum to protect the integrity of data, resilience of systems, and privacy.

Best Practices For Adoption

In order to be successful, industrial leaders are to:

1. Focus on use cases: There is usually a reliable potential ROI, e.g. in predictive maintenance workflows, or to optimize HVAC.

2. Establish first-rate data infrastructure: Install sensors that record useful measures at adequate rating.

3. Pilot measurable objectives Repeatable: Use one plant or process to test, iterate, and measure ROI.

4. Collaborate with experts: Team up with experts that demonstrate successful experience with ML-EMS functionality (e.g., approaches by DeepMind, developed at Google, FlexGen OS, Aquant, GE).

5. Upskill staff: Train engineers and technicians to interface with ML insights and diagnostic tools.

6. Govern for sustainability: Watch over model drift, check predictions, and retrain data lines on a continuous basis.

The Future Trends

The important trends affecting industrial energy developments of ML are:

I. Prescriptive and Conversational AI – The combination of discovery of the anomaly, possible solutions, and collaborative technicians will become the norm.

II. Dynamic Load Management and Peer-to-grid trade – ML will facilitate dynamic load management and peer-to-grid trade of industrial clusters with dynamic VPP ecosystems and microgrids.

III. Transparency and Governance – The interpretability of ML will assist engineers in gaining confidence in predictions and investigating problems.

IV. Cyber-secure ML deployment – Resilience and secure ML designs will be important parameters as systems get networked.

V. Regulatory incentive– The availability of funds and government regulations (such as the UK clean-energy plan) will stimulate the use of ML-based EMS systems.

CONCLUSION

The situation in industrial energy management is at the stage of change. Machine learning provides industrial facilities with three strategic advantages:

Economic: Physical cost savings via demand optimization, peak shifting and predictive maintenance.

Operational: Better equipment availability, safer working environment and lower possible downtime.

Environmental: Reduced carbon emissions due to optimal energy consumption, renewable energy, and more intelligent system designs.

Using the data infrastructure along with strategic piloting and workforce skilled engagement, industrial operators will be able to utilize the true potential of ML. Businesses that adopt it early enough, when training staff, improving data flows and making systems more secure, will define the future where energy becomes an opportunity and a business advantage, than a simple cost. The path will cost money, take time, and require some hard work to get done, but the reward will be a slimmer, greener, more robust industrial energy sector. With the ML technologies moving to production, industrial sites are not only seeing the energy and cost savings, but spearheading the energy transition and transforming what the modern manufacturing process is.",https://www.automate.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-26 07:00:21.865653

If passed, the federal agency's ability to enforce restrictions on automakers could be limited in the future.

The plan would overturn official EPA policy that has been in place since 2009.

A newly drafted plan from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said to be days away from going public, aims to strip the agency's ability to limit greenhouse gases. According to , the draft proposal rescinds a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and methane emissions are hazardous to public health.

If verified and passed, such a proposal presents further headwinds to EV adoption and also removes limits on tailpipe emissions. The ruling would also affect industrial pollution, but as far as the automotive industry is concerned, it would remove carbon emission limitations as a target for automakers.

With fines for CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) violations largely eliminated and federal rebates for EV purchases gone, this new change could continue to change the course of domestic car manufacturing. Long-term, such a change would limit the EPA's authority to enforce rules aimed at limiting climate change.

The proposed draft is said not to argue with the science regarding greenhouse gas emissions, but rather it states that the EPA has legally overstepped its authority. It seeks to limit the EPA's ability to legislate except in specific circumstances.

There are several steps to be taken before such a change occurs, not least of which are various legal hurdles. If enacted, the new plan would almost certainly face challenges from various sources. It also has to weather some form of public review.

It took two years for the EPA to officially label greenhouse gases as a public health issue after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that they were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unwinding this finding may take a similarly long timeline.

If you are in the automaking business, however, it's fairly straightforward to see which way the winds are blowing.

The prototype is heavily disguised, but appears to be roughly the same size as the EV2. Despite the similarities, the Kia is positioned as a crossover while the Ioniq 2 is a more traditional hatchback. It sports an upright front fascia with a wide lower intake. They’re joined by an angular sensor and what appears to be slender lighting units.

The profile screams hatchback and the car features a gently sloping roof. We can also see a compact greenhouse as there’s a curvaceous sweeping beltline, which is contrasted by angular upper window frames. Hyundai also gave the prototype a set of modestly sized wheels, which are wrapped in Hankook iON GT rubber. These are summer tires designed specifically for compact electric vehicles.

The rear end isn’t as tall as the camouflage suggests, but it appears the Ioniq 2 will have an upright rump with a relatively plain bumper. We can also get a glimpse of LED taillights and an angular rear window.

Little is known about the car at this point, but it will presumably have a lot in common with the EV2 as well as the EV3. This means it should ride on the Electric-Global Modular Platform (E-GMP) and have a 58.3 kWh battery pack. They could be joined by a front-mounted motor producing 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS).

Tesla plans to launch an invite-only service in the Bay Area as soon as this weekend, according to a Business Insider report citing an internal company memo.

The move comes about a month after Tesla robotaxis hit the roads in Austin, Texas. The vehicles, which are still being tested using human co-pilots to monitor their movements and help them get out of tough traffic situations, have drawn scrutiny for behaving oddly.

Musk has touted the abilities and potential of his company’s self-driving technology for years. The pressure to deliver on his promises has risen as Tesla’s electric vehicle sales decline.

The chief executive has increasingly banked the future of the company on a successful robotaxi service and developing other robotics, including the humanoid robot Optimus.

On Thursday, Musk shared a post on his social media platform X, discussing how Tesla’s latest self-driving software is able to take into account 10 times more parameters as it guides cars. In theory this should give vehicles more awareness of their surroundings to drive better.

On Wednesday, the company reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales for the second quarter. Total revenue fell 12% to $22.5 billion.

Musk faces a crowded field of competitors in the robotaxi space, including Waymo, which has operated in San Francisco since 2022 and began service in Los Angeles late last year. Waymo is owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet. Amazon is testing its own robotaxi effort, Zoox, in several cities.

In the U.S., Waymo is well ahead of the competition, having already completed millions of driverless rides. Its vehicles are operating without backup human co-pilots.

As Tesla scrambles to catch up, the company also faces a lawsuit from the Department of Motor Vehicles accusing Tesla of leading buyers to believe that its vehicles can operate autonomously. A semi-autonomous feature known as Full Self-Drive mode is widely available in Tesla vehicles, but it cannot be used without a human in the driver’s seat.

Several incidents have been reported by Tesla drivers using FSD, leading to a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation that began last year.

Musk has lofty ambitions for the feature, claiming that one day customers will be able to sleep in the back of their Tesla as it drives across the country. Musk has also advertised an Uber-like service in which Tesla owners can earn money by deploying their autonomous vehicle as a taxi.

Last October, Musk unveiled a prototype for the Cybercab, a self-driving vehicle that lacks a steering wheel and pedals. Although he made promises that a fleet of Cybercabs would soon transport customers in several cities, the robotaxis currently operating in Austin are Model Y Teslas. Musk has not updated his timeline for launching the Cybercab.

Tesla shares have fallen more than 16% this year following a series of setbacks for the company, including brand damage and plateauing interest in electric vehicles.

Tesla fell out of favor with many potential buyers while Musk served a prominent role in the Trump administration earlier this year. His subsequent feuds with the president have further alienated customers, especially those who are liberal-leaning.

On an earnings call this week, Musk warned that the company could have “a few rough quarters,” partially in response to an expiring electric vehicle tax credit that makes it more affordable to purchase a new or used EV. The $7,500 credit will be eliminated at the end of September as dictated in President Trump’s recent megabill.

Tesla bull Dan Ives predicted that autonomous technology could be a $1 trillion venture for Tesla. Musk aims to have robotaxi services available to half the U.S. population by the end of 2025, Ives said in a note.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/221d842/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7816x4103+0+553/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F0a%2Fb2d15c110ff1b2bdca199f53f8b9%2F06dbcf110d1841b9a35db0b3dded727f,N,,2025-07-26 00:00:12.318731

Being included in UNEP FI’s Sustainability Risk Dashboard affirms the growing importance of asset-level data in managing climate risk”

— Libby Bernick, Senior Advisor at RS Metrics

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, July 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RS Metrics is among the risk data providers selected for the Q2 2025 issue of the Sustainability Risk Dashboard database of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) released this July. With three of its ESGSignals® solutions featured (for physical risk, biodiversity, and transition risk data), the company is excited to continue its mission of providing finance market participants with verified and objective data for supporting the sustainability transition of the business sector.

“Being included in UNEP FI’s Sustainability Risk Dashboard affirms the growing importance of asset-level data in managing climate risk,” said RS Metrics senior advisor Libby Bernick, a global sustainability and climate thought leader. “RS Metrics empowers financial institutions with forward-looking, location-specific insights to reduce risk, improve due diligence, and meet evolving regulatory demands.”

The UNEP FI risk dashboard is a specialized open database launched and maintained by the UNEP FI Risk Centre. Published every quarter, this resource recognizes leading data suppliers of environmental and social risks which offer solutions tailored to the needs of financial customers like banks and asset managers.

RS Metrics fits well amongst industry peers with ESGSignals®, the company’s foundational data product measuring the environmental, climate, and physical risks associated with different company locations. The tool’s competitive advantage comes from its asset-level approach to data analysis, which allows customers to obtain information about specific business locations as opposed to insights on the level of the whole company, and its aggregate risk assessment method, which implements a system of inter-dependencies of various risks that construct a score for each region.

Some powerful applications of ESGSignals® within the finance sector include data assessments for portfolio management, due diligence, sustainability-focused banking processes, adherence to regulations (like TNFD, EUDR, CSRD), and green bond investments.

RS Metrics’ collaboration with UNEP FI follows another year of excellence, enhancement, and expansion. “This is the first time RS Metrics is being featured in UNEP FI’s sustainability dashboard and it is an acknowledgement of the team’s effort and success during the past couple of years,” said Magnus Billing, President of RS Metrics Europe and former CEO of Nasdaq Nordics Ltd. “As climate risks, biodiversity, and transition plans are becoming a natural component of business models across most industries, RS Metrics’ solutions can enhance models’ capabilities to deliver value in an ever more complex business environment.”

From rising household utility bills to eliminating thousands of job opportunities across multiple industries to cutting critical health care resources, here’s how Trump’s tax bill will affect ‘Ganders—all while providing tax cuts to the rich.

Shifting $150 million for parks and conservation onto Michigan taxpayers

Trump’s tax bill repealed funding for National Park Service maintenance and staffing, putting strain on already-overburdened public lands during the peak summer visitation.

A report from Climate Power estimates that Trump’s plans would shift more than $150 million in park maintenance and additional staffing costs onto Michigan taxpayers, while simultaneously raising visitor fees, slashing tourism revenue, and putting active military and veterans’ benefits at risk.

Rollbacks on clean energy incentives will lead to higher utility bills

As projects are delayed or cancelled altogether, the bill’s repeal of clean energy tax credits and its slowdown of renewable energy could cost Michigan an estimated 19,000 manufacturing and clean energy jobs by 2035. This is especially concerning as manufacturing accounts for about 16% of Michigan’s economic output.

As these jobs and industries are eliminated, analysts forecast Michiganders will feel the effects as early as next year—when utility bills are expected to increase by as much as $110 per household per year and $400 within a decade.

Watch: Trump slams brakes on Michigan’s clean energy future

More expensive grocery bills

Trump’s tax bill will slash annual federal spending by $285 billion over the next decade, forcing individual states to pick up the bill to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) going.

In Michigan, those extra costs could reach as high as $900 million a year, according to state estimates. But even if the state fills the gap, the new work requirements in the tax bill will soon force more than 270,000 Michiganders statewide to lose their SNAP benefits.

Cuts to SNAP will also impact local grocery stores, farmers markets, and other stores in Michigan. In 2024, over $3 billion in SNAP benefits were spent at Michigan retailers, which directly contributed to local economies and supported food access in both urban and rural communities.

Health care cuts

Medicaid currently covers about 2.6 million Michiganders—roughly one in four residents—including three in five nursing home patients, nearly half of all births, and 300,000 people with disabilities, according to data provided by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office.

Additional reports indicate that Trump’s tax bill will eliminate nearly $1 trillion from the Medicaid program over the next decade. As a result, state officials say 200,000 Michiganders could lose their coverage altogether—largely due to new paperwork requirements and eligibility checks included in the newly signed federal legislation that make it difficult for people to stay on Medicaid when their hours fluctuate, when their school schedules change from term to term, or because they find the online reporting system hard to navigate.

The cuts are also set to gut a key source of funding for nursing homes, hospitals, and health care providers, especially in rural areas, where Medicaid covers a majority of these services.

Companies in the US cancelled, closed or scaled back more than $22bn worth of clean-energy investments during the first half of the year, according to new analysis by research group E2, covered by the Hill. More than 5,000 jobs were lost to the changes in June alone, pushing the total number of job losses this year up to 16,500, the outlet adds. The cuts are equivalent to around 17% of the $133bn worth of clean energy projects announced since the start of 2022, “many of which are based in Republican-led states”, according to Bloomberg. It explains that this comes ahead of US president Donald Trump signing a tax bill that rolls back significant Biden-era tax breaks for low-carbon sectors. In a series of earnings calls earlier this week, renewable energy developers downplayed Trump’s elimination of clean energy subsidies and expressed confidence they could still advance projects “despite political headwinds”, according to Politico. Iron ore magnate Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue company has cancelled two green hydrogen projects – including one in Arizona – and laid “some of the blame on the Trump administration’s shift away from renewable energy”, the Guardian reports. In an interview with Semafor, Wally Adeyemo, the former deputy Treasury secretary under Joe Biden, says Trump’s effort to block renewables will “undermine a vital new national security tool by leaving US consumers more exposed to sanctions-related volatility” in oil markets.

Business columnist Jeremy Grant has an article in the Scotsman considering the need for a “new narrative” to “protect Scotland’s huge pipeline of offshore wind projects”. He explains how Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice recently told the heads of offshore wind developers in the UK that, if elected in 2029, his party would “strike down” any contracts they signed under the next government renewable-energy auction. [In fact, Tice later rowed back these comments, clarifying that “a legally binding contract is a legally binding contract”.] Grant says Tice’s threat could “spell an end” to Scotland’s future offshore wind developments and point to the economic and employment benefits of this industry. He writes: “In Scotland, we already see the start of re-industrialisation on a scale not witnessed since the oil boom of the 1970s.” Grant continues: “Instead, Tice’s party wants more licences to drill for oil in the North Sea – a call that may be reinforced by US president Donald Trump when he meets Sir Keir Starmer in Aberdeen. Yet this ignores the fact that the North Sea basin is in decline and any new licences to drill will make little difference to oil production.” He concludes: “Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. But the time it will take for this to filter through to the public risks being longer than [energy secretary Ed] Miliband’s 2030 target. A new narrative is required.”

MORE COMMENT

Climate-sceptic columnist Matt Riddley is given a full page in the Daily Mail to write about the UK government increasing the guaranteed price paid for new wind power, which he describes as “the most regressive wealth transfer in history”.

Daily Telegraph associate editor Ben Marlow, another critic of net-zero policies, also has an article about the government’s wind power plans. He describes the move as the “latest devastating blow to [Miliband’s] clean energy fantasy”.

Meanwhile, climate scientist Andrew Dessler has an article on the Climate Brink showing how, despite what some people claim, “renewables do not appear to be increasing the cost of energy generation” and that “adding renewables reduces the cost of electricity”.",,N,,2025-07-26 01:00:17.043360

The department also questioned whether the $11 billion project could meet the financial conditions required for a loan guarantee.
“To ensure more responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources, DOE has terminated its conditional commitment,” the agency said in a statement.
A federal loan guarantee generally makes borrowing money less costly.
A statement issued for the Grain Belt Express expressed disappointment, calling the new transmission line “America’s largest power pipeline.” Construction has been set to start next year.","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The Trump administration on Wednesday canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for a new high-voltage transmission line for delivering solar and wind-generated electricity from the Midwest to the eastern U.S., but the company indicated that project would go forward anyway.

The U.S. Department of Energy declared that it is “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the first phase of Chicago-based Invenergy’s planned Grain Belt Express. The department also questioned whether the $11 billion project could meet the financial conditions required for a loan guarantee.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly derided wind and solar energy as unreliable and opposed efforts to combat climate change by moving away from fossil fuels. The Department of Energy also said Wednesday that the conditional commitment to Invenergy in November was among billions of dollars’ worth of commitments “rushed out the doors” by former President Joe Biden’s administration after Biden lost the election.

Two prominent Missouri Republicans, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley and state Attorney General Andrew Bailey, have been vocal critics of the project, describing it as a threat to farmland and landowners’ property rights. Hawley said on July 10 that he had secured a pledge from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel the loan guarantee in a conversation with him and Trump.

“To ensure more responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources, DOE has terminated its conditional commitment,” the agency said in a statement.

A federal loan guarantee generally makes borrowing money less costly. A statement issued for the Grain Belt Express expressed disappointment, calling the new transmission line “America’s largest power pipeline.” Construction has been set to start next year.

The statement added: “A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs.”

Invenergy has said its project would create 4,000 jobs and new efficiencies in delivering power, and that it would save consumers $52 billion over 15 years. The line would deliver electricity from western Kansas about 800 miles (1,287 kilometers), across Missouri and Illinois and into Indiana, connecting there to the power grid for the eastern U.S. It could deliver up to 5,000 megawatts of electricity.

“When electricity demand and consumer power bills are soaring, it’s hard to imagine a more backward move,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a nonpartisan, Washington-based group supporting renewable energy.

The decision to cancel the loan guarantee came the same day Trump unveiled a plan for U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence that includes speeding up the permitting of new data centers and factories that will boost the demand for electricity.

“This gross mismanagement of our country’s energy needs will increase power bills for hundreds of millions of people while making the electricity grid less reliable,” said Laurie Williams, director of a campaign against fossil fuels for the Sierra Club environmental group.

Jigar Shah, who headed the Department of Energy office handling loan guarantees under Biden, said that if an applicant meets the requirements of a conditional commitment, the department is obligated to follow through.

“This decision is illegal,” he said in a post on the LinkedIn social media platform.

Hawley and Bailey have called the Grain Belt Express a “scam.” Critics object to what Hawley labels an “elitist land grab,” the company’s ability to use lawsuits against individual landowners along the line’s route to compel them to sell their property.

Online court records show that the company filed dozens of such lawsuits in Missouri circuit courts in recent years. The Missouri Farm Bureau’s president posted on the social platform X Wednesday that the project threatened to “sacrifice rural America in the name of progress.”

“We’ve won a major battle in the war for Missouri’s private property rights and farmers,” Bailey said. “At our urging, the DOE saw this boondoggle for what it was.”

Bailey acknowledged in his comments that the project still could go forward with private funding and no loan guarantee but added, “If Invenergy still intends to force this project on unwilling landowners, we will continue to fight every step of the way.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25204569869268-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 01:00:19.701554

The facility will feature 42 EV charging plugs for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, a workforce development hub, and a welcome center.

The site will also feature 32 DC fast chargers, including at least eight designed for Class 8 trucks and 10 Level 2 chargers for additional vehicle types. The infrastructure will support Light Duty and Medium and Heavy Duty electric vehicles with a community solar installation.

The facility will also offer 24/7 micromobility options such as scooters and electric bikes. According to NYCEDC, construction is expected to begin in 2026.

The workforce hub and welcome center will span 12,500 square feet, including 10,000 square feet of indoor space. Indoor space will include shared areas such as security offices, a lobby, and commercial space for restaurants and convenience stores.

Bold Vision for Economic Mobility

The Hunts Point project is expected to bring major environmental benefits and economic opportunities. The transition to electric freight vehicles will help reduce more than 66,000 tons of CO2 emissions between the years 2029 and 2039.

The initiative will eliminate thousands of pounds of air pollutants, improving air quality in the South Bronx and surrounding communities. A planned solar installation will also power homes and serve 300 local households. New street trees will help absorb CO2 and reduce the urban heat island effect in the neighborhood.

The project will create meaningful economic opportunities for the South Bronx. It will boost the local workforce by generating 11 permanent, high-quality jobs and more than 100 temporary jobs.

The project will include 15% participation from Disadvantaged Business Enterprises in its construction and design phases, supporting inclusive economic development.

Hello and welcome to Eco Report.

In today’s feature report, WFHB Environmental Correspondent Max Jancich speaks with Greg Olsen, Field Projects Director at the Sand County Foundation. Olsen discussed prairie strips, a conservation practice that integrates prairie ecosystems into 10-20 percent of farmland to improve water quality and soil health.

And now for your environmental reports:

The quality of Lake Monroe for swimming as of July was: there is an alert level based on a cyanobacteria cell count less than 100,000 cells per milliliter of water. Don’t drink the water, shower after you swim. This affects Monroe Lake, both Fairfax Beach and Paynetown Beach.

In Bloomington, Indiana, the rainfall for January through April 2025 has been significantly above average, with April seeing the largest deviation. The year-to-date rainfall total is 42.99 inches, compared to a 30-year average of 28.70 inches. Specifically, January was below average, February through May were slightly above average. In June, the total rainfall averaged 10.5 inches, significantly exceeding the 30-year average of 5.3 inches. It appears there is a trend toward wetter summers.

Reports suggest that tariffs are expected to significantly impact grocery prices, particularly on imported goods.

We are Eating the Earth is a new book by Michael Grunwald. Humanity has cleared a land mass the size of Asia plus Europe to grow food, and our food system generates a third of our carbon emissions.

China has more wind and solar power capacity than both the United States and Europe combined. China has five times the wind and solar of the USA. Specifically, China is building wind and solar capacity at a rate that is nearly twice the rest of the world combined. The USA has lost the battle for leadership in green energy, and after the Trump administration, it appears we will be well behind China.

We are living in a time where we need to have access to the truth, such as provided by public television and radio. To ignore science costs money and lives. For example, CNN recently reported that the ocean circulation may stop during this century, resulting in catastrophic climate change, including the possibility of a new glacial period. This is not a new theory. It was introduced more than two decades ago. Circulation could possibly stop, but probably not a glacial period. Ocean currents transfer heat from equatorial regions to the poles. This role could, for example, be taken over by the jet stream, which has become wavier in recent years, perhaps in response to a weakening ocean circulation.

On Friday, the stock price closed at $316.06, up $10.76, or 3.52%, from the day before, when the stock slumped 8.2%. Its market capitalization slumped to $984.73 billion. Tesla earnings report was released after the market closed on Wednesday.

Tesla is down 16.7% year to date but up 43.5% from one year ago, according to NASDAQ.

Tesla's price was as low as $284.70 on June 5 when Elon Musk's feud with President Donald Trump intensified and $221.85 on April 8 when stock indexes and bond market were tumbling before Trump announced a pause on harsh tariffs on trading partners.

The company's stock price reached a record of 479.86 on Dec. 17 before Trump entered the White House as president again on Jan. 20. Tesla first began trading on June 29, 2010, with an initial price offering of $17 but opened trading at $19 per share.

Back then the only car for sale was the Roadster and two years before the Model S hit the market. The top-selling cars are now the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan.

Musk wasn't Tesla founder but he invested early and served as chairman and took over as CEO in 2008.

The conference call Thursdsay was light in earnings information and more focused on robotics and artificial intelligence.

""The company offered remarkably little detail on some of the most important factors"" - like its mysterious new lower-priced model - ""making our outlook lean more on imagination than realistic targets,"" Truist's William Stein, who has a hold rating on Tesla, said in a note after the call in a report by CNN.

""I wouldn't say it was a conference call that should be put in the Hall of Fame,"" Dan Ives of Wdbush Securities, told CNN on Thursday, but said he is still bullish on Tesla's robotics future with Musk in charge. ""Communication on the call was less than stellar in terms of details, and I think that definitely played into the selloff that we're seeing.""

Tesla later told staff Thursday it plans to launch its Robotaxi service in San Francisco this weekend, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. Tesla has a permit for testing its self-driving software in California with a driver behind the wheel.

Earning report

Looking back, Tesla sold $22.5 billion worth of products during the second quarter, which is $3 billion less than the $25.5 billion in sales during the same period in 2024.

Tesla reported $1.2 billion in earnings profit from April to June, which is down from $1.4 billion a year earlier.

The earnings drop is the third straight quarter for the EV maker that last reported an earnings gain during the third quarter last year.

Driving much of the loss is a decline in Tesla vehicle sales, which totaled $16.7 billion during the second quarter -- down by 16% from a year ago.

Tesla delivered 384,000 vehicles during the second quarter, which is 14% fewer than a year ago, the company announced in July.

Several factors have contributed to the decline in Tesla sales, including the end to federal tax credits for buying electric vehicles and increased competition for EV makers in China and elsewhere.

Musk recently cautioned investors about the approach of a ""few rough quarters"" due to the loss of the federal EV tax credits.

A recently signed budget bill that Trump dubbed ""one big, beautiful bill"" eliminates a $7,500 federal tax credit after September.

Trump said he does not intend to eliminate federal subsidies for Tesla, though.

""I want Elon and all businesses within our country to thrive ... like never before,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday.

""The better they do, the better the USA does, and that's good for all of us,"" Trump added.

Tesla also posted a decline in new vehicle registrations in Europe in July and only sold 4,300 units of its Cybertruck during the second quarter.

Tesla sold about half as many Cybertrucks during the second quarter than it did a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Musk has announced Tesla will soon offer a new EV that costs less after beginning production in June.

Industry analysts anticipate it will be similar to Tesla's electric Model Y SUV.

Tesla's declining EV sales come as demand for EVs has grown by 1.5% so far in 2025 in the United States and by 32% and 26%, respectively, in China and Europe, Cox Automotive and Rho Motion reported.

China's BYD EV maker is growing its market share there, while JATO Dynamics reported Volkswagen has overtaken Tesla as the top EV seller in Europe.

Recent political turmoil also has led to negative publicity for Musk and Tesla by extension.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/6721753390636/2025/1/e00ea60ef2aec2a6ecea9f169b90d950/v1.5/Tesla-shares-end-week-in-decline-amid-third-straight-quarterly-loss.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 20:02:24.682348

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY, et al.,

Defendants.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

The Sierra Club, the National Parks Conservation Association, and the Environmental

Integrity Project (collectively “Plaintiffs”) brought this action to compel the United States

Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and its Administrator, Lee Zeldin 1 (collectively

“Defendants”), to take certain required actions under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”),

42 U.S.C. §

7401

et seq. Fortunately, the parties’ negotiations bore fruit and resulted in a consent decree.

Now, the Plaintiffs move to recover $173,217 in attorney’s fees and costs. Upon careful

consideration, the Court will grant the Plaintiffs’ motion in part and award them $99,343.43 in

total—$98,841.43 in attorney’s fees and $502 in costs.

BACKGROUND

The CAA aims to protect visibility in “class I Federal areas . . . from manmade air

pollution.”

42 U.S.C. § 7491

(a)(1).2 Thus, it requires qualifying states periodically to submit State

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).

156 national parks and wilderness areas comprise “Class I Federal areas.” United States Environmental

Protection Agency, Regional Haze Program, (Mar. 12, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/visibility/regional-haze-program.

Throughout this Opinion, the Court takes judicial notice of government websites. See, e.g., Santos v. Collins, Civ. A.

No. 24-1759 (JDB),

2025 WL 1905596

, at *1 n.2 (D.D.C. July 10, 2025).

Implementation Plans (“SIPs”) to the EPA to address visibility impairment in these areas. See

id.

§ 7491(b)(2);

40 C.F.R. § 51.308

. Within sixty days of a state’s SIP submission, but no later than

six months after a state’s SIP submission deadline, the EPA must determine whether the

submission is “complete” under criteria established by the CAA and relevant regulations. See

42

U.S.C. § 7410

(k)(1); 40 C.F.R. pt. 51, app. V. If the EPA does not make a timely finding of

completeness, the plan is deemed complete by operation of law.

42 U.S.C. § 7410

(k)(1)(B).

Within twelve months of a SIP being declared “complete,” the EPA must approve (wholly or in

part), conditionally approve, or disapprove the submission.3

Id.

§ 7410(k)(2)–(4).

The Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in June 2023, alleging that the EPA had failed to

take final action within twelve months of the completion of SIP submissions from seven states.4

See Compl. for Declaratory & Injunctive Relief [ECF No. 1] (“Initial Compl.”). They amended

their complaint in November 2023, expanding the list of states to thirty-four.5 See Am. Compl.

for Declaratory & Injunctive Relief [ECF No. 15] (“Am. Compl.”).

Eventually, through a series of unopposed motions for extension, the Plaintiffs and

Defendants negotiated a consent decree, see Consent Decree [ECF No. 53-1] (“CD”), which this

Court approved in July 2024, see Order Approving Consent Decree [ECF No. 53]. In the decree,

the parties established a schedule by which the Defendants agreed to take final action on all

completed SIP submissions still pending such action.6 See CD ¶ 3. They also agreed that the

Plaintiffs could “file a motion for costs of litigation (including attorney fees).” Id. ¶ 13.

The Plaintiffs filed the instant fee motion in January 2025, requesting $181,977 in total.

response to the Defendants’ objections to some of the billed hours, see Defs.’ Fee Resp. to Pls.’

Mot. [ECF No. 59] (“Defs.’ Resp.”) at 9–10 & n.6, the Plaintiffs reduced their request to $173,217.

See Pls.’ Reply Supp. Fee Mot. [ECF No. 63] (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 7. The Defendants agree that the

Plaintiffs are entitled to fees and costs, Defs.’ Resp. at 1, but for “no more than $42,500.” Id. at

ANALYSIS

Under the CAA, this Court “may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney

and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.”

42 U.S.C. § 7604

(d). Because the parties do not dispute that the Plaintiffs are entitled to fees, see

Defs.’ Resp. at 1, the Court considers only the fees’ magnitude.7

The “basic formula” for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees is to multiply “the number

of hours reasonably expended in litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.” DL v. District of Columbia,

924 F.3d 585, 588

(D.C. Cir. 2019) (cleaned up). The movant bears the burden of demonstrating

the reasonableness of both the rates and hours. See Eley v. District of Columbia,

793 F.3d 97, 100

(D.C. Cir. 2015). And the opposing party can rebut the movant’s claims “by equally specific

6

The Plaintiffs dropped claims relating to two (Maryland and Massachusetts) out of the thirty-four states in

the Amended Complaint, because the EPA had taken final actions on those states’ SIPs before this Court approved

the consent decree. See CD at 4.

The Defendants also do not challenge the reasonableness of the $502 in costs.

countervailing evidence.” Nat’l Ass’n of Concerned Veterans v. Sec’y of Def.,

675 F.2d 1319,

1326

(D.C. Cir. 1982). The Court will examine the rates and hours in turn.

I. Rates

The parties disagree first about the hourly rates. See Pls.’ Reply at 5. The Plaintiffs bear

the burden of establishing the reasonableness of their requested rates through a three-part

framework: “(1) the attorneys’ billing practices; (2) the attorneys’ skill, experience, and reputation;

(3) and the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. District

of Columbia,

809 F.3d 58

, 61–62 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). The Defendants challenge only

the third prong, specifically what fee matrix among those in existing case law to apply. Defs.’

Resp. at 4.

a. Fitzpatrick Matrix

“A court calculating a prevailing market rate allows fee applicants to submit attorneys’ fee

matrices as one type of evidence.” Salazar,

809 F.3d at 62

. These matrices suggest hourly rates

based on years of attorney experience. See

id.

Here, the Plaintiffs urge the Court to apply the LSI

Laffey Matrix, while the Defendants advocate for the newer and less generous Fitzpatrick Matrix.8

See Defs.’ Resp. at 4.

To determine the applicable rates, the Court must walk through a “burden-shifting

framework,” examining first the Plaintiffs’ evidence and then weighing it against any

countervailing evidence from the Defendants. See DL, 924 F.3d at 588–89. Given that fee

matrices are “somewhat crude, the matrix’s proponent usually cannot stop there”; the Plaintiffs

must provide further support for the matrix’s rates, such as “surveys to update the matrix; affidavits

8

Both matrices are “meant to capture the market rates for complex federal litigation in the District [of

Columbia].” J.T. v. District of Columbia,

652 F. Supp. 3d 11

, 29–30 (D.D.C. 2023) (emphasis added). The parties

do not meaningfully brief complexity, and the Court need not resolve whether this case is complex because the

Defendants assume complexity by advocating for the Fitzpatrick Matrix. See

id. at 30

.

reciting the precise fees that attorneys with similar qualifications have received from fee-paying

clients in comparable cases; and evidence of recent fees awarded by the courts or through

settlement to attorneys with comparable qualifications handling similar cases.”

Id. at 589

(internal

quotation marks omitted).

Here, the Plaintiffs offer: (1) an expert report of William H. Jeffress, Jr.9; (2) an affidavit

of Dr. Michael Kavanaugh10; and (3) prior decisions from judges in this District and the D.C.

Circuit that have concluded the LSI Laffey Matrix is reasonable.11 But these sources fail to meet

the Plaintiffs’ initial burden.

First, this Court is familiar with the Jeffress report, which concludes that rates in line with

the LSI Laffey Matrix were reasonable for a non-CAA, complex personal injury suit. See Jeffress

Report at 2–3; Feld v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co., Civ. A. No. 12-1789 (JDB),

2020 WL 1140673

,

at *8 (D.D.C. Mar. 9, 2020). But the Plaintiffs merely attach the report here without meaningfully

explaining why the rates for their CAA litigation should also align with the LSI Laffey Matrix.

Second, the Kavanaugh affidavit was prepared in 2010 for a

42 U.S.C. § 1983

dispute, see Salazar

v. District of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 93-452 (GK) (D.D.C.), and argues for the superiority of the

LSI Laffey Matrix over the less generous USAO Laffey Matrix. See Kavanaugh Aff. It’s unclear

how that discussion aids the Plaintiffs’ case for the superiority of the LSI Laffey Matrix over the

Fitzpatrick Matrix in this CAA case. Cf. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DEA,

266 F. Supp. 3d 162, 171

(discounting a 2013 Kavanaugh declaration defending LSI Laffey Matrix against competing

matrix as outdated evidence due to change in competing matrix’s methodology).

Pls.’ Reply Ex. B, Aff. of Dr. Michael Kavanaugh. [ECF No 63-1] (“Kavanaugh Aff.”).

11

Fee Mot. at 5–7; Pls.’ Reply at 2–3.

5

Lastly, the prior judicial decisions don’t help the Plaintiffs, either. The Plaintiffs cite

multiple cases applying the LSI Laffey Matrix, but none involved the CAA. Cf. Eley,

793 F.3d at

104

(pointing out that none of the four cases cited by fee applicant for using the LSI Laffey Matrix

concerned the statute at issue). And the one CAA fee-shifting case they invoke didn’t apply the

LSI Laffey Matrix. See Sierra Club v. McCarthy,

235 F. Supp. 3d 63

(D.D.C. 2017) (applying the

USAO Matrix12 where neither party contested rates).

In short, the Plaintiffs fail their burden because they merely suggest a matrix without

providing sufficient evidence demonstrating that their “requested rates are in line with those

prevailing in the community for similar services”—here, CAA litigation. See Eley,

793 F.3d at

104

(emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).

12

Astute readers of the record may notice that the Plaintiffs claim Sierra Club applied the “Laffey Matrix

published by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia [USAO-DC],” Fee Mot. at 5–6, or

simply the “Laffey Matrix,” Pls. Reply at 2. These characterizations are imprecise and/or inaccurate.

It is imprecise to call any modern fee matrix the “Laffey Matrix.” The actual Laffey Matrix debuted in 1983

in its namesake case. See Laffey v. Nw. Airlines, Inc.,

572 F. Supp. 354, 371

(D.D.C. 1983), aff’d in part, rev’d in

part on other grounds,

746 F.2d 4

(D.C. Cir. 1984), overruled in part, Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel,

857 F.2d 1516

(D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc). Since then, courts have used two competing iterations of the Laffey Matrix

to account for inflation: (1) LSI Laffey Matrix and (2) USAO Laffey Matrix. See DL, 924 F.3d at 589–90. This

means there is no single “Laffey Matrix” in use. The Plaintiffs seek to apply the LSI Laffey Matrix, which is the more

generous offspring. See Smith v. District of Columbia,

466 F. Supp. 2d 151, 156

(D.D.C. 2006). Citing to a case

applying a distinct and less generous fee matrix does not help the Plaintiffs’ cause.

It’s also inaccurate to label the matrix used in Sierra Club as a Laffey Matrix of any kind. The Sierra Club

court incorrectly characterized the rates it applied as being based on the “Laffey Matrix published by the [USAO-

DC].”

235 F. Supp. 3d at 67

. But by 2015, the USAO-DC had scrapped its USAO Laffey Matrix and created a new

fee matrix wholly untethered to the original Laffey Matrix. See DL,

924 F.3d at 590

. A close reading of Sierra Club’s

record reveals that the plaintiff actually asked for, and the Court subsequently affirmed, rates based on this new

“USAO Matrix,” see Mot. Att’y Fees [ECF No. 15, Civ. A. No. 15-2264] at 9 & n.4 (requesting hourly rates of $386

and $325 based on the “revised” USAO Matrix); Sierra Club,

235 F. Supp. 3d at 67

(affirming same hourly rates),

which is also thriftier than the LSI Laffey Matrix, see Klayman v. Judicial Watch, Inc., Civ. A. No. 06-670 (GMH),

2022 WL 22263805

, at *20 (D.D.C. Oct. 25, 2022). The Defendants also conflate the “USAO Matrix” and the “USAO

Laffey Matrix.” See Defs.’ Resp. at 5. See generally Schiff v. District of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 18-1382 (ZMF),

2021 WL 4059469

, at *3 (D.D.C. Sep. 7, 2021) (tracing the labyrinthine history of the “three-headed hydra” of pre-

Fitzpatrick matrices). The D.C. Circuit subsequently rejected the legitimacy of the USAO Matrix for complex federal

litigation in the District, see DL, 924 F.3d at 592–93, which spurred the creation of the Fitzpatrick Matrix. See J.T.,

652 F. Supp. 3d at 15–16.

6

On the other hand, the Defendants amply demonstrate the Fitzpatrick Matrix’s rates are

reasonable. Since the matrix’s debut in November 2021, judges in this District have almost

uniformly come to view it as “a superior measure of the prevailing market rate for complex federal

litigation in the District as compared to the LSI Laffey Matrix.” J.T. v. District of Columbia,

652

F. Supp. 3d 11

, 32 (D.D.C. 2023) (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”) litigation);

see also Alavi v. Bennett, Civ. A. No. 15-2146 (RBW),

2024 WL 505604

, at *13 (D.D.C. Dec. 10,

2024) (Title VII litigation); Brackett v. Mayorkas, Civ. A. No. 17-988 (JEB),

2023 WL 5094872

,

at *4 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2023) (Rehabilitation Act litigation). Given this growing consensus, the

Court sees no reason to not apply the Fitzpatrick Matrix rates in CAA litigation, especially

considering that “fee-shifting statutes’ similar language is a strong indication that they are to be

interpreted alike.”13 Indep. Fed’n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes,

491 U.S. 754

, 758 n.2 (1989)

(internal quotation marks omitted). What’s more, at least one judge in this District has lamented

his inability to deploy the Fitzpatrick Matrix where a statute bound him to the LSI Laffey Matrix.14

The Plaintiffs offer two novel criticisms of the Fitzpatrick Matrix, see Pls.’ Reply at 3–4,

neither of which convinces the Court. First, they contend that the Fitzpatrick Matrix fails the

“basic test of showing prevailing market rates for the same type of litigation in the District of

Columbia legal market,”

id.,

because an explanatory note to the Matrix defines a reasonable fee as

13

Compare

42 U.S.C. § 7604

(d) (“The court . . . may award costs of litigation (including reasonable attorney

and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.”) (CAA), with

20

U.S.C. § 1415

(i)(3)(B)(i) (“[T]he court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys’ fees as part of the costs.”)

(IDEA), and 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k) (“[T]he court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable

attorney’s fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs.”) (Title VII), and 29 U.S.C. § 794a(b)(1) (“[T]he court, in

its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the

costs.”) (Rehabilitation Act).

See Cabrera v. Mogoo, Inc., Civ. A. No. 22-1816 (MJS),

2025 WL 1341520

, at *5 (D.D.C. May 8, 2025)

(“Judges in this District are increasingly using the Fitzpatrick Matrix in lieu of the [LSI] Laffey Matrix as a more

faithful barometer . . . . Given this shifting landscape, it may be worthwhile for the D.C. Council to revisit the

governing statutory scheme to consider substituting the Fitzpatrick Matrix for the [LSI] Laffey Matrix to compute fee

awards. But until that occurs, the Court is bound by the statute as it stands.”).

what “is sufficient to attract an adequate supply of capable counsel for meritorious cases.” USAO-

DC, Civ. Div., The Fitzpatrick Matrix, Explanatory Note 2, https://www.justice.gov/usao-

dc/media/1395096/dl?inline (citing Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn,

559 U.S. 542, 552

(2010)).

The Plaintiffs claim this definition “has nothing to do with” the proper focus on whether the

requested rates are “prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably

comparable skill, experience and reputation.” Pls.’ Reply at 4 (quoting DL,

924 F.3d at 588

). But

this argument fails to grapple with the methodology behind the Fitzpatrick Matrix: eighty-six cases

with attorney’s fee motions filed in this Court (“the community”) for complex federal litigation

(“similar services”) anchor the Matrix. The Fitzpatrick Matrix, Explanatory Notes 1, 5–13. A few

words plucked out of context do not disturb the reality that the Fitzpatrick Matrix shows the market

rates for complex litigation in the District.

Second, the Plaintiffs point out that the Fitzpatrick Matrix draws from fee motions rather

than invoices to clients. See Pls.’ Reply at 4. This methodology, they argue, fails to “show the

rates that for-profit attorneys actually charged their clients” because attorneys have incentive to

submit rates derived from less generous matrices to avoid “prolonged litigation over a fee award.”

Id.

(emphasis added). This is a weak objection at best. To begin, the Plaintiffs proffer no evidence

to support this assertion. Moreover, the Fitzpatrick Matrix’s base data excluded cases that

“involved rates explicitly or implicitly based on an existing fee matrix.” The Fitzpatrick Matrix,

Explanatory Note 5. If the Plaintiffs are right that some attorneys have submitted fee motions with

low-balled amounts based on less generous matrices, the Fitzpatrick Matrix would not have

considered those motions.

Accordingly, the Court will apply the Fitzpatrick Matrix. That undertaking is

straightforward. The Plaintiffs’ lead counsel, Charles McPhedran, graduated from law school in

8

1990. Fee Mot. at 4. His timesheets range from June 2023 to May 2024, Fee Mot. Ex. A-2,

McPhedran Timesheets [ECF No 57-1] (“McPhedran Timesheets”) at 9–13, meaning he worked

on the case 33–34 years after graduation.15 Thus, the appropriate Fitzpatrick Matrix rates for Mr.

McPhedran’s work done in 2023 and 2024 are $804 per hour and $862 per hour, respectively. See

The Fitzpatrick Matrix. The Plaintiffs’ co-counsel, Joshua Smith, graduated from law school in

2006. Fee Mot. at 5. His timesheets range from March 2023 to March 2024, Fee Mot. Ex. B-2,

Smith Timesheets [ECF No 57-1] (“Smith Timesheets”) at 21–22, meaning he worked on the case

17–18 years after graduation. The appropriate Fitzpatrick Matrix rates for Mr. Smith’s work done

in 2023 and 2024 are therefore $707 per hour and $768 per hour, respectively. See The Fitzpatrick

Matrix.

II. Hours

Having established the rates, the Court turns to the parties’ second disagreement: the

reasonableness of the Plaintiffs’ billed hours. “Attorneys who anticipate making a fee application

must maintain contemporaneous, complete and standardized time records which accurately reflect

the work done by each attorney.” Concerned Veterans,

675 F.2d at 1327

. These records “must be

of sufficient detail and probative value to enable the court to determine with a high degree of

certainty that such hours were actually and reasonably expended.” Role Models Am., Inc. v.

Brownlee,

United States,

682 F.2d 240, 250

(D.C. Cir. 1982). In modifying fees, the Court has discretion to

“identify specific hours that should be eliminated or simply reduce the award.” Hensley v.

Eckerhart,

461 U.S. 424

, 436–37 (1983) (cleaned up). Regardless of the approach it takes, the

Court’s “essential goal in shifting fees . . . is to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.”

Fox v. Vice,

563 U.S. 826, 838

(2011).

The Plaintiffs apply a voluntary 10 percent discount on their billed hours to “account for

any inefficiency remaining after the exercise of billing judgment.” Fee Mot. at 9. But the

Defendants are dissatisfied with the hour reductions, raising several objections and seeking further

reductions. See Defs.’ Resp. at 8–13. Because some of these objections have merit, the Court will

further reduce the Plaintiffs’ hours.

a. Block-billing

The Defendants first ask the Court to reduce the Plaintiffs’ fee request because the

Plaintiffs use “block-billed time entries.” Id. at 9. Block-billing is the disfavored practice of

“lumping multiple tasks into a single time entry, which can make it impossible to evaluate their

reasonableness.” Tridico v. District of Columbia,

235 F. Supp. 3d 100, 109

(D.D.C. 2017) (cleaned

up). Judges in this District have often reduced fee awards for block-billing. See

id.

(collecting

cases). But the Court may decline to levy additional discounts where plaintiffs offer voluntary

reductions. See Segar v. Garland, Civ. A. No. 77-81 (EGS),

2024 WL 4332615

, at *8 (D.D.C.

Sept. 27, 2024) (finding 10 percent voluntary reduction adequate to counteract block-billing); cf.

Driscoll v. George Washington Univ.,

55 F. Supp. 3d 106, 116

(D.D.C. 2014) (finding 5 percent

voluntary reduction adequate to counteract inadequately documented billing).

10

Here, the Plaintiffs’ 10 percent voluntary fee reduction is sufficient to account for block-

billing. While most of the Plaintiffs’ time entries are to some extent block-billed,16 the Plaintiffs

were generally careful to limit entries to small time increments. Out of 142 total time entries, 92

were for less than ninety minutes. Only two exceeded five hours, and these were less than seven

hours each.17 Thus, the Plaintiffs never logged “entire days on a variety of vague tasks with a

single time entry.” See Segar,

2024 WL 4332615

, at *8.

But a reduction for block-billing does not necessarily account for all inadequacies in a fee

request. See, e.g., Apprio, Inc. v. Zaccari, Civ. A. No. 18-2180 (JDB),

2025 WL 1905643

, at *10

(D.D.C. July 10, 2025) (reducing fee by 10 percent for block-billing and another 30 percent for

excessive hours). The Court will therefore apply the 10 percent voluntary reduction across all of

the Plaintiffs’ hours for block-billing and also layer on additional reductions discussed below.

b. Third-party claims and the Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment

Next, the Defendants ask for reductions for “work that was not required to resolve [the]

Plaintiffs’ claims against [the] Defendants.” Defs.’ Resp. at 9. In particular, the Defendants point

to time the Plaintiffs spent (1) responding to plaintiff-intervenor PacifiCorp’s motion for

intervention and motion to stay and (2) filing a motion for summary judgment and responding to

PacifiCorp’s opposition to the motion. See

id.

at 9–10 & n.6.

In December 2023, the Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, Mot. for Summ. J. [ECF

No. 22], amid settlement talks, see Defs.’ Unopposed Mot. Extension to Respond to Mot. Summ.

J. [ECF No. 23] (“First Extension to Respond to Mot. Summ. J.“) at 1 n.1, and before the

16

Virtually all of Mr. McPhedran’s time entries are block-billed. See McPhedran Timesheets at 9–13. About

half of Mr. Smith’s time entries are block-billed and to a lesser degree than Mr. McPhedran’s. See Smith Timesheets

at 21–22.

17

See McPhedran Timesheets at 9, 11 (billing 6.8 hours on June 14, 2023, and 6.5 hours on Jan. 16, 2024,

for various block-billed tasks).

11

Defendants filed their answer, Answer to Am. Compl. [ECF No. 28]. Only plaintiff-intervenor

PacifiCorp18 opposed the motion for summary judgment. See PacifiCorp’s Mem. Partial Opp’n to

Summ. J. [ECF No. 31] (“PC Opp’n.”). The Plaintiffs replied to the opposition. Pls.’ Reply to

PacifiCorp’s Mem. Partial Opp’n [ECF No. 33]. PacifiCorp also moved to stay the proceedings

as relevant to Utah and Wyoming. PacifiCorp’s Proposed Mot. to Stay [ECF No. 30]. Both the

Plaintiffs and Defendants opposed this motion. Pls.’ Resp. in Opp’n to Mot. to Stay [ECF No. 35];

Defs.’ Resp. to Mot. to Stay [ECF No. 36].

In their fee motion, the Plaintiffs initially claimed to have voluntarily excluded all “hours

spent reviewing and responding to motions to intervene,19 a motion to stay, [and] an opposition to

summary judgment . . . filed by intervenors in this case.” Fee Mot. at 8. But after the Defendants

correctly pointed out that the Plaintiffs did not remove all such hours, see Defs.’ Resp. at 9–10 &

n.6, the Plaintiffs voluntarily removed 9.7 hours, see Pls.’ Reply at 7. However, the 9.7 hours are

only a subset of the leftover hours that the Defendants identified and that the Plaintiffs originally

promised to exclude. Specifically, the Plaintiffs did not eliminate all time spent responding to

PacifiCorp’s opposition to the Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion.20

The Court will exclude all remaining hours the Plaintiffs spent responding to PacifiCorp’s

filings. To start, the Plaintiffs promised to remove them. See Fee Mot. at 8. But even without

that promise, the Court would exclude the hours. The Plaintiffs claim that Environmental Defense

18

PacifiCorp is a regional utility company with extensive operations in Utah and Wyoming, two states whose

SIP submissions are part of the claims in the amended complaint. See PacifiCorp’s Mem. Partial Opp’n to Summ. J.

[ECF No. 31] (“PC Opp’n.”) at 5–6.

19

Aside from plaintiff-intervenor PacifiCorp, North Dakota and Nevada moved to intervene on behalf of the

Defendants. See North Dakota’s Mot. to Intervene [ECF No. 18]; Nevada’s Mot. to Intervene [ECF No. 27]. The

Plaintiffs voluntarily removed hours regarding Nevada’s motion, Pls. Reply at 7 n.5 (0.9 hours on Jan. 9, 2024), and

did not log hours regarding North Dakota’s motion.

20

See McPhedran Timesheets at 11 (2.5 hours on Jan. 12, 2024; 3.0 hours on Jan. 14, 2024; 1.5 hours on Jan.

15, 2024; 6.5 hours on Jan. 16, 2024).

Fund, Inc. v. EPA (“EDF”),

672 F.2d 42

(D.C. Cir. 1982), confirms that “courts have found similar

attorney hours compensable.” Fee Mot. at 8. However, it shows no such thing. In EDF, the D.C.

Circuit rejected the defendant EPA’s request to remove hours that the plaintiff had logged litigating

against third-party intervenors. See 672 F.2d at 55. But this was because the positions of the EPA

and the intervenors were “closely aligned.” Id. at 56 n.8. It was therefore reasonable to require

the EPA to pay the plaintiff for time spent working against the intervenors. Here, PacifiCorp did

not intervene “in the defense of” the EPA, see id. at 56—indeed, it intervened as a plaintiff. It

sought only to continue its own litigation against the EPA in its preferred venues. See PC Opp’n.

at 1–2.

The more relevant precedent, offered by the Defendants, is Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Department of Commerce,

470 F.3d 363

(D.C. Cir. 2006). There, the D.C. Circuit denied fee

recovery to a plaintiff for work done against third parties when (1) litigation disputes between the

plaintiff and third parties were not initiated or pursued by the defendant; (2) the third parties were

not represented by the defendant; and (3) the defendant had neither authority nor control over the

third parties. See

id. at 374

. All three points are true here as well.

Beyond the 9.7 hours already deducted by the Plaintiffs, the Court identifies approximately

13.5 hours the Plaintiffs spent replying to PacifiCorp’s opposition to summary judgment. The

Court will completely remove 5.5 of these hours spent entirely on the reply.21 The remaining 8

hours are block-billed with tasks either not related to the reply or inadequately described.22 The

Plaintiffs’ voluntary 10 percent reduction accounts for the existence of block-billing but does not

remove the ineligible reply time embedded in the block-billed entries. Given that precise excision

21

See McPhedran Timesheets at 11 (2.5 hours on Jan. 12, 2024; 3.0 hours on Jan. 14, 2024). While these

entries are block-billed, they are entirely about the Plaintiffs’ reply to PacifiCorp’s opposition to summary judgment.

22

See

id.

(1.5 hours on Jan. 15, 2024; 6.5 hours on Jan. 16, 2024).

13

is impossible, the Court will further reduce these entries by 40 percent. Cf. Tridico,

235 F. Supp.

3d at 110

(halving subset of requested fee associated with overbilled travel time). That totals to

an 8.7-hour reduction.

The Defendants also challenge hours the Plaintiffs spent working on their summary

judgment motion, which the Plaintiffs filed in the midst of settlement negotiations in December

2023. See Defs.’ Resp. at 10. The Plaintiffs say that they filed the motion “in light of [the] EPA’s

sluggish efforts to respond to the complaint and settlement proposals” and note that the parties

reached the consent decree only after the Plaintiffs filed the motion. Fee Mot. at 8; Pls.’ Reply at

6. The Defendants counter that the Plaintiffs present no evidence that the motion affected the

underlying case’s ultimate disposition. See Defs.’ Resp. at 10.

The Court agrees with the Defendants and will remove from the fee calculation the time

the Plaintiffs spent working on the summary judgment motion. “[T]he inquiry before the Court is

whether the hours expended by Plaintiff’s counsel on [the summary judgment motion] were

necessary and reasonable.” Sierra Club,

235 F. Supp. 3d at 68

. As in Sierra Club, the answer here

is no. Consider the similarities to that case: (1) counsel worked on the motion before “[the] EPA

was required to answer”; (2) the EPA gave no indication that it would “aggressively litigate” the

lawsuit; and (3) the Plaintiffs would have had “ample opportunity” to pursue a dispositive motion

after the EPA filed its Answer.

Id.

The only relevant distinction from Sierra Club is that here the Plaintiffs actually filed their

summary judgment motion. Even so, the Plaintiffs do not establish why the motion was “necessary

[or] reasonable.”

Id.

Before and after the motion, the Defendants asked for, and the Plaintiffs

never opposed, a series of extensions to negotiate for the consent decree.23 If, as the Plaintiffs

23

See, e.g., Defs.’ Unopposed Mot. Extension to Answer [ECF No. 12]; First Extension to Respond to Mot.

Summ. J.; Final Defs.’ Unopposed Mot. Extension to Respond to Mot. Summ. J. [ECF No. 49].

14

claim, the summary judgment motion was necessary to light a fire under the “sluggish” Defendants,

Fee Mot. at 8, it’s hard to see why the Plaintiffs never opposed any of the extension requests. And

even if there was an explanation, the Plaintiffs have not provided it to the Court.

The Court identifies up to 49.7 hours billed for the summary judgment motion. Of these,

the Court will completely remove 14.4 hours spent solely on the motion.24 The remaining time is

inextricably interspersed with unrelated tasks in 35.3 hours of block-billed entries.25 Because the

Court is unable to remove that time surgically, it will instead apply an additional 40 percent

deduction on the 35.3 hours. Cf. Tridico,

235 F. Supp. 3d at 110

(halving subset of requested fee

associated with overbilled travel time). This results in a total 28.52-hour reduction for work on

the summary judgment motion.

c. Fee agreements

The Defendants assert that “[t]he government should not have to pay for administrative

matters relating to the formal relationship” between the Plaintiffs and their attorneys, including fee

agreements. Role Models,

353 F.3d at 973

; see also Miller v. Holzmann,

, 26

n.40 (D.D.C. 2008). The Court agrees. 26 Mr. McPhedran recorded fee discussions with the

26

The Court is aware of cases allowing the plaintiff’s counsel to bill for time spent on retainer agreements.

See Czarniewy v. District of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 02-1496 (HHK),

2005 WL 692081

, *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 25, 2005);

Bailey v. District of Columbia,

839 F. Supp. 888, 891

(D.D.C. 1993). But both were IDEA cases, whose counsel were

“operating either as solo practitioners or in small firms” who lacked “the manpower of a major law firm.”

Id.

On the

other hand, Earthjustice has fifteen offices and employs “200+ full-time lawyers,” including Mr. McPhedran. About

Earthjustice, EARTHJUSTICE, https://earthjustice.org/about (last visited July 22, 2025). The Court takes judicial notice

of background information found on the website of the Plaintiffs’ counsel. Cf. Mundo Verde Pub. Charter Sch. v.

Solokov,

315 F. Supp. 3d 374

, 381 n.3 (D.D.C. 2018) (“The court may take judicial notice of representations made

15

Plaintiffs in a heavily block-billed 6.8-hour entry from June 14, 2023. See McPhedran Timesheets

at 9. Unable to discern exactly how much of the 6.8 hours were spent on the retainer, the Court

will discount that entry by 40 percent for a 2.72-hour reduction.

d. Excessive time on complaints

Next, the Defendants take issue with what they believe was excessive time spent on both

complaints. See Defs.’ Resp. at 11. But the Court is not convinced.

First, the Court rejects the Defendants’ objection to the (up to) 21.9 hours the Plaintiffs

spent crafting the initial complaint.27 The Defendants rely mainly on Sierra Club, which found

11.39 hours reasonable for two attorneys to prepare the complaint for a CAA case. See 235 F.

Supp. 3d at 70. But the 21.9 hours here are block-billed, so it is unclear that the Plaintiffs spent

more time on the initial complaint than the counsel did in Sierra Club. And even if the Plaintiffs

spent more than 11.39 hours, Sierra Club did not establish an upper limit of reasonable hours. The

Court does not find it necessary to reduce these hours further.

The Court concludes the same for the 14.1 largely block-billed hours spent on the amended

complaint,28 which the Defendants characterize as a simple, unchallenged update to the initial

complaint. See Defs.’ Resp. at 11. That may well be true when one considers only the words

added. But adding in claims from twenty-seven additional states also requires research and

coordination. Additionally, on account of block-billing, the Plaintiffs did not actually spend all of

on Plaintiff’s website.”); see also United States v. Burroughs,

810 F.3d 833

, 835 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (taking judicial

notice of Google Maps). What’s more, the Plaintiffs did not respond to the Defendants’ objection about the time spent

on the retainer.

27

See McPhedran Timesheets at 9 (June 2, 2023; June 6, 2023; June 7, 2023; June 9, 2023; June 13, 2023;

See McPhedran Timesheets at 9–10 (Aug. 28, 2023; Aug. 31, 2023; Sept. 1, 2023; Oct. 11, 2023; Nov. 9,

2023; Nov. 10, 2023); Smith Timesheets at 21 (Oct. 26, 2023; Nov. 9, 2023; Nov. 10, 2023).

16

the 14.1 hours in question on the amended complaint, nor are they recovering for all that time. The

Court again concludes no additional reductions are necessary.

e. Communications with unidentified individuals and inadequately described tasks

The Defendants also challenge the Plaintiffs’ billing for (1) communications with

unidentified individuals and (2) inadequately described tasks. See Defs.’ Resp. at 11–12. The

Court agrees with these objections.

First, the Court agrees that it is improper to compensate the Plaintiffs for communicating

with individuals for whom the Court has “no other information about their identities or the

substance of the communications.” Defs.’ Resp. at 12. In Role Models, the D.C. Circuit

determined that “time spent dealing with individuals whose roles in the case are never explained”

was “manifestly inadequate” for compensation.

353 F.3d at 971

; see also Michigan v. EPA,

254

F.3d 1087

, 1093–94 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Here, the Plaintiffs’ counsel billed for communications with

individuals such as “Navarro,” “Baron,” “Gilbert,” “Zelaya,” “Rachel K.,” “WH,” “RA,” “KH,”

and “TM.”29 Mr. McPhedran recorded the majority of these communications. It is not clear to the

Court who these individuals are or why the Plaintiffs should be able to bill for time corresponding

with them.

The Defendants also ask for reductions on account of inadequately described tasks that are

part of block-billed entries. See Defs.’ Resp. at 12. The Court agrees. Mr. McPhedran’s time

entries have multiple instances of inadequately described tasks such as “Check prior e-mails,”

“Additional e-mails,” “e-mail to clients,” “e-mails,” “p/c,” “Review notes and prior e-mails,” “call,”

29

See, e.g., McPhedran Timesheets at 9–11 (June 15, 2023; Aug. 16, 2023; Jan. 17, 2024; Jan. 19, 2024; Feb.

28, 2024; Mar. 12, 2024); Smith Timesheets at 21 (June 8, 2023; June 9, 2023; Oct. 12, 2023).

and “legal research” without any more context.30 “Such generic entries are inadequate to meet a

fee applicant’s heavy obligation to present well-documented claims.” Role Models,

353 F.3d at

971

(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Michigan,

254 F.3d at 1095

(levying 10 percent

deduction for inadequate descriptions).

In summary, the Court agrees with the Defendants that the Plaintiffs inappropriately billed

for time corresponding with unknown individuals and inadequately described many of their billed

tasks. The majority of these issues reside in block-billed entries, making targeted removals

difficult. Because these issues appear predominantly in Mr. McPhedran’s entries, the Court will

additionally discount Mr. McPhedran’s billed hours by 10 percent and Mr. Smith’s by 5 percent

on top of the voluntary 10 percent cut for block-billing, while excluding entries from the previous

sections that the Court will remove completely or reduce by 40 percent. These reductions amount

to 8.19 hours for Mr. McPhedran and 1.935 hours for Mr. Smith.

f. Other challenges

Lastly, the Defendants take issue with the Plaintiffs’ billing for time spent on (1)

researching the Defendants’ “request to extend [their] deadline to answer” and (2) clerical

activities such as “researching how to file documents using the court’s ECF system.” Defs.’ Resp.

at 13. The Defendants highlight two entries that amount to less than five hours of block-billed

time. See McPhedran Timesheets at 9–10 (Aug. 28, 2023; Nov. 10, 2023).31

30

See, e.g., McPhedran Timesheets at 9–11 (June 6, 2023; June 14, 2023; Oct. 20, 2023; Nov. 8, 2023; Nov.

20, 2023; Jan. 19, 2024; Feb. 28, 2024; May 1, 2024).

31

Although the Defendants point to a Oct. 10, 2023, entry by Mr. McPhedran, Defs.’ Resp. at 13, no such

entry exists. Based on the timesheet descriptions, the Court assumes the Defendants challenge the Nov. 10, 2023,

entry.

18

The Court declines to reduce the Plaintiffs’ hours further based on small, “nit-picking”

objections that the D.C. Circuit discourages. See Alfonso v. District of Columbia,

The roundtable brought urgent attention to cuts to clean energy tax credits and their far-reaching impacts on the region’s environment, economy, and energy security.

These cuts threaten clean energy goals and could also impact the reliability of Washington’s power grid at a time when energy demand is growing rapidly.

How key changes to federal policy affect Washington state

Recent federal law changes removed clean energy tax credits that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. These cuts are expected to heavily impact Washington residents and businesses. The roundtable focused on examining the consequences of cuts to clean energy tax credits outlined in recent federal legislation.

According to data presented at the roundtable, the cuts could cost Washington over $8.7 billion in clean energy investments. The U.S. Climate Alliance estimates that 21,800 Washington residents will lose their jobs by 2030 due to these policy changes. Additionally, households face a 12% increase in electricity costs, or about $115 more per year by 2029.

Voices from the roundtable

Senator Patty Murray

Senator Murray highlighted that Washington families could lose between $390 to $900 in annual energy bill savings.

Joe Nguyen, State of Washington Commerce Director

Joe pointed to immediate impacts on communities, especially in rural areas.

Dawn Lindell, Seattle City Light General Manager and CEO

Dawn explained how the cuts affect utility planning and costs.

Christine Reid, Political Director for IBEW Local 77

Christine described immediate job losses.

Gregg Small, Executive Director of Climate Solutions

Gregg provided context about energy trends.

Brandon Provalenko, General Manager of Western Solar

Brandon described the direct business impacts, stating how policy uncertainty affects both commercial projects and residential solar adoption.

Washington’s Clean Energy Future

Despite these challenges, the roundtable participants emphasized their commitment to continuing clean energy development. Senator Murray noted her ongoing efforts: “I’m using every bit of leverage I have as Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee to fight back and reject these cuts.”

City Light and other utilities continue planning for clean energy expansion, though at higher costs. Labor unions and solar companies are adapting, ready to resume work as soon as projects move forward.

While federal policy changes create significant obstacles, Washington leaders continue working toward a sustainable energy future for families and businesses.

Campbell coal plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was set to go dark on May 31, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order on May 23 forcing the plant to remain open past its expiration date.
State energy regulators have also ensured that the plant’s retirement would not impact grid reliability.
“The Campbell coal plant is out of date, costs more to operate than other electricity generation options, and is one of the worst polluters in the state,” Slaughter said.
“The only energy emergency is the one being created by this unprecedented power grab by federal authorities.”","Nine environmental advocacy groups on Thursday redoubled their opposition to federal efforts extending the life of a West Michigan coal plant originally slated to close earlier this year.

Although the J.H. Campbell coal plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was set to go dark on May 31, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order on May 23 forcing the plant to remain open past its expiration date.

Despite agreements between Consumers, state energy regulators, the Department of Attorney General and multiple parties representing customer and environmental interests to close the plant down, the Department of Energy justified the move by arguing it was under the authority of the Federal Power Act, and fell in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring a national energy emergency.

On June 18, the environmental law group Earthjustice filed a challenge on behalf of 10 public interest groups requesting a rehearing on the department’s order.

In their request, the groups highlighted the negative environmental impacts of the plant while rejecting the Trump administration’s argument that the plant is needed to prevent disruptions to the state’s energy grid. State energy regulators have also ensured that the plant’s retirement would not impact grid reliability.

However, the order went unanswered, prompting nine of those groups to file a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, with Earthjustice and the Sierra Club leading the charge.

Derrell Slaughter, Michigan policy director of climate and energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said people in Michigan and the Midwest should not be stuck paying the cost of a nonexistent emergency with their health and electric bills.

“The Campbell coal plant is out of date, costs more to operate than other electricity generation options, and is one of the worst polluters in the state,” Slaughter said. “This petition is very much in line with the State of Michigan’s commitment to pursue a clean, affordable, and reliable grid that protects both ratepayers and public health.”

In an interview with CNN, Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, which oversees the state’s energy utilities, estimated that the cost for keeping the plant open could cost tens of millions of dollars on the low end.

The Natural Resources Defense Council also noted that the plant releases several millions of pounds of health-harming pollution and more than 10 billion pounds of climate-harming carbon dioxide into the air each year. That’s in addition to releasing roughly 100,000 pounds of water pollution into Lake Michigan every year, including 10,000 pounds of toxic metals.

Shannon Fisk, an attorney and director of state electric sector advocacy for Earthjustice, emphasized that the utility, alongside state regulators and stakeholders, all agreed the plant should be retired.

“While the administration might not like that fact, a fabricated energy emergency does not give them the authority to saddle Michiganders with the costs and pollution of a coal plant that the utility has already replaced with other resources,” Fisk said. “The only energy emergency is the one being created by this unprecedented power grab by federal authorities.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot-2025-05-24-0652591753459412.png?h=e9fb820e&itok=HThMHFFm,N,,2025-07-25 22:02:33.769988

Brake dust is high in copper, and it's apparently even more harmful than diesel soot.

The brake pads in EVs last a lot longer, up to 100,000 miles in real-world taxi use.

The lack of tailpipe emissions is the main way electric vehicles are seen as better for air quality, especially in cities packed with cars. But there is another important source of emissions that they do much better for than combustion cars, and it’s hardly ever talked about: brake dust pollution.

EVs have exactly the same friction braking system as gas cars, but because they rely on their motors for deceleration, they don’t need to put pad to disk as often to reduce speed. In fact, in EVs with one-pedal driving, where simply lifting off the accelerator pedal brings the car to a stop, you hardly ever touch the brake pedal in normal driving.

Sure, if a runaway dog sprints across the street and you have to stop quickly to save its life, you will apply the brakes, but for the vast majority of normal driving scenarios, lifting off is enough. Using the regenerative braking function not only saves your brake pads from wear, but it also puts energy back into the battery, essentially giving your EV a bit of free extra range.

Limiting brake dust emissions is important because it’s pretty nasty stuff. It’s made up of microscopic particles that easily get airborne and end up in your lungs. Modern brake pads thankfully no longer contain asbestos, a known carcinogen, but they do have a high concentration of copper and other elements that pose serious health concerns.

One study published earlier this year in Particle and Fibre Toxicology had some pretty alarming findings about just how bad brake dust is for humans. It concluded that particulate matter (PM) “from copper-enriched non-asbestos organic, and ceramic brake pads as inducing the greatest oxidative stress, inflammation, and pseudohypoxic HIF activation (a pathway implicated in diseases associated with air pollution exposure, including cancer, and pulmonary fibrosis), as well as perturbation of metabolism, and metal homeostasis compared with brake wear PM from low- or semi-metallic pads, and also, importantly, diesel exhaust PM.”

Yes, you read that right: particulates from brake dust are worse for you than those produced by diesel engines. Modern diesels have had particulate filters for nearly two decades now, drastically limiting the amount of fine particulates they spew into the air, while the amount of brake dust emissions isn’t controlled in any way. What goes into making brake pads remains largely unregulated, although Washington and California passed laws to limit the amount of copper that goes into them.

The fact that an EV’s brake pads see much less use than those in a combustion car is evidenced by how much longer they last. British automotive services company RAC quotes information from a taxi company operating Nissan Leaf cabs, which said these cars’ brake pads last between 80,000 and 100,000 miles before they have to be replaced. That is many times better than a combustion car, no matter how carefully it’s driven.

The fact that EVs are responsible for a lot less brake dust emission is another advantage they have. But how much less brake dust do they actually produce? One recent European Union-funded study published by EIT Urban Mobility found that EVs can potentially emit up to 83% less brake dust than a typical gas car.

The percentage decreases progressively the less electrified a vehicle is. For plug-in hybrids, it’s 66% lower brake wear emissions, while for non-plug-in hybrids, it ranges between 10-48%, presumably depending on how powerful their electric motor is and how much deceleration it can provide.

For pure EVs, though, 83% represents a drastic reduction, and manufacturers are even considering placing the brakes inside the electric drive unit to completely eliminate particulate emissions. Mercedes showed off its idea for in-drive brakes, which don’t produce particles as they wear, which it plans to use in its future EVs, although not the next generation of electric models, likely the one after that.

Volkswagen chose a much simpler path to achieve the same goal. All of the group’s vehicles built on the MEB platform, even those with dual-motor powertrains producing in excess of 300 horsepower, have drum brakes on the rear axle. Drums don’t quite provide the same stopping power as disks and can’t dissipate heat as quickly, so they’re not suitable for performance applications. But they are completely enclosed and since most of the friction braking is done through the front wheels, VW considered that having drums on the rear was a good solution that could essentially last the life of the car without having to be serviced.

EVs do have one downside brought by their extra weight, more brutal torque delivery and superior power compared to gas cars: their tires wear out faster. This is also a source of emissions that affects air quality. However, while EVs can’t escape the physics brought by their extra heft, their tires don’t wear out anywhere near as quickly as some deliberately misleading headlines might have you believe, although there isn’t a definitive number stating how that’s different from a combustion car.

So if you own an EV that allows you to choose the level of brake regeneration and offers one-pedal driving, and you’re not using it, maybe you should give it a second chance. It will not only help your brakes last a lot longer, but it also means the air in your area has fewer nasty particulates floating around, potentially causing all sorts of health issues.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/1ZEZB3/s1/zeekr-7x.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 22:01:54.831534

Governments need to assess administrative capacity when proposing new rules, allocate resources accordingly, and create space to manage trade-offs transparently when they arise.","The Environmental Protection Agency’s 1990s Acid Rain Program is often touted as a landmark environmental initiative which reduced sulfur dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants. But Constantin Kaplaner, Christoph Knill and Yves Steinebach, find that the introduction of this program meant that unrelated inspections and enforcement were scaled back. This form of policy triage, they write, is a result of limited administrative capacity which sees some implementation tasks prioritized over others.

Governments typically respond to new societal demands by introducing new policies. But recent research suggests that this strategy can sometimes backfire. Rather than strengthening state capacity, the steady accumulation of policies – the “policy stock” – can overwhelm public agencies and reduce their effectiveness. Policy stocks are expanding across countries and sectors, yet administrative capacity (the ability to deliver policies) often remains flat. As governments continue to adopt more rules than they repeal, a growing gap emerges between what implementation bodies are expected to do and what they can realistically deliver.

This mismatch increasingly contributes to implementation shortfalls—not due to mismanagement, but because the system is being asked to do too much. When new responsibilities are layered onto already overstretched administrations, something usually has to give. In new work, we show how this plays out in practice: as the US Environmental Protection Agency took on a landmark environmental initiative in the 1990s, it quietly reduced enforcement in other areas—highlighting how limited capacity forces agencies to trade-offs, even when the policies themselves are well-designed.

Why more policy can mean less enforcement

Across countries, policymakers are constantly responding to new demands by introducing additional regulations. But while legislation is often easy to pass, it’s much harder to implement. Real enforcement depends on people—inspectors, analysts, administrators—who are often already stretched across competing tasks. And when new mandates arrive without new resources, trade-offs are no longer optional. They become necessary.

We focused on a case that offered a rare window into this process: the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its implementation of the Acid Rain Program in the 1990s. This program, widely praised as a pioneering environmental initiative, introduced a cap-and-trade system to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants. But beneath the surface, something else was happening. As the EPA took on this major new responsibility, it quietly scaled back inspections in other areas not related to the new program. This shift wasn’t a case of mismanagement or inefficiency. It was simply a matter of administrative overload.

The logic of “policy triage”

We describe this phenomenon as “policy triage.” Borrowing the concept from emergency medicine, it refers to the deliberate prioritization of some implementation tasks over others in the face of limited capacity. When agencies can’t do everything, they must choose where to focus. That often means new or politically important policies receive attention, while older or less visible ones are deferred—or dropped entirely.

In our study, we went beyond theory. Using statistical analysis, we compared EPA regions that were involved early in implementing the Acid Rain Program to those brought in later. The results showed that regions affected in the program’s first phase saw a significant decline—up to 17 percent— in the inspection probability of facilities unrelated to the new regulation.

And it wasn’t just the probability of inspections that changed. The type of enforcement shifted as well. On-site inspections, which are more resource-intensive, declined the most. Meanwhile, remote (off-site) inspections increased slightly. These patterns signal how administrators were adapting their work to cope with a growing workload under tight constraints.

A quasi-experiment in stress

The phased structure of the Acid Rain Program allowed us to observe these effects more clearly. Phase 1, starting in 1995, applied to a select group of heavily polluting power plants concentrated in certain EPA regions. Phase 2, launched in 2000, expanded the program nationwide. This staggered rollout created a quasi-experiment: some regions were “treated” earlier, others later, allowing us to isolate the causal impact of the program on unrelated enforcement activity.

Crucially, the decline in inspections wasn’t due to changes in monitoring technology or to the shifting of responsibility to other levels of government. The pattern remained even after controlling for these alternative explanations.

The missing piece: administrative capacity

A key reason for this enforcement drop is simple: affected EPA regions didn’t receive additional staff to carry out the new responsibilities. Data from the US Office of Personnel Management confirmed that personnel levels remained flat, even as regulatory duties expanded. The new policy was layered onto existing workloads with no additional capacity given.

This points to a deeper structural problem in democratic governance. While it’s politically attractive to introduce new policies, it’s far less rewarding to invest in the long-term administrative resources required to implement them. Reforming or removing outdated regulations is difficult and often politically unpopular. As a result, policies accumulate over time, but implementation capacity does not.

It’s not just an American problem

To understand whether this phenomenon was unique to the US context, we conducted interviews with 28 environmental regulators in Germany, Italy, and Portugal. Despite different administrative traditions, a common theme emerged: when agencies are overwhelmed, they prioritize.

A German official described how routine compliance checks had been sidelined because “you can no longer do everything.” In Portugal, inspection schedules were adjusted based on risk scores, often leaving lower-priority issues unattended. These examples suggest that policy triage is not an anomaly. It’s a widespread response to a growing mismatch between what governments commit to and what their administrations can deliver.

Shrinking the state while adding more responsibilities

Our findings come at a time when some governments are focused on shrinking the state, not expanding it. But the reality on the ground is that public agencies are already operating at the edge of their capacity. Adding new responsibilities—or cutting staff—without strategic planning doesn’t just lead to inefficiency. It leads to loss of coverage, blind spots in enforcement, and declining public trust.

Policy triage, while often unavoidable, comes with real costs. It creates uneven enforcement, undermines the legitimacy of regulation, and obscures accountability. Because these trade-offs happen quietly, their effects can go unnoticed—until a crisis reveals what’s been neglected.

A call for administrative realism

Our research underscores a simple point: policy doesn’t end at the moment it’s passed. Its effectiveness depends on the resources and systems that carry it forward. Without the administrative muscle to match political ambition, even the best-designed reforms risk failure.

That doesn’t mean abandoning new policies. But it does mean treating implementation as a central part of the policymaking process—not an afterthought. Governments need to assess administrative capacity when proposing new rules, allocate resources accordingly, and create space to manage trade-offs transparently when they arise.

Some level of policy triage may always be necessary. But if left invisible and unmanaged, it erodes both policy performance and institutional credibility. A more honest, capacity-aware approach is not only better governance—it’s essential for ensuring that policies work as they are intended to.",https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/58/files/2025/07/Smokestack-smog-Unsplash-747x420-1.png,N,,2025-07-25 22:01:44.704094

Technologies that are set to be supported via this Accelerator include electric vehicles (EVs), electricity networks, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen, nuclear, batteries and offshore wind.

The government believes this will “enable the UK to seize growth opportunities through the transition to net zero, building on our world-leading decarbonisation track record and strong deployment offer”.

The EPA imminently is expected to repeal the so-called “endangerment finding,” which dates back to 2009 and established the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. It subsequently charged the federal government with regulating them, said Joe Goffman, a former assistant administrator in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in March that the agency would work to erase that legal underpinning for emissions regulations, decrying the finding as the “holy grail of the climate change religion.” In a Friday call with media members, Goffman said he expected the agency not only would rescind the finding that vehicle emissions are harmful, but also anticipated the agency would end all emissions standards for passenger cars and light- and heavy-duty trucks.

Goffman said rescinding the endangerment finding “all but abandons the public health mission” of the EPA.

“There is a vast literature created by the EPA itself as well as peer-reviewed experts who have made the case again and again and again and again, the net benefits of air pollution regulation and climate regulation are enormous,” Goffman said.

In a statement provided to Inside Climate News, the EPA said it was preparing a proposal.

“On Monday, June 30, 2025, EPA sent over its ‘Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards’ proposal to the Office of Management and Budget, which was originally announced on March 12, 2025,” the statement says. “The proposal will be published for public notice and comment once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the Administrator.”

There is overwhelming scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions, primarily those associated with the burning of fossil fuels, are warming the global climate and leading to more extreme events such as the wildfires that engulfed Los Angeles this winter and Hurricane Helene, which carved out a vast swath of destruction from southwest Florida to western North Carolina last September.

The starkest example of how the warming climate is harming human health is hotter temperatures, said John Balbus, the former deputy assistant secretary for climate change and health equity at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Biden administration, who also participated in the Friday call. Warmer air holds more moisture, leading to events such as this summer’s flash floods in Texas. Hotter temperatures also can fuel hurricanes and dry out plant material that fuels wildfires.

“The science is very strong, but you only have to open your eyes to what has been going on in the U.S. in the past 10 years to know that the climate has changed,” Balbus said.

“Any move to rescind the endangerment finding is not just a denial of the science,” he added. “It’s also a denial of common sense.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2215955909-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 21:00:21.649916

Their advantages include high efficiency (a lower heating value of 60%), fuel flexibility, combined heat and power (CHP) capabilities, and hybrid/gas turbine cycle capabilities, per the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). However, they also suffer from high temperature corrosion and breakdown of cell components, long start-up times compared to other forms of generation, and a limited number of shutdowns.

Bloom Energy has previously reached onsite power agreements with with Equinix, American Electric Power (AEP), and Quanta Computing. To date, Bloom Energy has deployed over 400 MW to power data centers worldwide.

Earlier this year, Bloom Energy released results from a survey that found data center developers continue to turn to onsite power amid rising demand. The latest survey results found that by 2030, 38% of facilities are expected to incorporate primary onsite generation, up from 13% a year ago. 27% of facilities expect being fully powered by onsite generation by 2030, up from just 1% a year ago.

Historically, data centers have used onsite power mostly for backup purposes.

The Pacific Northwest is already home to numerous data center facilities, with plans to build more.

The data center tech giants — also called hyperscalers — are seeking clean power sources given that they’ve set ambitious goals for shrinking their carbon impacts.
Clean energy advocates say there’s a disconnect between those ambitions and policy that limits options for new power.","As energy demand spikes due to AI-driven data center expansions and the shift to electrification of transportation and other sectors, a sweeping bill signed this month by President Trump cuts resources for deploying renewable power, Washington state leaders said Friday.

Washington Sen. Patty Murray convened a roundtable in Seattle on Friday to highlight the potential energy impacts of the “Big Beautiful Bill” and issue a call to action. She warned of rising utility costs for businesses and residents and lost jobs in the energy sector.

“It’s going to set us back in terms of our access to clean energy,” Murray said. “It’s so important that people know why this is coming and that we continue to raise our voices to fight back.”

Joe Nguyen, director of the state’s Department of Commerce, was blunt in his criticism of the bill in a GeekWire interview following the roundtable.

“This is a direct attack on tech,” Nguyen said. “Without clean energy, we don’t have technology.”

That’s particularly true, he added, as companies such as Amazon and Microsoft are building out capacity to meet AI demands.

The Pacific Northwest is already home to numerous data center facilities, with plans to build more. In Washington alone, the Republican-backed bill could decrease electric capacity by 18 gigawatts over the next decade — or the equivalent of two Seattles’ worth of energy — said Gregg Small, executive director of Climate Solutions, speaking at the event.

The legislation repeals tax cuts for renewable power efforts including wind and solar installations that were included in the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. At the same time, the GOP measure bolsters support for fossil fuel power.

President Trump staunchly defends the nixing of benefits for wind and solar, calling the intermittent power sources “unreliable,” and even some critics of the president acknowledge that tax cuts for renewable power should phase out over time.

Others say the support makes sense to get new energy deployed as quickly as possible. Renewable power made up 93% of the U.S. energy capacity that came online last year.

“Even if you’re pro-fossil fuels, pro-coal, that is very expensive and it takes a long time to build. And also, the market is not demanding that right now,” Nguyen told GeekWire.

The data center tech giants — also called hyperscalers — are seeking clean power sources given that they’ve set ambitious goals for shrinking their carbon impacts. The AI boom is making it increasingly difficult to reach their targets, with Microsoft and Amazon both reporting rising carbon emissions.

At the same time, Trump this week announced his “AI Action Plan” to accelerate data center growth in the U.S. and support America’s leadership in AI. Clean energy advocates say there’s a disconnect between those ambitions and policy that limits options for new power.

“For us to be leaders in that [AI] space, it requires hyperscalers. It requires energy for those hyperscalers,” Nguyen said. “So limiting the amount of energy we can produce is counterintuitive in terms of trying to be a dominant player in the AI space.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250725_183457731.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 19:01:13.193197

It’s worth noting that the cost we’re incurring extends far beyond slower progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
The second Trump term is attacking climate policy with a ferocity we didn’t see in the first.","This week fresh rumblings from the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency emerged, outlining more anti-climate science plans — just as the International Court of Justice took a defining step to safeguard the planet.

The EPA, under the direction of Administrator Lee Zeldin, appears increasingly serious about scrapping the “endangerment finding,” a rule that serves as the fulcrum of U.S. climate action. Or, to borrow Zeldin’s words, “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”

The EPA, under the direction of Administrator Lee Zeldin, appears increasingly serious about scrapping the “endangerment finding,” a rule that serves as the fulcrum of U.S. climate action.

The finding, dating to 2009, indicates that “the elevated concentrations of the six greenhouse gases in the atmosphere — carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) — endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” In addition, the rule identifies motor vehicles as a culprit of the greenhouse gas emissions that sully the air and jeopardize our collective health.

It’s hard to overstate the significance of this rule. Regulating greenhouse gas emissions is essential to have any chance of mitigating the climate crisis, and the endangerment finding supplies the legal muscle to do so. Without this foundational leverage for tackling one of the most existential threats of our time, it’s virtually inconceivable how the U.S. could remain a meaningful player in global climate efforts.

The United Nations’ top court won’t be too pleased about that. As it turns out, on Wednesday, the ICJ issued a first-of-its-kind advisory opinion on climate change that starkly diverges from the narrative playing out in the Trump administration.

While Trump has infamously mocked climate change as “a great hoax,” the ICJ unanimously declared that international law obliges “the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.""

While the EPA has couched its rationale for reconsidering the endangerment finding in language about “lowering the cost of living for American families,” the ICJ posited that “a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a precondition for the enjoyment of many human rights, such as the right to life, the right to health and the right to an adequate standard of living, including access to water, food and housing.”

The court’s opinion, though considered nonbinding, has inspired some hope.

More than 130 countries supported Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation that spearheaded the efforts to bring this case to the ICJ. This matters both practically and symbolically. As the Trump administration has all but forfeited the U.S.’s role in global climate leadership, many have wondered whether this move would offer convenient guise for other big emitters to do the same. Though it’s perhaps too early to gauge whether this pretext will, for example, lower the threshold for what counts as ambitious commitments, there’s little evidence so far of widespread backsliding or a domino effect of disengagement in climate action.

It’s worth noting that the cost we’re incurring extends far beyond slower progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

Instead, the U.S appears to be standing on lonely ground. As the international community inches toward a framework that increasingly recognizes the indivisibility of environmental protection, public health and human rights, Americans are left holding the tatters of a Trumpian “America First” agenda that, for some baffling reason, is concomitant with polluted air.

It’s worth noting that the cost we’re incurring extends far beyond slower progress on curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Our climate commitments are not merely being postponed. This is no longer a matter of climate change being demoted to a back-burner issue. We’re not just playing another round of kick-the-policy-can-down-the-road until someone remembers our world is on fire.

No, what we’re witnessing now is a full-on hollowing out. We’re facing a fundamental dismantling of levers — institutional, scientific and diplomatic — that risks leaving us with too little to rebuild from.

The second Trump term is attacking climate policy with a ferocity we didn’t see in the first. As this approach pulls us further away from international norms and trusted partners, it stands to erode both our planet’s prospects and our capacity to reclaim what we lose.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250312-lee-zeldin-ew-306p-40790e.jpg",N,,2025-07-25 20:03:13.327883

Mary Kay Inc.’s Cadillac incentive might be pink but is is also going green.

The multi-level marketing company is transforming its beloved pink Cadillac incentive into an electric vehicle. The pink Cadillac Optiq (pronounced Optic) made its debut during Mary Kay’s annual Seminar, hosted for the first time in the vibrant city of Charlotte, North Carolina.

The transition from internal combustion to electric symbolizes more than just a vehicle upgrade, it marks a recharged vision for the future of the iconic beauty brand, according to the company.

The new Cadillac model is a significant step forward in Mary Kay’s commitment to innovation, environmental responsibility, and meeting expectations of the next generation of both Mary Kay independent sales force members and their customers, per a press release.

A 60-second spot shows off the new Cadillac with the superimposed copy “Same Legacy. New Energy.” It includes the disclaimer that only the top 1% of Mary Kay employees “earns the use of a career car through their Mary Kay businesses.”

The iconic pink Cadillac was born in 1968 when Mary Kay Ash purchased a Cadillac Coupe De Ville from a Dallas dealership and promptly had it painted to match the pale pink Mary Kay lip and eye palette. General Motors later named the color Mary Kay Pink Pearl, and the shade is exclusive to Mary Kay.

“Mary Kay pink Cadillacs are very rare vehicles,” according to Jalopnik. “The pink pearl color is reserved exclusively for Mary Kay Inc., and all Mary Kay vehicles are only leased for two years. Once the lease period ends, the vehicles are returned to the dealer where they are repainted the factory color. Finding a Mary Kay pink Cadillac for sale doesn't happen often, but some have slipped through the cracks through the years.”

Should the rep not want the car, they instead receive a significant bonus of $900 per month — though 90% of people who qualify for it choose to take the car.

The Mary Kay pink Cadillac symbolizes accomplishment, aspiration, and the power of recognition, said Ryan Rogers, chief executive officer of Mary Kay.

“With the introduction of the all-electric Optiq, we’re honoring that iconic legacy while driving into a transformative future—one grounded in our commitment to sustainability and dedication to inspiring and celebrating the achievements of our independent sales force for generations to come,” Rogers says in a release.

GM’s relationship with Mary Kay is built on shared values of innovation, empowerment and excellence, says Ian Hucker, vice president of GM Envolve.

“As the organization takes bold steps into the future with the transition to an electric vehicle, we are proud to stand beside them, supporting a vision that’s not only sustainable but also deeply inspiring,” Hucker says.

***WATCH FULL EVENT HERE; PHOTOS AND B-ROLL HERE***

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, held a roundtable discussion at the Seattle City Light Denny Substation in downtown Seattle with Washington State Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn and labor, clean energy, and business leaders to discuss how cuts to critical clean energy tax credits in President Trump and Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which was recently signed into law—will raise energy prices for Washington state households, kill thousands of clean energy jobs, and put billions of dollars in new investments for Washington state projects at risk.

Joining Senator Murray for the event were Joe Nguyễn, Director, Washington Department of Commerce; Dawn Lindell, CEO of Seattle City Light; Christine Reid, Political Director for IBEW 77; Gregg Small, Executive Director of Climate Solutions; and Brandon Provalenko, General Manager of Western Solar in Bellingham.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act rapidly phases out critical clean energy tax credits that Democrats passed in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and will slow the construction of solar, wind, and battery projects, which made up over 90 percent of new electricity connected to the grid last year. So far in Washington state, the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have generated at least $978 million in new private-led investment across seven energy manufacturing facilities in the state. $8.75 billion in outstanding investments to 27 facilities in Washington are at risk under the cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The U.S. Climate Alliance estimates 21,800 Washingtonians will lose their jobs by 2030 due to the reconciliation bill’s cuts to clean energy and manufacturing tax credits, and Washington households will face a $115 annual increase in their energy bills by 2029. The legislation threatens Washington’s energy security and electric grid reliability by stifling renewable energy development at a time of soaring electricity demand. A one-pager from Energy Innovation on how the energy provisions in the Republican bill will affect Washington state is HERE.

“The fact is, we need clean and renewable energy now more than ever. It’s critical to secure our grid, tackle the climate crisis—and lower costs! That’s why I worked hard to secure clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. Then, Trump and Republicans came in like a wrecking ball—with truly shortsighted and destructive cuts. The harm to our clean energy sector is really immense,” Senator Murray said. “It’s an uphill battle to reverse so much damage, but I am not going to stop fighting. Everyone should know, Trump and Republicans are trying to make even more cuts to clean energy right now in our government funding bills. I’m using every bit of leverage I have as Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee to fight back and reject these cuts. And I’m using my voice—and urging everyone to use theirs as well—to shine a spotlight on what these shortsighted, damaging policy changes mean for businesses and families.”

“This is an attack on Washington’s workers, our economy, and our values. It threatens the jobs we’ve built, makes energy more expensive for families, and puts our competitiveness at risk. These tax credits have brought real investment and real savings to communities across our state. Gutting them now would do real damage — and Washington won’t stand by and let it happen,” said Joe Nguyễn, Director for the Washington Department of Commerce.

“The passing of the Reconciliation Bill directly impacts City Light and its customers by removing critical clean energy tax credits and incentives necessary for public and private investment in new renewable energy and energy efficiency projects,” said Dawn Lindell, General Manager and CEO, Seattle City Light. “It strips away essential support needed to keep pace with load growth forecasts. Every new megawatt of generation we add will cost significantly more than our current energy portfolio. These are costs that we must now pass on to our customers in the electric rates.”

“At a time when we have rapidly rising energy costs and increased needs for power due largely to AI and data centers, we need more energy than ever,” said Gregg Small, Executive Director of Climate Solutions. “Renewables like solar and wind and batteries are the cheapest and fastest energy that we can build. We need to double down and accelerate the building of these resilient power sources. The Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress’ policies do the exact opposite, increasing energy costs for everybody and making it much more likely we will have blackouts at critical times.”

“IBEW 77’s highly trained workforce stands ready to meet the clean energy challenge of the future. Our members—experienced in every facet of utility work, from generation, transmission, safe delivery, and all of the critical supporting classifications—have the skills, adaptability, and drive to build and maintain the advanced energy infrastructure our communities need. But the reduction in clean energy projects threatens this progress. When projects stall, it’s not just jobs at risk—it’s the pace of innovation and the reliability of our energy system that suffers. Our union believes we need to keep building. Investing in clean energy isn’t about today’s economy alone; it’s laying the foundation for a safer, more resilient, and more sustainable future,” said Christine Reid, Political Director for IBEW 77.IBEW 77 is one of the largest outside utility locals in the country, representing about 8,800 members across 34 Washington counties, Northern Idaho, and parts of Montana. Overall, IBEW represents over 20,000 workers in WA state alone. “Our members are on the front lines of energy infrastructure, ensuring the lights stay on and our communities remain connected and safe. In short, these cuts make it harder for new workers to enter the field and for the industry. Our IBEW members are trained and ready to build. We need to build now.”

“This bill will accelerate rising energy costs across Washington, every household and business will feel it in their utility bills,” said Brandon Provalenko, General Manager of Western Solar in Bellingham and a member of the Washington Solar Energy Industries Association (WASEIA). “Fewer families will go solar, fewer small businesses will reduce or eliminate their bills, and we’ll face a slower, more expensive path to producing the power we need to meet our state’s growing energy demand. That’s the wrong direction, especially when solar and storage remain the fastest, cleanest, and most cost-effective solution on the table.”

The cuts to clean energy tax credits in the legislation come at the same time as Trump and the Department of Energy’s decision to illegally cut investments provided by Congress to support the research and development of wind and solar energy, in defiance of legislation President Trump himself signed into law in March. In fiscal year 2024, Congress provided $137 million for the Department of Energy to support wind energy initiatives and provided $318 million to support solar energy. The fiscal year 2025 full-year CR that House Republicans wrote, and President Trump signed into law continued these fiscal year 2024 funding levels. But in a spend plan made public by DOE, the Trump administration revealed it is steering hundreds of millions of dollars designated by Congress to support wind and solar energy to other, favored industries—jeopardizing critical progress and ceding ground on key energy solutions of the future—among other harmful cuts. Instead of funding wind energy initiatives at $137 million, the administration is funding them at $29.8 million (a 78 percent cut), and instead of funding solar initiatives at $318 million, it is funding them at $41.9 million (an 87 percent cut).

Senator Murray has held constant recent events—including multiple events in Washington state—to sound the alarm on Republicans’ devastating reconciliation bill and encourage constituents to raise their voices and call on their Members of Congress to oppose the legislation. Senator Murray and Democrats forced Republicans to take dozens of tough votes over a nonstop 30-hour “vote-a-rama,” which came after Democrats forced a full reading of every word of Republicans’ 940-page bill. Senator Murray spoke repeatedly on the Senate floor during debate over the bill, laying out in detail the harm the legislation would cause. Senator Murray also spoke out repeatedly on the Senate floor against Republicans’ use of a depictive so-called “current policy baseline” to hide the true cost of their deficit-busting tax cuts for billionaires.

To offset the cost of other provisions in the bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) includes significant reforms to Medicaid, Medicare, and Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits that are expected to result in millions of people losing federal healthcare coverage and reduced expenditures by more than $ 1 trillion over a decade. Collectively, the OBBBA’s healthcare provisions amount to the largest changes to healthcare programs since the ACA.

The majority of OBBBA’s healthcare reforms relate to Medicaid and chiefly consist of both eligibility reforms and funding rollbacks. The eligibility reforms include new work requirements for Medicaid, more frequent eligibility reviews, and other provisions to require states to proactively ensure that the program’s application is limited to eligible individuals. The funding rollbacks include both direct rollbacks of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, in certain aspects, and reforms to mechanisms that states may used for financing their share of Medicaid spending, i.e., reducing permissible provider taxes currently used by states to finance Medicaid.

The OBBBA’s reforms to Medicare and ACA premium tax credits are similar in that both will now be limited in coverage to U.S citizens, lawful permanent residents (green card holders), Cuban or Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association Migrants. Coverage for ACA premium tax credits is also eliminated for lawfully present immigrants who would be eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status.

While the OBBBA largely consists of reforms to reduce expenditures, the OBBBA does contain a few provisions to increase healthcare funding. Most prominently, the OBBBA contains a $50 billion rural health relief fund that will be available to rural hospitals. Additionally, there is a temporary 2.5% adjustment to the 2026 Medicare PFS payment rate.

1. Medicaid

A. Reducing fraud and improving enrollment processes

Sec. 71101. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment in Medicare Savings Programs:

Section 71101 prohibits the Secretary from implementing, administering, or enforcing certain provisions stemming from part one of a two-part final rule aimed at simplifying processes for eligible individuals to enroll and retain eligibility in the Medicare Savings Programs (MSPs) until October 1, 2034.1 As background, MSPs are part of state Medicaid programs that help individuals cover the costs of Medicare Part A and Part B premiums. The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule sought to solve “unnecessary administrative burden,” “barriers to enrollment,” and “no regulations to facilitate enrollment in the MSPs.”2

The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule made several regulatory updates of which certain provisions have been halted by Section 71101 until October 1, 2034. The affected provisions include:

Individual enrollment: There are three primary MSP eligibility groups, one of which is the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB). For the QMB, Medicaid pays all of an individual’s Medicare Parts A and B premiums and assumes liability for most associated Medicare cost-sharing charges for people with income that does not exceed 100% of the federal poverty level. In the 2023 Eligibility Final Rule, CMS sought to “codify existing policy that individuals who reside in group payer States and enroll in actual or conditional Part A during the [general enrollment period] can obtain QMB as early as the month Part A entitlement begins.”3The compliance date was set to take effect on April 1, 2026 to “allow States more time to implement this provision.”4

Procedures for determining eligibility for the MSP groups: The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule newly defined “family size” for purpose of MSP eligibility to “include at least the individuals included in the definition of ‘family size’ in the [Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy (LIS)] program.”5 The Medicare Part D LIS program is described in further detail below. This definition includes the applicant, the applicant’s spouse, and all other individuals living in the same household who are related to and dependent on the applicant or applicant’s spouse.6 The compliance date was set to take effect on April 1, 2026.

Medicare Part D LIS program leads data: The Medicare Part D LIS program is administered by Social Security Administration (SSA) and pays Medicare Part D prescription drug premiums and cost-sharing. Most LIS enrollees are deemed eligible for LIS by virtue of their enrollment in Medicaid. Others apply for the benefit by completing an application and submitting it to SSA. Section 113 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) requires SSA to transmit data from LIS applications, i.e., “leads data”, to State Medicaid agencies and that the electronic transmission from SSA ‘‘shall initiate’’ an MSP application. “MIPPA also requires States to accept leads data and act upon such data in the same manner and in accordance with the same deadlines as if the data constituted’ an MSP application submitted by the individual.”7 The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule recognized that not all states initiated an MSP application upon receipt of leads data from SSA and sought to codify in regulation “the statutory requirements for States to maximize the use of leads data to establish eligibility for Medicaid and the MSPs.” To that end, the 2023 Eligibility Final Rule established a new definition of “Low-Income Subsidy Application data (LIS leads data)” at 42 C.F.R. § 435.4 and a process by which the State Medicaid agency must accept and treat received LIS leads data “as an application for eligibility under the [MSP]” at 42 C.F.R. § 435.911(e). The compliance date was set to take effect on April 1, 2026 to allow “for States to come into full compliance with all the provisions in new § 435.911(e) to facilitate MSP enrollment through LIS leads data[.]”8

Determining eligibility for MSPs: The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule set forth in regulation streamlined eligibility and verification processes for individuals applying for MSPs, specifically that the State Medicaid agency “must accept attestation (either self-attestation by the individual or attestation by an adult who is in the applicant's household, as defined in § 435.603(f), or family, as defined in section 36B(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, an authorized representative, or, if the individual is a minor or incapacitated, someone acting responsibly for the individual) of the following income and asset information without requiring further information (including documentation) from the individual.”9 The regulation provides further instruction for “income and interest income,” “non-liquid resources,” “burial funds,” and “life insurance policies.” The compliance date was set to take effect on April 1, 2026.

Sec. 71102. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program.

Section 71102 prohibits the Secretary from implementing, administering, or enforcing certain provisions stemming from part two of a two-part final rule aimed at simplifying the eligibility and enrollment processes for Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Basic Health Program until October 1, 2034.10 The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule sought to address “unnecessary administrative burden” and “barriers to enrollment and retention of coverage for eligible individuals” by implementing “policies designed to address these and other gaps, thereby streamlining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and enrollment processes[.]”11

The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule made several regulatory updates of which certain provisions have been halted by Section 71102 until October 1, 2034. The affected provisions include:

Determination of Eligibility: The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule updated the regulatory text of this provision to include § 435.916, which refers to regularly scheduled renewals of Medicaid eligibility. The text reads: “For each individual who has submitted an application described in § 435.907 or whose eligibility is being renewed in accordance with § 435.916 and who meets the non-financial requirements for eligibility (or for whom the agency is providing a reasonable opportunity to verify citizenship or immigration status in accordance with § 435.956(b)) of this chapter, the State Medicaid agency must comply with the following[.]”12

Establish maximum timeframes for redetermination of eligibility: The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule provided States with adequate time to redetermine eligibility while also ensuring timely completion of renewals and changes in circumstances. This provision applies to CHIP through a cross reference at 42 C.F.R. § 457.340(d)(1). The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule provides a detailed table of the new timeframes.

Aligning MAGI and Non-MAGI Renewal Requirements: The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule sought to make the same streamlined renewal procedures available to all beneficiaries – both MAGI and non-MAGI. Prior to the 2024 Eligibility Final Rule, eligibility was to be renewed once every twelve months and no more frequently for MAGI-based beneficiaries only. At renewal, states must provide MAGI-based beneficiaries with (1) a prepopulated renewal form; (2) a minimum of 30 calendar days to return form; and (3) a minimum 90 calendar day reconsideration period. The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule requires the same renewal processes for all Medicaid beneficiaries, except as specifically allowed under statute. Moreover, 42 C.F.R. § 435.907 set forth timeframes for applicants to respond to requests for additional information when eligibility cannot be determined based on available information.

Acting on changes in circumstances: Where the existing regulations were silent on expectations for processing redeterminations based on changes in circumstances, the 2024 Eligibility Final Rule established mandatory steps for States when redetermining Medicaid and CHIP eligibility based on changes in circumstances. This included: (1) requiring a minimum of 30 calendar days to respond to requests for information; (2) providing 90 a calendar day reconsideration period; and (3) prohibiting procedural terminations when verifying eligibility for additional benefits. The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule also required states to take proactive steps to update beneficiary address information.

Facilitate transitions between Medicaid and CHIP: Under the 2024 Eligibility Final Rule, Medicaid and CHIP agencies are required to transfer accounts of individuals disenrolled from Medicaid or separate CHIP for procedural reasons if available information indicates the individual is potentially eligible for Marketplace or BHP coverage.13 Moreover, the 2024 Eligibility Final Rule revised the regulations to specify that combined notices must be sent by Medicaid and CHIP agencies when a child is transitioned between these two programs.14

Exceptions from advance notice: Section 1902(a)(3) of the Social Security Act requires that a State plan provide an opportunity for a fair hearing to any person whose claim for assistance is denied or not acted upon promptly. Under 42 C.F.R. § 431.211, states generally are not permitted to terminate an individual’s Medicaid eligibility sooner than ten days after providing notice that the individual is no longer eligible for Medicaid. Section 431.213 provides for a series of exceptions to the requirement to provide advance notice. The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule explained that then-current § 431.213(d) permits a State to send notice of an adverse action not later than the date of the action when a beneficiary’s whereabouts are unknown and the post office returns mail with no forwarding address. It also refers to current § 431.231(d) for the procedure for when beneficiaries whereabouts become unknown. The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule revises and redesignates this subsection, explaining that § 435.919(f)(4) establishes procedures if the beneficiary’s whereabouts become known. 15

Types of acceptable documentary evidence for citizenship: A State must verify an applicant’s U.S. citizenship under § 1902(a)(46)(B) of the Social Security Act. When a State is unable to verify an applicant’s U.S. citizenship through an electronic data match with the SSA, it must verify the applicant’s U.S. citizenship using alternative methods described under §§ 435.407 and 435.956(a)(1). The amendments under § 435.407 in the 2024 Eligibility Final Rule “simplify eligibility verification procedures by considering verification of birth with a State vital statistics agency or verification of citizenship with DHS SAVE as stand-alone evidence of citizenship.”16Additionally, separate verification of identity will not be required.

Limitations on premiums and cost sharing: Under § 447.56(a)(1)(v), States may exempt from premiums and cost-sharing ‘‘individuals under age 19, 20, or age 21, eligible under § 435.222,” which—as renamed by the 2024 Final Eligibility Rule—is optional eligibility for reasonable classifications of individuals under age 21 with income below a MAGI-equivalent standard in specified eligibility categories.17 The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule explains that 42 C.F.R. § 435.223 (other optional eligibility for reasonable classifications of individuals under age 21) is derived from the same statutory provisions that supports § 435.222. Accordingly, CMS made a technical amendment to § 447.56(a)(1)(v) to add ‘‘and § 435.223’’ after ‘‘42 CFR 435.222.’’

CHIP-specific review process: The 2024 Final Eligibility Rule required States to “ensure the opportunity for continuation of enrollment and benefits pending the completion of review” for a suspension or termination of enrollment and a failure to make a timely determination of eligibility at application and renewal.18Additionally, § 457.1180 set forth notice requirements in such situations and as set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 457.1130 (Program specific review process: Matters subject to review).

Sec. 71103. Reducing duplicate enrollment under the Medicaid and CHIP programs.

Section 71103 requires states to implement measures to reduce duplicate enrollments across Medicaid and CHIP by cross-checking with other state and federal data systems. By January 1, 2027, each State plan must provide for a process to regularly obtain address information for enrolled individuals. The Act identifies reliable data sources that must be consulted for address information, with the option for States to utilize additional sources of information. As a part of this data, managed care entities with State contracts must transmit enrollee address information to the States beginning January 1, 2027.

By October 1, 2029, the Secretary must establish a system to prevent an individual from being enrolled in the State plan for multiple states. The system must allow states to submit information about enrollees, and to use that information to send information back to the states about whether an individual enrolled or seeking to be enrolled in a state plan is also enrolled in the plan of another state. In connection with this to-be-created system, by October 1, 2029, the States must submit to the social security number of each enrollee and any other information determined by the Secretary in future rulemaking. The information must be submitted at least monthly, and during any determination of eligibility. This information is intended to be used to determine whether an individual is enrolled in multiple states. If the system identifies an individual enrolled in multiple states, whichever state the enrollee does not live in must disenroll the individual.

The OBBBA appropriates $10 million for FY2026 for the purpose of establishing the eligibility system. The Act also appropriates $20 million beginning in FY2029 for the purpose of maintaining the system.

Sec. 71104. Ensuring deceased individuals do not remain enrolled.

Section 71104 requires States to verify, at least on a quarterly basis, that no individuals enrolled under the State plan have deceased by reviewing the Death Master File or any successor system. If an individual is determined to be deceased due to their listing on the Death Master File, that individual shall be disenrolled from the State plan and the State shall discontinue any payments made on behalf of that individual. If any individual is disenrolled in error, that individual shall be reenrolled immediately upon detection of the error with an effective date retroactive to the date of the erroneous disenrollment. These requirements take effect January 1, 2027.

Sec. 71105. Ensuring deceased providers do not remain enrolled.

Beginning on January 1, 2028, states must check the Death Master File during both the initial enrollment and subsequent enrollment of Medicaid providers to ensure that deceased providers do not remain enrolled in Medicaid, codifying current CMS regulations. States must also check the Death Master File at least quarterly during the time that a Medicaid provider is enrolled, to determine whether the provider is deceased.

Sec. 71106. Payment reduction related to certain erroneous excess payments under Medicaid.

Federal law previously directed CMS to recoup federal funds for erroneous payments made for ineligible individuals and overpayments for eligible individuals if the state’s eligibility error rate exceeds 3 percent. CMS was permitted to waive the recoupment if the Medicaid agency has taken steps to demonstrate a good faith effort to get below the 3 percent allowable threshold.

Section 71106 expands the definition of erroneous payments to include payments where insufficient information is available to confirm eligibility. This Section also puts a cap on the amount that may be waived for a good faith showing. This Section takes effect in FY2030.

Sec. 71107. Eligibility redeterminations.

Section 71107 tightens eligibility redetermination rules for Medicaid expansion enrollees. Beginning January 1, 2027, States must conduct eligibility redeterminations for ACA Medicaid expansion enrollees every 6 months, instead of annually. States must continue to conduct annual eligibility review for all other Medicaid enrollees. The Act appropriates $75 million in FY2026 for implementation.

Sec. 71108. Revising home equity limit for determining eligibility for long-term care services under the Medicaid program.

The home equity limit is the maximum value of homes that a Medicaid applicant can own without the homes counting towards the asset limit when calculating financial eligibility under Medicaid. Currently, states may set a home equity limit, and the home equity limit is updated annually to account for inflation. Effective January 1, 2028, the maximum home equity limit becomes $1 million regardless of inflation. States may implement different home equity limit requirements for agricultural homes.

Sec. 71109. Alien Medicaid eligibility.

Section 71109 shortens the list of eligible immigrant populations whose care can be covered by Medicaid. Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, hospitals could receive Medicaid payments from the federal government for emergency care provided to a number of qualified immigrant groups, including lawful permanent residents (green card holders); asylees and refugees; Cuban/Haitian entrants; battered non-citizens, spouses, children, or parents; members of federally recognized Indian tribes or American Indians born in Canada; victims of human trafficking; and DACA recipients, among others. Even among these qualified immigrant groups, many lawfully present immigrants have been subject to a five-year waiting period before they could enroll in Medicaid. (States are permitted to waive the five-year wait for children and pregnant individuals.) Some states cover undocumented immigrant groups through programs funded solely by those states.

Under the OBBBA, fewer immigrant groups will qualify for Medicaid. Section 71109 prohibits Medicaid payments to States for medical assistance to individuals unless they fall into one of four categories: (1) U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals; (2) certain U.S. lawful permanent residents (excluding, tourists, visitors, diplomats, and students temporarily in the U.S.); (3) Cuban and Haitian entrants; and (4) individuals in the U.S. under a Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. The same restrictions apply to CHIP eligibility. Thus, the OBBBA excludes previously eligible populations—refugees, asylees, DACA recipients, and abused spouses and children—from Medicaid coverage going forward. Hospitals and providers will not be able to receive federal Medicaid reimbursement for care furnished to these populations.

The OBBBA provides $15 million in funding for FY 2026 for the CMS administrator to implement the new eligibility requirements. Section 71109 goes into effect on October 1, 2026.

Sec. 71110. Expansion FMAP for emergency Medicaid.

Section 71110 limits Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) payments for emergency care furnished to immigrants who qualify for Medicaid coverage. Before the OBBBA, states that enrolled in Medicaid expansion under the ACA would be eligible to receive a higher percentage of Medicaid reimbursement for the costs of emergency care provided to immigrants who would qualify for Medicaid except for their immigration status. (Federal law requires hospitals to provide such emergency care.) The OBBBA caps FMAP payments to the state’s regular FMAP for emergency care provided to immigrants not eligible for Medicaid coverage. In other words, the higher Medicaid reimbursement percentage under the ACA for emergency care provided to immigrants who would qualify for Medicaid except for their immigration status is no longer available.

These modifications to FMAP payments will likely lead to lower Medicaid payments to states, requiring them to make larger contributions to maintain current reimbursement levels. The FMAP reductions could also result in lower reimbursement to providers.

The OBBBA provides $1 million in funding for FY 2026 for CMS to implement the new eligibility requirements. Section 71110 goes into effect on October 1, 2026.

B. Preventing wasteful spending

Sec. 71111. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to staffing standards for long-term care facilities under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Section 71111 imposes a ten-year moratorium on the implementation, administration, or enforcement of the final rule issued by CMS on May 10, 2024, titled “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting” (89 Fed. Reg. 40876). The rule aimed to set federal minimum staffing standards for nursing homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid, by amending 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.5 and 483.35.

Section 71111 prohibits CMS from taking any action to implement, enforce, or administer any aspect of the staffing rule from the date of enactment through September 30, 2034. In effect, it blocks the rollout of staffing mandates and related reporting requirements that were a key part of the Biden administration’s broader nursing home reform initiative. Supporters of the moratorium have cited concerns about workforce shortages and compliance costs for facilities, while critics argue it undermines efforts to improve patient safety and care quality in long-term care settings.

Sec. 71112. Reducing State Medicaid costs.

Section 71112 amends Section 1902(a)(34) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(34)) to modify the rules governing retroactive Medicaid eligibility by shortening the period during which states must cover care received before an individual formally applies. Under current law, states are required to provide up to three months of retroactive coverage if the applicant would have been eligible during that time. The amended provision establishes two distinct rules based on eligibility category:

For individuals enrolled under the ACA Medicaid expansion group (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)), retroactive coverage is limited to one month prior to the month of application.

For all other Medicaid applicants, retroactive coverage may extend back no more than two months prior to the month of application.

Section 71112 also amends Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)) to align the definition of “medical assistance” with the revised retroactive eligibility timeframes. In addition, it amends Section 2102(b)(1)(B) (42 U.S.C. § 1397bb(b)(1)(B)) to apply similar limits under CHIP. Specifically, states that elect to provide retroactive CHIP coverage for child health or pregnancy-related services may not cover services furnished earlier than the second month prior to the month of application, even if the individual would have been eligible during that time.

These changes take effect for applications submitted on or after January 1, 2027. Congress has appropriated $10 million to CMS to support implementation. By shortening the retroactive eligibility period, the provision is intended to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting states’ obligation to reimburse for services provided before an individual is formally enrolled.

Sec. 71113. Federal payments to prohibited entities.

Section 71113 prohibits federal Medicaid funds that constitute “direct spending” from being used to pay certain entities—defined as “prohibited entities”—for services furnished during the one-year period beginning on the date of enactment. The ban applies not only to direct payments to such entities but also to any payments made through contracts or arrangements between a state and a “covered organization,” such as a managed care entity or prepaid health plan.

A “prohibited entity” is defined as any organization (and its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, or clinics) that:

Is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit tax-exempt entity;

Qualifies as an essential community provider under 45 C.F.R. § 156.235 and is primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related care;

Performs abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or where the life of the pregnant individual is endangered as certified by a physician; and

Received more than $800,000 in total federal and state Medicaid reimbursements in FY 2023—whether directly or through a provider network.

“Direct spending” has the meaning given under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, referring generally to mandatory federal expenditures not subject to annual appropriations. The Section also defines “covered organization” to include Medicaid managed care entities, prepaid inpatient health plans, or prepaid ambulatory health plan, as defined in the Social Security Act.

Congress appropriated $1 million for FY2026 to support implementation of this provision. The one-year ban may significantly disrupt access to reproductive health services for Medicaid beneficiaries in states that rely heavily on providers affected by the restrictions.

C. Stopping abusive financing practices

Sec. 71114. Sunsetting increased FMAP incentive.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, passed during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, allowed non-expansion states to receive a five-percent increase to the traditional FMAP for eight quarters should those states expand Medicaid under the ACA. Specifically, to qualify for the enhancement a non-expansion state would have to cover those who are under 65 years of age, not pregnant, not entitled to Medicaid benefits and whose income does not exceed 133 percent of the federal poverty level.19

Section 71114 heavily restricts this incentive by imposing a narrow window for non-expansion states to become eligible. Though Section 71114 does not remove this incentive outright and does not diminish the FMAP enhancement for states that are currently eligible for the enhancement, Section 71114 does set a limit on when state governments need to expand their Medicaid programs to qualify. However, a non-expansion will only be eligible for this enhancement if the state covers the full expansion population by January 1, 2026. Though it is possible that this may put slight pressure on states to expand their Medicaid programs prior to January 1, 2026, the more likely effect of Section 71114 is that it will eliminate the FMAP incentive outright as states will be unable to meet this deadline.

Sec. 71115. Provider taxes.

Section 71115 made substantial changes to how states can finance the state share of their Medicaid programs, specifically, by reducing states’ flexibility to employ provider taxes. As of 2018, state governments used “health care provider taxes” to generate approximately 17 percent of the “Nonfederal Share of Medicaid Payments[.]”20

Some state governments favor provider taxes as a method for financing Medicaid over general revenue not only because that frees up the states’ “general funds,” but from the implicit fairness of hospitals financing programs that generally benefit hospitals. For a provider tax to contribute to the state share of Medicaid expenditures and count towards federal matching, it must clear the statute’s “hold harmless” requirement. Section 71115 adjusted the “hold harmless threshold” to 6 percent instead of 5.5 percent of net patient revenue, but as of 2028, states that expanded their Medicaid programs will gradually have their hold harmless amount reduced 0.5% year over year until reaching 3.5% in 2032 and onwards – though this phase down does not appear to be the case for states that did not expand their Medicaid programs. Effectively, this appears to lightly penalize states that expanded their Medicaid programs by lowering the amount they are allowed to assess hospitals to support Medicaid programs, requiring those states to finance a greater share of their programs through general revenue funds and Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) by units of government. However, because Section 71115 delineates between expansion states and non-expansion states based on the date of enactment, even if states wound back their Medicaid programs, they likely would not be able to avoid these reductions.

One limit that Section 71115 implements for both expansion states and non-expansion states is that, as of enactment, states that do not have provider taxes in place for a given class of providers will have their “hold harmless threshold . . . set to 0 percent” for those classes of hospitals; however, should a provider tax already be in effect for a class of providers prior to enactment, that tax can [generally] remain in effect.

The state most obviously affected by this provision is Alaska; as of 2024, Alaksa was the only state with no provider taxes at all. Arguably the states even more affected are those that expanded Medicaid, as their hold harmless threshold is getting wound down from the present 5.5 percent to only 3.5 percent in 2026. This places a significant restriction for those states currently assessing providers near that 5.5 percent limit, as they would need to either reduce their Medicaid spending or find alternative revenue sources to cover that lost revenue. Expansion states and non-expansions states alike may have some provider taxes in place but not necessarily applied to the full range of providers eligible to pay them. Section 71115 restricts their ability to impose taxes on further classes of providers, rendering inaccessible significant untapped financing.

Sec. 71116. State directed payments.

Though Medicaid often reimburses providers at substantially below even the cost of providing services, this was not the case for some providers due to additional state directed payment programs. In 2024, MACPAC found that 72 percent of all directed payment spending was attributable to only 29 directed payment arrangements that not only paid providers above cost and the Medicare payment rates, but for 11 of the 29 programs, reimbursed Medicaid providers at “90 percent of the average commercial rate, or the average rate that providers negotiate with private payers.”21

Generally, under CMS’s regulations, the average commercial rate is the upper payment limit that providers can receive for Medicaid services even after state directed payments. See 42 CFR § 438.6(c)(2)(iii). Section 71116 changes that, setting the limit for state directed payment rates for non-expansion states to no more than 100 percent of the Medicare payment rate, while setting the limit for expansion states to 110 percent of the Medicare payment rate. Though the Medicare payment rate may appear to still be a marked improvement over the Medicaid payment rates, the Medicare payment rates are still considerably lower than what commercial payors pay for inpatient care because “[p]rivate insurers paid nearly double Medicare rates for all hospital services” and “[f]or physician services, private insurance paid 143% of Medicare rates, on average[.]”22 Though hospitals currently benefiting from state directed programs that reimburse providers above their average commercial rates will receive a temporary grandfather clause, Section 71116 ultimately stipulates that “beginning with the rating period on or after January 1, 2028, that total amount of such payment shall be reduced by 10 percentage points each year until the total payment rate for such service” equals 100 percent of the Medicare payment rate for expansion hospitals or 110 percent of the Medicare payment rate for non-expansion hospitals.

Sec. 71117. Requirements regarding waiver of uniform tax requirement for Medicaid provider tax.

Section 71117 is intended to prevent states from structuring their provider taxes to derive revenue principally from Medicaid services. Federal law authorizes states to assess taxes on providers, i.e., “provider taxes,” to finance the state share of Medicaid spending. All states except Alaska have enacted provider taxes. In 1991, Congress enacted restrictions on provider taxes to prevent states from imposing a disproportionate share of the tax burden on providers with high Medicaid utilization—the providers that stand to benefit the most from the taxes.23 Under those restrictions, provider taxes generally must be broad based (they must apply to all providers in a class, such as hospitals), uniform (the same tax rate must apply for all members of the class) and cannot hold any providers harmless. Recognizing the need for flexibility, Congress’s 1991 reforms directed CMS to grant waivers to the broad-based and uniform requirements if the net impact of a provider tax is “generally redistributive,” i.e., it tends to draw funds from non-Medicaid sources. To determine whether a tax is “generally redistributive,” CMS performs a regression analysis known as the “B1/B2” test to confirm that the tax paid by providers does not increase with Medicaid utilization.24 CMS has recently observed that some states have found ways to design their provider taxes to pass the B1/B2 test even if most of the tax revenue is collected based on Medicaid usage.25 To close this perceived “loophole,” Section 71117 provides that a tax will not be considered “generally redistributive,” and therefore not exempt from the broad-based and uniform requirements, if it imposes a higher tax rate on Medicaid “units” (e.g., bed days, discharges, costs) than non-Medicaid units. States with non-compliant taxes are required to fix them immediately, unless CMS implements a transition period (not to exceed 3 years). Notably, the Trump administration issued a proposed rule earlier this year that would have changed the existing regulations to implement the same policy.26

Sec. 71118. Requiring budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration projects under section 1115.

Section 71118 prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from approving new or renewing existing Section 1115 demonstration projects on or after January 1, 2027, unless the Chief Actuary for CMS certifies that the project is budget neutral—i.e., it will not increase Federal Medicaid expenditures over what they would be in the absence of the demonstration. Section 1115 permits the Secretary to waive compliance with the Medicaid statute to enable states to carry out demonstration projects that “assist in promoting the objectives of the Medicaid program,” and to authorize federal matching funds for services provided under the demonstration that are not otherwise permissible under the statute.27 Demonstration projects make up a sizable share of Medicaid spending. According to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, Section 1115 demonstrations accounted for 52 percent of Medicaid spending in fiscal year 2019.28 Under longstanding agency policy, CMS has generally required states to show that a proposed demonstration project will produce no more outlays than savings.29 However, the GAO has reported on several instances where CMS approved demonstrations without adequately ensuring they will be budget neutral.30Now that budget neutrality is a statutory requirement, the agency is expected to review proposed demonstrations with greater scrutiny. To that end, Section 71118 appropriates an additional $5 million to CMS in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to be used for evaluating the budgetary impact of proposed demonstrations. Section 71118 also gives CMS the discretion to decide whether savings achieved by a demonstration project in one year can be applied towards calculating budget neutrality in future approval periods.

D. Increasing personal accountability

Sec. 71119. Requirement for States to establish Medicaid community engagement requirements for certain individuals.

Section 71119 directs states to incorporate a “Community Engagement” requirement into their processes for determining eligibility for Medicaid no later than January 1, 2027. Under this requirement, those applying for Medicaid enrollment will need to show that they have completed at least 80 hours of “Community Engagement” during the prior month.31Those who are already enrolled in Medicaid, must, at their next regularly scheduled redetermination of eligibility, show that they have completed at least 80 hours of “Community Engagement” for one or more prior months.32

What constitutes “Community Engagement”? “Community Engagement” is defined as (1) working at least 80 hours; (2) performing at least 80 hours of community services; (3) participating in a work program for at least 80 hours; (4) being enrolled in an educational program for at least half of the time; (5) some combination of the prior four activities amounting to at least 80 hours. Alternatively, “Community Engagement” can be established by a monthly income of the national minimum wage (currently $7.50/hour) multiplied by 80 hours.33

What if a beneficiary does not meet the “Community Engagement” requirement? If the state is unable to verify that a person has met the “Community Engagement” requirements, the state is to (1) provide that person with a notice of noncompliance; (2) provide that person 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of noncompliance to show that they either had met the requirements or were subject to an exception; (3) if the person is unable to make such a showing, deny the person’s application for Medicaid or disenroll the person from Medicaid no later than the end of the month following the month in which the 30-day period ends.34

Exceptions for Beneficiaries: Most people who are eligible for or enrolled in the Medicaid program will be subject to these requirements. However, the bill establishes both mandatory and optional exceptions.

There is a mandatory exception, pursuant which the person will be deemed to have demonstrated the prior month that they met the Community Engagement requirements for: (1) Native Americans deemed eligible for the “Indian Health Service”; (2) people who are the parents/guardians/caretakers of a disabled child who is 13 years old or younger; (3) veterans who are deemed to have “total” disability under the VA’s disability rating schedule; (4) people who are “medically frail” or who have “special medical needs,” including those who are legally blind, who have a “disabling mental disorder,” with a “physical, intellectual or developmental disability that significantly impairs their ability to perform 1 or more activities of daily living” or have a “serious or complex medical condition”; (5) people who are already subject to work requirements through the supplemental nutrition assistance program under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008; (6) people who are participating in a nonprofit or publicly operated drug or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation program; (7) people under the age of 19; (8) people who are pregnant or entitled to postpartum medical assistance; (9) people who are entitled to or enrolled for benefits under Medicare Part A or enrolled for benefits under Medicare Part B; and (10) people who were inmates of public institution any time during the three prior months.

The OBBBA also allows states to create “optional exceptions” pursuant to which the beneficiary will be deemed to have met their requirement for the prior month if they endured certain “short-term hardship events,” such as (1) where the person received inpatient hospitalization; (2) resides in a county in which there has been a declaration of national emergency or national disaster; (3) resides in a county in which there is an unemployment rate of the lesser of 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate; (4) must travel outside their community for an extended period of time to receive medical services necessary to treat a serious medical condition that are unavailable within their community.

Exemptions for States: States may submit a request to the HHS Secretary for an exemption, demonstrating that the state is demonstrating a good faith effort to comply with the purposes of these requirements. This “good faith effort” includes requiring the state to submit quarterly progress reports on the state’s efforts to comply with these requirements. Such an exemption will only last until December 31, 2028, and may not be renewed after that date. The Secretary may also terminate the exemption at an earlier date for failure to make “continued good faith efforts towards compliance[.]”

Avoiding Managed Care Entity Conflicts of Interest: The bill prohibits the Medicaid managed care entities or contractors that determine whether a beneficiary has complied with the Community Engagement requirements from being the same Medicaid managed care entity that is responsible for providing or arranging for coverage for those individuals in order to avoid conflicts of interest.

New Administrative Requirements: The bill defers to the HHS Secretary for developing the specific procedures by which states will confirm beneficiaries’ “Community Engagement” and eligibility or lack thereof for Medicaid. These procedures will be utilized during each beneficiary’s regularly scheduled redetermination of eligibility. This means annually. However, the bill allows states to conduct verifications of “Community Engagement” more frequently should they choose.

The bill also delegates the authority to the HHS Secretary to establish processes by which states can use payroll data or similar data to confirm beneficiaries’ eligibility in order to minimize the amount of additional information the beneficiary must submit.

The bill also directs the HHS secretary to establish standards by which states must notify applicable individuals of these requirements.

The HHS Secretary must promulgate an interim final rule to implement these requirements no later than June 1, 2026.

Funding: The bill authorizes the appropriation of $200 million for CMS to use to carry out the implementation of these requirements. The bill authorizes a grant of $100 million to the states for FY2026, to be distributed based on the ratio of individuals who meet the requirements to be eligible for Medicaid in that state to the total number of individuals who meet the requirements to be eligible for Medicaid in all states, as well as another grant of $100 million to be distributed equally among the states.

Sec. 71120. Modifying cost sharing requirements for certain expansion individuals under the Medicaid program.

Section 71120 permits state Medicaid plans, effective October 1, 2028, to begin imposing deductions, cost sharing, or similar charges determined appropriate by the state for certain care, items and services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries who have a family income that exceeds the federal poverty level. This expansion does not, however, allow for the imposition of premiums. This cost-sharing cannot be applied to (1) services rendered to those under 18-years old; (2) services related to pregnancy rendered to pregnant women; (3) people receiving inpatient services in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility who are required to spend all but a minimal amount of income on medical care; (4) emergency services; (5) hospice services; (6) certain in vitro diagnostic products; (7) COVID-19 testing; or (8) vaccines recommended by the CDC. The portion the beneficiary must pay should not exceed $35 for any given item or service, with the exception of prescription drugs, where the cost share must not exceed the amounts permitted under Section 1916A(c). The maximum aggregate amount of deductions, cost sharing, or similar charges imposed for all members of a family cannot exceed five percent of the family income.35

Providers are entitled to make the provision of services contingent on payment of deductions, cost-sharing, or similar charges. Providers are, however, permitted to reduce or waive such deductions and cost-sharing on a case-by-case basis.

Section 71120 appropriates $15 million for FY2026 for CMS to carry out these new provisions.

E. Expanding access to care

Sec. 71121. Making certain adjustments to coverage of home or community-based services under Medicaid.

Section 71121 expands the ability of state Medicaid plans to provide Home and Community-based services as an alternative to institutional services for individuals who otherwise would require admission to a nursing facility of intermediate care facility by establishing “waivers” of requirements under § 1396(a) that normally would require state Medicaid plans to ensure consistency and comparability of services statewide. These additional waivers supplement existing waivers under 42 U.S.C. 1396n(c).

Starting July 1, 2028, HHS may approve waivers pursuant to which state plans can cover part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than room and board). These waivers will be for an initial term of three years that can be extended for additional five-year terms. The state’s ability to obtain such a waiver will be contingent on the state establishing needs-based criteria for determining who will be eligible for care under the state plan provided under such waiver, as well as on the state establishing that the average per capita expenditure for medical assistance provided pursuant to these waivers will not exceed the comparable amounts expended for individuals receiving institutional care. States will be required to, at least annually, provide data to HHS comparing the costs for home or community-based services with the cost of institutional services and the number of individuals receiving care under both scenarios.

Section 71121 appropriates $50 million for FY2026 for CMS to carry out the provisions of this amendment, and $100 million for the FY2028 for making payments to the states to support the delivery of home or community-based services. This $100 million will be distributed to the states based on the proportion of the population of the state receiving home or community-based services compared to all other states.

2. Medicare

Strengthening eligibility requirements

Sec. 71201. Limiting Medicare coverage of certain individuals.

Section 71201 limits Medicare coverage of certain individuals. As of 18 months after the date of the OBBBA’s enactment, individuals may only be enrolled in Medicare if the individual is: (1) a citizen or national of the United States; (2) an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; (3) An alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant, as defined in section 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980; or (4) an individual who lawfully resides in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association referred to in accordance with section 402(b)(2)(G) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.

The Commissioner of Social Security shall notify each individual whose entitlement to Medicare benefits will be terminated.

Improving services for seniors

Sec. 71202. Temporary payment increase under the Medicare physician fee schedule to account for exceptional circumstances.

Section 71202 provides a temporary one-year increase of 2.5% to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) conversion factor for all services furnished between January 1, 2026 and January 1, 2027.

Medicare payment rates to physicians and other clinicians for specific services are set forth each year in the PFS.36 One factor used to determine those rates is the so-called Conversion Factor, which is updated annually.37The Conversion Factor updates are based on statutory factors and other budgetary requirements, and do not vary based on changes in market forces. The Conversion Factor had remained at 0.0% for the last five years and was scheduled to increase by 0.25% each year for most Medicare providers starting in 2026.38

The House-passed version of the bill replaced the Conversion Factor with annual increases tied to the Medicare Economic Index (MEI), a measure of inflation in medical practice costs. This provision was removed, however, by the Senate in the final adoption of the bill. Instead, the enacted version retains the conversion factor for all services and provides a one-time 2.5% increase to the Conversion Factor effective January 1, 2026.

Sec. 71203. Expanding and clarifying the exclusion for orphan drugs under the Drug Price Negotiation Program.

Section 71203 expanded the Orphan Drug Exclusion under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program.

As background, the IRA requires HHS to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers for certain drugs covered under Medicare that have been on the market for at least 7 years (for small-molecule drugs) or 11 years (for biologics) past the FDA approval or licensure date. Under the IRA, excluded from the negotiations are so-called “orphan drugs,” drugs that are designated for only one rare disease or condition and approved for an indication (or indications) only for that disease or condition.

Section 71203 modifies the Orphan Drug Exclusion to include drugs designated for one or more rare diseases or conditions and where the only approved indication or indications are for one or more rare diseases or conditions. The time that drugs have been on the market with one or more orphan indications shall not count towards the seven- or eleven-year time frame that determines eligibility for selection.

3. ACA / Health Tax

A. Improving eligibility criteria

Sec. 71301. Permitting premium tax credit only for certain individuals.

Section 71301 limits the availability of premium tax credits under the ACA only to certain “eligible aliens.” An “eligible alien” is defined as an individual who “is, and is reasonably expected to be for the entire period of enrollment for which the [premium tax credit] is being claimed – (i) an alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act . . . (ii) an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant, . . . or (iii) an individual who lawfully resides in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association” under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Currently, these premium tax credits are available to aliens “lawfully present,” which is defined to include individuals who are or are reasonably expected to be for the entire period of enrollment for which the credit is being claimed, a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States.

The OBBBA modifies eligibility for premium tax credits under the ACA by replacing the “lawfully present” standard with a narrower definition, limiting eligibility for the tax credits to lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants as defined in the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980, and individuals residing under Compacts of Free Association. These changes will go into effect on January 1, 2027.

Sec. 71302. Disallowing premium tax credit during periods of Medicaid ineligibility due to alien status.

Section 71302 eliminates premium tax credit eligibility under the ACA for lawfully present immigrants with income below 100% of the federal poverty level who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status. This change will become effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

B. Preventing waste, fraud, and abuse

Sec. 71303. Requiring verification of eligibility for premium tax credit.

Section 71303 adds eligibility verifications requirements to ensure that health insurance exchanges annually verify an applicant’s eligibility before enrollment in a plan or receipt of premium tax credits. The exchange must verify, using applicable enrollment information, an individual’s eligibility to enroll in the plan through the exchange and eligibility for receipt of payments of premium tax credits under the ACA. Applicable enrollment information includes, under the OBBBA, affirmation of at least the following information: (i) household income and family size, (ii) whether the individual is an eligible alien, (iii) any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage, (iv) place of residence, or (v) such other information as may be determined by the Secretary as necessary to the verification.

The OBBBA also explicitly provides that exchanges may use any data available to the exchange and any reliable third-party sources in collection information for verification by the applicant. These requirements become effective with taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027.

Sec. 71304. Disallowing premium tax credit in case of certain coverage enrolled in during special enrollment period.

Section 71304 disallows premium tax credits in the case of certain coverage that is enrolled during a special enrollment period (SEP).

An SEP provides an opportunity for enrollment in a health plan outside a standard open enrollment period. SEPs are usually temporary and come with restrictions on those that may be eligible to enroll, such as requiring a qualifying life event (e.g., marriage, birth of a child, etc.).

Originally designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on unemployment and loss of health care coverage, the Biden administration significantly expanded the opportunity for individuals to enroll in coverage at any point through new SEPs or extensions of open enrollment periods. Many extension deadlines were further extended in response to the American Rescue Plan Act, which introduced a special SEP for individuals with income below 150% of the federal poverty level.

Section 71304 eliminates the SEP for individuals claiming income between 100-150% of the federal poverty level. This change will go into effect during plan years beginning December 31, 2025.

Sec. 71305. Eliminating limitation on recapture of advance payment of premium tax credit.

Section 71305 eliminates caps on the IRS’ recapture of excess Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and requires individuals who misreport income to fully account for overpayments.

There are limits to the amount of APTCs the government may recover if an enrollee receives excess APTCs. Since the ACA Premium Tax Credit is based on income, brokers have incentive to advise enrollees to underestimate income and increase overpayments. Limits on the recapture of APTCs account for billions of dollars lost per year.

Section 71305 allows the government to recover the entirety of the overpayments. This change will go into effect during taxable years beginning December 31, 2025.

C. Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers

Sec. 71401. Rural Health Transformation Program.

Section 71401 establishes a $50 billion rural health relief fund called the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP). The RHTP aims to support rural health by dispersing funds to eligible states, which then have the discretion, subject to certain limitations, to determine how to allocate such funds. To be eligible to access this funding, states must submit an application to the Administrator of CMS by December 31, 2025.

The RHTP appropriates $50 billion, $10 billion of which will be administered annually from 2026-2030, to CMS. CMS will then disperse such funds to eligible states. For a state to be eligible to receive funding under the RHTP, the state must submit (i) a certification that none of the amounts provided under the RHTP will be used by the state for an intergovernmental transfer, certified public expenditure, or any other expenditure to finance the non-Federal share of expenditures required under any provision of law, and (ii) an application to CMS. The application must include a detailed rural health transformation plan. The rural health transformation plan must outline how the state will:

Improve access to hospitals, other health care providers, and health care items and services furnished to rural residents of the state;

Improve health care outcomes of rural residents of the state;

Prioritize the use of new and emerging technologies that emphasize prevention and chronic disease management;

Initiate, foster, and strengthen local and regional strategic partnerships between rural hospitals and other health care providers in order to promote measurable quality improvement, increase financial stability, maximize economies of scale, and share best practices in care delivery;

Enhance economic opportunity for, and the supply of, health care clinicians through enhanced recruitment and training;

Prioritize data and technology driven solutions that help rural hospitals and other rural health care providers furnish high-quality health care services as close to a patient's home as is possible;

Outline strategies to manage long- term financial solvency and operating models of rural hospitals in the state; and

Identify specific causes driving the accelerating rate of stand-alone rural hospitals becoming at risk of closure, conversion, or service reduction.

CMS will determine the funds allotted to each eligible state. CMS must allocate 50% of the funds equally among the approved states, while the remaining 50% of the funds will be allocated based on a state’s (i) percentage of the state population that is located in a rural census tract; (ii) the proportion of rural health facilities in the state relative to the number of rural health facilities nationwide; (iii) the situation of the state’s “deemed disproportionate share” hospitals; and (iv) any other factors the Administrator deems appropriate.

Additionally, CMS has the authority to determine the terms and conditions of the funds allotted to each state. These terms and conditions prohibit states from using more than 10% of the funds it receives under the RHTP for administrative expenses. The OBBBA also requires funds to be used for at least three of the following activities:

Promoting evidence-based, measurable interventions to improve prevention and chronic disease management;

Providing payments to healthcare providers for the provision of healthcare items and services, as specified by the Administrator;

Promoting consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for prevention and managing chronic disease;

Providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, AI and other advanced technologies;

Recruiting and retaining clinical workforce to rural areas, with commitments to serve rural communities for at least five years;

Providing technical assistance, software and hardware for information technology advances designed to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity capability or improve outcomes;

Assisting rural communities to right-size their delivery systems by identifying needed preventative, ambulatory, pre-hospital, emergency, acute inpatient care, outpatient care and post-acute service lines;

Supporting access to opioid, substance abuse and mental health treatment;

Developing projects that support innovative models of care that include value-based care arrangements and alternative payment models, as appropriate; and

Additional uses to promote sustainable access to high-quality rural health services, as determined by the administrator.

Thus, if a state wishes to receive funding under the RHTP, the state must: (i) submit an application, including a health transformation plan, to the Administrator; (ii) be approved by the Administrator and granted funding; and (iii) use the funds for at least three of the uses described above.

Health Savings Accounts

Sec. 71306. Permanent extension of safe harbor for absence of deductible for telehealth services.

Section 71306 makes permanent the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) telehealth safe harbor for Health Savings Account (HSA) eligible health plans that allows provision of telehealth and remote care services without a deductible or with a minimum annual deductible lower than the one required under 26 U.S.C. 223(c)(2)(A).

Research

Sec. 70302. Full expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures.

Section 70302 allows research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer’s trade or business to be immediately deductible. This provision revises the existing Section 174 of the U.S. Tax Code that had required amortization of research expenses over a five-year period, rather than allowing them to be immediately deductible. Section 70302 still requires amortization over a 15-year period for research or experimental expenditures from research that takes place outside of the U.S. The amendments made by this section apply to amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 00:00:00.888772
,Indiana American Energy ,2025-07-25 22:07:48+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Letters: Thank your state lawmaker for rejecting the proposed energy omnibus bill,Chicago Tribune,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/25/letters-072525/,"The proposed energy omnibus bill the General Assembly refused to pass this year would not have stopped the price spike this summer.
First, for 20 years, the bill required Illinois ratepayers to guarantee profits to out-of-state energy companies providing energy storage.
The coalition opposing the draft bill offered a practical solution to protect ratepayers from unnecessary cost increases while facilitating energy storage opportunities.
Without proof, proponents claimed (and continue to do so) that raising these caps would promote renewable generation, ultimately lowering energy costs.
The rejected energy omnibus bill guaranteed none of these.","Illinois families and businesses experienced sticker shock upon opening their June electricity bill. The proposed energy omnibus bill the General Assembly refused to pass this year would not have stopped the price spike this summer. Contrary to recent reporting, if passed, this bill would have added costs in 2026 and beyond without guaranteed benefits.

First, for 20 years, the bill required Illinois ratepayers to guarantee profits to out-of-state energy companies providing energy storage. Two other states where such guarantees exist, New York and California, have electricity costs that are 75% to 100% higher than those in Illinois, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The coalition opposing the draft bill offered a practical solution to protect ratepayers from unnecessary cost increases while facilitating energy storage opportunities. Using existing state agencies and monies collected, battery storage developers could apply for low-interest loans to help them get projects built. This solution wouldn’t have saddled ratepayers with costs for unnecessary subsidies and would have aligned with Illinois’ desire for affordable, reliable and sustainable energy policies to promote future economic prosperity.

Second, the proposed bill would have removed important ratepayer protections by raising caps on how much the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) can collect from consumers to buy renewable energy. Without proof, proponents claimed (and continue to do so) that raising these caps would promote renewable generation, ultimately lowering energy costs. This is as confusing as it sounds — claiming lower costs while charging ratepayers more defies logic.

Third, the bill would have granted energy policymaking authority, and hence the ability to protect (or not protect) customers against future rate hikes, to nonelected agencies including the IPA. While the IPA was created to administer competitive processes for energy procurement, the draft legislation would have granted it and select other state agencies and consultants increasingly expansive powers, further centralizing energy procurement in Illinois and stifling needed market innovations. As consumers in California learned at the start of this century, centralized energy procurement can lead to disastrous consequences.

An energy policy focused on reliable, affordable and sustainable solutions is critical. The rejected energy omnibus bill guaranteed none of these. So, when you see a General Assembly member this summer, thank them for rejecting special interests and doing right by ratepayers.

Jackson’s condition

While reading the July 20 editorial (“On Jesse Jackson Jr. and second chances”) arguing for a second chance for former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., I was struck by the omission of his bipolar disorder and subsequent disability payments, as reported by the Tribune on Feb. 23, 2017: “Jackson, 51, receives about $138,400 a year — more than he made as a freshman congressman in 1995. Most of that — about $100,000 — is workers’ compensation and tax-free, according to Chicago attorney Barry Schatz, who is representing Jackson in his divorce proceeding. The rest of Jackson’s benefits are Social Security Disability Insurance payments, some of which may be taxable, Schatz said. The payments flow to Jackson because he has bipolar disorder and depression — the issues that led to an extended leave from Congress in 2012.”

I think it is a relevant question for voters to ask and the Tribune to examine: What is the current status of this disorder since it may affect his ability to be an effective representative? Is the condition being treated? Have payments ended?

While I would never deign to judge the fairness of a “second chance” for anybody, I feel the editorial board’s omission in examining this relevant issue illustrates less than exacting journalism.

Built on fossil fuels

Civilization advanced on the back of energy technology. From burning wood for heat to kerosene lamps for light to coal and later natural gas for heat, and now gasoline and diesel oil for transportation, this is where we are today.

And now we want to blame the suppliers for pollution and global warming? That’s kind of like blaming the bartender for your alcoholism.

— David C. White, Chicago

Response to crisis

I appreciate the letter (“Give us the full facts,” July 15) from Richard J. Aronson, saying that “State Farm has a duty to explain to Illinois insurance holders the facts behind its rate increase.” I agree, and I wonder: Could it be that State Farm sees the science-based truth and the evidence-based (painful) consequences of the climate change that is upon us, bringing us ever more powerful natural catastrophes? Could it be that they are trying to prepare to pay for the mounting damages?

I wish State Farm’s rate hike could be enough to change the minds of climate change deniers and fossil fuel promoters.

Fix the ‘pill penalty’

It is widely accepted that ensuring patients have access to medicines lowers overall health costs, improves management of both chronic and acute conditions, and supports a more viable health care system.

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a significant obstacle to continued access to treatments through its “pill penalty.” The “pill penalty” allows large-molecule biologic medicines a 13-year period following approval by the Food and Drug Administration before being subject to price controls, but it limits small-molecule drugs, which typically come in pill or tablet form, to nine years. This discrepancy disincentivizes research into small molecule drugs, currently about 90% of prescriptions in the U.S.

The discouragement of incentives into one type of treatment option over another is problematic, especially as the health care system is seeing many opportunities using already approved treatments to fast-track new treatment options for unsolved diseases.

Congress must address this discrepancy because patients living with chronic and acute conditions, whether rare or common, depend on the right treatment options to manage them — these may be small or large molecule medications. Science is constantly advancing: Supporting continued research and development ensures that treatment efficiency is improving, more treatments are becoming available, and ultimately patient outcomes and quality of life are improving.

A commonsense, bipartisan bill was introduced to fix the discrepancy created by the pill penalty. The Ensuring Pathways to Innovative Cures (EPIC) Act would equalize the exemption period for small molecule medicines and is an investment in the future of medicine and healthier lives for patients everywhere. According to a University of Chicago policy brief, without the EPIC Act, patients could miss up to 188 new small-molecule medications. That is 188 missed chances for valuable treatment options and hundreds more for all of the follow-on indications that each approved treatment could provide for unsolved diseases by using already approved treatments to fast-track new treatment options.

We are calling on leaders from both parties to co-sponsor the EPIC Act and demonstrate their commitment to reducing overall health care costs for Americans and improve the quality of life for patients.

Braun’s correction

The recent editorial opposing Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s plan to freeze in-state undergraduate tuition at public universities misses the mark (“Indiana University, Ball State and Purdue are gutted without logic or thought,” July 7). Rather than a political stunt or a hollow gesture, this policy is a long-overdue correction to a higher education system that has drifted far from its core mission.

Braun’s tuition freeze is a bold but necessary step to restore affordability and accountability in higher education and perhaps something the state of Illinois could learn from since state universities’ tuition costs and fees continue to rise as state funding is lagging the pace of inflation.

For too long, universities have expanded their offerings, amenities and administrative layers in pursuit of prestige rather than purpose. As Braun’s “Freedom and Opportunity” agenda makes clear, Indiana’s future depends on leaner, more responsive institutions that serve citizens and students, not bureaucracies, whether that is in the statehouse or the classroom.

State universities were never meant to be everything to everyone. They were designed to equip the next generation with practical knowledge and skills to contribute to society. Somewhere along the way, that mission was diluted by mission creep and bloated budgets. While there will always be exceptions and special cases that deserve consideration, the broader trend is clear: Higher education has become too expensive, too expansive and too unaccountable.

This isn’t about denying students the chance to study a language at the school of their dreams. But taxpayers shouldn’t shoulder the burden of funding everything, and there are plenty of other fantastic institutions across the state where Hoosiers can pursue more esoteric studies to their hearts’ content.

Starting in the 1960s Americans were becoming more concerned with deteriorating air quality, pollution, contaminated water supplies, and waterways choked with chemicals, trash, oil, and other pollutants.

In response to these public concerns, President Richard Nixon, in 1970, presented the House and Senate with a 37-point message on the environment. This plan, titled Reorganization Plan №3 (He couldn’t think of a better title?) called for the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Here are some of the points included in the plan:

This was an agency established with a sense of purpose. The EPA had the capacity to research pollutants, monitor and improve the environment, set and enforce higher standards of air and water quality, and work with individual states, offering technical and financial assistance with their pollution control programs.

Here's how to fight back - Trellis Group,"Jigar Shah, Arnab Pal",,,,,https://trellis.net/article/trump-kill-renewable-energy-how-to-fight-back/,"Real political power demands more: smarter communications, grassroots organizing, clean energy champions in elected office at every level — and above all, money.
A worrying shift in public support Policy isn’t the only thing under pressure.
Over 15 percent of U.S. counties have banned or blocked utility-scale clean energy projects.
Align with workers and consumers — always Every clean energy message should start with American workers and American families.
Let’s bring those skills to organizing and show what happens when clean energy fights back.","The solar and wind industries have never looked more vulnerable.

Just weeks ago, Congress passed a policy and budget package billed as fiscal reform that, in reality, takes direct aim at clean energy. Critical tax credits are set to sunset in 2027. Foreign content rules that will sharply increase the cost of new projects arrive just as we need to bring huge amounts of new capacity online. Experts warn of 830,000 jobs lost, skyrocketing energy bills and investor confusion.

Clean energy entrepreneurs are resilient. We have all ridden the “solar coaster” over the past two decades. But like hope, resilience isn’t a strategy. We are no longer operating under the radar. Powerful interests have put our industry in the crosshairs. It’s time we take full responsibility for our political license to operate.

This isn’t a policy accident. It’s a calculated attack by our political opponents, threatening not only the economic and social upside of the clean energy transition but also the ability of U.S. companies to secure reliable, advanced energy technologies that future-proof their operations.

And the hardest truth? It passed because we were unprepared.

Despite clear wins in cost, innovation and job creation, renewables remain politically underpowered. Our trade associations play a vital role. But we now spend less on influence and education than we did a decade ago, while our opposition spends more than ever. Real political power demands more: smarter communications, grassroots organizing, clean energy champions in elected office at every level — and above all, money.

It’s time for a wartime footing

The new budget bill wasn’t a victory for the fossil fuel industry. Rather, MAGA politics beat us, by out-organizing, out-communicating and outlasting us in the places where power is actually decided.

We must adopt a wartime footing. Survival requires unity, speed and resourcefulness. Political power can no longer be optional. It must be treated as essential infrastructure.

Wartime footing doesn’t mean panic. It means clarity of purpose and firm resolve. It means that every employee, CEO, subcontractor and policymaker understands they are part of something bigger.

We’ve seen this before. When Saudi Arabia flooded the oil market in 2014 to crush U.S. fracking, American drillers responded like it was a hurricane. They cut costs, consolidated and coordinated — from city halls to Congress. They didn’t just survive. They adapted and came back stronger.

Now it’s renewable energy’s turn. The real fight isn’t in Washington anymore. It’s in statehouses, utility commissions, local permitting battles and public opinion. Congress dropped a bomb, but we can decide where the next battle is fought.

States are the new battleground

This war isn’t over. The balance of power has shifted to the states. From California’s interconnection queue to Texas’ battles over distributed generation, the policies shaping our future are local. State commissions, permitting boards and zoning councils are often dominated by NIMBY voices or fossil-backed interests. We can’t let that stand. That’s where the public is, where the friction lives and where our momentum is strongest — if we show up.

California shows both the risk and the opportunity. With federal support retreating, Sacramento now bears national leadership responsibility. SB 541, led by Senators Josh Becker and Henry Stern, offers a blueprint: lowering costs by enabling smart batteries, EV chargers and thermostats — the same technologies that the Trump administration has penalized. California is doubling down on flexibility, affordability and grid resilience while others retreat.

But the stakes are rising. Grids everywhere are straining from heat waves, AI-driven demand and aging infrastructure. One in six U.S. families is behind on its utility bills. Clean, distributed power must now move from backup to backbone and prove it works at scale.

Meanwhile, Texas offers a case study in post-partisan progress. In the last legislative session, three Senate-passed anti-renewable bills died in committee after a coalition of clean energy employers, rural co-ops and oil and gas groups mobilized. They warned lawmakers that blocking renewables would stall economic growth and raise energy costs.

ERCOT’s numbers back them up: blackout risk fell from 12 percent to 0.3 percent over the last year as solar and battery capacity surged. Prices stayed 24 percent below the national average.

This wasn’t luck. It was organizing. Texas shows that when renewables are treated as infrastructure, not ideology, practical policy follows. That’s the model to replicate.

A worrying shift in public support

Policy isn’t the only thing under pressure. Public support is slipping. A recent AP-NORC poll shows declining enthusiasm for solar tax credits and offshore wind, even among Democrats. Pew reports that Republican support for solar farms has dropped 20 points since 2020. Over 15 percent of U.S. counties have banned or blocked utility-scale clean energy projects.

This isn’t a blip. It’s a warning. Clean energy has the economics. But our narrative is losing ground. And that has political consequences.

When support weakens, it becomes easier for opponents to repeal incentives or spread disinformation. Without voter pressure, lawmakers face no cost for siding with fossil fuel interests. If we lose the cultural narrative, we lose the political mandate.

Four moves to win the political war

1. Shape public opinion with a coordinated media strategy

Too many Americans still believe wind and solar are more expensive than coal, or that batteries aren’t safe. That’s not just a messaging problem; it threatens deployment. The industry needs a unified, well-funded communications strategy to shift public perception and tell powerful stories: EVs keep our air clean, rooftop solar cuts monthly bills and batteries provide resilience in blackouts. Public sentiment isn’t a side issue. It’s core political infrastructure.

2. Mobilize at the grassroots Showing up means having a steady, local presence. Solar installers at rate hearings. Co-op members writing op-eds. Students organizing school campaigns. When neighbors speak up about energy choices, elected officials listen. We need real people with real stakes, backed by training and support, making their voices heard.

3. Align with workers and consumers — always

Every clean energy message should start with American workers and American families. Clean energy must prioritize good jobs and lower costs. These aren’t competing goals — they’re reinforcing. We can grow union careers and cut monthly bills. Projects from Intersect Power, Form Energy and the DOE Loan Programs Office prove it’s already happening. Every message and policy should reflect that reality.

4. Elect supporters

We need more elected officials who’ve built clean energy firsthand. Leaders like Illinois Rep. Sean Casten, California Rep. Mike Levin and New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich bring practical expertise to public service. Developers, entrepreneurs and installers should be encouraged to run in both parties. No one speaks for this work better than those who’ve done it.

Most importantly: fund the fight

None of this matters without resources. The opposition funds advocacy like it funds pipelines. We treat it like a line item to minimize. That must change. We need to invest in organizing, education, regulatory strategy and legal defense exponentially to what we now spend.

Let’s be clear: the Big Beautiful Bill didn’t pass on merit. It passed because we didn’t have the power to stop it.

We’ve already won the battlefield of economics. But politics is not won by Moore’s Law; it’s won by muscle. If we don’t adopt a wartime footing and build the political infrastructure to match, we risk losing everything we’ve created.

But we won’t. Because we’ve learned. This industry is filled with builders—of projects, companies, careers and futures. Now we must build political power too. That means starting small, scaling fast and staying with it for the long haul. We know how to deploy capital, manage timelines and build coalitions. Let’s bring those skills to organizing and show what happens when clean energy fights back.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Paddington-Square.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 18:05:36.170827

These shifts are transforming what’s possible for developers, utilities, and grid operators, not only in scaling renewable energy, but also in how and when to integrate storage.

A prime example is the $6 billion solar-plus-storage project underway in Abu Dhabi, which aims to deliver a consistent 1 GW of solar power 24 hours a day by combining 5 GW of solar modules with 19 GWh of energy storage.

That momentum is now drawing scrutiny from researchers asking when it makes the most financial sense to attach batteries to the world’s fast-growing base of solar power, now estimated at over two terawatts globally. Their modeling suggests the United States has entered a favorable stretch of the storage cost curve, where the net present value of adding batteries has risen sharply since 2022, reaching strong returns around 2027 and peaking in the early 2030s. The forecast reflects both declining costs and the impact of the federal 30% investment tax credit.

In key markets, the researchers found that retrofitting batteries to a solar plant could boost revenue by 29% to 81%.

In The Optimal Timing of Storage Additions to Solar Power Plants, authors Aiden Hughes, Jarred King, and Dr. Eric Hittinger examine whether solar power facilities built in 2022 should include infrastructure that allows for cost-effective battery retrofits in the future. Their analysis shows that, beginning in 2027, storage pricing is expected to reach a point where most solar plants will benefit financially from battery additions. The results suggest that early investment in enabling hardware is likely to pay off.

The study also notes that while battery costs are expected to continue falling, the financial upside of retrofitting peaks in 2032, just before the scheduled expiration of the 30% U.S. energy storage tax credit.

Hittinger wrote on Bluesky that the chart above illustrates how net present value and system sizing shift depending on when storage is added:

“We generally find that 5-10 yrs from now seems to be the optimal time to add batteries, and that a lot more batteries are added to our solar plant if we wait some time for the addition. The figure here, for CAISO, shows NPV and inverter/battery quantity if we ‘force’ certain years for the additions.”

The paper notes that optimal retrofit timing varies by market, depending on local price signals, policy environments, and project constraints. In California, developers have already embraced solar-plus-storage at utility scale, making it the default model for new projects. Nationally, solar, storage, and hybrid systems now dominate interconnection queues, signaling that battery-paired solar is becoming the industry norm.

The model accounts for factors such as battery costs, initial inverter sizing, solar capacity and cost, regional generation profiles, and local electricity pricing.

One of the model’s more compelling findings is the value in expanding interconnection capacity, not just to match solar output, but to allow batteries to deliver power during peak-price periods. This mirrors how gas peakers earn revenue during demand spikes. In California, grid-connected batteries are already tapping into this opportunity.

However, securing additional interconnection capacity is often more difficult and expensive than adding physical hardware. In some cases, additional capacity may not be available at all.

This analysis arrives as solar deployment continues to accelerate globally. Installations reached nearly 600 GW in 2024, and projections suggest annual deployment could hit 1 TW as soon as 2026. Planning for energy storage retrofits today is increasingly seen as a low-cost hedge against expensive or infeasible upgrades and lost revenue. In some cases, failure to accommodate storage from the start could result in curtailed generation and no revenue at all.

A 60-second spot shows off the new Cadillac with the superimposed copy “Same Legacy. New Energy.” It includes the disclaimer that only the top 1% of Mary Kay employees “earns the use of a career car through their Mary Kay businesses.”

The iconic pink Cadillac was born in 1968 when Mary Kay Ash purchased a Cadillac Coupe De Ville from a Dallas dealership and promptly had it painted to match the pale pink Mary Kay lip and eye palette. General Motors later named the color Mary Kay Pink Pearl, and the shade is exclusive to Mary Kay.

“Mary Kay pink Cadillacs are very rare vehicles,” according to Jalopnik. “The pink pearl color is reserved exclusively for Mary Kay Inc., and all Mary Kay vehicles are only leased for two years. Once the lease period ends, the vehicles are returned to the dealer where they are repainted the factory color. Finding a Mary Kay pink Cadillac for sale doesn't happen often, but some have slipped through the cracks through the years.”

Should the rep not want the car, they instead receive a significant bonus of $900 per month — though 90% of people who qualify for it choose to take the car.

The Mary Kay pink Cadillac symbolizes accomplishment, aspiration, and the power of recognition, said Ryan Rogers, chief executive officer of Mary Kay.

Dive Brief:

The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals — where challenges to its climate-risk disclosure rule are consolidated — to proceed with litigation and issue a decision on the petitions against the rule. The agency withdrew its legal defense of the rule earlier this year.

The SEC’s request was included in a status report submitted Wednesday in response to an Eighth Circuit April court order. The agency also said that it “does not intend to review or reconsider the rules at this time.”

However, the agency declined to explicitly answer the court’s prompt on whether it will uphold and enforce the climate rule if legal challenges against it fail. “Nothing about the potential for future Commission action poses an impediment to a decision by this Court,” the SEC wrote in the July 23 report.

Dive Insight:

The fate of the SEC’s climate-risk disclosure regulation hangs in the balance as the agency, now operating under President Donald Trump, looks to distance itself from rulemaking established by his predecessor’s administration.

The SEC announced in March it would no longer defend its rule requiring companies to disclose certain climate-related risks in court because its lawyers were “no longer authorized to advance” arguments the agency had made to defend the rule under the Biden administration.

Shortly after, the Eighth Circuit issued an order pausing the litigation on the validity of the SEC’s climate disclosure rule until the SEC informed the court of its intention to review or reconsider the rule. The appeals court issued the April 24 order in response to a motion filed by a coalition of Democrat-led states, who initially signed on as intervenors alongside the SEC but now stand alone in defending the rule in court. The Eighth Circuit directed the SEC to file a status report to inform the court of its plans for the rule in that same order.

While the SEC said it does not intend to review or reconsider the rule, the agency did not explicitly answer the court’s prompt on whether it will adhere to the rule if the petitions from its challengers fail. Instead, the agency asked the court to end the pause in litigation, continue consideration of the parties’ arguments and “exercise its jurisdiction to decide the case.”

“If the Court were to uphold the Rules in whole or in part, any reconsideration of them would be subject to Commission deliberation and vote of its members, and the Commission cannot prejudge that action,” the SEC wrote Wednesday.

The SEC claimed the court’s decision on legal issues concerning the case would help determine the scope and need for further rulemaking, as well as “conclusively resolve the dispute about the Commission’s power to adopt the mandatory disclosure obligations on climate risk in the Rules.”

The agency passed the climate disclosure rule last spring by a 3-2 vote, with three Democrats — former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Commissioners Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizárraga — supporting it, and two Republicans — Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda — opposing it. The split vote hinged on the commissioners’ conflicting views on the SEC’s authority — or lack thereof — to probe companies for climate-related disclosures.

Gensler has since been replaced by Trump’s SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and Lizárraga departed the Commission in January, leaving Crenshaw as the agency’s only Democratic commissioner and lone supporter of the climate rule.

Crenshaw criticized the SEC for providing a “wholly unresponsive” answer in a statement following the release of its status report, and accused the agency of attempting to avoid its legal obligations under the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how agencies make and repeal rules.

“The Court asked us in no uncertain terms ‘will [the Commission] adhere to the [R]ules if the petitions for review are denied[?]’” We did not — but should have — answered that question. The unspoken truth under this Commission is that the answer is ‘no,’” Crenshaw said Wednesday.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ypmP8D1eWJEubBux5B4S--stYrKiE_mzPOUFRUazQF0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy04Mjg4MDM1M193bWJVbGFULmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-25 19:01:59.198556

The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has proposed to re-register the pesticide dicamba for use directly on top of dicamba-resistant soybean and cotton plants. The proposed re-registration decision includes additional mitigation measures for dicamba, intended to reduce the on-going challenges of environmental impacts and off-target damage to crops.

Newly proposed mitigation measures include a prohibition on aerial applications, limits on the number of applications, a 240-foot buffer zone, and a requirement of three mitigation points from EPA’s runoff/erosion mitigation menu.

Dicamba was first approved for use directly on dicamba-resistant soybean and cotton crops in 2016, but has had its registration revoked twice by federal courts, first in 2020 and most recently in 2024. In 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the registration for over-the-top uses of dicamba after the court determined that EPA had failed to consider various environmental and social concerns when registering the pesticide.

In 2024, federal court in Arizona vacated the registration for over-the-top dicamba after finding that EPA had failed to follow the proper registration procedures.

This action may relieve these entities from compliance obligations related to GHG emissions reductions and the adoption of new technologies or generation-shifting strategies.
The EPA proposal has significant practical implications due to the uncertainty it introduces within regulatory frameworks.","Regulatory history

It is undisputed that since the 1970s, the EPA has regulated fossil fuel–fired steam generators and stationary combustion turbines, establishing corresponding New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). However, the EPA established the standards for non-greenhouse gas (GHG) air pollutants. During the Obama administration, the EPA began to regulate GHG emissions from power plants by combining the two source categories into a single category of fossil fuel–fired electric generating units (EGUs) and issued a final rule for both new source performance standards for new power plants (the 2015 NSPS).

During this period, the EPA established the Clean Power Plan (CPP) under section 111(d) of the CAA to regulate GHG emissions from existing sources within a new, combined source category. However, multiple legal challenges led to the repeal of the CPP. In 2019, the EPA replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule during the Trump administration. Ultimately, the Supreme Court struck down the CPP and ACE rules in West Virginia v. EPA, 597 US 697 (2022), where the Court held that CAA section 111 did not authorize the EPA to regulate the CPP's best system of emission reduction (BSER) of “generation shifting” approach to reduce emissions and that EPA exceeded the statutory authority because CAA section 111 did not authorize EPA to cap GHG emissions at a level that forces a nationwide transition away from using coal to generate electricity.

In May 2024, following the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia, the Biden administration’s EPA issued a new rule known as the 2024 CPS. This rule incorporated the Court’s decision and established emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing EGUs, including coal-fired, oil-fired, and gas-fired units. The rule sets different compliance deadlines for various EGUs. For instance, EGUs that ceased operations before 2039 are required to limit their gas co-firing to 40 percent by 2030. On the other hand, EGUs that plan to operate beyond 2039 must implement BSER measures to control 90 percent of their carbon dioxide emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS). Notably, EGUs that intend to cease their operations by 2032 are exempt from these compliance requirements. Despite the EPA’s thoroughness, the 2024 CPS Rule faced immediate legal challenges from various stakeholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Challenges with EPA’s unjustified rationale of “significant contribution”

EPA’s June 2025 proposal marked a significant departure from prior legal interpretations of CAA section 111 (b). For example, the CAA section 111(b)(1)(A) requires that the administrator must “publish (and from time to time thereafter shall revise) a list of categories of stationary sources. He shall include a category of sources in such list if in his judgment it causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” Further, the CAA section 111(b)(1)(B) directs EPA to propose regulations “establishing Federal standards of performance” for new sources within the source category, to allow public comment, and to “promulgate . . . such standards with such modifications as he deems appropriate.” Despite the discretionary language in CAA section 111 (b)(1)(A) and CAA (b)(1)(B), the EPA proposes that the CAA section 111 states that

for a new source category, whether consisting of previously unregulated sources or sources previously regulated under distinct categories, cannot be listed without the Administrator’s determination of significant contribution required by the statute . . . Congress required the EPA to identify more than a rational basis for regulating emissions from a source category, as evidenced by the statute’s use of cause, or contributes significantly’ in relation to ‘air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.

Concededly, EPA considered many of the key terms of CAA section 111 when it promulgated the 2015 NSPS and the 2024 CPS. In the 2015 NSPS, EPA interpreted that CAA section 111(b)(1)(B) authorized it to promulgate standards of performance for any air pollutant that the EPA has identified in listing the source category, as well as for any additional air pollutant for which the EPA has identified a rational basis for regulation. Id. Further, the 2024 CPS Rule states that “Fossil fuel-fired EGUs are the nation’s largest stationary source of GHG emissions, representing 25 percent of the United States’ total GHG emissions in 2021.” However, in the 2025 proposal, the EPA claims that GHG emissions represent “a small and decreasing share of global emissions” and asserts that GHG emissions from EGUs do not contribute significantly, as they accounted for only 3 percent of global emissions in 2022, compared to 3.7 percent in 2015.

In 2021, the EPA proposed and finalized a Pollutant-Specific Significant Contribution Finding to regulate source categories for GHG emissions under CAA section 111(b) for EGUs, reaffirming that EGUs remain a listed source category. EPA stated that if a source category exceeds the 3 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions threshold, then GHG emissions from the EGU source category would contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution. However, this interpretation was vacated and remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court. EPA is shifting its rationale in this proposal from the 3 percent of total U.S emissions to the 3 percent of global emissions threshold.

The inconsistent justifications provided by the EPA raise important concerns regarding its analysis of significant contributions outlined in this proposal. Accepting the EPA's reasoning leads to ambiguity surrounding the term “contributes significantly” as defined in CAA section 111(b)(1)(A). It remains unclear what level of contribution is deemed significant and what constitutes reasonable “administrator judgment.” This 2025 proposal highlights the urgent need for a comprehensive reassessment of regulatory approaches to effectively address GHG emissions going forward.

Challenges with EPA’s alternative proposal

EPA’s rationale for the alternative proposal (the 2024 CPS) is more complex, comprehensive, and technical. Some of the key takeaways from the alternative proposal are:

EPA asserts that 90 percent of the CCS-based threshold proposal is not workable due to inadequacy, high costs, and lack of necessary infrastructure before the compliance deadline of 2039.

EPA alleges that the 40 percent natural gas co-firing in a steam generating unit is an inefficient use of natural gas.

EPA contends that the existing natural gas-and-oil-fired steam generating units would be an inefficient use of state resources to develop, submit, and implement state plans, which comprise a relatively small part of the source category and would contribute few or no emission reductions under the existing emission guidelines.

Since 2015, there has been a series of regulatory approaches that have revealed inconsistencies in the EPA authority, often influenced by political dynamics. This trend is indicative of a cycle that is atypical for modern democratic governance. If the EPA advances its current proposal, the implications for GHG regulations could be significant. EPA maintains that the largest stationary sources of emissions do not contribute meaningfully to GHG pollution. Should this perspective be validated, it could result in all sources being exempt from GHG regulation under the CAA, representing a fundamental shift in the landscape of environmental policy.

Practical implications

The proposed repeal is expected to primarily impact owners and operators of fossil fuel–fired EGUs. This action may relieve these entities from compliance obligations related to GHG emissions reductions and the adoption of new technologies or generation-shifting strategies. The EPA proposal has significant practical implications due to the uncertainty it introduces within regulatory frameworks. It remains to be seen how industries that have already adopted a generation-shifting approach will be affected in the future. While sectors that have not yet made investments in these strategies may potentially benefit from this deregulation, it raises concerns given the well-documented evidence that coal-fired power plants are substantial sources of GHG emissions. This is supported by EPA’s previous findings and the historical context of environmental law. If finalized, the repeal would remove all federal GHG regulations for the power sector under section 111, and it remains uncertain whether states would take on regulatory authority under section 111(d).",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-white-fluffy-clouds-blue-sky-1413614464.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 20:02:48.556280

The system is deployed when renewable energy is abundant on the grid and uses the power to compress CO2 gas into a liquid. When the grid requires more power, the liquid CO2 expands back into a hot gas under pressure, which spins a turbine that can feed energy back into the grid for periods ranging from eight to 24 hours.

The company has developed a 20MW/200MWh battery, which it claims has a lifetime of more than 30 years. According to Energy Dome, the technology does not rely on any critical minerals, only using water, steel, and CO2. It has a deployment time of under two years, with every component used in the system standard, which improves economies of scale.

Google has said it believes the commercial partnership will play a significant role in unlocking “new clean energy for grids where we operate before 2030, helping meet near-term electricity system needs and moving us closer to our 24/7 carbon-free energy goal.”

“The programmatic and strategic deployment of our technology at scale to help Google reach carbon-free energy represents the core of our industry-first agreement. We’re proving that a 24/7 cost-effective and carbon-free energy supply is achievable with the right technology and partnership model,” said Claudio Spadacini, founder and CEO of Energy Dome.

In addition to the commercial partnership, Google has also made a direct investment in the company. The partnership is part of a broader push by Google to invest in LDES technology. It plans to support a growing range of LDES technologies currently under development through both commercial agreements to support more mature technologies, such as Energy Dome’s, in addition to earlier-stage investments.

Energy Dome has several deployments already underway. Last year, it signed its first supply contract within the US market with Alliant Energy. It has also signed an offtake agreement with renewable energy firm Engie to supply power from its first commercial deployment in Ottana, Sardinia, Italy.

Gus Pichot, the chief executive of growth and energy at Fortescue, said a “shift in policy priorities away from green energy” in the US had “changed the situation” for its reported US$550m green hydrogen production plans in Arizona.
“The lack of certainty and a step back in green ambition has stopped the emerging green energy markets making it hard for previously feasible projects to proceed,” he said.
Pichot said this was down to the company’s “strategic shift away from electrolysers to focus on advancing technologies to provide low cost hydrogen for green industry in Australia”.

Fortescue’s decision to cancel the two ventures in Queensland and Arizona are the latest in a run of canned hydrogen projects in Australia and elsewhere that will raise further questions about the future of the clean fuel.

Gus Pichot, the chief executive of growth and energy at Fortescue, said a “shift in policy priorities away from green energy” in the US had “changed the situation” for its reported US$550m green hydrogen production plans in Arizona.

“The lack of certainty and a step back in green ambition has stopped the emerging green energy markets making it hard for previously feasible projects to proceed,” he said.

At the same time, Fortescue said it was cancelling its Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland that had been slated to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year.

Pichot said this was down to the company’s “strategic shift away from electrolysers to focus on advancing technologies to provide low cost hydrogen for green industry in Australia”.

Electrolysers use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Using renewable energy to power an electrolyser can manufacture a zero emissions liquid fuel.

Fortescue said it was looking at alternative uses for its sites in Arizona and Gladstone, and Pichot added that “green energy and green hydrogen is key to our future”, and while costs would come down “we must also be realistic and disciplined”.

The company’s green metals project in the Pilbara was progressing, Pichot added.

Simon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: “There has clearly been way too much hype, and politicians and policies have been far too distracted by nonsensical uses of green hydrogen – things like household heating, or adding hydrogen into the gas distribution network, and electric vehicles are clearly winning the race [against hydrogen cell vehicles].”

He said subsidies provided to the industry needed to be more targeted for green hydrogen for domestic use and for uses that “made more sense” such as in replacing hydrogen derived from gas used for fertilisers or in steel production.

A spokesperson for the federal industry minister, Tim Ayres, said the Gladstone announcement was “disappointing for the workers and businesses connected to the project”.

“But we know green hydrogen is essential to manufacturing and industry in a net zero future, and Australia has one of the best hydrogen development opportunities in the world,” the spokesperson said.

The federal government has provided $44.9m for a seperate Fortescue project – the Gladstone Electrolyser Facility – under its modern manufacturing initiative. The Guardian understands there could be flow-on impacts from the closure of PEM50 to that grant.

The spokesperson said the department was “continuing to work with Fortescue on its delivery of the Gladstone Electrolyser Facility project”, which is located at the same site as PEM50.

They said it was normal practice for grant agreements to allow the government to recoup funds if a project can’t deliver what was agreed to.

A statement added: “Government support in developing hydrogen opportunities around the country provides additional certainty for projects, however how they progress ultimately remains a commercial decision for the parties involved.

“Standing up a new industry is not easy, but we’re unapologetic about pursuing opportunities so regional communities continue to thrive through the energy transformation.”

A spokesperson for Fortescue said the company had been “upfront with the government” and would “return funds where required under the grant agreement”.

“Those conversations are already underway,” they said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75069752ac097c593a9888aa5a57e1e252486f6e/696_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6459b658abae5ad67bd5862dcf4aef2",N,,2025-07-25 18:05:40.580584

These updates stem from the massive tax bill recently signed into law by President Donald Trump.

The new legislation includes several key tax rules: an extension of many of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), an expanded child tax credit, a larger standard deduction for seniors, tax breaks for workers who receive tips and overtime pay, and more.

But not all of these provisions will take effect at the same time — and some are permanent while others are temporary.

Here’s a summary of when some of the key tax provisions go into effect — and expire.

A timeline of key tax breaks

2025: Tax changes that could put more money in your pocket

Beginning in 2025, millions of Americans could begin benefiting from a wide range of new tax breaks.

One of the most notable changes is the expanded state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which increases the cap from $10,000 to $40,000. The change will provide meaningful relief to taxpayers in high-tax states such as New York, California, and New Jersey. The increased SALT cap will be adjusted annually for inflation but is set to drop back to $10,000 in 2030 unless extended by Congress.

Another provision beginning in 2025 allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in auto loan interest for qualifying vehicles — new cars purchased for personal use and with final assembly in the U.S. The deduction applies to loans issued from 2025 through 2028.

Seniors will be eligible for a bonus deduction of up to $6,000. Meanwhile, service workers could benefit from a new exclusion of up to $25,000 in reported tip income, while employees who work overtime may qualify for a deduction of up to $12,500, or up to $25,000 for married couples filing jointly.

“These new tax provisions could bring about meaningful changes for taxpayers starting in 2025,” says Tracey Carney, a certified public accountant in New Orleans. “Now is the time to review how these updates might impact your finances and consider meeting with a qualified tax professional to plan ahead.”

2026: More changes ahead, including health care impacts

Several tax changes, including extensions of TCJA provisions, are set to begin in 2026. That said, taxpayers may not notice some of these changes that much, because many of these new provisions are simply continuing what is already in effect for 2025.

The 2017 TCJA, passed during Trump’s first term, made sweeping changes to the tax code. However, many of its provisions were set to expire after 2025. The new law makes several of those provisions permanent and extends them beyond Dec. 31 of this year. Some of those tax rules include reduced income tax rates, the limit on deducting mortgage interest on debt up to $750,000 and the qualified business income deduction.

The new law also makes two significant changes related to health care and taxes beginning in 2026.

“There are two overlooked elements of the big beautiful bill that can have major tax implications for your health care,” says Whitney Stidom, vice president of consumer enablement at eHealth, an independent insurance advisor. “One impacts how health insurance subsidies are calculated, and the other changes who qualifies to use a health savings account.”

The law modifies rules for Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which help reduce premiums for lower-income Americans. Under the new rules, individuals who earn more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level may still qualify for subsidies, but any excess subsidies received must be repaid in full when filing taxes.

“In the past, there was a cap on how much of the overpaid subsidies you had to return,” Stidom says. “Now, you may have to repay the full amount.”

The law also expands eligibility for health savings accounts (HSAs), allowing more health insurance plans — specifically, catastrophic and bronze-tier ACA marketplace plans — to qualify. An HSA allows people to stash money into a tax-advantaged account for qualified medical expenses, but you can only have an HSA if you also have a qualified high-deductible health plan.

For 2025, people can contribute up to $4,300 for themselves into an HSA and the amount increases to $8,550 for families. People aged 55 or older can add a $1,000 catch-up contribution to those amounts.

“There are about 7 million Americans currently enrolled in bronze plans who haven’t been able to use an HSA,” Stidom says. “This change could offer significant new tax benefits.”

Some tax breaks will now expire this year

The sweeping legislation also ends several clean energy tax credits, but on different timelines.

The popular electric vehicle (EV) tax credit is set to expire on Sept. 30. After that date, the credit will no longer be available. Originally introduced in 2008, the credit was expanded under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models.

“If you’re considering buying a vehicle, now is the time to buy an electric vehicle,” Carney says. “Unless Congress extends the credit in the future, buyers won’t have the chance to take advantage of it once it’s gone.”

Other credits — specifically, the energy efficient home improvement credit and the residential clean energy credit — are now scheduled to end after 2025.

Until the end of the year, taxpayers can claim up to $3,200 per year for eligible improvements to their primary residence under the energy efficient home improvement credit. The credit covers 30 percent of qualified expenses, such as for installing energy efficient doors and windows.

The residential clean energy credit allows taxpayers to claim 30 percent of the cost for new qualified clean energy property — including solar panels, solar water heating systems, geothermal heat pumps and more. These credits are nonrefundable, meaning they cannot reduce your tax bill below zero.

Bottom line

Carney recommends that taxpayers review both expiring tax provisions and new ones that may apply to their situation.

The finding is what obligates the EPA to address greenhouse gas emissions, Goffman said.
“They’re making it impossible to take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” in a deliberate fashion, he said.
The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The EPA argued that the decision doesn’t support how the agency has carried out the Clean Air Act.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has submitted a proposal to scrap a years-old finding that greenhouse gas emissions threaten the environment and public health, a move that former agency officials say would gut the EPA’s authority to reduce emissions and is sure to end up in the courts.

The EPA sent a draft proposal to the White House late last month calling for scrapping what’s referred to as the endangerment finding on top of vehicle emissions standards for certain cars and trucks. The White House Office of Management and Budget could finish reviewing the draft on Monday and some expect an announcement on the issue the last week of July, Joe Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said in an interview.

Former EPA officials say such a move would gut the agency’s own power to curb greenhouse gas emissions, which have been widely found to cause global warming.

“It'll be the most decisive step taken to make the agency totally irrelevant, which then will become an excuse to just get rid of it,” Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator from 2001 to 2003 under President George W. Bush, said in a phone interview.

Whitman said she thinks “the long-term goal of all of this is to ensure that the agency can't do regulations.”

‘Suffocating its own authority’

The EPA finalized what it is known as the endangerment finding in late 2009. It said that greenhouse gases are a threat to both the environment and public health and that emissions from vehicles pollute the air with greenhouse gases. The finding is what obligates the EPA to address greenhouse gas emissions, Goffman said.

“Essentially what the EPA is doing is suffocating its own authority under the Clean Air Act…to establish programs and rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said Goffman, who worked at the EPA during the administrations of Democratic Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama.

“They’re making it impossible to take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” in a deliberate fashion, he said.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced back in March that the agency was going to reconsider the finding.

Its proposal — which was submitted to the executive branch’s Office of Management and Budget on June 30 — will be shared for public comment following interagency review and after Zeldin has signed it, an EPA spokesperson said Thursday in an email.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Court fight ahead

The Trump administration’s moves to scrap the finding and vehicle emissions standards are its latest plays to dial back U.S. climate policy and efforts to fight climate change.

President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans scaled back support for renewable energy projects and other climate policies in the budget reconciliation bill signed into law July 4.

Trump also signed executive orders during his first days back in office to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again and to aid fossil fuel production.

The EPA said the endangerment finding went beyond the agency’s statutory authority under the Clean Air Act, according to a summary of part of the proposal that was sent to the White House.

The Clean Air Act “does not authorize the EPA to prescribe emission standards to address global climate change concerns,” an executive summary of the proposal sent to the White House states, according to an excerpt obtained by States Newsroom.

Because of that, the agency is proposing rescinding “the Administrator's findings that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare,” it said.

The agency in its proposal also raises a key 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Massachusetts v. EPA that determined the EPA is allowed to regulate greenhouse gases as part of the Clean Air Act because they pollute the air.

The EPA argued that the decision doesn’t support how the agency has carried out the Clean Air Act. On top of that, the agency says that the “EPA unreasonably analyzed the scientific record” and that “developments cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.”

Similar to numerous other executive actions taken by the Trump administration, Whitman and Goffman said they expect this latest move will end up in the courts.

“This is the beginning of a long, long saga,” Goffman said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/get-traffic1737215661.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ftmXQAlr,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:07.629032

Just days before, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office released its strategic plan to provide affordable and reliable energy, while also meeting the state’s climate goals.
The plan calls for a mix of clean energy sources, but is largely predicated on a goal to develop offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.
Could Canadian offshore wind help meet New England’s climate goals?
While the future of Maine’s wind industry is dependent on who next occupies the White House, Gallivan said the next governor of Maine will also need to commit to developing offshore wind.","With Massachusetts toying with the idea of procuring offshore wind energy from Canada, officials in Maine say they are keeping an eye on opportunities across the border as local development has been stalled.

In the first few days of his second term, President Donald Trump hit the breaks on new wind energy development by pausing all new federal permits for on or offshore projects. Just days before, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office released its strategic plan to provide affordable and reliable energy, while also meeting the state’s climate goals. The plan calls for a mix of clean energy sources, but is largely predicated on a goal to develop offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.

Meanwhile, the latest federal tax bill created another roadblock for the clean energy industry by phasing out the tax credits for solar and wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.

Like Maine, Massachusetts is trying to shift its power mix to sustainable sources and has a statutory goal to lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. It has one project under construction that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year, but it won’t be enough to meet that objective.

That’s why Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada — news first reported by Canada’s National Observer last month.

While turning north of the border won’t be without its own challenges, Massachusetts state Sen. Michael Barrett called it a “creative solution” and said he would work to extend the statutory deadline so the state can pursue this route.

“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”

The Governor’s Energy Office in Maine didn’t dismiss the idea. The office told Maine Morning Star that it is working with New England and Canadian partners to advance shared energy goals.

“We’re closely tracking the development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure, and broad economic benefits for Maine,” the office said in a statement Friday.

Other proponents are divided

Though Maine faces the same domestic roadblocks from the Trump administration, it has a longer statutory runway than Massachusetts. State law outlines a goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

Given that timeline, Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said it’s probably too early for the state to procure energy from Canadian projects to achieve its offshore wind goals. Building a new industry was always going to require long-term planning and, unlike Massachusetts, Maine’s statutory timeline goes well beyond Trump’s term, he added.

“We’ve got a long way to go before I think we need to give up on the idea of building an offshore wind industry for Maine, given how much we know about the economic benefits that will come along with that,” Shapiro said.

Could Canadian offshore wind help meet New England’s climate goals?

Constructing a port to build floating offshore wind platforms could support more than 6,000 jobs during construction and an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050 for a total economic benefit to the state of $6.6 billion, according to an economic impact analysis conducted by Karp Strategies on behalf of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Proponents also say this would provide a new industry to anchor the local economy.

Rather than turn to Canada, Shapiro said the state can use the remainder of the Trump administration to continue researching the budding technology so that when the roadblocks clear it will be ready to keep moving forward on domestic offshore wind projects.

Alternately, some argue that supporting Canadian projects would allow the industry to continue to advance and innovate so that when the political environment is more favorable, Maine and its workers would benefit.

Cheyenne Gallivan, communications director for the Maine Labor Climate Council, said if New England states buying offshore wind power from Canada could jumpstart the industry, it’s worth considering.

“We, of course, want Maine workers to be domestically producing our energy, but at a time when the federal and political environment is not amenable to our development of that homegrown offshore wind, we don’t see working with Canada as something that would hinder,” Gallivan said.

Though Maine workers would more easily benefit from domestic projects, workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, noted Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. But he added those dynamics could be complicated by current trade tensions.

Pointing out that part of northern Maine is already intertwined with the electrical grid in New Brunswick, Provost said strengthening the regional market would benefit everyone.

“It’s better to have an industry move forward in an area so that it can grow to the whole northeast, at the end of the day, as opposed to not having that happen and then starting from scratch again in three and a half, four years,” Provost said.

While the future of Maine’s wind industry is dependent on who next occupies the White House, Gallivan said the next governor of Maine will also need to commit to developing offshore wind. The current governor, Janet Mills, will be termed out by the end of 2026.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-100/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/vineyard-wind-turbine-scaled-1-1-2048x1534-1-1024x7671753474795.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=IyWCuxK7,N,,2025-07-25 22:59:20.935083

In just the month of May, solar plus wind accounted for nearly 21.5% of U.S. electrical output.
In May alone, the disparity increased further when solar + wind out-produced coal and nuclear power by 55.7% and 22.1% respectively.
“Solar and wind continue to grow, set new records, and out-produce both coal and nuclear power,” said SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong.","A review by the SUN DAY Campaign of data just released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reveals that solar provided over 11% of total U.S. electrical generation in May while wind + solar produced over one-fifth and the mix of all renewable energy sources generated nearly 30%.

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through May 31, 2025), confirms that solar continues to be the fastest growing among the major sources of U.S. electricity.

In May alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (i.e., >1-MW) increased by a third (33.3%) compared to May 2024 while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 8.9%. Combined, they grew by 26.4% and provided over 11% of the nation’s electrical output during the month.

For the first time ever, the mix of utility-scale and small-scale solar produced more electricity than wind: solar – 38,965 GWh; wind – 36,907-GWh.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 39.8% while that from small-scale systems rose by 10.7% during the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by almost a third (31.1%) and was almost 8.4% of total U.S. electrical generation for January-May – up from 6.6% a year earlier.

As a consequence, solar-generated electricity easily surpassed the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (6.1%). In fact, solar is now producing more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

Wind + solar are over one-fifth of total U.S. electrical generation — a larger share than that provided by either coal or nuclear power:

During the first five months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided over a fifth (20.5%) of the U.S. total, up from 18.7% during the first five months of 2024. In just the month of May, solar plus wind accounted for nearly 21.5% of U.S. electrical output.

During the first five months of this year, the combination of wind and solar provided 26.2% more electricity than did coal and 15.4% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In May alone, the disparity increased further when solar + wind out-produced coal and nuclear power by 55.7% and 22.1% respectively.

Electrical output by the mix of all renewables was almost 30% in May:

The mix of all renewables (i.e., wind and solar plus hydropower, biomass and geothermal) produced 9.7% more electricity in January-May than they did a year ago (7.6% more in May alone) and provided (28.1%) of total U.S. electricity production compared to 26.5% twelve months earlier.

Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables in just the month of May provided almost 30% (29.7%) of total U.S. electrical generation. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas whose electrical output actually dropped by 5.9% during the month.

“Solar and wind continue to grow, set new records, and out-produce both coal and nuclear power,” said SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong. “Consequently, the ongoing Republican assault against renewables is not only misguided and illogical but also a good example of shooting oneself in the foot.”

New York’s bill to increase maximum tax credit for residential solar and storage installations

Since 2006, New York has offered a solar tax credit capped at $5,000 per household for solar installations. The credit is sized at 25% of the system cost, or $5,000, whichever is less.

Nearly two decades later, “there’s a number of fixes that need to occur with this tax credit,” T.R. Ludwig told pv magazine USA. Ludwig has been on NYSEIA’s board for more than seven years, and CEO and co-founder of both Brooklyn SolarWorks and Brooklyn Solar Canopy.

SB S3596B would have doubled the cap to $10,000, allowing customers to offset state income taxes with a credit and retain the 25% installed system cost. The bill also strived to remove a 50 kW limit on how much co-ops and condos can use the tax credit towards, a cap other residential buildings are not subject to.

NYSEIA also proposed to apply the tax credit to energy storage. If successful, New York would become the first state to do so. New York was historically one of the few states to offer tax credits on top of the federal credits for home solar installations.

North Carolina’s bill to limit solar growth, cut tax incentives

A bill in the North Carolina House aimed to cut tax incentives in half for utility-scale solar projects and make it harder for them to be installed on agricultural land.

Introduced in the North Carolina House by Rep. Dixon (R), HB 729, or “The Farmland Protection Act,” would have reduced the tax abatement for certain solar projects from 80% to 40% of the appraised value.

Additionally, HB 729 forbid utility-scale solar projects from being constructed if they are not certified as qualifying small power production facilities under the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, unless the project is sited on a brownfield property, non-agricultural land, or timberland that has been clear-cut harvested and is not currently in production. Brownfields are idle commercial or industrial properties where redevelopment is hampered by real or perceived environmental contamination.

“I want to show face for our Santa Barbara chapter,” said Peterson in a pre-trip interview.
For Feinstein, Santa Barbara’s climate vulnerability alone warranted a seat at the table.
“According to NOAA, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have warmed more than any other counties in the continental U.S. over the last 50 years,” he said.
“You can’t scale up clean energy if you can’t connect it to population centers.","Earlier this week, two Santa Barbara residents visited Washington, D.C., as part of a national climate lobbying effort — traveling across the country to urge Congress to protect environmental legislation at a time when much of it is being quietly dismantled.

Charles Feinstein and Kirk Peterson are members of the Santa Barbara chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a nonprofit that organizes volunteers to advocate for federal climate policies. They joined hundreds of volunteers at CCL’s annual Summer Conference and Lobby Day, held July 20-22. The event combined two days of panels and strategy sessions with a full day of in-person meetings on Capitol Hill.

Feinstein and Peterson met with Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Representative Salud Carbajal — all Democrats who already support clean energy — but did not have sit-downs with any Republican offices. “That’s just how the assignments worked out,” said Feinstein, who acknowledged the limits of the trip.

“I want to recharge my batteries, so to speak,” said Feinstein, former director of the World Bank’s Energy and Extractives Global Practice, who now lives in Santa Barbara, in an interview prior to the trip. “It’s a difficult environment … but by networking and getting on top of the latest, I hope to redouble my effort and regain enthusiasm.”

Their talking points centered on two pieces of legislation: the Fix Our Forests Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at restoring wildfire resilience and accelerating forest health projects, and the Foreign Pollution Fee Act, which would place a fee on carbon-intensive imports to encourage cleaner manufacturing globally. CCL has also long supported a carbon fee-and-dividend model — effectively taxing polluters and returning that revenue to households.

“Right now, you’re free to pollute,” Feinstein said. “And just basic life experience tells us that if something’s free, you’ll consume a lot of it.”

Peterson, who works in renewable energy consulting, said his climate focus was shaped by personal experience. “We had friends who lost family in the La Conchita landslide,” he said, referring to the devastating 2005 debris flow. “With climate change, disasters like that are going to keep happening — and they hit the most vulnerable communities hardest.”

Both men said the lobbying trip was more about presence than persuasion.

“I want to show face for our Santa Barbara chapter,” said Peterson in a pre-trip interview. “To show that this is still something we care about and want our leaders to fight for.”

Still, the current political landscape does not inspire confidence. “The U.S. was on track to meet its Paris commitments,” Feinstein said. “Now, with changes enacted by Congress, we’ll be lucky to hit even 30 percent reductions. And that’s a downer.”

Showing face may not be enough. Just last month, the House passed a budget reconciliation bill that would repeal large portions of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act — including clean energy tax credits that California has widely adopted. A companion bill is under Senate consideration. If signed into law, the package will slash billions in federal climate investment and eliminate incentives for technologies aimed at reducing emissions.

Yet both men insist the trip wasn’t futile. For Feinstein, Santa Barbara’s climate vulnerability alone warranted a seat at the table. “According to NOAA, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties have warmed more than any other counties in the continental U.S. over the last 50 years,” he said. “Our ecosystems aren’t just threatened — they’re already being impacted.”

And for Peterson, it’s about staying in the fight — even when the system feels slow or broken. “If you integrate climate action into the market, you get movement,” he said. “We’ve got to keep showing up.”

Now that the conference has concluded, Feinstein said the experience exceeded expectations — not because any policy shifts, but because of the persistence he saw across the climate community.

“No one’s giving up,” he said in a follow-up interview. “This is a hard political climate, but Citizens’ Climate Lobby has a plan — multiple plans.”

That plan includes three key areas of focus: the FY26 appropriations process to restore clean energy support; permitting and transmission reform to expand the national grid; and renewed efforts to pass the Fix Our Forests Act.

“Transmission is critical,” Feinstein said. “You can’t scale up clean energy if you can’t connect it to population centers. And a stronger grid also protects against climate-related failures — like the winter blackout in Texas.”

While Peterson was still in Maryland as of Thursday, most other volunteers, he noted, returned home on Wednesday, July 23. “We had over 850 volunteers at the conference,” he said. “And I’d bet nearly all of them showed up for Lobby Day. That kind of turnout gives me hope.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image0-30.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 20:03:48.365525

The new bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4, incorporates multiple provisions to clean energy, including solar. The most significant of those changes drastically shortens the length of time people and businesses can get a tax credit for solar installations.

Under Trump’s legislation, homeowners have until the end of this year to take advantage of a 30% tax break on residential solar projects. This new rule replaced tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 that gave homeowners tax incentives through 2034, with a gradual reduction starting in 2032.

“For PV Squared, it’s hard to say today exactly how this will affect our business, but the bill certainly introduces more complexity and uncertainty into an already challenging planning landscape …,” Kate Carter, a member of management at Greenfield-based PV Squared, said in an email to the Gazette. “Even with the recent loss of federal tax credits, going solar in Massachusetts still makes strong financial sense.”

According to the company EnergySage located in Boston, a high-end solar panel project for a 11 kW installation on a home in Massachusetts would cost about $32,500, and would be reduced to $22,750 through the federal tax credit, saving roughly $9,750 through the pay-off period. The amount of the credit depends on factors including the cost of a homeowner’s electric bill, the type of solar panel unit and changing market rates.

Homeowners who want the tax credit but won’t finish a project by the end of the year have one other option. They can enter a third-party ownership arrangement that allows a separate business to own the solar project and sell the power made from the array back to the homeowner, allowing homeowners to access the credit until the end of 2027, according to Solar.com.

“A lot of the energy business has been driven with the mindset of incentives,” explained Gregory Garrison, president of Northeast Solar in Hatfield. “The consumers out there have an idea that solar has incentives and without incentives it is not as good of a purchase or an investment, which is not true. It’s just a matter of communicating details back to the client.”

By definition, according to Cornell Law School, solar electric property expenditures are, “an expenditure for property which uses solar energy to generate electricity for use in a dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence by the taxpayer.”

Similar to the residential tax credit, businesses under Trump’s new bill must begin construction of solar installation by July 4, 2026 to qualify for the 30% tax credit. If construction does not begin before then, solar projects must be in service and operational before Dec. 31, 2027 to access the credit.

National impact

At a national level, the bill is expected to have a large impact because cuts on solar energy are likely to reduce the number of solar factories and manufacturing sites. A recent analysis by SEIA reports that in its current state, the bill could result in the loss of 330,000 jobs across the country, with 6,100 jobs lost in Massachusetts.

While local solar energy companies expect business to slow down, they maintain a firm belief that solar energy is still a reliable investment for homeowners.

“Yes, we expect the proposed cuts to have an impact — particularly on members of our community who are trying to go solar,” Carter said in an email. “Homeowners with marginal solar sites or those who need significant electrical upgrades may find it more difficult to move forward with projects without the full support of federal tax incentives … While the removal of the tax credit may extend the payback period for some projects by a few years, solar still delivers significant savings over time.”

Solar energy demand has been on the rise in the country over the past decade. According to a 2025 report from SEIA, in the last decade, solar deployments across the nation have experienced an average annual growth rate of 28%.

In Massachusetts for 2023, renewable energy resources provided 34% of the total in-state electrical generation, with the largest portion coming from solar energy. In the same year, small-scale PV systems accounted for two-thirds of the state’s total solar electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“I would say with solar, especially in Massachusetts, losing the tax credits is going to slow the progress of solar down some, but in general it’s still a very valid investment for homeowners,” said Michael Hempstead, president and co-owner of Valley Solar in Easthampton. “Nationally it’s going to have a very profound impact because there are states that have electric rates that are less than half of what ours (Massachusetts) are. If you’re in a state such as that, trying to sell solar may be more expensive than the prevailing electric rates — that’s a problem.”

Valley Solar has been active in Easthampton for 10 years. Hempstead explained that over the past 15 years in Massachusetts, electricity prices increased due to the rising costs of natural gas, along with other reasons. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in October 2015, the average cost of electricity for Boston-area households was 17.7 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), rising to 30.2 cents in October 2024, nine years later.

“We expect it’s going to have somewhat of a slowing effect on our business because instead of being a five-year payback it might be a seven-year payback,” said Hempstead. “In general we think that for a lot of people, not everyone, it will still be a very good investment.”

State incentives

Hempstead explained, the spike in demand for solar energy over the past decade can be partly attributed to the introduction of state programs including the first Solar Renewable Energy Certificate’s (SREC) launched in 2010 and the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) program launched in 2018, along with decreasing costs to solar equipment and installation costs.

More recent energy legislation in Massachusetts occurred earlier this year. On June 20, the state Department of Energy Resources (DOER) filed emergency regulations for the SMART 3.0 program. The regulations aim to “create a sustainable incentive program that advances solar energy in Massachusetts while being able to quickly respond to changing market conditions.”

“Solar is one of the fastest and cheapest forms of energy we can bring into Massachusetts right now,” said Gov. Maura Healey, in a press release in June. “I want us moving as fast as states like Florida and Texas on this because it will increase reliability and bring down the cost of electricity. Our administration is moving quickly to reduce costs — that’s why we released our Energy Affordability Agenda and filed legislation to get charges off bills and support the growth of new energy.”

“We do anticipate there will be some drop off in business but overall we still feel and it is well documented that solar is still the cheapest form of energy a household can purchase …” said Garrison. “Our focus is primarily on retaining 100 percent of our team, continue to grow our business and to be a good partner in the communities. We’ve been here now for 15 years and we have a great reputation with the (Pioneer) Valley and western Mass.”

Garrison explained that due to permit, planning and design processes, solar projects take months to fully contract and construct. With Northeast Solar nearly fully contracted until the end of the year, he believes that most solar energy companies will have an idea of how the tax credit cuts will impact sales sometime in October, when 2026 sales can be compared to 2025.

“It’s truly unfortunate that the government decided to disincentivize the one thing that was providing the best return for homeowners through the tax credit,” said Garrison. “The way our company always looked at it was that those tax credits came through the federal government but they came to our communities and those households were able to use the savings of their energy dollars to invest more in their communities.”

That order is now being challenged in court.

President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” early in the year. A few months later the Department of Energy ordered Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-burning power plant in Ottawa County operating past its planned closure date on May 31.

Nine environmental groups, including Sierra Club and Earthjustice, are taking the agency to federal court after it refused to hold a re-hearing of the order.

The groups say the order to keep the aging power plant was “unlawful and unreasonable” in its petition to the court.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is intervening separately in another case filed by Consumers Energy. According to reporting by my colleague Tracy Samilton, the utility seeks to assess the costs of operating the plant on the majority of grid customers, rather than solely on Consumers Energy customers in Michigan.

“This unprecedented order of the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said in a press release.

The Trump administration’s interference in Consumer Energy’s planned closure of the Campbell power plant runs counter to Michigan’s plans to switch the state to power generation that does not contribute to climate change.

Keeping the old, inefficient, and polluting power plant running will cost Consumers and eventually ratepayers an estimated $100 million or more, depending on how long it is required to keep operating.

Trump’s “energy emergency” is an attempt to bolster fossil fuel industries and in particular, what he calls, the “beautiful clean coal” mining industry.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/496c036/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fe2%2F791153484d4abdbc524310e51ef1%2Fcampbell.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:24.449752

Bounded by Duke University, North Carolina State University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, RTP’s 7,000 acres host over 375 companies, spanning science and technology companies, government agencies, academic institutions, startups, and nonprofits.

Biogen is a biotechnology company that primarily develops treatments for neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease. The company has invested $10 billion in the area since its start as the company’s manufacturing base in 1995.

“We are proud of our longstanding commitment to manufacturing innovation, investment, and collaboration with the Research Triangle Park community,” said Nicole Murphy, head of pharmaceutical operations and technology at Biogen. “Our manufacturing footprint in the United States has played a critical role in Biogen’s history and success, and in advancing the treatments that are making an impact for patients, families, and communities here in the U.S. and around the world.”

Murphy continued by saying, “With this investment, we will modernize and expand our manufacturing capability to enable our pipeline and provide resilient patient supply, while continuing to support the skilled and dedicated community of life sciences talent in North Carolina.”

Despite its sizable investment allotment, Biogen’s corporate investment plan for the state is far from unique. North Carolina has experienced a surge in planned corporate investment for nearly two months. According to data collected by the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, in the month of June alone, North Carolina secured over $16.7 billion in pledged investment on behalf of corporations, an amount greater than for the entirety of 2024.

For the entirety of the Economic Development Partnership’s database entries (covering a two-year period from July 2023 to June 2025), the organization records 298 total corporate investment initiatives in North Carolina, amounting to $46.0 billion and the creation of 48,156 new jobs. Despite the large number of initiatives launched, most of the investment and job generation is concentrated among a small number of larger firms. Among these firms are household name brands Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, and Toyota.

The 10 largest corporate investments by dollar amount over the recorded period accounted for $33.3 billion, or approximately 72% of the total dollar amount announced. These investments were launched by:

Amazon Web Services: $10.0 billion

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina: $8.0 billion

JetZero: $4.7 billion

Novo Nordisk: $4.1 billion

Natron Energy: $1.4 billion

Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (Holly Springs): $1.2 billion

Amgen: $1.0 billion

Johnson & Johnson: $1.0 billion

Enovum Data Center Corp: $1.0 billion

American Titanium Metal, LLC: $0.9 billion

North Carolina’s 10 largest corporate investments in terms of job creation account for 25,173 new jobs, or approximately 52% of the total over the measured period. The companies leading state job growth through their investments are:

JetZero: 14,564 jobs

Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina: 3,000 jobs

Jabil, Inc: 2,003 jobs

Natron Energy: 1,062 jobs

Novo Nordisk: 1,000 jobs

The Energy Department would get $48.8 billion, a cut of $1.4 billion.
A COLLISION OVER EPA: House and Senate appropriators have also shown stark differences in how they’re handling Interior and EPA — including which programs they want to cut.
The House Appropriations Committee advanced its bill along party lines this week, including a proposed 23 percent cut for the EPA.
But the Senate version, advanced the following day by a subcommittee chaired by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), would cut EPA just 5 percent.","The House left Washington this week for its August recess, setting the stage for fall showdowns with the Senate and White House on deeper cuts to climate and environment spending.

If the sides can’t work out their differences, or agree on how to kick the can past Oct. 1, a partial government shutdown could hit in a little more than nine weeks.

Three distinct visions of the future are at play:

— President Donald Trump’s budget request in May asked lawmakers for massive reductions for programs that aim to fight climate change, and agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Park Service.

— The Senate has put forth largely bipartisan proposals, eyeing a small cut to EPA and an increase for the Interior Department. In some cases, senators are pushing back at how Trump is handling government funding.

— The House, on the other hand, is aiming to take a sledgehammer to those agencies and more, with double-digit percentage cuts that would have to advance with only Republican votes. Its cuts still wouldn’t bite as deeply as what Trump proposed.

A MOUNTAIN OF DIFFERENCES: Take the spending bill for the Energy Department and water development programs, which advanced through the House Appropriations Committee last week on a party-line vote.

It would fund the agencies in its purview at $57.3 billion, or $766 million less than current levels. The Energy Department would get $48.8 billion, a cut of $1.4 billion. Its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is targeted for a 46 percent decrease, while the Office of Grid Deployment’s funding would fall by more than half.

Trump’s budget request eyed even bigger cuts, seeking to reduce the Energy Department’s budget by $4.7 billion, slash about 70 percent of the renewable energy office’s funding and mostly eliminate money from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

Things are even messier on the Senate side. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who chairs the subcommittee overseeing the energy and water legislation, says he wants the bill to spend less than the $59.9 billion that Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) and ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) had agreed to, creating an impasse that has blocked the legislation from moving forward, our Andres Picon reported.

A COLLISION OVER EPA: House and Senate appropriators have also shown stark differences in how they’re handling Interior and EPA — including which programs they want to cut.

The House Appropriations Committee advanced its bill along party lines this week, including a proposed 23 percent cut for the EPA. The bill’s total spending for the agencies it covers, $38 billion, is $9.2 billion higher than what Trump requested.

But the Senate version, advanced the following day by a subcommittee chaired by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), would cut EPA just 5 percent.

The Senate bill also takes aim at the Trump administration and its priorities. It would cut EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s office, provide no funding for EPA’s planned closure of its research office, and require the administration to change the name of Alaska’s Mount McKinley back to Denali, reversing Trump’s January renaming.

Extreme storms producing even more rain than some scientists expected

Heavy rainfall events like the one that created deadly flooding in the Texas Hill Country are a symptom of climate change, Chelsea Harvey writes.

“The biggest, baddest, rarest extreme precipitation events are precisely those which are going to increase the most in a warming climate,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the California Institute for Water Resources, said not long after the Texas floods.

This is because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. But scientists say recent flash floods have produced more rainfall than their equations hold.

Trade deals take gas along for the ride

Some nations are currying favor with the Trump administration ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline for tariffs by buying liquefied natural gas from the U.S., Brian Dabbs and Carlos Anchondo write.

The president announced new trade deals this week with Indonesia and Japan, the latter of which he said will include a “major expansion of U.S. energy exports.”

“LNG is playing a significant role in the bilateral trade talks,” said Mark Menezes, president of the U.S. Energy Association trade group and a former Department of Energy official in Trump’s first term.

China, EU agree and disagree on climate

European Union leaders agreed to a joint effort with China to fight climate change this week after leaving Beijing without a wider trade deal, Karl Mathiesen, Koen Verhelst and Jordyn Dahl write.

The friction over trade stems from China’s dominance in clean technology and its associated supply chains. European leaders see China’s exports as a threat to their own manufacturing.

Chinese President Xi Jinping called on EU leaders to see that “convergent interests are not a threat,” in remarks reported by the state-run Xinhua News Agency.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the agreement a “big step forward … our cooperation can set a global benchmark.”

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit.","Editor's note: President Donald Trump signed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) into law on July 4, 2025. A major component of the bill was the elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which will now expire on Sept. 30, 2025. The information in this story is still valid for those who purchased an electric car at any point in 2025 up until the end of September. After that, there will be no more tax credits on any new or used electric vehicle regardless of where it was made. Another relevant aspect of the OBBBA for car shoppers is the addition of the car loan interest tax deduction, which would allow a person to write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans. However, there are several requirements that need to be met, and economists have noted that only 1% of car shoppers would be able to take advantage of the full benefit.

Federal EV tax credits in 2025 top out at $7,500 if you're buying a new car and $4,000 if you're buying a used car, while the bank or the automaker's finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly. Edmunds takes a quick look at the key rules for each scenario — buying new, buying used and leasing — and shares a list of cars that qualify for an EV tax credit.

If you're buying a new EV or PHEV (plug-in hybrid), the ""final assembly"" of the vehicle must have occurred in North America to unlock any tax credits. If it passes that test, now you're looking at two $3,750 electric car tax credits that add up to $7,500 if you meet all the criteria. To get the first $3,750 credit, a certain percentage of the car's critical battery minerals must have been sourced from the U.S. or from any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.

The other $3,750 credit requires that a certain percentage of battery components be manufactured or assembled in the same roster of countries. There are also significant eligibility caps on both the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the vehicle — $55,000 for cars; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks and vans — and the income of the buyer, which is subject to limits between $150,000 and $300,000, depending on tax filing status. If either figure is too high, you won't qualify for any federal EV tax credits.

If you're buying a used EV or PHEV, you don't have to worry about where the car was assembled or where its battery bits came from. The income caps are significantly lower, however, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, while the car itself must be at least two years old and cost no more than $25,000. You also have to buy it from a dealer, not a private party. Check all the boxes, and you can get a tax credit of up to $4,000, though there's a sliding scale for cheaper used EVs, which will be explained below.

What about leasing a new EV or PHEV? There's a legislative loophole that lets the originator of the lease (typically the automaker's finance division) take the full $7,500 tax credit for a leased EV, irrespective of the final assembly, battery sourcing and vehicle pricing requirements. It's up to each automaker to decide whether to pass these savings along in the form of more affordable leases, but keep in mind that you might get a hefty discount on a leased EV thanks to this loophole. That's true even if your income would disqualify you from getting the tax credit on a purchased EV — since you're not the one getting the tax credit in this case, your income is irrelevant.

Which new vehicles qualify for the federal EV tax credit?

The following vehicles should qualify for the federal EV tax credit because they are assembled in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery component requirements.

It's also worth noting that the vehicle must be purchased for ""original use"" to qualify for the federal tax credit, meaning that it is for the taxpayer's use. You cannot buy the vehicle and then immediately resell it in hopes of getting the tax credit.

This list is based on data from the U.S. Department of Energy, last updated on May 19, 2025. It affects new cars placed in service from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, 2025.

If you're interested in other possible EV credits, rebates, and manufacturer incentives, take a look at Edmunds' detailed list here.

Qualifying new cars for the 2025 EV tax credit

Edmunds

How to qualify for the used EV tax credit

The tax credit for used EVs will be calculated based on either 30% of the vehicle's value or $4,000, whichever is less. As we mentioned earlier, there are no assembly requirements or battery component percentages for used EVs and PHEVs. The rules for used EVs went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023, and are as follows:

Price limit for used vehicles: There is a hard eligibility ceiling at a sale price of $25,000 for all used EVs regardless of type.

Income limits for used vehicles: As with new vehicles, the income limits are determined by modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). By filing status, the limits are as follows.

Edmunds

Other eligibility requirements for used EVs

The vehicle must be at least two model years older than the calendar year in which it was purchased.

The used EV tax credit applies only once in the vehicle's lifetime. Subsequent owners are not eligible.

Once a buyer has taken the federal used EV credit, the buyer is not eligible for another credit for three years.

The vehicle must be for personal use and ""not for resale.""

The vehicle must be purchased through a dealer.

Only an individual may claim the used EV tax credit. Businesses are excluded.

Electric vehicle tax credit for leasing

Leased electric cars or plug-in hybrids from dealerships are considered ""commercial vehicles"" under IRS regulations. This means that the full $7,500 tax credit goes to the company that leased it to you, which is usually the automaker's captive finance arm. In other words, the automaker itself effectively gets the benefit of the tax credit. Moreover, leased EVs and PHEVs are not subject to the major restrictions detailed above — there are no limitations regarding final assembly, battery sourcing or vehicle pricing, while the caps on buyer income are irrelevant because there is no purchase in the case of a lease.

There's also no obligation on the automaker's part to pass along any savings to you, but in practice, many automakers seem to be offering at least some kind of discount on EV leases as a direct result of this loophole. It probably won't last forever, so if you're interested in leasing vehicles not on the list here, check with your local dealership to see if there are loophole-driven lease discounts.

How to qualify for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit

Several requirements will determine if an electric car qualifies for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit. The maximum buyer credit for new vehicles is $7,500, provided that several requirements are met.

Final assembly, parts, and mineral sourcing requirements

The final assembly of the new vehicle must occur in North America (i.e., the U.S., Canada or Mexico). This is the gateway requirement for the federal EV tax credit — if the answer is no, the EV won't qualify unless you're leasing. This rule went into effect on Aug. 16, 2022, and affects vehicles purchased through 2032.

If the vehicle meets the assembly requirement, you can think of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as being split into two halves — critical battery minerals and battery components — each worth $3,750 and subject to requirements of its own. The percentages will be discussed here, but don't worry about remembering this. The EPA has already calculated the percentages below to determine which cars are eligible and are reflected in this list, so you won't have to figure it out yourself.

Critical battery minerals: To qualify for this $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must have been either recycled in the U.S. or extracted or processed there (or in any country that has a free trade agreement with the U.S.).

Battery components: To qualify for the remaining $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the EV's battery components must be manufactured or assembled in the U.S. (or in any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.)

New vehicle pricing limits for EV tax credits

The following price caps by vehicle type became effective as of Jan. 1, 2023, and refer specifically to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). It does not include the manufacturer's destination charge, optional items added by the dealer, or taxes and fees. For example, if you're looking at an SUV with a $79,990 MSRP, and the destination fee takes it over $80,000, the vehicle is still eligible. If, for example, the vehicle is priced above the MSRP limit (let's say $82,000), but there's a manufacturer incentive that brings it back down to $80,000, the vehicle would also not be eligible.

Edmunds

New car buyer income limits for EV tax credits

The income limits are based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which is roughly the adjusted gross income with certain allowable deductions added back in for the current or prior tax year. Depending on your tax filing status, the limits for a new vehicle are:

Edmunds

What's changed for 2025?

As of Jan. 1, 2025, a vehicle is ineligible for a tax credit if any of the battery's components and critical battery materials were sourced from a ""foreign entity of concern,"" which includes China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. That's a big deal given China's outsized role in the minerals supply chain to date. The critical battery minerals requirement went up to 60% from 50% last year.

Additionally, the credits will no longer be in effect after Sept. 30, 2025.

How do I claim the EV tax credit?

If you purchased an eligible vehicle in 2025, you have two options to claim the tax credit:

You can claim the credit on your tax return for the year in which it was purchased, using Form 8936. If your tax liability is less than $7,500, the IRS said it will not seek repayment, but just keep in mind you won't get to keep the difference either, as it is a nonrefundable credit.

You can transfer the EV tax credit to an eligible dealership so that they can apply the credit amount to your final purchase cost. The dealership must be registered with IRS Energy Credits Online. They should submit and give you a copy of the ""time of sale report"" to confirm that the report was accepted. This document will be needed when filing your tax return. If you lease the vehicle, the credit goes to the lessor and may be used to reduce the price of the lease if the leasing party chooses to do so. If you choose to go this route, please note that you still need to fill out IRS Form 8936, which reports your eligibility for the credit and your decision to transfer the credit to the dealer.

It is important to verify that you meet the income requirements listed above; otherwise, you may need to repay the IRS if your modified adjusted gross income is higher than the authorized limits.

FAQs

How does the EV charger tax credit work?

If you are installing an EV charger at your home, the federal credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $1,000, whichever is smaller. For those wanting to install an EV charger at a business or investment property, the credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $30,000, whichever is smaller. You can claim the EV charger tax credit the following year on your income taxes using IRS Form 8911. Some states may have additional incentives for installing an EV charger, so it's worth looking into this list maintained by the DOE. Your local utility company might also have incentives for installing an EV charger.

How much can you write off for an electric car?

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit. The difference is that a $7,500 write-off reduces your taxable income by that amount before the tax is calculated, whereas a $7,500 credit means you pay $7,500 less in tax than you would have otherwise. In case that didn't clear things up, just remember that for a given dollar amount, a tax credit means a lot more money in your pocket than a write-off.

The maximum federal tax credit of $7,500 on an eligible electric vehicle is effectively a $7,500 handout to you, which is far more than what you'd gain if you simply subtracted $7,500 from your taxable income. It's worth looking into this list of state EV incentives maintained by the DOE so that you can maximize the benefits of buying an EV. You also have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as an immediate discount on the car.

How does the federal tax credit for EVs work?

To qualify for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, the EV you purchase has to be brand new and assembled in North America. Beyond that, increasingly stringent geographical requirements are being phased in regarding the composition and production of the car's battery pack alongside the vehicle pricing and personal income requirements.

You have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as a discount on the car, as opposed to having to wait for tax season. You can also choose to have the credit applied to your taxes using IRS Form 8936, which you submit as part of your annual taxes to the federal government.

Are there tax credits from states or other sources?

Yes. While the federal tax credits for plug-in and natural gas vehicles get the most mention, there also are dozens of state and regional incentives on plug-in vehicles and those that use alternative fuels. Many states have a dozen or more programs. Many, however, apply only to businesses. Some credits come in the form of exemptions from fees and inspections. Others are nonmonetary incentives such as carpool lane access and free parking.

Retail buyers in a number of states can get some cost relief in the form of tax credits, rebates, reduced vehicle taxes, or registration fees for buying a qualified alternative-fuel or electric-drive vehicle. Edmunds keeps a detailed list of state, local, federal and manufacturer incentives all in one place. The U.S. Department of Energy has an interactive chart of state incentives. It's a good idea to be sure about available state and local incentives before you shop. Just because a state has a program now doesn't mean it will continue indefinitely.

How about hydrogen fuel cell cars?

On paper, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles should qualify for incentives and are explicitly mentioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. However, at the time of this writing, no hydrogen-powered vehicles qualify for a tax credit for a vehicle purchase, likely due to not being built in North America. A workaround would be to lease the vehicle, in which case the automaker can — but is not obligated to — use the tax credit as a discount toward the lease. This can be a way to save some money on vehicles like the Toyota Mirai or Hyundai Nexo. Take a look at the U.S. Department of Energy's website to see the latest hydrogen laws and incentives.

Is there a tax credit for buying a Tesla in 2025?

Yes. As of the beginning of 2023, Tesla customers are once again eligible for the new tax credit of up to $7,500. That said, the vehicle must satisfy the manufacturing, pricing, and income requirements discussed in this article. Like other EVs, there will be no tax credits for any Tesla model after Sept. 30, 2025.",https://cmg-cmg-rd-20081-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Fcmg%2FD3O3NQWWWE5S3ERJIOJ3TJ7RUU.jpg?auth=ce55ee70e362e14b0734fcf79c27d610aaa560d59c04fe7975341d423ff88e4a&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-07-25 20:02:31.414491

The Cutting LNG Bunkering Red Tape Act codifies a Trump-era Department of Energy (DOE) order clarifying that ship-to-ship transfers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as marine fuel—commonly known as LNG bunkering—are not considered exports under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act unless conducted in foreign waters.

“LNG exports unequivocally benefit our economy, domestic prices, national security, and partners and allies around the world that want our product. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration spent four years imposing one regulation after another on these exports, stifling the energy industry,"" said Rep. Pfluger. ""This legislation permanently reverses one of these misguided policies to ensure American LNG can compete on the global stage by removing regulatory uncertainty and streamlining its use as a cleaner, more efficient fuel source for maritime transportation. I am proud to lead this legislation with my good friend from Florida, Representative Laurel Lee.”

“The Biden Administration’s harmful energy policies have created unnecessary regulatory burdens that stall innovation and weaken American energy leadership,” said Rep. Lee. “Liquefied natural gas is a more efficient, cleaner, and cost-effective energy source. My bill ensures that LNG bunkering is not hindered by red tape, so that ports in Florida and across the nation can continue to expand, drive job creation, and compete globally.”

Background:

· In December 2024, the Biden Administration issued a DOE order that asserted new oversight for LNG bunkering—transfers between ships in U.S. ports—subjecting it to burdensome federal regulations and requiring a public interest determination under the Natural Gas Act.

But according to the latest research from automotive consulting and technology firm Urban Science and The Harris Poll, they have widely differing ideas about what that future will look like.

For example, the 2025 Urban Science Harris Poll Study found 61% of dealers strongly agree that traditional car dealership model — with sales, service, parts and body shops under one roof — is completely optimized for the marketplace of the future. That’s up 13 percentage points from the 2024 poll and is almost double what dealers said in 2023.

On the other hand, just 37% of car buyers strongly agreed with that statement, down from 38% last year. The 24-point gap between those groups — the largest in the five years the study has been conducted — is more than double that of 2024 and six times wider than in 2023.

The difference was even more stark on the subject of electric vehicles. Looking down the road, 91% of dealers believe the public will be ready for EV-only buying options by 2040, consumers were much less certain, with 47% agreeing while 48% said they might never be ready for an all-EV world.

The surveys of more than 5,000 adults who own a vehicle or are planning to buy one in the next 12 months — 3,026 of them in the U.S. — and 254 U.S. franchise dealers was conducted in January. The report on the survey results, titled “The Pace of Transformation: What Dealers and Auto Buyers Are Telling Us Today”, said a May follow-up survey of 1,844 auto buyers found 32% of the consumers said they were less likely to purchase an EV as a result of the Trump Administration’s planned policies.

“Dealer confidence in EVs likely stems from the continued push by manufacturers to expand all-electric lineups and honor longstanding electrification targets,” the report said. “With vehicles already in production or on lots, dealers are more likely to focus on moving inventory and aligning with OEM direction than reacting to short-term policy signals.”

One area both dealers and consumers could agree on was the biggest concern in the current auto retail landscape: affordability.

It was by far the top choice among car buyers, cited by 64% of them. In fact, their top three choices were cost-related, with cost of vehicle insurance second at 52% and cost of vehicle service third at 47%. Among dealers, affordability tied for the No. 1 spot with economic factors at 40%, followed by vehicle insurance costs (37%).

The report said consumers’ affordability concern still ranked first in the May follow-up survey, but it cooled slightly, dropping to 56%. It was again followed by the costs of insurance (42%) and service (38%), which were also lower, “suggesting a slight uptick in buyer confidence.”

The May survey pointed out another gap between dealers and consumers, as 33% of dealers listed the elimination of the EV tax credits as a concern, fourth on their list, while it barely registered for car buyers at 16%, ranking eighth among the nine factors listed.

It also showed the effects of tariffs on consumer behavior, with 67% saying they have changed their car-buying plans or experienced higher costs because of the tariffs. Some 23% said they are more likely to buy a vehicle manufactured in America and 21% said they’ve delayed a purchase because of tariff concerns, while 22% said they paid more for the vehicles and 20% saw increased vehicle service costs.",https://www.autoremarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Urban-Science-Harris-poll-2025.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 17:03:35.218961

With countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany depending heavily on imports to meet their clean energy goals, cross-border hydrogen trade is becoming a linchpin for the global hydrogen economy. However, to ensure transparency in carbon intensity, source verification, and compliance with national sustainability policies, hydrogen product traceability becomes essential. A digital hydrogen passport ensures every shipment carries a verifiable origin, emissions history, and handling log aligning with frameworks like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) and ISO 14067.

Heavy Mobility:

Hydrogen is increasingly favored for long-range transport applications such as trucks, buses, trains, and even ships where battery electric systems face range and weight limitations. For these segments, especially in government-funded deployments or regulatory zones (e.g., California’s ZEV mandates), traceability helps monitor lifecycle emissions, fueling behavior, and even certify green compliance. This tracking is critical in carbon credit systems or ESG-linked performance indicators of fleet operators and OEMs.

Refueling Infrastructure:

Building hydrogen refueling stations (HRS) is a capital-intensive and strategically sensitive activity. Countries are racing to set up dense refueling networks (e.g., Germany's H2 MOBILITY, California H2USA). Integrating track-and-trace systems within these stations enables auditability of hydrogen quality, prevents contamination from fossil-derived hydrogen, and provides end-users with QR-code-enabled data on what kind of hydrogen they're using green, blue, or grey. This enhances user trust, especially in fleet management and public transport segments.

Industrial Feedstocks:

Industries such as steel, ammonia, and cement are among the hardest to decarbonize. Green hydrogen offers a path forward, replacing coal or natural gas as feedstock or reducing agents. In such cases, traceability ensures process transparency, helps monitor scope 1 and 2 emissions, and supports carbon accounting in global value chains. For example, green steel certified via hydrogen passport systems can carry a premium in global markets, particularly under EU’s CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism)

Power-to-X Applications:

Governments and financial institutions are increasingly demanding real-time data on energy sourcing, especially to validate tax credits (like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s 45V hydrogen credit). Hydrogen track-and-trace frameworks provide tamper-proof digital ledgers of energy use, electrolyzer input sources, and emissions intensity. This creates compliance-ready reporting for ESG disclosures, sustainable financing, and avoids greenwashing making it a tool not just for tracking, but for building credibility and investor trust.",https://www.tcs.com/content/dam/global-tcs/en/images/what-we-do/industries/Manufacturing/Whitepaper/hydrogen-traceability-framework-compliance-credibility-card.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 19:01:47.042513

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit.","Editor's note: President Donald Trump signed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) into law on July 4, 2025. A major component of the bill was the elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which will now expire on Sept. 30, 2025. The information in this story is still valid for those who purchased an electric car at any point in 2025 up until the end of September. After that, there will be no more tax credits on any new or used electric vehicle regardless of where it was made. Another relevant aspect of the OBBBA for car shoppers is the addition of the car loan interest tax deduction, which would allow a person to write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans. However, there are several requirements that need to be met, and economists have noted that only 1% of car shoppers would be able to take advantage of the full benefit.

Federal EV tax credits in 2025 top out at $7,500 if you're buying a new car and $4,000 if you're buying a used car, while the bank or the automaker's finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly. Edmunds takes a quick look at the key rules for each scenario — buying new, buying used and leasing — and shares a list of cars that qualify for an EV tax credit.

If you're buying a new EV or PHEV (plug-in hybrid), the ""final assembly"" of the vehicle must have occurred in North America to unlock any tax credits. If it passes that test, now you're looking at two $3,750 electric car tax credits that add up to $7,500 if you meet all the criteria. To get the first $3,750 credit, a certain percentage of the car's critical battery minerals must have been sourced from the U.S. or from any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.

The other $3,750 credit requires that a certain percentage of battery components be manufactured or assembled in the same roster of countries. There are also significant eligibility caps on both the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the vehicle — $55,000 for cars; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks and vans — and the income of the buyer, which is subject to limits between $150,000 and $300,000, depending on tax filing status. If either figure is too high, you won't qualify for any federal EV tax credits.

If you're buying a used EV or PHEV, you don't have to worry about where the car was assembled or where its battery bits came from. The income caps are significantly lower, however, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, while the car itself must be at least two years old and cost no more than $25,000. You also have to buy it from a dealer, not a private party. Check all the boxes, and you can get a tax credit of up to $4,000, though there's a sliding scale for cheaper used EVs, which will be explained below.

What about leasing a new EV or PHEV? There's a legislative loophole that lets the originator of the lease (typically the automaker's finance division) take the full $7,500 tax credit for a leased EV, irrespective of the final assembly, battery sourcing and vehicle pricing requirements. It's up to each automaker to decide whether to pass these savings along in the form of more affordable leases, but keep in mind that you might get a hefty discount on a leased EV thanks to this loophole. That's true even if your income would disqualify you from getting the tax credit on a purchased EV — since you're not the one getting the tax credit in this case, your income is irrelevant.

Which new vehicles qualify for the federal EV tax credit?

The following vehicles should qualify for the federal EV tax credit because they are assembled in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery component requirements.

It's also worth noting that the vehicle must be purchased for ""original use"" to qualify for the federal tax credit, meaning that it is for the taxpayer's use. You cannot buy the vehicle and then immediately resell it in hopes of getting the tax credit.

This list is based on data from the U.S. Department of Energy, last updated on May 19, 2025. It affects new cars placed in service from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, 2025.

If you're interested in other possible EV credits, rebates, and manufacturer incentives, take a look at Edmunds' detailed list here.

Qualifying new cars for the 2025 EV tax credit

Edmunds

How to qualify for the used EV tax credit

The tax credit for used EVs will be calculated based on either 30% of the vehicle's value or $4,000, whichever is less. As we mentioned earlier, there are no assembly requirements or battery component percentages for used EVs and PHEVs. The rules for used EVs went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023, and are as follows:

Price limit for used vehicles: There is a hard eligibility ceiling at a sale price of $25,000 for all used EVs regardless of type.

Income limits for used vehicles: As with new vehicles, the income limits are determined by modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). By filing status, the limits are as follows.

Edmunds

Other eligibility requirements for used EVs

The vehicle must be at least two model years older than the calendar year in which it was purchased.

The used EV tax credit applies only once in the vehicle's lifetime. Subsequent owners are not eligible.

Once a buyer has taken the federal used EV credit, the buyer is not eligible for another credit for three years.

The vehicle must be for personal use and ""not for resale.""

The vehicle must be purchased through a dealer.

Only an individual may claim the used EV tax credit. Businesses are excluded.

Electric vehicle tax credit for leasing

Leased electric cars or plug-in hybrids from dealerships are considered ""commercial vehicles"" under IRS regulations. This means that the full $7,500 tax credit goes to the company that leased it to you, which is usually the automaker's captive finance arm. In other words, the automaker itself effectively gets the benefit of the tax credit. Moreover, leased EVs and PHEVs are not subject to the major restrictions detailed above — there are no limitations regarding final assembly, battery sourcing or vehicle pricing, while the caps on buyer income are irrelevant because there is no purchase in the case of a lease.

There's also no obligation on the automaker's part to pass along any savings to you, but in practice, many automakers seem to be offering at least some kind of discount on EV leases as a direct result of this loophole. It probably won't last forever, so if you're interested in leasing vehicles not on the list here, check with your local dealership to see if there are loophole-driven lease discounts.

How to qualify for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit

Several requirements will determine if an electric car qualifies for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit. The maximum buyer credit for new vehicles is $7,500, provided that several requirements are met.

Final assembly, parts, and mineral sourcing requirements

The final assembly of the new vehicle must occur in North America (i.e., the U.S., Canada or Mexico). This is the gateway requirement for the federal EV tax credit — if the answer is no, the EV won't qualify unless you're leasing. This rule went into effect on Aug. 16, 2022, and affects vehicles purchased through 2032.

If the vehicle meets the assembly requirement, you can think of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as being split into two halves — critical battery minerals and battery components — each worth $3,750 and subject to requirements of its own. The percentages will be discussed here, but don't worry about remembering this. The EPA has already calculated the percentages below to determine which cars are eligible and are reflected in this list, so you won't have to figure it out yourself.

Critical battery minerals: To qualify for this $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must have been either recycled in the U.S. or extracted or processed there (or in any country that has a free trade agreement with the U.S.).

Battery components: To qualify for the remaining $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the EV's battery components must be manufactured or assembled in the U.S. (or in any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.)

New vehicle pricing limits for EV tax credits

The following price caps by vehicle type became effective as of Jan. 1, 2023, and refer specifically to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). It does not include the manufacturer's destination charge, optional items added by the dealer, or taxes and fees. For example, if you're looking at an SUV with a $79,990 MSRP, and the destination fee takes it over $80,000, the vehicle is still eligible. If, for example, the vehicle is priced above the MSRP limit (let's say $82,000), but there's a manufacturer incentive that brings it back down to $80,000, the vehicle would also not be eligible.

Edmunds

New car buyer income limits for EV tax credits

The income limits are based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which is roughly the adjusted gross income with certain allowable deductions added back in for the current or prior tax year. Depending on your tax filing status, the limits for a new vehicle are:

Edmunds

What's changed for 2025?

As of Jan. 1, 2025, a vehicle is ineligible for a tax credit if any of the battery's components and critical battery materials were sourced from a ""foreign entity of concern,"" which includes China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. That's a big deal given China's outsized role in the minerals supply chain to date. The critical battery minerals requirement went up to 60% from 50% last year.

Additionally, the credits will no longer be in effect after Sept. 30, 2025.

How do I claim the EV tax credit?

If you purchased an eligible vehicle in 2025, you have two options to claim the tax credit:

You can claim the credit on your tax return for the year in which it was purchased, using Form 8936. If your tax liability is less than $7,500, the IRS said it will not seek repayment, but just keep in mind you won't get to keep the difference either, as it is a nonrefundable credit.

You can transfer the EV tax credit to an eligible dealership so that they can apply the credit amount to your final purchase cost. The dealership must be registered with IRS Energy Credits Online. They should submit and give you a copy of the ""time of sale report"" to confirm that the report was accepted. This document will be needed when filing your tax return. If you lease the vehicle, the credit goes to the lessor and may be used to reduce the price of the lease if the leasing party chooses to do so. If you choose to go this route, please note that you still need to fill out IRS Form 8936, which reports your eligibility for the credit and your decision to transfer the credit to the dealer.

It is important to verify that you meet the income requirements listed above; otherwise, you may need to repay the IRS if your modified adjusted gross income is higher than the authorized limits.

FAQs

How does the EV charger tax credit work?

If you are installing an EV charger at your home, the federal credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $1,000, whichever is smaller. For those wanting to install an EV charger at a business or investment property, the credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $30,000, whichever is smaller. You can claim the EV charger tax credit the following year on your income taxes using IRS Form 8911. Some states may have additional incentives for installing an EV charger, so it's worth looking into this list maintained by the DOE. Your local utility company might also have incentives for installing an EV charger.

How much can you write off for an electric car?

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit. The difference is that a $7,500 write-off reduces your taxable income by that amount before the tax is calculated, whereas a $7,500 credit means you pay $7,500 less in tax than you would have otherwise. In case that didn't clear things up, just remember that for a given dollar amount, a tax credit means a lot more money in your pocket than a write-off.

The maximum federal tax credit of $7,500 on an eligible electric vehicle is effectively a $7,500 handout to you, which is far more than what you'd gain if you simply subtracted $7,500 from your taxable income. It's worth looking into this list of state EV incentives maintained by the DOE so that you can maximize the benefits of buying an EV. You also have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as an immediate discount on the car.

How does the federal tax credit for EVs work?

To qualify for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, the EV you purchase has to be brand new and assembled in North America. Beyond that, increasingly stringent geographical requirements are being phased in regarding the composition and production of the car's battery pack alongside the vehicle pricing and personal income requirements.

You have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as a discount on the car, as opposed to having to wait for tax season. You can also choose to have the credit applied to your taxes using IRS Form 8936, which you submit as part of your annual taxes to the federal government.

Are there tax credits from states or other sources?

Yes. While the federal tax credits for plug-in and natural gas vehicles get the most mention, there also are dozens of state and regional incentives on plug-in vehicles and those that use alternative fuels. Many states have a dozen or more programs. Many, however, apply only to businesses. Some credits come in the form of exemptions from fees and inspections. Others are nonmonetary incentives such as carpool lane access and free parking.

Retail buyers in a number of states can get some cost relief in the form of tax credits, rebates, reduced vehicle taxes, or registration fees for buying a qualified alternative-fuel or electric-drive vehicle. Edmunds keeps a detailed list of state, local, federal and manufacturer incentives all in one place. The U.S. Department of Energy has an interactive chart of state incentives. It's a good idea to be sure about available state and local incentives before you shop. Just because a state has a program now doesn't mean it will continue indefinitely.

How about hydrogen fuel cell cars?

On paper, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles should qualify for incentives and are explicitly mentioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. However, at the time of this writing, no hydrogen-powered vehicles qualify for a tax credit for a vehicle purchase, likely due to not being built in North America. A workaround would be to lease the vehicle, in which case the automaker can — but is not obligated to — use the tax credit as a discount toward the lease. This can be a way to save some money on vehicles like the Toyota Mirai or Hyundai Nexo. Take a look at the U.S. Department of Energy's website to see the latest hydrogen laws and incentives.

Is there a tax credit for buying a Tesla in 2025?

Yes. As of the beginning of 2023, Tesla customers are once again eligible for the new tax credit of up to $7,500. That said, the vehicle must satisfy the manufacturing, pricing, and income requirements discussed in this article. Like other EVs, there will be no tax credits for any Tesla model after Sept. 30, 2025.",https://cmg-cmg-rd-20056-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Fcmg%2FD3O3NQWWWE5S3ERJIOJ3TJ7RUU.jpg?auth=ce55ee70e362e14b0734fcf79c27d610aaa560d59c04fe7975341d423ff88e4a&width=1200&height=630&smart=true,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:42.518296

“Vistra will conduct and pay for the battery removal and disposal process under EPA’s oversight,” Kazami Brockman, the EPA’s on-scene coordinator, said during a Monterey County news briefing Wednesday.
But the Vistra fire also has exposed the dangers inherent with large-scale battery storage, prompting state and federal regulators to seek stronger safety protocols.
The Moss Landing fire ignited nine days after the start of the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County.
Albizu said the battery removal in Moss Landing differs greatly from the removal of smaller batteries in Southern California, many of which came from electric vehicles.","Ever since a massive fire tore through one of the world’s largest battery storage facilities in January, cleanup crews have been unable to safely access portions of the building that burned in rural Monterey County.

The risk of reigniting a fire has been too high, preventing crews from starting the lengthy, dangerous removal of tens of thousands of lithium-ion batteries.

Now, that process could soon begin.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it had reached an agreement regarding the battery removal with Texas-based Vistra Corp., which owns the battery energy storage system in Moss Landing that caught fire.

The 75-page agreement, signed July 17, requires Vistra to submit detailed work plans to the EPA on all aspects of battery removal and to get the government’s approval before it proceeds.

“Vistra will conduct and pay for the battery removal and disposal process under EPA’s oversight,” Kazami Brockman, the EPA’s on-scene coordinator, said during a Monterey County news briefing Wednesday. “If the agreement is not performed to EPA’s satisfaction, EPA does have the authority to take over the cleanup and bill Vistra for the cost.”

Brockman added, “We anticipate that this work will continue for over a year due to the technical complexity as well as the safety measures being put in place to protect the workers and the community.”

In an email Wednesday night, Meranda Cohn, a Vistra spokeswoman, said “battery removal could not occur until this agreement was in place.”

The Moss Landing fire began Jan. 16. It smoldered for several days, spewing toxic gas into the air and prompting the evacuation of about 1,500 people. Firefighters let it burn, citing the dangers of dousing lithium-ion battery fires with water, which can cause dangerous chemical reactions.

The fire ignited inside a former turbine building that contained a 300-megawatt system made up of about 4,500 cabinets, with each containing 22 individual battery modules, according to Vistra.

Such battery systems store excess energy generated during the day and release it into the power grid during times of high demand, including evening hours. These facilities are seen as essential for stabilizing the state’s electric grid and advancing the transition to cleaner energy because they can store solar and wind power to use when the sun isn’t shining and turbines are not turning.

But the Vistra fire also has exposed the dangers inherent with large-scale battery storage, prompting state and federal regulators to seek stronger safety protocols.

Of the 99,000 individual LG battery modules in the building, about 54,450 burned, according to Vistra.

On Feb. 18, the fire reignited and burned for several hours. Vistra wrote on its website that “additional instances of smoke and flare-ups are a possibility given the nature of this situation and the damage to the batteries.”

The damaged building — filled with burned and unaffected lithium-ion batteries — remains volatile, which has both slowed and complicated the cleanup.

“The challenge here is there are batteries in various states of charge, still being able to hold charge, all the way to completely consumed,” Brockman said.

Over the last six months, crews have removed fire debris containing asbestos and disconnected safely accessible batteries to reduce the risk of reignition, according to the EPA.

Some portions of the building have been “completely inaccessible,” Ramon Albizu, the EPA’s lead on-scene coordinator, said in an interview Thursday. He added that the 99,000 modules in the building suffered varying degrees of damage.

“We need to carefully, surgically demolish the building to be able to get to all the modules,” Albizu said. “That requires a lot of planning.”

Since the fire, the EPA, Vistra and other regulatory agencies have created more than 30 work plans related to the demolition and battery removal, he said. Work to stabilize the building should begin by the end of the month, he added.

The Moss Landing fire ignited nine days after the start of the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles County. The EPA, under pressure from the Trump administration to work quickly in Southern California, removed about 300 tons of hazardous household debris — including more than 1,000 lithium-ion batteries — from the massive burn zones in Altadena and Pacific Palisades within 28 days.

Albizu said the battery removal in Moss Landing differs greatly from the removal of smaller batteries in Southern California, many of which came from electric vehicles. In the Vistra building, each of the 99,000 batteries, he said, is about 4 feet long and weighs more than 200 pounds.

“It’s something that is unprecedented,” Albizu said of the battery plant fire.

Once each battery is removed, its remaining energy will be transferred to another source, according to the EPA. If the batteries are too damaged for that to be done, crews will discharge them through brining, during which they are submerged in a water-and-salt solution.

The batteries then will be transported off-site for disposal, David Yeager, director of project development for Vistra, said during the Monterey County news briefing Wednesday.

In a statement to The Times on Thursday, Monterey County Supervisor Glenn Church, whose district includes Moss Landing, said he was “disappointed it has taken this long to come to a point where cleanup can begin, but safety must be a priority.”

According to Vistra, the cause of the blaze “remains unknown” and is still under investigation by the company. The California Public Utilities Commission also has an ongoing investigation.

The Vistra fire rocked California’s clean energy industry and its plans for more battery plants, which state leaders are aggressively pursuing.

In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal published Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom touted California’s transition to renewable energy, writing that it was “time for America to follow California’s lead.”

He wrote that the ability to store clean electricity was “a key factor” in hitting clean energy goals and that, over the last six years, the state has added 15,000 megawatts of battery storage capacity, enough to meet a quarter of peak electricity demand.

“More is on the way,” Newsom wrote, “including the largest battery project in the world, now being permitted in Fresno County through California’s new fast-track permitting process.”

Niki Woodard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said in an email Friday that the the 300-megawatt capacity at the Moss Landing facility “is still reflected in California’s total battery storage.”

Along with additional safety regulations, the blaze has prompted calls for more local control over where battery facilities are located.

In a survey of nearby residents conducted by the Monterey and Santa Cruz counties’ health departments, 83% of respondents said they experienced at least one symptom — most commonly headaches, sore throats and coughing — shortly after the fire. Nearly a quarter of respondents said they had trouble breathing, and 39% reported having a metallic taste in their mouth.

The survey, conducted in February and March, polled 1,539 people who lived or worked in the region at the time of the fire.

Knut Johnson, an attorney with the law firm Singleton Schreiber, said hundreds of nearby residents have joined a lawsuit against Vistra, LG Energy Solution and Pacific Gas & Electric, accusing the companies of failing to maintain adequate fire safety systems.

Johnson said plaintiffs are “very worried” about the batteries that remain on site.

“Those burned-up batteries still contain a lot of toxins,” Johnson said. “The wind blows, the evening fog rolls in, suspending particles in the moisture — there’s lots of ways for any remaining toxins to get around the community.”

The fire should “serve as a wake-up call,” Johnson said, for anyone wanting to build battery storage facilities near residential areas and sensitive ecosystems.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75b59e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+282/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2Fd5%2F544bd39a437eac36f53f1b36daea%2Fgettyimages-2193809066.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 19:01:22.782618

The EPA has crafted a proposal that would undo the government's ""endangerment finding,"" a determination that pollutants from burning fossil fuels, such as carbon dioxide and methane, can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The finding has long served as the foundation for a host of policies and rules to address climate change. The EPA's proposal to revoke the finding is currently under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Already, environmentalists, climate advocates and others are bracing for what could be a fundamental shift away from trying to address the problem of a hotter climate. And the Trump administration is celebrating the proposal as a potential economic win.

""Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the proposal in March. ""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.""

The administration's effort comes in the wake of the hottest year humans have ever recorded on Earth, climate-fueled wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes in Los Angeles and hotter ocean temperatures that made Hurricane Helene stronger and more likely to cause damage inland.

Solar continues to set new records

Solar continues to be the fastest-growing source of US electricity, according to EIA’s latest “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through May 31, 2025), which the SUN DAY Campaign reviewed.

In May alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (>1-megawatt (MW)) increased by 33.3% year-over-year, while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 8.9%. Combined, they grew by 26.4% and provided over 11% of US electrical output during the month.

For the first time ever, the mix of utility-scale and small-scale solar produced more electricity than wind: solar – 38,965 gigawatt-hours (GWh); wind – 36,907-GWh.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 39.8% while that from small-scale systems rose by 10.7% during the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 31.1% and was nearly 8.4% of total US electrical generation for January to May – up from 6.6% a year earlier.

Solar-generated electricity easily surpassed the output of US hydropower plants (6.1%). Solar now produces more electricity than hydropower, biomass, and geothermal combined.

Wind is also on the rise in 2025

Wind produced 12.2% of US electricity in the first five months of 2025. Its output was 3.9% greater than the year before, almost double that produced by hydropower.

During the first five months of 2025, electrical generation by wind + utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 20.5% of the US total, up from 18.7% during the first five months of 2024. Solar + wind accounted for nearly 21.5% of US electrical output in May alone.

During the first five months of this year, wind and solar provided 26.2% more electricity than coal, and 15.4% more than US nuclear power plants. In May alone, the disparity increased further when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 55.7% and 22.1%, respectively.

All renewables produced almost 30% in May

The mix of all renewables – wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, geothermal – produced 9.7% more electricity in January to May than they did a year ago (7.6% more in May alone) and provided 28.1% of total US electricity production compared to 26.5% 12 months earlier.

Electrical generation by all renewables in May alone provided 29.7% of total US electrical generation. Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second only to that of natural gas, whose electrical output actually dropped by 5.9% during the month.

“Solar and wind continue to grow, set new records, and outproduce both coal and nuclear power,” said Ken Bossong, the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director. “Consequently, the ongoing Republican assault against renewables is not only misguided and illogical but also a good example of shooting oneself in the foot.”

“The threat of not getting infrastructure built has only gotten larger,” he continued. “Not only from bad actors getting rich by selling energy that could be replaced with American energy—it’s also the threat of China winning the AI race.”

In the first few days of his second term, President Donald Trump hit the breaks on new wind energy development by pausing all new federal permits for on or offshore projects. Just days before, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office released its strategic plan to provide affordable and reliable energy, while also meeting the state’s climate goals. The plan calls for a mix of clean energy sources, but is largely predicated on a goal to develop offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine.

Meanwhile, the latest federal tax bill created another roadblock for the clean energy industry by phasing out the tax credits for solar and wind projects that aren’t in service by the end of 2027.

Like Maine, Massachusetts is trying to shift its power mix to sustainable sources and has a statutory goal to lock in contracts for at least 5,600 megawatts of offshore wind by 2027. It has one project under construction that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year, but it won’t be enough to meet that objective.

That’s why Massachusetts’s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs is potentially looking to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada — news first reported by Canada’s National Observer last month.

While turning north of the border won’t be without its own challenges, Massachusetts state Sen. Michael Barrett called it a “creative solution” and said he would work to extend the statutory deadline so the state can pursue this route.

“This becomes a serious possibility for the mid-term and the long-term,” Barrett told CommonWealth Beacon. “It isn’t a short-term substitution for the damage that President Trump is doing to our current offshore wind projects, but there’s a lot of promise here.”

The Governor’s Energy Office in Maine didn’t dismiss the idea. The office told Maine Morning Star that it is working with New England and Canadian partners to advance shared energy goals.

“We’re closely tracking the development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure, and broad economic benefits for Maine,” the office said in a statement Friday.

Other proponents are divided

Though Maine faces the same domestic roadblocks from the Trump administration, it has a longer statutory runway than Massachusetts. State law outlines a goal to develop 3,000 megawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2040.

Given that timeline, Jack Shapiro, climate and clean energy director for the Natural Resources Council of Maine, said it’s probably too early for the state to procure energy from Canadian projects to achieve its offshore wind goals. Building a new industry was always going to require long-term planning and, unlike Massachusetts, Maine’s statutory timeline goes well beyond Trump’s term, he added.

“We’ve got a long way to go before I think we need to give up on the idea of building an offshore wind industry for Maine, given how much we know about the economic benefits that will come along with that,” Shapiro said.

Could Canadian offshore wind help meet New England’s climate goals?

Constructing a port to build floating offshore wind platforms could support more than 6,000 jobs during construction and an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050 for a total economic benefit to the state of $6.6 billion, according to an economic impact analysis conducted by Karp Strategies on behalf of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Proponents also say this would provide a new industry to anchor the local economy.

Rather than turn to Canada, Shapiro said the state can use the remainder of the Trump administration to continue researching the budding technology so that when the roadblocks clear it will be ready to keep moving forward on domestic offshore wind projects.

Alternately, some argue that supporting Canadian projects would allow the industry to continue to advance and innovate so that when the political environment is more favorable, Maine and its workers would benefit.

Cheyenne Gallivan, communications director for the Maine Labor Climate Council, said if New England states buying offshore wind power from Canada could jumpstart the industry, it’s worth considering.

“We, of course, want Maine workers to be domestically producing our energy, but at a time when the federal and political environment is not amenable to our development of that homegrown offshore wind, we don’t see working with Canada as something that would hinder,” Gallivan said.

Though Maine workers would more easily benefit from domestic projects, workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, noted Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers Local 7 and vice president of the Maine AFL-CIO. But he added those dynamics could be complicated by current trade tensions.

Pointing out that part of northern Maine is already intertwined with the electrical grid in New Brunswick, Provost said strengthening the regional market would benefit everyone.

“It’s better to have an industry move forward in an area so that it can grow to the whole northeast, at the end of the day, as opposed to not having that happen and then starting from scratch again in three and a half, four years,” Provost said.

While the future of Maine’s wind industry is dependent on who next occupies the White House, Gallivan said the next governor of Maine will also need to commit to developing offshore wind. The current governor, Janet Mills, will be termed out by the end of 2026.

While Democrats in Maine, including Mills, are largely supportive of the state’s energy goals and the development of offshore wind, in particular, Republican legislators wrote a letter to Trump thanking him for his action on offshore wind and asking him to take it a step further by revoking the existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine. They argued it puts Maine’s fishing industry at risk, but the lease areas outlined by the federal government already avoid a vital fishing area.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vineyard-Wind-turbine-scaled-1-1-2048x1534-1.webp,N,,2025-07-25 17:03:43.661563

(NEXSTAR) — New York’s future energy goals remain the subject of fierce debate, with Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration presenting a new draft energy plan on Thursday. Drawing criticism from environmentalists who argue it falls short, the draft from the State Energy Planning Board maps state power demand through 2040, aiming to balance supply, affordability, and climate concerns.

New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, passed in 2019, mandated greenhouse gas reductions of 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050. The CLCPA also calls for 70% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030 and a 100% zero-emission electric system by 2040.

The State Energy Planning Board released the draft plan, which proposes ways to meet these future energy demands, for public comment. Share your thoughts until October 6 online, by email, by mail, or at one of the nine public hearings planned throughout August and September. These include virtual meetings and in-person meetings in Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Hudson Valley, New York City, and Long Island.

The final State Energy Plan is slated for publication before 2026. Today, about three-quarters of New York’s primary energy comes from fossil fuels, mostly natural gas (39%) and petroleum (36%). The electric power sector uses the most energy (35%), followed by transportation (31%), homes and businesses (29%), and industry (5%). And we lose most of that energy (64%) when converting to heat or electricity.

The draft plan analyzes how the energy system could change through 2040, projecting 35 more gigawatts of solar and 9 gigawatts each of energy storage, offshore wind, and onshore wind. Existing nuclear and hydroelectric will continue to generate power, with less overall from burning fuels, partly because of new projects like the Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line and new energy storage systems.

By 2040, the plan predicts a 26% increase in annual electricity demand and a 23% increase in peak demand, compared to 2025. It also expects natural gas in homes and businesses to drop because of state policies, a warming climate, buildings becoming more efficient, and people choosing greener options. But if renewable projects fall behind schedule, natural gas plants would need to generate a larger share come 2040, which would release over 7 million tons of greenhouse gas.

The plan anticipates massive jumps in electricity consumption through 2040, a change from the past 10 years when demand was mostly flat. New large businesses and factories, electric vehicles, and heat pumps drive much of that projected growth. And in a recent op-ed in USA Today, Hochul specifically cited the $100 billion computer chip factory near Syracuse and a large artificial intelligence supercomputer in Buffalo as justifications for more power.

Hochul has expressed support for an all-of-the-above energy strategy, talking up the need for diverse power sources to meet rising energy demands while creating jobs. While acknowledging the importance of renewable energy, she stressed the need for always-available baseload power for industries of the future.

She argued that solar and wind power only work in certain conditions, while those future industries need a “fully dependable electric grid.” That’s why she plans for the New York Power Authority to build a power plant upstate, a “clean, reliable, around-the-clock source of electricity” that does not burn fossil fuels.

But on Thursday, state lawmakers, local officials, and environmental groups in Binghamton pushed Hochul to reject the Constitution and Northeast Energy Supply Enhancement natural gas pipelines. That’s because the draft plan suggests natural gas as a major component of the supply to meet energy demand circa 2040.

The Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC, previously denied both pipelines in 2016 and 2019 due to threats to water quality. The Constitution pipeline’s route could pollute some 250 waterways from Pennsylvania to New York, while NESE—which would run for 24 miles beneath New York Harbor—was rejected over concerns about stirring up toxic materials that damage ecosystems.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the company Williams again seeks approval for these projects in the wake of negotiations between the governor and President Donald Trump. The White House said Hochul “caved” on the pipelines after Trump allowed a wind project to continue, though Hochul denied any deal. But opponents maintain that those pipelines pose the same dangers today as they did before. Frack Action director Julia Walsh offered, “New Yorkers want clean water, not Trump’s dirty pipelines.”

Dr. Kathleen Nolan, co-founder of Concerned Health Professionals of NY, explained that studies link such pipelines to “significant sources of hazardous air pollutants, including the carcinogens benzene and formaldehyde.” And Democratic Assemblymember Dr. Anna Kelles warned that the NESE pipeline alone could raise costs for National Grid customers in New York City and Long Island by 3.5% while harming industries like agritourism in Central New York.

Democratic State Senator Lea Webb agreed, saying, “These pipelines threaten everything we hold dear, from our trout streams and family farms to our children’s health and our region’s economic future.”

Adding to the energy debate, the Public Power NY Coalition pointed out that the draft identifies renewables as the most cost-effective option. They said that Hochul is “refusing to lead on climate,” “giving up on climate goals,” and “leaving the most powerful tool in the toolbox by not fully utilizing NYPA to build 15 gigawatts of public renewables.”

They argued that the draft energy plan barely mentions the Build Public Renewables Act passed in 2023. The BPRA lets NYPA build and own renewable energy projects, empowering the state to build 15 gigawatts of public renewable power by 2030 to meet CLCPA goals. Instead, per the coalition, she’s relying on “volatile fracked gas and costly nuclear” to power “wasteful AI over keeping the lights on for New Yorkers.”

It’s true that New York faces high costs for energy investments through 2040 regardless of the path it takes. One minimal plan in the draft, the “No Action” scenario, would still cost $120 billion per year (in 2024 dollars) through 2040. That’s because just maintaining or updating infrastructure, replacing old equipment, and acquiring fuels to meet demand all require ongoing spending.

The more aggressive scenario incorporating clean energy efforts raises costs by 2% in 2030 and 9% in 2040 compared to “No Action.” The state could meet more than 90% of its investment needs each year by shifting to newer, cleaner renewables.

And that plan also foretells 13% job growth by 2040 in New York’s energy sectors—electricity, buildings, transportation, and fuels—adding over 60,000 jobs. Most of that growth would be in construction, an industry that could grow by about 60%, adding 45,000 net jobs.

By 2040, policies to reduce pollution could prevent about 9,700 early deaths, 4,100 nonfatal heart attacks, and 12,500 asthma-related emergency room visits. The combined value of health benefits from cleaner air (fewer fine particles and ozone) by 2040 could approach $65 billion (in 2024 dollars). Most public health benefits come from reducing emissions in transportation (50%) and buildings (40%). A smaller part (5%) comes from cleaner electricity generation, though the benefits from electricity are more than double per person in disadvantaged communities compared to other areas.

Beyond the energy plan, New York is working on other environmental and power-related initiatives. DEC adopted a new rule on Wednesday to create an Endangered and Threatened Species Mitigation Bank Fund to offset damage to endangered and threatened species caused by renewable energy or energy transmission.

The DEC also wants public comments on proposed regulations for closed-loop geothermal drilling, which uses the earth’s heat to warm and cool buildings. It would reduce reliance on fossil fuels and help meet decarbonization goals. Public comments are accepted through August 22, with virtual public meetings scheduled for July 29 and July 31.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/06/6859a117c61032.82545014.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 22:01:18.367278

The update was shared in a report from Insider, which cited an internal memo from the electric vehicle maker.

New Robotaxi service launch

According to Insider, the Robotaxi service in the Bay Area is set to launch as soon as Friday. Thus, some Tesla owners in the area should receive invites to use the driverless ride-hailing service. Similar to the Austin pilot, the Robotaxi rides will reportedly be a paid service.

The publication noted that the Robotaxi service’s geofence in its Bay Area launch will be quite large, as it will include Marin, much of the East Bay, San Francisco, and San Jose. This is not surprising as California has long been saturated with Teslas, and it is home to several of the electric vehicle maker’s key facilities.

Unlike the Austin pilot, the Tesla Robotaxi service’s pilot in the Bay Area will use safety drivers seated in the driver’s seat. These drivers will be able to manually take over using the steering wheel and brakes as needed. As per a spokesperson from the California DMV, the agency recently met with Tesla but the company is yet to submit a formal application to operate fully driverless cars.

Tesla Robotaxi expansion

Interestingly enough, Tesla did tease the release of its Robotaxi service to the Bay Area in its second quarter earnings call. While discussing the service, Tesla VP of Autopilot/AI Software Ashok Elluswamy mentioned that the company will initially be rolling out Robotaxis with safety drivers in the San Francisco Bay Area. He did, however, also highlight that the electric vehicle maker is working hard to get government permission to release the service for consumers.

“The next thing to expand would be in the San Francisco Bay Area. We are working with the government to get approval here and, in the meanwhile, launch the service without the person in the driver seat just to expedite and while we wait for regulatory approval,” he stated.

The United States’ electric vehicle tax credit is coming to an end at the end of the third quarter. Tesla, the country’s leading electric vehicle maker, is ready to meet this challenge with a rather simple but clever counter.

Tesla executives outlined this strategy in the recently held Q2 2025 earnings call.

End of the US EV tax credit

While Elon Musk has always maintained that he prefers a market with no EV tax credit, he also emphasized that he supports the rollback of any incentives given to the oil and gas industry. The Trump administration has not done this so far, instead focusing on the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of the third quarter.

Tesla has been going all-in on encouraging customers to purchase their vehicles in Q3 to take advantage of lower prices. The company has also implemented a series of incentives across all its offerings, from the Cybertruck to the Model 3. This, however, is not all, as the company seems to be preparing a longer-term solution to the expiration of the EV tax credit.

Affordable variants

During the Q2 2025 earnings call, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moray stated that Tesla really did start the production of more affordable models in June. Quality builds of these vehicles are being ramped this quarter, with the goal of optimizing production over the remaining months of the year. If Tesla is successful, these models will be available for everyone in Q4.

“We started production in June, and we’re ramping quality builds and things around the quarter. And given that we started in North America and our goal is to maximize production with a higher rate. So starting Q3, we’re going to keep pushing hard on our current models to avoid complexity… We’ll be ready with new, more affordable models available for everyone in Q4.,” Moravy stated.

These comments suggest that Tesla should be able to offer vehicles that are competitively priced even after the EV tax credit has been phased out. Interestingly enough, previous comments from Tesla executives have mentioned that these more affordable models would resemble the company’s current lineup. This suggests that the more affordable models may indeed be variations of the Model Y and Model 3, but offered at a lower price.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the company’s plans for its next expansion of the Robotaxi in terms of both the geofence in Austin and the platform overall, as it looks to move to new areas outside of Texas.

Tesla launched the Robotaxi platform last month on June 22, and has since expanded both the pool of users and the area that the driverless Model Y vehicles can travel within.

The first expansion of the geofence caught the attention of nearly everyone and became a huge headline as Tesla picked a very interesting shape for the new geofence, resembling male reproductive parts.

The next expansion will likely absolve this shape. Musk revealed last night that the new geofence will be “well in excess of what competitors are doing,” and it could happen “hopefully in a week or two.”

Musk’s full quote regarding the expansion of the geofence and the timing was:

“As some may have noted, we have already expanded our service area in Austin. It’s bigger and longer, and it’s going to get even bigger and longer. We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two.”

The expansion will not stop there, either. As Tesla has operated the Robotaxi platform in Austin for the past month, it has been working with regulators in other areas, like California, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida, to get the driverless ride-hailing system activated in more U.S. states.

Tesla confirmed that they are in talks with each of these states regarding the potential expansion of Robotaxi.

Musk added:

“As we get the approvals and prove out safety, we will be launching the autonomous ride-hailing across most of the country. I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year.”

We know that Tesla and Musk have been prone to aggressive and sometimes outlandish timelines regarding self-driving technology specifically. Regulatory approvals could happen by the end of the year in several areas, and working on these large metros is the best way to reach half of the U.S. population.

Tesla said its expansion of the geofence in Austin is conservative and controlled due to its obsession with safety, even admitting at one point during the Earnings Call that they are being “paranoid.” Expanding the geofence is necessary, but Tesla realizes any significant mistake by Robotaxi could take it back to square one.

Tesla has warned customers about its incentive strategy for qualifying electric vehicles, as the days of both the $7,500 EV tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs are coming to a close.

Both tax credits, which impact some of the vehicles in the Tesla lineup, are set to be eliminated at the end of Q3. The phase out of these consumer credits was always in the plans of the Trump Administration, but now we’re in the final quarter of their existence.

As a result, EV companies are scrambling to see how they can reduce costs or make their vehicles more affordable for customers. The $7,500 will price many consumers out of many EVs on the market, and Tesla is not immune to that.

However, Tesla has made a significant push into Q3 deliveries, rolling out numerous incentives to customers, including 0% APR on select purchases, lease deals, free upgrades on certain inventory units, and more.

The extensive list of incentives on Tesla vehicles in the quarter will not get any longer, either. During last night’s Tesla Earnings Call for the second quarter of 2025, company executives stated that their intention for these incentives was to encourage customers to place orders early in the quarter.

Tesla will only be able to apply the $7,500 credit with deliveries that occur before the end of September. Even if an order is placed before then, delivery must be completed by September 31 to receive the tax credit.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja confirmed that the incentives for the quarter are already out and encouraged customers to place an order sooner rather than later:

“Given the abrupt change, we have a limited supply of vehicles in the US this quarter. As we are already within lead times to order parts for cars, we have rolled out all our planned incentives already and will start pairing them back as we start to sell. If you are in the US and looking to buy a car, let’s roll now as we may not be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed in the later part of August and beyond.”

The loss of the incentives will impact every EV maker in the United States. Tesla has a plan moving forward, and it said last night that its affordable models would be rolled out in Q4, as introducing these cars any earlier could have detrimental effects on Model 3 and Model Y sales.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/robotaxi-austin-launch-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 17:03:40.553630

Donald Trump is coming for the “holy grail” of climate regulations. As multiple media outlets reported this week, the administration plans to roll back the “endangerment finding,” an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency decision at the center of the government’s ability to address climate change.

On paper, the endangerment finding states that greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide pose a risk to the public’s health and well-being. That may sound obvious enough. But in practice, it’s one of the agency’s most important decisions.

That’s thanks to the landmark 2007 Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, which found that the agency not only has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, but the obligation to do so, if it determines the pollutants pose a health hazard. In 2009, backed by an overwhelming body of science, the endangerment finding did just that.

Now, the Trump administration reportedly plans to throw out the finding, stripping the EPA of its central role in regulating emissions from vehicle tailpipes, power plants, and more. If the administration succeeds in court (a big if), experts say it would put the United States’—and the world’s—ability to fight climate change at risk.

To understand what rescinding the endangerment finding might mean, I called up Pat Parenteau, an emeritus law professor and senior fellow for climate policy in the Environmental Law Center at Vermont Law School, and James Milkey, a retired Massachusetts Appeals Court justice and former environmental attorney who argued Massachusetts v. EPA before the Supreme Court.

Here are a few takeaways from our conversations.

The evidence that greenhouse gases are bad for health is irrefutable.

More than two decades ago, Milkey and his team at the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office sued the Bush administration over its inaction on climate change in Massachusetts v. EPA. At the time, he recalls, they faced all sorts of challenges, but “marshaling the underlying science was not one of them.”

The science was clear. “Scientists are the most skeptical people on Earth,” he says. “And there was a scientific consensus that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere posed dire threats.”

Since then, those threats have only worsened. As the most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), completed in 2023, concluded, “Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.”

The Trump administration, in a sense, appears to recognize this. While it hasn’t released the details of its proposal publicly, reports from the New York Times, Washington Post, and other outlets indicate that Trump officials aren’t planning to repeal the endangerment finding on scientific grounds, but procedural ones, and will reportedly argue that the Obama administration overstepped its authority under the Clean Air Act.

Rescinding the “endangerment finding” won’t be easy.

On June 30, the Trump EPA sent its proposal—”Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards”—to the Office of Management and Budget, an EPA spokesperson told Mother Jones in an emailed statement. The proposal will be published for public comment, the spokesperson said, “once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the Administrator.”

After it’s finalized, expect “lawsuits galore,” Parenteau says, whether from attorneys general in blue states, public health groups, or climate nonprofits.

From there, it could take years—possibly the rest of the Trump administration’s term in office, according to Parenteau—for the courts to sort out the lawsuits. Ultimately, the question is likely to go to the Supreme Court. If the court also decides to reconsider Massachusetts v. EPA, the foundation for the endangerment finding, “God help us,” says Parenteau, “because there are not five votes to uphold [the ruling].”

And in the meantime, if EPA rolls back other rules based on the endangerment finding—like the Biden administration’s efforts to curb tailpipe emissions and encourage the transition to electric vehicles—the administration is likely to face even more lawsuits, Parenteau says: “Litigation, litigation, litigation, all the time, everywhere, all at once.”

It could also backfire.

As Parenteau wrote in the Conversation in March, throwing out the endangerment finding might not be all good news for Big Oil.

Across the country, Parenteau explains, cities and states have sued fossil fuel companies in dozens of lawsuits over damage caused by climate change. In response, the companies have argued that the federal Clean Air Act supersedes the state lawsuits. But if Trump’s repeal of the endangerment finding succeeds, Parenteau says, and greenhouse gas emissions aren’t regulated under the Act, that could “undercut” the companies’ arguments.

“You’ve got to be careful what you ask for in law,” he says, “because you never can be sure what the unintended consequences are going to be.”

Win or lose, Trump has signaled no intention to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

When I asked Milkey how a challenge to the endangerment finding might play out in court, he didn’t think Team Trump would have much of a chance, at least on the scientific front. “But the scary part is,” Milkey says, “from their perspective, I don’t think it matters.”

As the legal conflict rolls on, the administration may go years, potentially, without implementing any sort of climate regulation (or enforcing existing ones). “It’s parallel to the Trump administration illegally pulling research grants from universities—the damage is being done,” Milkey says, “regardless of who wins the ultimate legal fight.”

That would set the country back on climate action at a time when we can’t afford to delay. The United States is the second-leading emitter of greenhouse gases, after China, in the world. If we abandon any effort to reduce emissions, Parenteau warns, the world won’t come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement—limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, let alone a less damaging 1.5 degrees. “That’s the cascading effect of this,” Parenteau says, “we cripple the world’s ability to create anything approaching a livable planet.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-25.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:11.463273

The developer of a nuclear power facility may choose to obtain an early site permit (""ESP"") from the NRC.
And he's done just that, upending hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in investments across the country—including many projects in New York State.","As New York Governor Kathy Hochul's commitment to renewable energy has been challenged both by Washington and by her own Administration's evolving priorities, she has embarked on a new strategy to elevate the profile of nuclear energy in the state. While a nuclear strategy will not solve New York's immediate need for new sources of energy, particularly in New York City and Long Island—or even close the long-term capacity gap—the Governor's nuclear announcement last month begins a serious discussion about the future role of this historically controversial, emission-free source of power.

At a June 23, 2025 press event at the Niagara Power Project, flanked by government officials, labor and industry representatives, Governor Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (""NYPA""), in coordination with the New York State Department of Public Service (""DPS""), to develop and construct ""at least one new nuclear energy facility,"" which will be ""a zero-emission advanced . . . power plant"" with a total capacity of ""no less than one gigawatt"" of electricity by 2040. The directive makes tangible some of the commitments to increasing the role of nuclear power in New York made by Hochul in her January 2025 State of the State Address and by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (""NYSERDA"") in the 2025 Blueprint for Consideration of Advanced Nuclear Energy Technologies released that same month.

New York State has delegated to NYPA major responsibilities for expanding and advancing New York's energy infrastructure in the past, including the 1961 Niagara Power Project and the 1968 James A. Fitzpatrick nuclear plant, among others. While Hochul's announcement follows in this historic vein, the NYPA endeavor will force New York to confront anew questions about developing new nuclear resources, including the siting process and the ways in which NYPA will look to partner with others to realize the state's aspirations.

Further, NYPA's work will be only one leg of New York's nuclear stool, with NYSERDA slated to release a ""Master Plan"" in late 2026 for ""Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development"", and DPS (which serves as staff to the Public Service Commission (""PSC"")) required to consider the future of the state's aging nuclear fleet, which accounts for more than 20% of the state's existing generation capacity.

Because nuclear power cannot satisfy the near-term demand for zero-emission energy in New York, the State must amplify its commitment to deploying wind, solar, and transmission resources, notwithstanding challenging recent changes in federal policy. Nonetheless, the Governor's announcement is a notable milestone in the State's support for nuclear power technologies. In 2021 the State encouraged the shut-down of the last operating reactor at the Indian Point facility in Westchester County, due to safety concerns. At the time, it seemed far-fetched that New York would announce the development of a new nuclear facility just four years later. Whether Hochul's ""no less than"" one-gigawatt plan results in only a single facility, or instead emerges as a vanguard project that catalyzes a future New York nuclear market, will depend on an extraordinary level of complex legal, commercial, and political work in the months and years ahead.

Partnerships, Procurements, and Public-Private Coordination

Governor Hochul's announcement did not specify how NYPA should proceed in development and construction of the new facility, but she did hint at private-sector involvement. NYPA will be called on to lead the initiative, Hochul said, in ""coordination with [DPS] . . . either alone or in partnership with private entities."" Further, she directed NYPA to ""secure the key partnerships needed for the project.""

Clearly, we should expect the involvement of some number of non-NYPA entities, and the nature of their potential involvement (and the manner of their selection) is likely to play out in the coming months—potentially through a competitive solicitation for certain aspects of the project's development, including siting, facility design, and construction.

The State's existing relationship with Constellation Energy Corporation (""Constellation"") may serve as a model. Constellation is the operator and majority owner of all three of New York's currently-operating nuclear power facilities—Nine Mile Point, Ginna, and Fitzpatrick—and the operator of twelve other nuclear plants in the PJM, ERCOT, and MISO balancing areas. In fact, Gov. Hochul's press release reads in part: ""This initiative also builds on the State's ongoing financial support to Constellation to pursue an early site permitting process for a new project at its Nine Mile Point Clean Energy Center[.]"" Constellation not only is the nation's largest producer of clean energy, but also is well-known both to NYPA and to New York State regulators, sports a nearly $100 billion market capitalization, and, as of recently, has experience assembling the funds and expertise to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility.

The ""Specs"" Question: Choosing the Right Technology for NYPA's Project—and Beyond

Hochul's announcement that NYPA will develop an ""advanced nuclear"" facility suggests a technological departure from the state's legacy nuclear fleet. While ""advanced nuclear"" could mean a fusion reactor (a technology which has not yet been commercialized) or a radioisotope system (a technology primarily used in spacecraft), the term in this context almost certainly refers to a next-generation (i.e., Generation III, III+ or IV) fission reactor. (The Nine Mile Point, Fitzpatrick, and Ginna facilities, along with other legacy nuclear facilities across the United States and Canada, are classified as Generation II fission reactors.)

Advanced fission reactors' comparatively simple designs allow them to be built with fewer components and require less frequent maintenance. Notably, they are designed to be safer than legacy nuclear facilities, generally featuring ""passive"" safety systems in which gravity, natural convection, and the use of existing pressure differentials within the reactor serve to shut down and cool the reactor in the event of an accident without human intervention.

Consider the addition of Units 3 and 4 to Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle facility in Burke County, Georgia. For the new units, Georgia Power and its partners selected the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor, a Generation III+ pressurized water reactor (""PWR"") technology with a net power production capacity of 1,117 MW. The new units commenced commercial operation in 2023 and 2024 respectively and are the first utility-scale nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in over 30 years.

Keeping in mind Hochul's specification that the NYPA facility be of ""no less than one gigawatt"" in capacity, the Westinghouse AP1000 PWR may hold the pole position for technology type should NYPA elect to build a single PWR; it's the right size and – with Vogtle – U.S. firms have shown they construct and operate them, an advantage no other advanced reactor model can claim. However, whether the Generation III+ PWR compares favorably to alternative advanced fission technology types, especially on the basis of cost, is a question muddled by the myriad hiccups that led to the Vogtle project's extraordinary cost overruns. By the time construction was completed, total project cost had exceeded the initial budget by $17 billion and drove the reactors' manufacturer, Westinghouse Electric Co., into bankruptcy. The Vogtle experience will provide valuable lessons to any commercial nuclear power developer in the United States in the coming years, including the concept that building multiple units as part of a single project will drive down the cost for each successive unit built and lead to a lower total project cost overall (though this claim is contested with respect to its applicability to the Vogtle saga). But that lesson in particular may militate in favor of selecting for the NYPA project a different technology type entirely: the small modular reactor, or ""SMR.""

Believed by some industry observers to be the future of nuclear power in the United States, SMRs trade facility size (ranging from 60 MW to 300 MW, compared to the 600 MW to 1,500 MW typical of Generation II facilities) for lower upfront capital costs, siting flexibility, and the potential cost- and speed-of-deployment advantages that come with modularity, all of which suggest significantly higher deploy-ability than larger facilities. In theory, SMRs could be deployed on smaller parcels than larger facilities, and due to their relatively lower power output, SMRs could avail themselves of a broader range of physical grid interconnection opportunities.

SMRs may soon be deployable in the United States. At least two firms, Holtec International (""Holtec"") and TerraPower, claim to be able to build SMRs right now. Holtec has units under development on the site of the existing Palisades nuclear facility in Michigan and public ambitions of building 10 GW of SMR capacity in the United States by 2040. And TerraPower, which became the first developer to submit an SMR license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC"") in 2024, recently announced supplier contracts for its ""Natrium"" project in Kemmerer, Wyoming. Additionally, since 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy has partnered with NuScale Power, which became the first developer to receive NRC approval for its SMR design in 2020, and Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems to construct a proof-of-concept SMR facility at the Idaho National Laboratory, with hopes of completing the project by 2030.

Hochul's at-least-one-gigawatt goal could be fulfilled by building a small fleet of co-located SMRs, an approach that could capitalize on the cost advantages of building multiple units as part of a single project. Moreover, enthusiasm at the federal level for SMR development has survived the 2025 presidential administration transition, and that enthusiasm may be more likely to convert into financial support if Washington is pleased with NYPA's technology type selection.

Lessons from Other First-of-a-Kind Energy Projects in the Northeast

Whether NYPA elects to build a multi-SMR facility or a larger, single-unit advanced fission facility, all parties involved – NYPA, NYSERDA, DPS/the PSC, and the Governor – should look to the lessons learned from other first-of-a-kind, proof-of-concept deployments in the Northeast, and ask how the NYPA project can serve as a stepping-stone to the selection and construction of future nuclear power facilities. By using the NYPA project to lay a path for development of other facilities in the future, the State can gain traction not only on its 100%-by-2040 zero-emission electricity system requirement under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (2019) (""CLCPA""), but also on the CLCPA's broader requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85% from 1990 levels by 2050.

Though Hochul's announcement does not include mention of a ""pilot project,"" first-of-a-kind generation projects historically have played a crucial role in proving out technology and related development strategies, driving down costs and setting the stage for future deployment.

The successful development and operation of the Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island in 2016, and the South Fork Wind Farm off the cost of Montauk, New York in 2024, for example, paved pathways for permitting, contracting, procurement, and new technology construction for the offshore wind industry in the United States, encouraging investment and market participation in the United States from the world's offshore wind development giants. Though comparatively smaller (30 MW and 130 MW respectively) and more expensive ($244/MWh and $160/MWh, respectively) than follow-on offshore wind projects, those early smaller projects unlocked a new market and trailblazed a path for the larger and more economical offshore wind projects that followed.

New York itself has recently kicked off a proof-of-concept effort to deploy the state's first long duration energy storage (""LDES"") facilities. In June 2024, NYSERDA and the PSC authorized several LDES demonstration and pilot programs that ""utilize a variety of technologies including iron-air batteries, zinc alkaline batteries, and hydrogen storage"" to ""best position New York to timely develop and deploy LDES assets when the electric power system requires it."" NYSERDA is seeking to award 20% of its upcoming bulk energy storage procurement to LDES resources, and other states and utilities have initiated similar LDES demonstration projects to jumpstart that nascent market.

In short, New York State and the northeast markets more broadly have significant recent experience with supporting early-stage clean energy development projects, and myriad examples of how to ensure that such early-stage support leads to effective leveraging of private sector investment in order to reduce ratepayer costs, spur new economic development, and position the state for significant private investment.

New York's Climate Law and Related Regulations: How Does New Nuclear Fit In?

The CLCPA makes no specific mention of the potential contributions of nuclear power to decarbonizing the state's energy resource mix, and defines the State's 70% renewable-power-by-2030 goal explicitly with reference to ""renewable sources,"" a category in which nuclear power is not included. The CLCPA's 2040 zero-emissions target, on the other hand, does not explicitly disclaim a role for nuclear facilities.

On the other hand, the Climate Action Council's (the ""CAC"") Scoping Plan (2022) (the ""Scoping Plan"")), the State's implementation plan for the CLCPA, does discuss possible avenues for developing nuclear power, contemplating that the advanced nuclear power facilities may be developed in the state in order to achieve the 2040 zero-emissions target – all in furtherance of the CLCPA's 2050 85% emissions-reduction target – and specifically hypothesizing a role for SMRs.

The Scoping Plan is due to be updated in 2028, and revisions would have to squarely contemplate the role of nuclear power in the State's power supply plans and emissions-reductions efforts. At the least, the next iteration of the Scoping Plan would have to describe in detail how DPS should proceed in designing funding sources for new nuclear facilities (whether it be a revised Zero-Emissions Credit, which we discuss below, or some successor mechanism)—if the State determines that it should provide such a funding source at all.

Relatedly, the State Energy Plan (""SEP""), which is now under revision, should signal clearly to the CAC and to the private sector how State authorities are thinking about the issues involved in, and the role of, the development of the NYPA facility. Although the in-progress draft of the SEP is not publicly available, materials made available for the June 25, 2025 State Energy Planning Board Meeting suggest that NYSERDA is considering whether new nuclear power could substitute for new natural gas generating capacity that may be needed by 2040 to satisfy the state's energy needs; whether the State should engage in multi-state collaboration related to new nuclear development; and whether the State should pursue additional deployment opportunities ""in parallel with ongoing initiatives"" like the NYPA project.

NYSERDA officials commented at the June 25 meeting that a draft SEP is likely to be released this summer. Because New York State agencies are required by law to implement the SEP, parties interested in the NYPA nuclear announcement and the potential for further nuclear development should pay careful attention to the final SEP, currently slated to be released in December 2025.

Compensation: New York's ""ZECs""

Related to questions about the CLCPA and the Scoping Plan is the problem of fairly but adequately compensating the new NYPA facility and other ""new"" and ""advanced"" nuclear facilities, all while balancing the Governor's focus on reducing energy costs for New York ratepayers. The State has a legacy mechanism for allocating out-of-market revenue to nuclear power producers: the Zero-Emissions Credit (""ZEC""). Like a Renewable Energy Credit (""REC""), but for nuclear power facilities, a ZEC represents the environmental attributes of one megawatt hour of zero-emission nuclear generation. Under the program, NYSERDA procures ZECs from nuclear facilities and in turn sells them to load-serving entities. Because the ZEC's value consists of a base incentive representing the social cost of carbon that decreases if wholesale electricity prices rise, it provides revenue certainty for the existing nuclear fleet, ensuring those plants can operate over the long term and obtain financing for construction and maintenance.

However, the ZEC was not designed to support new nuclear facilities. Rather, the ZEC was originally incorporated into the State's 2016 Clean Energy Standard, through orders of the PSC, to ensure the continued operation of existing facilities, which have different capital needs and challenges than facilities in the early stages of development. Moreover, the ZEC program as it exists now will sunset in 2029, and the Scoping Plan now in-progress calls for the State to consider whether support beyond that time will be necessary to keep New York's existing nuclear fleet operational.

In order to provide appropriate market signals and time for Constellation to invest the funds needed to keep the existing fleet safe and operating as it continues to age, the State will need to determine well ahead of the ZEC's current sunset date the right mechanism (continuation of the ZEC as designed, or otherwise) that balances its clean energy needs and ratepayer costs. That set of considerations sits on top of quickly changing federal policy in the energy industry, and in the context of an upstate New York energy system that continues to take on new solar and wind capacity.

A number of alternative funding sources may be available to support New York's existing and future nuclear fleets. First, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") made existing nuclear facilities eligible for Section 45U zero-emission nuclear power production credits for electricity sold before January 1, 2033. Though the credit begins to phase out once a reactor's gross receipts exceed $25/MWh, and though the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (""OBBBA"") implemented certain additional foreign entity of concern requirements, Section 45U credits remain otherwise available. New York's fleet has been unable to take full advantage of Section 45U credits, because, inter alia, the credits' value is reduced if a facility receives ZEC payments or comparable payments under a state program. Accordingly, if New York allows its ZEC program to expire, the existing nuclear facilities could potentially offset that loss of revenue by obtaining higher-value Section 45U credits to support their continued operation—or, if the State chooses to support the facilities through a different mechanism, then the tax credit may be able to be maximized.

Second, electricity and capacity prices are expected to rise in the near and medium terms due to data center development and beneficial electrification. Wholesale electricity prices in Northeast markets are rising year-over-year and are expected to continue to do so; meanwhile, capacity prices in supply-constrained, data center-heavy balancing areas like the PJM Interconnection are soaring. While legacy nuclear facilities have sometimes struggled to clear capacity auctions, a number of factors may position the next generation of nuclear facilities to collect capacity revenues more reliably, including growing overall demand for power, increased market penetration by variable renewable resources, retirements of fossil-fired generators (who typically set the clearing price in capacity auctions), and the reduction in available hydro imports from Ontario and Québec, who have long supplied Northeast markets with cheap dispatchable power, as those provinces address their own demand growth.

And lastly, while likely not a solution for ensuring a nuclear project's near-term contribution to the State's clean energy goals, the appetite for private-sector offtake has increased. For example, Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy plant in Illinois signed a twenty-year power purchase agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc., rather than continuing to operate in the region's competitive wholesale electricity markets as Illinois' own ZEC was set to expire; and in Pennsylvania, Talen Energy's Susquehanna Steam Electric Station facility is now contracted to supply nearly two gigawatts of power to Amazon Web Services, Inc.'s data center campus nearby.

Siting New Nuclear in New York and the Role of the NRC

Where the new NYPA facility will be located is an open question. As mentioned above, Hochul has stated that sites under review include Constellation's three existing facility sites. It's also possible that the State will explore the possibility of using federal land such as Fort Drum, located in Jefferson County, to host the facility. Regardless, the siting process and the involvement of pertinent State and federal authorities will present challenges that the State has never faced before. New York State and federal authorities – namely the NRC, which exercises jurisdiction over certain elements of the siting process – have not approved the siting of a new nuclear facility in the State since 1974. This fifty-year hiatus, and the fact that the underlying applicable state law has changed fundamentally during that period, makes it hard to predict how the siting process for NYPA's facility will unfold.

The NRC licensing process proceeds roughly as follows. The developer of a nuclear power facility may choose to obtain an early site permit (""ESP"") from the NRC. ESPs remain valid for 10 to 20 years from the date of issuance (and can be renewed beyond that period), and though ESPs are not required in order to proceed with developing a nuclear facility, they give a developer certainty that they may build on a particular site even before selecting the reactor technology to be used. Notably, in January 2025, Constellation and NYSERDA announced a grant proposal to the Department of Energy (""DOE"") seeking funding to support an ESP application as Constellation explores the possibility of constructing one or more SMRs at the Nine Mile Point facility.

A developer must, however, obtain from the NRC either (i) both a construction permit and operating license (pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 50) or (ii) a single ""combined license"" (pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 52) in order to break ground on a project and operate it. Whichever licensing path the NYPA facility follows, the NRC will review the license application for: site characteristics (including descriptions of surrounding communities and of local seismology, geology, and hydrology); planned responses to hypothetical accidents; plans for plant operations (including the operator's technical qualifications); radiological effluents or discharges from the plant; and other application elements.

However, it is possible that the NRC licensing process will look different by the time that NYPA seeks its own license. In a May 23, 2025 Executive Order, President Trump called on the NRC to ""undertake a review and wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents"" in the interest of streamlining and accelerating the issuance of licenses. It is too soon to say whether the resultant process will in fact be faster or more straightforward, or whether the divisions between federal and state jurisdiction will be made more or less clear—or even whether the new regulations will be finalized before NYPA begins the licensing process.

On the state level, Article 10 of the New York Public Service Law (""PSL"") governs the siting of large or repowered electric generating facilities that are not wind- or solar-powered. However, the text of the statute and the regulations clearly imply that the Article 10 regime was never intended to control, and perhaps cannot accommodate, (i) the siting of a nuclear-powered facility (as compared to, for example, a natural gas-fired facility, which the statute and regulations clearly contemplate) or (ii) a siting process over which jurisdiction is shared with a federal authority. Nevertheless, the process for obtaining a siting certificate under Article 10 calls for much of the same information as the NRC process (as that process stands today). An applicant must submit a pre-application preliminary scoping statement describing, among other things, potential environmental and health impacts of the facility, and the application itself must detail: site characteristics (surrounding communities, maps, geology, seismology, etc.); anticipated emissions and effluents; environmental impacts and safety implications; safety measures and emergency contingency plans; analysis of the facility's compatibility with New York environmental justice laws and regulations; evaluation of possible alternative locations; and other application elements.

If the State intends for NYPA's facility to be sited under the Article 10 regime, it would likely be necessary to pass legislation directing the PSC to develop new regulations for the siting of advanced nuclear facilities, or for the PSC to commence such a process on its own, or issue a declaratory order interpreting the jurisdictional interplay; in any event, the State's siting process would need to be augmented and/or clarified, including by taking into account existing (and likely preemptive) federal requirements.

Nuclear Power and the Trump Administration

For all its irrational hostility to wind and solar technologies, the Trump Administration has signaled that it intends to usher in an American ""Nuclear Renaissance."" Some of the Administration's energy-related policies so far announced – by executive order, through the OBBBA, and via public proclamations by leading officials – have focused on extending the lifetimes of existing nuclear facilities, while others have promised support for quickly deploying new advanced nuclear facilities, with the aim of standing up 300 GW of new capacity by 2050. Under its new Secretary Chris Wright, DOE has re-launched a Biden-era program to award $900 million to promising efforts to commercialize SMRs, and disbursed a $57 million loan to restart the Palisades nuclear facility in Michigan. Additionally, the OBBBA did not modify the IRA's Section 45J credits for electricity produced by new or upgraded advanced nuclear facilities, and as discussed above, largely preserved the Section 45U credits for existing facilities.

Will this Administration's support for nuclear power actually spur the deployment of new capacity? As mentioned previously, President Trump's May 2025 Executive Order indicates at the very least a strong interest in speeding up the development cycle for nuclear facilities, and Secretary Wright's comments that he intends to repurpose the DOE Loan Programs Office (""LPO"") – the office through which the Biden Administration committed over $100 billion in debt capital to the clean energy sector – to accelerate the ""Nuclear Renaissance,"" may bode well for the sector as it moves toward cost-competitiveness. On the other hand, the way in which the NRC's regulations will be reformed and the timing of such reform remains uncertain, and the ability and appetite of Trump's DOE's to efficiently deploy capital for nuclear projects remains to be seen.

With that said, federal monetary support could ease New York's financial burden in supporting a nuclear program. For example, if a solar or wind developer has obtained LPO financing, NYSERDA's most recent Tier 1 REC agreements reduce the REC payments that NYSERDA would otherwise owe to that developer. Similar arrangements for advanced nuclear – including the new NYPA facility – could reduce taxpayer and/or ratepayer exposure.

In Conclusion

These are turbulent times for energy policy in America. Amidst the rocket-ship launch of renewable energy over the last half-decade, Trump returned to office bent on hammering that industry. And he's done just that, upending hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in investments across the country—including many projects in New York State. Governor Hochul's announcement that a new nuclear facility will be built arrives in this moment of turmoil. The process of realizing the NYPA project will raise a number of questions of first impression for New York regulators and policymakers—particularly if the State treats the process as a proof-of-concept endeavor for future nuclear deployments. In the meantime, while the Governor should press ahead, she must resist the temptation to use the new nuclear strategy to abandon the State's leadership position on renewable energy, especially in the electricity-hungry downstate region. New York's economy demands a vigorous commitment to both, regardless of the headwinds out of Washington.

SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced a funding bill for Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, as well as for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). Durbin and Duckworth worked to secure various priorities for Illinois in the appropriations bills, both through Congressionally Directed Spending requests and through the programmatic appropriations process.

“It is the responsibility of Congress to fund our government programs and agencies through the appropriations process. Rather than rely on continuing resolutions, I hope that we can prioritize a true bipartisan process to pass these funding bills through the Senate in a timely process,” said Durbin. “While the Trump Administration continues to drain resources from critical programs, I will fight for the funding and support for the programs Illinoisans rely on.”

“Our state and our nation are stronger when we invest in our communities and families—and that’s what these bipartisan funding bills do,” Duckworth said. “Appropriating federal funding is the primary role of Congress, and it’s critical this responsibility remains in the legislative branch. I’m proud I was able to help secure critical support for projects throughout Illinois that help modernize our state’s infrastructure, clean up our water, improve accessibility and more.”

And its stopped dolling out federally approved funds to states across the country, with many suing the administration for said funds.
That's frankly absurd, and so when I see that the feds allocated $7 billion for EV infrastructure and only managed to build a whopping 384 chargers, I get why that number is so artificially low.
Now, obviously, the federal government didn't spend $7.5 billion dollars on 384 chargers.
No, they spent $1.5 billion, and the Trump administration wants to take back the extra $6 billion in unspent funds, per Reuters.","I'm neither right nor left, but firmly for the average person. And for us, the vast majority of this country, the government hasn't worked for us in decades. Instead, politicians have wrapped themselves and their decisions in heaps of bureaucracy, miles of red tape, and all the insider trading they can get away with. And they can get away with a lot.

It's why, despite the federal government taking more and more of our paychecks over the last 30 years, our roads are still trash, our schools are falling apart with teachers funding their own supplies, our national parks and forests go unmaintained and prone to fire, and why everything in our lives feels a little worse with each passing year.

They've got the money to fix all this, but they've made it absolutely impossible to do so in any real way, just so they go after one another in the press and fundraise off our anger that ""the other side"" won't let them get things done. It's horseshit.

And the biggest case study of this is the Inflation Reduction Act which, on the face of it, should've been great for cities across America. But because Washington is Washington, and the laws they pass are designed to basically drag a project on forever, it utterly failed, as evidenced by the fact that the feds allocated over $7 billion for public EV chargers, but only managed to build 400 stations.

That's not just ludicrous, it's criminal. And it lies on the head of both sides of the aisle.

Now, according to Reuters reporting, ""U.S. states have built less than 400 electric vehicle charging ports through April under $7.5 billion federal infrastructure programs, the Government Accountability Office said Tuesday. As of April 2025, 384 charging ports are operating at 68 stations in 16 states, GAO said, saying a joint office overseeing the program 'has not defined performance goals with measurable targets and time frames for its activities.'""

Part of the issue is that the current Trump administration is hell-bent on rolling back the clock, and reality, and doing its best to stop all electric vehicles for some unknown reason (cough, cough oil and gas industries). And its stopped dolling out federally approved funds to states across the country, with many suing the administration for said funds.

But there's a bureaucratic aspect of the issue, too, and that, the Democrats are absolutely implicated in as well. And that is, that over the years, both parties have added so many layers to the permitting process, so many federally-mandated requirements to access those funds, so many asinine handshakes that have to occur before you can ever even think of before breaking grounds and doing the damned thing. Hence the video above with Ezra Klein and Jon Stewart talking about this issue.

Ezra—no relation—lays out how to even start a project under the Inflation Reduction Act that Biden passed in his second year as President, it would take state agencies a minimum of three years just to get to the point of potentially accessing those funds due to the bureaucratic red tape that surrounds any sort of federal project. Three freakin' years. Not for the project to be done. Not for it to start. But for it to just get to the point of maybe starting.

That's frankly absurd, and so when I see that the feds allocated $7 billion for EV infrastructure and only managed to build a whopping 384 chargers, I get why that number is so artificially low. Because it's an absolute pain in the ass to get any of these funds.

Now, obviously, the federal government didn't spend $7.5 billion dollars on 384 chargers. No, they spent $1.5 billion, and the Trump administration wants to take back the extra $6 billion in unspent funds, per Reuters. How you spend that much money on so few chargers is beyond me, but if DOGE was looking for actual forms of bureaucratic waste, that feels like one if you ask me.

That's all to say that I'm for expanding electrical infrastructure, and that the federal government should be working to help the regular person. But the way it goes about anything feels antithetical to that mission. At least in how these politicians have set everything up. Which may be the point?

The findings undercut not only Dominion’s public messaging around the gas plant, but also its legal argument that the plant should be exempt from Virginia law because of a threat to system reliability.

Telos Energy evaluated Dominion’s application to build the 944-megawatt Chesterfield gas plant—a proposal that would cost ratepayers more than $8 billion including fuel costs over its lifetime and continue to pollute a community that has borne the brunt of toxic coal emissions for decades.

Because Dominion has failed to generate required energy efficiency savings, Virginia law prohibits construction of new carbon-emitting facilities unless there is a demonstrated “threat to system reliability.” Dominion has repeatedly argued that such a threat exists and has even presented analyses claiming there could be power shortages. Telos Energy’s analysis shows, however, that the “threat” identified in Company’s analyses is completely preventable and is, in fact, the product of illogical assumptions.

Flawed assumptions in Dominion’s analysis include:

Out-of-state exports: Dominion would let its Virginia customers lose power rather than suspend power exports to Duke Energy customers in North Carolina.

Inaccurate generator assumptions: Dominion’s power generators would perform significantly worse during future severe weather events than they have in the recent past, despite significant recent investments in upgrades.

Failure to use all available resources: Dominion would not use fully charged batteries and all deployable gas resources to keep the lights on for customers in severe weather.

By replicating both studies and re-running them with corrected assumptions, Telos Energy demonstrated thatDominion can reliably meet customers’ needs—even in severe weather—without building a new polluting gas plant. Ultimately, the testimony recommends denying the application to build the Chesterfield gas plant on the basis that Dominion has failed to support its proposal with a rigorous analysis that meets the statutory requirements.

“We look forward to presenting our case,” said Grayson Holmes, a senior attorney in SELC’s Charlottsville office. “The Company’s analysis assumes that it would keep significant resources offline or producing below their capabilities, choosing instead to build a new, expensive gas resource.”

“Reliability analyses should be used to ensure a reliable system—not to manufacture

emergencies or misrepresent operations,” said Melissa Thomas, senior organizer for Mother’s Out Front. “Rushed and baseless utility planning won’t result in a good outcome for Dominion’s customers, or the Commonwealth, and will fall the hardest on communities that have borne the brunt of polluting plants for decades. Thoughtful planning and thorough oversight will benefit Virginians.”

“When you look under the hood of Dominion’s reliability claims, the data simply do not reflect the situation the company has been repeating in the press,” said Peter Anderson, Energy Policy Director for Appalachian Voices. “No one is denying that there is some load growth, and we will need new resources. But there is no justification for backtracking on clean energy progress and saddling communities with new polluting plants.”

Here's How It May Affect Energy in the US,Associated Press,,,,,https://news.wttw.com/2025/07/25/trump-s-ai-plan-calls-massive-data-centers-here-s-how-it-may-affect-energy-us,"The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs.
What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,“ she added. ”But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-25 20:04:00.515193

The “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act” rolls back clean energy tax credits that middle- and low-income families, as well as businesses, have used in WNC to boost energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades.

Among the terminated tax incentives is the residential clean energy credit, which helped homeowners offset the cost of solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters, and other renewable energy home modifications.

Among other repeals, the OBBBA is rolling back:

Rooftop solar credits, ending December 31, 2025

Home energy efficiency credits, ending December 31, 2025

Commercial efficiency deductions, ending June 30, 2026

New energy-efficient home credits, ending June 30, 2026

Across the Appalachian solar industry, some are worried about energy resilience in the face of disasters and ever-increasing utility bills - and that fewer tax benefits might put clean energy out of reach for all but the richest.

Solar meant disaster resilience during Helene

Immediately after Helene hammered Western North Carolina, most of the region was under a complete electrical blackout. Sundance Power Systems, a small solar company, responded by partnering with other organizations to bring light to impacted households in the form of microgrids.

“We loaded solar panels and batteries up in the back of our '97 Chevy, and we went around and started providing power to people that didn't have it,” Dave Hollister, CEO of Sundance Power Systems, said. “That continued for months, and it's still continuing.”

They’re planning to install solar panels at the Fairview Volunteer Fire Department this month.

Elsewhere in the mountains, areas where distributed and residential solar had pre-existed the storm seemed to fare well, leading many to wonder whether they had a potential to prepare the region for the next storm.

The residential clean energy credit offsets up to 30% of the upfront cost of installing energy upgrades like rooftop solar panels The residential energy efficiency credit did the same for home improvements like heat pumps and better-sealed windows, and home energy efficiency audits.

Both allowed homeowners to get more quickly to the point where they were saving money on utility bills rather than spending. In 2023, after the Biden administration passed increased tax credits into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, solar adoption jumped nationwide; North Carolina IRS data shows over 62,490 households used the energy efficiency credit, while 26,470 households used the clean energy credit. And they helped the industry, too.

“Tax credits were part of the business model here in North Carolina,” Hollister said. “And you know it's been an important part of giving folks the ability to choose renewable energy as their preferred energy source.” Without it, he fears renewable energy will be left to the rich, and business will go down in more rural communities like the many he works with.

The tax credit often disproportionately benefitted wealthy families, for whom the tax write-off made a bigger difference simply because their taxes were bigger to begin with. Nonetheless, additional provisions in the IRA, like the “direct pay” tax credit system, allowed nonprofits and governments to take on costs of clean energy installation at the community level, where they had previously been dominated by for-profit companies. Direct Pay has not been rolled back by the Trump administration as yet. Some entities, like Mountain BizWorks, a nonprofit lender in Western North Carolina, can still take advantage of that to fund new clean energy projects.

Mountain BizWorks, a local nonprofit lender that helps small businesses clear financial hurdles, said that businesses in Western North Carolina historically lack access to the kind of capital that can make renewable energy investments pay off quickly.

“It definitely adds a bit of urgency, and would encourage folks to, if they've been thinking about pursuing some of those projects, to act now,” said Eric Burton, who works for BizWorks as the nonprofit’s director of energy and climate lending. Commercial tax credits extend through 2027 rather than 2025, but it’s still a tight timeline.

Impacts will also vary state-to-state and region to region, depending on state law.

Trouble on the horizon for residents’ utility bills

Bonnie Angermeier, a senior legislative associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said this was an outcome she’d feared since the election. “We know that in the wake of Hurricane Helene having energy sources that, you know, were not impacted was such a critical component for survival for so many folks,” she said.

Larger, utility-scale clean energy projects will have until 2027 before their own tax credit winds down.

Angermeier is worried that the overall impact will actually be to increase energy burden on rural customers who are already paying more than the average American. ven It could even impact people who don’t have solar energy at home and are just connected to the grid, thanks to lower average incomes, older housing stock, and what some advocates say is lack of investment in energy efficiency.

“Of the companies that we've talked to throughout Appalachia, many of them, their average customer makes between $50-$60,000,” she said. “So these are not really wealthy families. These are low-to-middle income hard-working families that are able to take advantage of residential solar to bring down their bill.”

The White House has said the repeals are a part of responding to the country’s increasing energy needs.

“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses,” said White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers in an email.

How to take advantage of energy efficiency incentives while you still can

The clean energy tax credit covers up to 30% of costs for installing new clean energy infrastructure in your home, and the energy efficiency credit coversup to 30% of costs for home improvements like energy-efficient HVAC systems, heat pumps and home energy audits.

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit.","Editor's note: President Donald Trump signed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) into law on July 4, 2025. A major component of the bill was the elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which will now expire on Sept. 30, 2025. The information in this story is still valid for those who purchased an electric car at any point in 2025 up until the end of September. After that, there will be no more tax credits on any new or used electric vehicle regardless of where it was made. Another relevant aspect of the OBBBA for car shoppers is the addition of the car loan interest tax deduction, which would allow a person to write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans. However, there are several requirements that need to be met, and economists have noted that only 1% of car shoppers would be able to take advantage of the full benefit.

Federal EV tax credits in 2025 top out at $7,500 if you're buying a new car and $4,000 if you're buying a used car, while the bank or the automaker's finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly. Edmunds takes a quick look at the key rules for each scenario — buying new, buying used and leasing — and shares a list of cars that qualify for an EV tax credit.

If you're buying a new EV or PHEV (plug-in hybrid), the ""final assembly"" of the vehicle must have occurred in North America to unlock any tax credits. If it passes that test, now you're looking at two $3,750 electric car tax credits that add up to $7,500 if you meet all the criteria. To get the first $3,750 credit, a certain percentage of the car's critical battery minerals must have been sourced from the U.S. or from any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.

The other $3,750 credit requires that a certain percentage of battery components be manufactured or assembled in the same roster of countries. There are also significant eligibility caps on both the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the vehicle — $55,000 for cars; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks and vans — and the income of the buyer, which is subject to limits between $150,000 and $300,000, depending on tax filing status. If either figure is too high, you won't qualify for any federal EV tax credits.

If you're buying a used EV or PHEV, you don't have to worry about where the car was assembled or where its battery bits came from. The income caps are significantly lower, however, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, while the car itself must be at least two years old and cost no more than $25,000. You also have to buy it from a dealer, not a private party. Check all the boxes, and you can get a tax credit of up to $4,000, though there's a sliding scale for cheaper used EVs, which will be explained below.

What about leasing a new EV or PHEV? There's a legislative loophole that lets the originator of the lease (typically the automaker's finance division) take the full $7,500 tax credit for a leased EV, irrespective of the final assembly, battery sourcing and vehicle pricing requirements. It's up to each automaker to decide whether to pass these savings along in the form of more affordable leases, but keep in mind that you might get a hefty discount on a leased EV thanks to this loophole. That's true even if your income would disqualify you from getting the tax credit on a purchased EV — since you're not the one getting the tax credit in this case, your income is irrelevant.

Which new vehicles qualify for the federal EV tax credit?

The following vehicles should qualify for the federal EV tax credit because they are assembled in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery component requirements.

It's also worth noting that the vehicle must be purchased for ""original use"" to qualify for the federal tax credit, meaning that it is for the taxpayer's use. You cannot buy the vehicle and then immediately resell it in hopes of getting the tax credit.

This list is based on data from the U.S. Department of Energy, last updated on May 19, 2025. It affects new cars placed in service from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, 2025.

Qualifying new cars for the 2025 EV tax credit

Edmunds

How to qualify for the used EV tax credit

The tax credit for used EVs will be calculated based on either 30% of the vehicle's value or $4,000, whichever is less. As we mentioned earlier, there are no assembly requirements or battery component percentages for used EVs and PHEVs. The rules for used EVs went into effect on Jan. 1, 2023, and are as follows:

Price limit for used vehicles: There is a hard eligibility ceiling at a sale price of $25,000 for all used EVs regardless of type.

Income limits for used vehicles: As with new vehicles, the income limits are determined by modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). By filing status, the limits are as follows.

Edmunds

Other eligibility requirements for used EVs

The vehicle must be at least two model years older than the calendar year in which it was purchased.

The used EV tax credit applies only once in the vehicle's lifetime. Subsequent owners are not eligible.

Once a buyer has taken the federal used EV credit, the buyer is not eligible for another credit for three years.

The vehicle must be for personal use and ""not for resale.""

The vehicle must be purchased through a dealer.

Only an individual may claim the used EV tax credit. Businesses are excluded.

Electric vehicle tax credit for leasing

Leased electric cars or plug-in hybrids from dealerships are considered ""commercial vehicles"" under IRS regulations. This means that the full $7,500 tax credit goes to the company that leased it to you, which is usually the automaker's captive finance arm. In other words, the automaker itself effectively gets the benefit of the tax credit. Moreover, leased EVs and PHEVs are not subject to the major restrictions detailed above — there are no limitations regarding final assembly, battery sourcing or vehicle pricing, while the caps on buyer income are irrelevant because there is no purchase in the case of a lease.

There's also no obligation on the automaker's part to pass along any savings to you, but in practice, many automakers seem to be offering at least some kind of discount on EV leases as a direct result of this loophole. It probably won't last forever, so if you're interested in leasing vehicles not on the list here, check with your local dealership to see if there are loophole-driven lease discounts.

How to qualify for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit

Several requirements will determine if an electric car qualifies for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit. The maximum buyer credit for new vehicles is $7,500, provided that several requirements are met.

Final assembly, parts, and mineral sourcing requirements

The final assembly of the new vehicle must occur in North America (i.e., the U.S., Canada or Mexico). This is the gateway requirement for the federal EV tax credit — if the answer is no, the EV won't qualify unless you're leasing. This rule went into effect on Aug. 16, 2022, and affects vehicles purchased through 2032.

If the vehicle meets the assembly requirement, you can think of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as being split into two halves — critical battery minerals and battery components — each worth $3,750 and subject to requirements of its own. The percentages will be discussed here, but don't worry about remembering this. The EPA has already calculated the percentages below to determine which cars are eligible and are reflected in this list, so you won't have to figure it out yourself.

Critical battery minerals: To qualify for this $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the critical minerals in the vehicle's battery must have been either recycled in the U.S. or extracted or processed there (or in any country that has a free trade agreement with the U.S.).

Battery components: To qualify for the remaining $3,750 credit, at least 60% of the EV's battery components must be manufactured or assembled in the U.S. (or in any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.)

New vehicle pricing limits for EV tax credits

The following price caps by vehicle type became effective as of Jan. 1, 2023, and refer specifically to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). It does not include the manufacturer's destination charge, optional items added by the dealer, or taxes and fees. For example, if you're looking at an SUV with a $79,990 MSRP, and the destination fee takes it over $80,000, the vehicle is still eligible. If, for example, the vehicle is priced above the MSRP limit (let's say $82,000), but there's a manufacturer incentive that brings it back down to $80,000, the vehicle would also not be eligible.

Edmunds

New car buyer income limits for EV tax credits

The income limits are based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), which is roughly the adjusted gross income with certain allowable deductions added back in for the current or prior tax year. Depending on your tax filing status, the limits for a new vehicle are:

Edmunds

What's changed for 2025?

As of Jan. 1, 2025, a vehicle is ineligible for a tax credit if any of the battery's components and critical battery materials were sourced from a ""foreign entity of concern,"" which includes China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. That's a big deal given China's outsized role in the minerals supply chain to date. The critical battery minerals requirement went up to 60% from 50% last year.

Additionally, the credits will no longer be in effect after Sept. 30, 2025.

How do I claim the EV tax credit?

If you purchased an eligible vehicle in 2025, you have two options to claim the tax credit:

You can claim the credit on your tax return for the year in which it was purchased, using Form 8936. If your tax liability is less than $7,500, the IRS said it will not seek repayment, but just keep in mind you won't get to keep the difference either, as it is a nonrefundable credit.

You can transfer the EV tax credit to an eligible dealership so that they can apply the credit amount to your final purchase cost. The dealership must be registered with IRS Energy Credits Online. They should submit and give you a copy of the ""time of sale report"" to confirm that the report was accepted. This document will be needed when filing your tax return. If you lease the vehicle, the credit goes to the lessor and may be used to reduce the price of the lease if the leasing party chooses to do so. If you choose to go this route, please note that you still need to fill out IRS Form 8936, which reports your eligibility for the credit and your decision to transfer the credit to the dealer.

It is important to verify that you meet the income requirements listed above; otherwise, you may need to repay the IRS if your modified adjusted gross income is higher than the authorized limits.

FAQs

How does the EV charger tax credit work?

If you are installing an EV charger at your home, the federal credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $1,000, whichever is smaller. For those wanting to install an EV charger at a business or investment property, the credit is generally 30% of the charger's cost or $30,000, whichever is smaller. You can claim the EV charger tax credit the following year on your income taxes using IRS Form 8911. Some states may have additional incentives for installing an EV charger, so it's worth looking into this list maintained by the DOE. Your local utility company might also have incentives for installing an EV charger.

How much can you write off for an electric car?

Technically, a write-off is a tax deduction, whereas the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 is just that — a tax credit. The difference is that a $7,500 write-off reduces your taxable income by that amount before the tax is calculated, whereas a $7,500 credit means you pay $7,500 less in tax than you would have otherwise. In case that didn't clear things up, just remember that for a given dollar amount, a tax credit means a lot more money in your pocket than a write-off.

The maximum federal tax credit of $7,500 on an eligible electric vehicle is effectively a $7,500 handout to you, which is far more than what you'd gain if you simply subtracted $7,500 from your taxable income. It's worth looking into this list of state EV incentives maintained by the DOE so that you can maximize the benefits of buying an EV. You also have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as an immediate discount on the car.

How does the federal tax credit for EVs work?

To qualify for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit, the EV you purchase has to be brand new and assembled in North America. Beyond that, increasingly stringent geographical requirements are being phased in regarding the composition and production of the car's battery pack alongside the vehicle pricing and personal income requirements.

You have the option to transfer your federal EV tax credit to a qualified selling dealer and receive the amount of the credit as a discount on the car, as opposed to having to wait for tax season. You can also choose to have the credit applied to your taxes using IRS Form 8936, which you submit as part of your annual taxes to the federal government.

Are there tax credits from states or other sources?

Yes. While the federal tax credits for plug-in and natural gas vehicles get the most mention, there also are dozens of state and regional incentives on plug-in vehicles and those that use alternative fuels. Many states have a dozen or more programs. Many, however, apply only to businesses. Some credits come in the form of exemptions from fees and inspections. Others are nonmonetary incentives such as carpool lane access and free parking.

Retail buyers in a number of states can get some cost relief in the form of tax credits, rebates, reduced vehicle taxes, or registration fees for buying a qualified alternative-fuel or electric-drive vehicle. Edmunds keeps a detailed list of state, local, federal and manufacturer incentives all in one place. The U.S. Department of Energy has an interactive chart of state incentives. It's a good idea to be sure about available state and local incentives before you shop. Just because a state has a program now doesn't mean it will continue indefinitely.

How about hydrogen fuel cell cars?

On paper, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles should qualify for incentives and are explicitly mentioned in the Inflation Reduction Act. However, at the time of this writing, no hydrogen-powered vehicles qualify for a tax credit for a vehicle purchase, likely due to not being built in North America. A workaround would be to lease the vehicle, in which case the automaker can — but is not obligated to — use the tax credit as a discount toward the lease. This can be a way to save some money on vehicles like the Toyota Mirai or Hyundai Nexo. Take a look at the U.S. Department of Energy's website to see the latest hydrogen laws and incentives.

Is there a tax credit for buying a Tesla in 2025?

Yes. As of the beginning of 2023, Tesla customers are once again eligible for the new tax credit of up to $7,500.

A major component of the bill was the elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit, which will now expire on Sept. 30, 2025. The information in this story is still valid for those who purchased an electric car at any point in 2025 up until the end of September. After that, there will be no more tax credits on any new or used electric vehicle regardless of where it was made. Another relevant aspect of the OBBBA for car shoppers is the addition of the car loan interest tax deduction, which would allow a person to write off up to $10,000 a year in interest paid on qualifying auto loans. However, there are several requirements that need to be met, and economists have noted that only 1% of car shoppers would be able to take advantage of the full benefit.

Federal EV tax credits in 2025 top out at $7,500 if you're buying a new car and $4,000 if you're buying a used car, while the bank or the automaker's finance company can take a $7,500 tax credit for EV leases but may discount your lease accordingly. Edmunds takes a quick look at the key rules for each scenario — buying new, buying used and leasing — and shares a list of cars that qualify for an EV tax credit.

If you're buying a new EV or PHEV (plug-in hybrid), the ""final assembly"" of the vehicle must have occurred in North America to unlock any tax credits. If it passes that test, now you're looking at two $3,750 electric car tax credits that add up to $7,500 if you meet all the criteria. To get the first $3,750 credit, a certain percentage of the car's critical battery minerals must have been sourced from the U.S. or from any country that has a free-trade agreement with the U.S.

The other $3,750 credit requires that a certain percentage of battery components be manufactured or assembled in the same roster of countries. There are also significant eligibility caps on both the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the vehicle — $55,000 for cars; $80,000 for SUVs, trucks and vans — and the income of the buyer, which is subject to limits between $150,000 and $300,000, depending on tax filing status. If either figure is too high, you won't qualify for any federal EV tax credits.

If you're buying a used EV or PHEV, you don't have to worry about where the car was assembled or where its battery bits came from. The income caps are significantly lower, however, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000, while the car itself must be at least two years old and cost no more than $25,000. You also have to buy it from a dealer, not a private party. Check all the boxes, and you can get a tax credit of up to $4,000, though there's a sliding scale for cheaper used EVs, which will be explained below.

What about leasing a new EV or PHEV? There's a legislative loophole that lets the originator of the lease (typically the automaker's finance division) take the full $7,500 tax credit for a leased EV, irrespective of the final assembly, battery sourcing and vehicle pricing requirements. It's up to each automaker to decide whether to pass these savings along in the form of more affordable leases, but keep in mind that you might get a hefty discount on a leased EV thanks to this loophole. That's true even if your income would disqualify you from getting the tax credit on a purchased EV — since you're not the one getting the tax credit in this case, your income is irrelevant.

Which new vehicles qualify for the federal EV tax credit?

The following vehicles should qualify for the federal EV tax credit because they are assembled in North America and meet the critical minerals and battery component requirements.

It's also worth noting that the vehicle must be purchased for ""original use"" to qualify for the federal tax credit, meaning that it is for the taxpayer's use. You cannot buy the vehicle and then immediately resell it in hopes of getting the tax credit.

This list is based on data from the U.S. Department of Energy, last updated on May 19, 2025. It affects new cars placed in service from Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, 2025.

South Africa continues to face a critical energy challenge, with more than 80% of its electricity currently generated from coal-fired power plants. Persistent power shortages and environmental concerns highlight the urgent need for clean, reliable alternatives. With over 2,800 kilometers of coastline, the country has substantial untapped wave energy potential that could help diversify its energy mix.

“Eco Wave Power is excited to explore South Africa’s wave energy potential in partnership with AGFDL,” said Inna Braverman, Founder and CEO of Eco Wave Power. “This feasibility study represents a meaningful step toward addressing energy access and sustainability in Africa, while advancing our global mission to commercialize wave energy technology.”

The Port of Ngqura, located in the Eastern Cape Province and operated by Transnet National Ports Authority, is one of South Africa’s most strategic deep-water ports and is adjacent to Coega Special Economic Zone, the largest SEZ in Southern Africa. Its robust breakwater infrastructure and direct ocean exposure make it technically suitable for wave energy implementation.

“This collaboration represents an important opportunity to support Africa’s clean energy transition,” said Wilfred Emmanuel-Gottlieb, CEO of AGFDL. “Wave energy has the potential to play a key role in delivering sustainable, reliable power to underserved communities and industries.”

“This project is about delivering practical, long-term impact,” added Alphonsus Ukah, Co-Founder and Chairman of AGFDL. “We believe this technology could become a critical part of Africa’s renewable energy future, and we are pleased to begin this journey with Eco Wave Power.”

It is also finalizing its first U.S. power station in the Port of Los Angeles, scheduled for launch in September 2025, with co-investment from Shell Marine Renewable Energy (MRE).

In addition, Eco Wave Power is advancing its first MW-scale project in Portugal, and pilot projects in Taiwan (in collaboration with local I-Ke), and India (in partnership with Fortune 500 company Bharat Petroleum).

A single mother, she bought a home in the Ohio River Valley “because it was pristine, it was clean air, clean water. And just the country quiet life.”

Beech trees, tulip poplars, and sugar maple surround the village, as do reservoirs, grassy hills, and meadows. Bass swim through creeks, hikers scale the sandstone rocks, and history lovers visit the train depot, built shortly after James Barnes founded the village in the early 1800s. Barnesville’s motto is “Where History Meets Progress,” a summary of its juxtapositions.

After buying her patch of land, Hunkler lived in an Airstream trailer at first, and then started building a small home out of recycled materials, with the help of family and friends. With her was her daughter, three dogs who served as her “protectors,” and the occasional visit from nieces and nephews eager to get a taste of the country life. They had no internet, and cell service was spotty.

She filled out the land with a “three sisters” garden of beans, squash, and corn, and another section with tomatoes and a strawberry patch that reminded her of her great-grandmother’s garden. She was glad to be home.

And then the oil companies came.

Beneath the Ohio River Valley’s earth lie rich deposits of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas that energy companies are eager to extract and sell for massive profits. Within just ten or so years of moving onto her homestead, Hunkler said, oil companies had started constructing well pads, which form the base for fracking operations, all around her town. Suddenly, she said, there were 78 well pads within a few miles of her home, a compressor station a mile away, and a pipeline just a few hundred yards from her door.

These pads are slabs of concrete built to mount the drills that force sand, water, and a soup of chemicals down into the shale, forcing it to crack apart and release its gas and oil. The pads, jarring patches of industrial gray gouged out of the landscape, also hold cars, tankers, wastewater reservoirs, and piles of unused equipment.

Hunkler says her initial wariness about the wells popping up in her region quickly developed into full-blown opposition when she learned that they could cause earthquakes and release volatile organic compounds into the air, which are heavier than air and settle into the lowest areas—like her hollow.

She began educating herself on the environmental and health risks of fracking and passed that information to her community. She formalized her work with the foundation of Ohio Valley Allies, and built power with another local group who know firsthand the dangers of fracking: truckers. As she continued organizing, Hunkler reconnected with her former high school classmates, many of whom worked hauling all kinds of fracking waste products, including drilling muds, settled solids, pipe scale, and hydrocarbon-bearing soil. Though she hadn’t seen them for 20 or 30 years, they began contacting her when they saw her work. The alliance between environmentalists and truckers might surprise some, but workers who want to protect themselves and the environment say it makes perfect sense to build power together.

“The trucking and the fracking industry are looking to continue to destroy Mother Earth as much as the coal industry and the hardrock mining industry,” said Billy Randel, a retired trucker and the head of Truckers Movement for Justice. “And you know what the funny thing is, the truck drivers can stop all this. We’re the key. We’re the 75 percent and our brothers and sisters on the rails are the other 25 percent. All we gotta do is educate our drivers.”

ON JUNE 4, OHIO VALLEY ALLIES WAS ONE of the signatories of a letter to the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration that asked the government to enforce its hazardous material regulations. If the government enforces these laws, advocates say, it will help protect the truckers who transport the dangerous by-products of fracking: sludge, brine water, and silica-rich sand.

According to Earthjustice, which wrote the letter on behalf of Ohio Valley Allies and Truckers Movement for Justice, oil and gas companies consistently fail to correctly label hazardous material loads. Truckers agree, saying they typically receive no training for moving toxic waste, though trucking companies are eager to blame them if anything goes wrong. The effect is deadly and the examples are numerous, dating back decades.

Eleven years ago in Lawrence Township, Ohio, for example, a truck carrying so-called brine—the toxic wastewater pumped at high pressure into the earth beneath well pads—crashed over a guardrail, slammed into a home, and began leaking beneath it. The driver was found on the ground spitting up blood, Earthjustice writes. Little has changed since then. Just this May in Tioga County, Pennsylvania, another tanker truck carrying fracking wastewater spilled 2,000 gallons into a nearby stream, echoing a similar story three years earlier, in which the driver died. And in 2016, right by Hunkler’s homestead, another brine truck crashed, spilling waste over a field and into the Barnesville reservoir, which supplies the community’s drinking water. Environmental Protection Agency tests of the reservoir after the crash found elevated levels of radium, a radioactive metal.

Studies show that fracking waste typically contains high levels of salts, heavy metals, and even radioactive material, as evidenced by the thousand-plus pages of exhibits Randel shared with the Prospect. They include multiple articles, studies, research, and testimony dating back decades, illustrating how the toxicity of the waste is hurting both workers and the environment.

Randel, a retired trucker, hauled toxic waste for years and told the Prospect that the letter environmentalists and truck drivers signed together is “the salvo fired,” in what will likely be “a long, hard war.” But the combined power of organized labor and environmental activists will win in the end, he said.

As it is now, virtually no workers receive any notice about the danger of the waste they’re hauling, let alone training to handle it safely, Randel and other truckers said. When a worker cites a study or raises concerns, bosses tell them not to worry about it. Tom McKnight, a retired oil field trucker in Ohio, said bosses never mentioned the danger of hauling such material, and if a worker brought it up, “they were like, ‘pshaw, you’ll get more radiation out of the phones you’re looking at all the time,’” he said. “It was totally downplayed.” It was easy to go along with the charade for a while, he said, because Eastern Ohio had been depressed since the late 1970s and the jobs oil companies were offering paid well.

“We’re happy, but here we are hauling radiated water around, radiated chips, not to mention the icky by-products that are even worse than that,” said McKnight, who joined the industry as a trucker hauling brine in 2013. “We were never placarded, we had no radiation detector on our uniform … the conversation on the radiation was nonexistent.”

McKnight might have kept on believing the industry’s lies until he read a Rolling Stone investigation in 2020 about the toxic waste the oil and gas industry produces. “I might not have even realized that until I saw the picture and saw, holy shit, I was in that place for a year.” By then, he was suffering from cancer, though he can’t say with certainty it’s because of what he was exposed to as a trucker. Now 63, McKnight also suffers from pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, and recently got a new diagnosis from a surgeon, who said he recognized mesothelioma in a biopsy of his lungs.

“I’m pretty sure I know what’ll kill me now. It’s just a matter of when,” McKnight said, speaking with the Prospect from his porch in the Ohio River Valley while his little Jack Russell terrier Coco ran around in the yard. His other dog, a big mixed-breed named Charlie, stayed closer to home. The sky was perfectly clear. McKnight worked until July 31, 2019, but the body can only take so much, so he applied for and received Social Security disability benefits. “I was expecting life to end up different,” he said, then added that it was still a beautiful day to be alive.

Oil field trucker Marco Mery spoke to the Prospect while he was on the job en route to Kermit, Texas, and then on to Mexico to celebrate his wife’s birthday. After ten years of working in oil fields, Mery, 54, said the reason for hauling the oil industry’s toxic waste is that the pay can be up to 35 percent higher than other jobs. But that’s hardly enough given the danger, which companies don’t help drivers mitigate with training or protective gear. Companies don’t even provide masks for toxic airborne material, like the silica he was hauling that day.

“The thing is, most of the well-paying jobs is work in the oil field,” he said. “And if it is not that good working in the oil field, well, the other jobs are worse.”

IN MOST INDUSTRIES, THESE RADIUM- AND SILICA-RICH products would be considered hazardous waste, but the oil and gas industries enjoy an exemption that classifies them as hazardous materials instead: a lower grade of danger with fewer regulations around their transportation.

The exemption, a major win for oil and gas companies, comes from the 1980 Bentsen and Bevill Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Some states have passed legislation that tightens up regulations within their borders, but Ohio tends toward the opposite direction, trying to further deregulate the industry.

“Ohio is not trying to do anything to make it better,” said Silverio Caggiano, a retired fire battalion chief and hazardous materials specialist who worked at the Youngstown Fire Department in Ohio for 39 years. “They just seem to want to play to whatever the industry wants.”

Indeed, truckers and environmental activists say fracking and trucking companies aren’t even living up to the exemption’s modest rules surrounding hazardous materials transfer. According to Megan Hunter, senior attorney at Earthjustice, anyone hauling hazardous materials needs extensive training and a number of extra precautions, such as carrying Safety Data Sheets within arm’s reach, properly labeling their trucks, and driving on roads that bypass small towns instead of cutting through them.

In their letter to the government, Earthjustice merely asks “that PHMSA uses its enforcement authority to enforce existing laws on the books regarding hazardous materials, as to transport of oil and gas, waste, and other materials in oil fields,” Hunter said. The activists and workers aren’t asking for new regulations (yet); they just want to see current laws upheld.

In Youngstown, Caggiano has seen oil and gas companies blatantly ignoring hazardous materials law for decades, and told the Prospect about the consequences: a worker’s leather boots lighting up a Geiger counter. Workers washing their radium-contaminated clothes in public laundromats. Firefighters wading through unidentified waste after a truck spill. Oil barons dumping wastewater into a city sewer.

Caggiano recalled one example in particular, when a truck carrying unidentified wastewater toppled over in Youngstown around 2016. When he and his team arrived on scene, they asked to see the driver’s Safety Data Sheets, which would give the first responders information about the materials being transported and any precautions to take. But the driver said he had never been given any. “OK, we’re breaking a couple of laws here,” Caggiano said, and called in the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

According to Earthjustice’s letter, many truck drivers have told Truckers Movement for Justice that they “rarely, if ever, receive Safety Data Sheets for their oil and gas waste loads.”

“These guys aren’t getting the right equipment to handle this stuff. These people should be in throwaway hazmat suits, and the industry is not going to do it because they’ll lose money,” Caggiano said. “They’re trying to get the least informed people. They can not inform them and get them to do dangerous work for very little pay. And if they complain about it, they get fired.”

Mery, the truck driver on his way to Texas, said the same. He told the Prospect that asking the bosses for help is pointless, because they’ll fire you, especially if they’re running a third-party provider or a smaller company.

“Most of the time, they tell you you have to be careful,” and little more, Mery said.

This lack of training and knowledge among truckers has disastrous consequences for the whole “eastern sacrifice zone of Ohio,” as Caggiano calls his region. He knows of one trucker who cleaned out his truck at a commercial truck wash, where the runoff is filtered and then reused for other trucks. While those filters can remove dirt particulates, or even volatile organic chemicals if they include carbon filters, they aren’t equipped to clear out the radium in wastewater.

Similarly, Caggiano said, some workers take home their uniforms and clean them in their personal laundry machines, transferring radium into the clothes of their spouses and children. Or they clean them in public laundromats, where the spread of chemicals could be even more extreme.

“It’s a Pandora’s box of bad shit that’s in these trucks,” he said.

LEGALLY, THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MEET SAFETY REGULATIONS lies with the shipper, who needs to class their loads and make sure that drivers are equipped to handle that class of materials. Earthjustice alleges that shippers are failing to class loads at all, leading to a host of subsequent violations: lack of appropriate protective gear, no placarding, trucks driving on the wrong routes and without the right insurance.

“Shipper” can mean many things, Earthjustice’s Hunter explained. It can refer to the oil and gas company, the producer, the entity creating the waste at the wellhead, processing facilities, or any other corporation involved in the process.

“There’s no permit, for example, that PHMSA issues, or some process that PHMSA goes through before shippers start shipping this stuff. So that’s why our ask is really just for enforcement,” Hunter said. The government “has the authority to check and see if violations are happening and to hit them with penalties if they are and to stop the violation. And that helps our self-enforcing laws work a little better.”

Earthjustice has no illusions about the “drill, baby, drill” Trump administration’s attitude toward regulating the fracking industry. But, Hunter said, she’s “hopeful” that Trump’s pro–industrial worker rhetoric could prompt action from the government.

“This is an administration that has suggested that it cares about energy workers, and if that is true, then certainly it should care about these drivers,” she said.

“I would like to see that they cared about us. I mean, we’re the people who move the industry,” Mery said. “It’s not just the oil field, everything that comes in trains and airplanes is then moved by trucks. I would like the government to treat us with respect.”

Earthjustice has already had a conversation with officials at PHMSA, who said the letter is a priority to them. Time will tell whether the government acts to enforce their own hazardous material regulations; as of now, they haven’t made any public statements about the letter.

But environmental activists and truckers know that the problem runs much deeper than Safety Data Sheets and truck placarding. Hunkler of Ohio Valley Allies told the Prospect that after industry came, she started getting headaches, rashes, insomnia, a metallic taste in her mouth, and unexplained body aches. On days that she left the valley, the symptoms would subside within an hour. But whenever she was home, they came back.

After four years of this, she decided to sell her home. “My peaceful, tranquil hollow was poisoned,” she said. She’s lived in a few other homes in the area since, but fracking always seemed to follow. As of 2021, there were 64,788 active wells in Ohio, according to the state, and they’ve become hard to outrun.

“If I had a magic wand, all the coal mines, all the fracking wells, all the chemical facilities, they’d all disappear,” Hunkler said. “They’re all gone. And it’s pristine again. But that’s not based in reality.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23275/download/Janssen-Wimbish-Truckers%20fracking%20072525.jpg?cb=02b7b9c5756b1a1e13eb5dcdd04b38b8&w=1024,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:16.649252

I own a Fisker Ocean with a very large battery and very good range: 360 miles under ideal circumstances.
Those are humbling numbers – and they clearly recommend that EV owners should think of themselves as hypermilers, unless they want to make numerous stops on longer trips.
To be honest, I've never fully understood why so many drivers want to blast along the open road at 80 mph anyway.
So think big picture if you own an EV, quit blaming the AC for hurting your range, and stop putting the pedal to the metal.","Will electric-vehicle owners ever be satisfied with the range they can get on a single charge? I doubt it. The new standard expectation seems to be 300-plus miles, which means a big, expensive battery and relatively long charging times. If you talk to people who have bought an EV, they'll often lament that they have to keep the thing above a 20 percent state of charge, that they only top 80 percent when taking a long trip to preserve the battery, and that hot and cold weather always knock off massive amounts of range.

Whinging is definitely part of the EV ownership experience, but as Forbes points out (citing analysis from an outfit called Geotab), the biggest range killer isn't temperature – it's driver behavior. While it's true that winter's chill and summer's swelter degrade overall battery capacity, what really undermines range is leadfooting your electric car. If you're consistently feeling the need for speed in an EV, you're setting yourself up for a lifetime of range anxiety.

In my experience, there's something of a knowledge gap between EV owners and those who buy gas-powered cars. I don't mean enthusiasts, of course: they can quote chapter and verse on combustion. I'm talking about the normies, people who buy a car for basic transportation and might not even know how many cylinders they have under the hood. They don't care about range because there's always a nearby gas station.

EV owners, on the other hand, often obsess over the intricate engineering of their cars, so it's actually sort of surprising that when they fail to contend with the basic physics of electron-based propulsion versus petroleum. As Forbes notes, faster driving exposes an EV to additional wind resistance, requiring the powertrain to suck more juice out of the battery to maintain velocity. Aerodynamics can mitigate this, to a degree, but a car is a car, and at some point you fight a losing battle as you pour on the speed.

I own a Fisker Ocean with a very large battery and very good range: 360 miles under ideal circumstances. When I hit the highway for a trip, I generally try to maintain as consistent a speed as possible, keeping it at about 70 mph max. I haven't noticed a huge drop-off in range when it's very hot, as it has been of late in the Northeast, even when cranking the AC. But oh boy have I seen the range plummet when it's extremely cold and when I drive fast. And it doesn't help when automakers tout the 0-60mph times of their EVs, encouraging drivers to punch it from every stoplight, further degrading range.

According to Forbes, the research shows that ""a full-electric sedan can expect a 28% drop in operating range at 86 degrees... when cruising at 80 mph versus 50 mph."" Mustering an example, the publication reported that an EV with ""277 miles of driving range at 50 mph will drop to an average 251 miles at 60 mph, 226 miles at 70 mph and just 200 miles at 80 mph.""

Those are humbling numbers – and they clearly recommend that EV owners should think of themselves as hypermilers, unless they want to make numerous stops on longer trips. To be honest, I've never fully understood why so many drivers want to blast along the open road at 80 mph anyway. Yes, I know, you want to get where you're going, but properly fast cars are for performance driving, not freeway cruising. They want the winding byway, not the boring parkway.

Clean energy dominates fossil projects like it would almost undoubtedly advantage clean energy over fossil.","For a long time in climate politics, the question has been: What path do we need to be on to avert absolute catastrophe? And are we on it — or do we have any chance of being on it? The big win here, in the past couple of years in America, was the Inflation Reduction Act. $370 billion — the largest renewable energy investment ever — to build the infrastructure of decarbonization. To build solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and so much more. Was it as much as climate advocates hoped? No. Was it more than we’ve ever done before? Yeah, by a lot. And now it has been gutted in the “big, beautiful bill.” I don’t want windmills destroying our place. I don’t want these solar things, where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell. So what path are we on now? And what does climate politics need to learn from this loss? Are we just courting catastrophe? Or do we actually still have a shot? To try and help me answer these questions, I wanted to have on two people who were involved not just in the Inflation Reduction Act, not just in the lobbying effort against the “big beautiful bill,” but who are doing really important work on both the modeling and the politics side to try to figure out where the climate movement goes from here. Jesse Jenkins is a professor at Princeton. He leads the ZERO lab on campus. And with his teams, he has been one of the leading climate modelers trying to figure out how much these policies will actually do. Jane Flegal is the executive director of Blue Horizons Foundation, and she was a member of the Biden administration’s climate policy team. As always, my email: ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, welcome to the show. Thanks Good to be back. Thanks for having us. So, Jane, you worked on the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments incentives as part of the Biden administration. So I think the place to begin is: What were the most important parts of that bill from your perspective? So as far as climate is concerned, I think there are two broad buckets of interventions that the Inflation Reduction Act made. One was the tax policy of that bill. There was a technology neutral clean electricity tax credit, both for production and investment in clean energy technologies that was extended basically into perpetuity until, well, for a long time. But what was unique about that was historically, we had had these fits and starts of very short term tax credit incentives for solar and wind that kept expiring and then coming back up for renewal. And we’d have a legislative fight of should they be extended or not. Which is that kind of uncertainty is not an environment in which private capital can make smart decisions about investing in energy technologies. So the IRA, really rationalized the clean energy tax credit scheme by making it technology neutral. So it’s not just solar and wind, it’s any zero emissions technology from solar to wind to geothermal to nuclear could qualify. There was also tax subsidies for purchase of electric vehicles, which accounted for very significant chunk of emissions reductions for advanced manufacturing. So building factories in the United States, states to build the component parts that make up these clean energy technologies. So a series of subsidies essentially for investment and production in clean energy technologies. That was thing one. And thing two was a series of grant programs which are in some ways the charismatic, charismatic megafauna of the bill because it’s like, discrete grants going to discrete projects all across the country, not vague tax interventions that are unleashing it could be an example of this charismatic, charismatic megafauna. There are. There was a grant program called the greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund at EPA that funded really incredible install solar panels on the roof of a school in a disadvantaged community, which is like a great thing to do for lots of reasons. But if you compare the emissions impact of even the sum total of all of those grant projects to what we anticipate the emissions impact of subsidizing solar power for the private sector to deploy at scale, it’s basically it’s not even close. The tax subsidies do way more to bend the curve on emissions reductions. So, Jesse, you did a ton of modeling on the Inflation Reduction Act. So what were the targets we were trying to hit and where were we. In terms of whether we were on pace to hit them prior to the B.B.B.? Yeah, I mean, the basic target we’re trying to hit is to get our greenhouse gas emissions to the point where whatever we’re emitting is being canceled out by some kind of removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or other greenhouse gases. That’s the net zero target. President Biden set that target as 2050 to get to net zero, and then set an interim target of cutting emissions to half of our peak levels by 2030. Our estimates were that from the repeat project, which I run, were that the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure law that passed under the Biden administration and then the set of regulatory policies that they also implemented collectively would have gotten us about half of the way. So it was kind of two steps forward. Now we’re taking a big step back. But we should have been taking four steps forward if we were on track for those kinds of targets. So I want to slow this down. So we were so the Inflation Reduction Act on paper would have gotten us halfway to Joe Biden’s goal, the Inflation Reduction Act and the other set of bills, the kind of full total of policies Biden would have gotten us halfway to Biden’s goal. So then we were actually implementing this. What matters is not the words on the page, but are you actually building solar panels. Are you building wind turbines? How is deployment implementation going. You’ve been tracking this. So for solar it’s been going solar and batteries have been smashing new records each year since the IRA passed. And so that’s going as intended. Wind power is continuing to struggle to get back even to record levels that it reached in circa 2020, when we built about gigawatts a year of wind. That’s enough for, I don’t about 10 million households, I guess, per year. We are only building about six or gigawatts a year now, so like half of that level, we have been making pretty good progress on electric vehicle adoption. And there we have seen a pretty substantial degree of market transformation. When the IRA passed, it was basically just Tesla. That was it. Now we have a pretty competitive broad set of entries, dozens of different vehicles on the market. Some of those have now reached a point where they’re at least profitable on paper. Like GM. That’s a key threshold to get to. And I think just the societal penetration of EVs is at a much higher level. Now we’re probably everybody knows somebody that has an electric vehicle or has seen them driving around. And I think there’s a long term indelible impact of that degree of penetration. So those are going relatively close to on track basically with what we were modeling. I think EVs are a little bit slower than intended, partly because Tesla has become a bit controversial. And it’s not selling as many as they intended. What happened there. Yeah and then wind has been falling behind while solar kind of picks up a bit of that Slack. All right. So that’s where we were prior ish to the election. Yeah Donald Trump wins the election. In great news for climate. He becomes very close with Elon Musk who runs an electric vehicle company. So green shoots there. You get the big beautiful bill. What does that do to that set of programs. What is gone. What is left and what new problems have emerged. So And Jesse, you should jump in here because he’s in the weeds probably more than anyone I know. But the most significant damage in that bill for clean energy was to solar and wind, specifically, where they were the Republicans. The Republicans were quite punitive, actually, really shortened the timeline for solar and wind. Anyone who’s tried to build a large scale piece of energy infrastructure will tell you the work and time to get even to commence construction takes years. I mean, it’s a very long process. So that’s what it means is that tax incentive is no longer sending a long term signal to the market that there will be incentives for them to build. Instead, we have this mad rush. So we’ve just decided to as best we can, wreck the solar and wind industries going forward. I mean, they even tried to go beyond that with the initial Senate draft, adding a new tax on wind and solar. Excise tax a tax on not just ending the Tax Cuts that basically lowered the cost of wind and solar by somewhere between 30 percent and percent. So we’ve just raised taxes percent on wind and solar, our biggest forms of New electricity generation. They actually proposed an excise tax on top of that to further penalize wind and solar beyond 2027. That bit was at least removed at the last minute, but you can see there was a very strong and concerted effort from a kind of ideological contingent of the Republican Party that ran into a bit of a more pragmatic contingent of the party that was like, hey, wait a minute. We electricity demand is growing rapidly. These technologies are contributing to our supply. They’re keeping energy costs low. They’re driving investment in our districts. We don’t want to cut this off immediately. Over 20 house members, half a dozen senators standing up to defend tax credits implemented in a partisan, Democrat only budget bill, vocally and repeatedly, multiple letters of the president telling them not to do that. And so I do think there are factions at play here. And unfortunately the ideological contingent won out there. What is Jane. The ideological contingent. I know you were involved in the mobilization around defeating the added tax on wind and solar. What was even the argument for taxing wind and solar specifically. Yeah We will cut taxes on corporations, but specifically fossil fuel subsidies. But specifically, if you want to build wind turbines or lay down solar panels, you face a new tax. The people arguing for that, how did they even how did they try to justify it. O.K let me I think one thing that I have learned throughout this process is that climate politics is inseparable from all of our other politics. So going back to the election, I think part of what happened here was we passed the IRA on a purely Democratic. It was a Democrat only bill. So we live in a world now that you’re quite familiar with where when that happens you there is a tendency to turn up the polarization on whatever is in whatever is in the demo. Bill, right on with the other side of the aisle. So I do think this bill was framed as Biden’s signature climate achievement. It’s not in some way surprising that the Republicans wanted to tear it down. Just wind and solar became culture war, political culture war issues. I think to some degree electric vehicles as well, which also have their tax credits. The tax cuts for EVs and September 30 of this year as well, which is even shorter than the initial proposal. So as the debate went on, that got shorter and shorter. So the tax credits for wind, solar, and EVs are gone. It’s gone. What’s left. Lots of stuff actually. President Trump, who has a lot of authority in that party, called for full repeal of the Green New Scam. That is not what happened. So I just I do think that’s an important thing, because I’ve devoted my entire life to climate. That would have been an unthinkable outcome to me even four years ago, if you had told me Dems pass a Dem only climate bill. Trump tells everyone to repeal the full thing and a significant chunk survives. So we mentioned that they tried to rationalize the clean energy tax incentive program by allowing. Any zero emissions technology to qualify. Basically, any technology that can claim that it is 0 emissions still can get this production or investment tax credit for clean energy. And through the long term, through the end of 20, commencing construction through the end of 2033, they can get the full credit. And then it steps down over a couple more years. So basically Republicans just endorsed a decade long tax credit for carbon free electricity, just not wind and solar. Just because I think this will be confusing to people. Oh, you can’t get it if wind and solar cannot get it. Not everything, but wind and solar. Any nuclear plant, any advanced geothermal plant. If fission or fusion works, that will qualify. So I’ve generally found this to be a puzzling part of Republican energy policy, which is I can almost understand as a matter of culture war, we are for fossil fuel energy and against renewables, clean energy. But there seems to be a particular loathing of wind and solar, but at the same time somewhat of an embrace, at least an openness to nuclear, which I kind of get because a lot of environmentalists don’t like it. So maybe the Republicans do like it. But then more technology forward, less mature technologies, advanced geothermal, green hydrogen, et cetera fusion, those have maintained a kind of neutrality in the political war here. Is that basically accurate. I think that’s basically true. And I think the reasons for it. So the culture war stuff is one. I think it is worth noting that part of the reason there was a larger target on solar and wind is because they are mature. They are pretty mature technologies that are being widely deployed because it makes economic sense. So those tax credits look expensive. As a matter of fiscal scoring. Whereas tax credits for more innovative technologies tend to not look expensive because no one thinks they’re going to get built in the next 10 years. Well, also then to steel man, the Republican position here it goes something. There’s a version of it that goes something like this. Wind and solar are more mature technologies. They are, by virtually any measure, now competitive with other forms of energy. EVs are fairly mature technology. If we wanted cheaper electric vehicles, we don’t need a tax credit. We could just open our borders to Chinese electric vehicles. Republicans are certainly keen on doing, which they don’t want to do. But the argument is basically we do not need to subsidize these technologies. Why is that wrong or is that wrong. I think it is wrong and Jesse can jump into. But I there are having abundant electrons that we can use to fuel economic growth and meet rising demand for energy in the United States, which is happening for the first time in decades, is a public good. We subsidize all kinds of energy development because we know that a robust and large and abundant energy system is good for economic growth. It underpins the entire economy. And it’s good for our national security. So there even if you didn’t care about climate change, given that solar in particular solar and batteries are the most rapid way and in many cases, the most cost effective way to meet growing demand, there’s absolutely a public argument for subsidizing this stuff, even if it’s relatively mature. In the same way, we subsidize all kinds of things that are relatively mature because they’re good for society. Then, of course, an argument is most Republicans will not deny that climate change is a problem. I mean, some do, but many Republicans now will acknowledge climate change is a problem. They’ll just argue for a different kind of solution set than Democrats. If you believe climate change is a problem, then you’re subsidizing not just the public good of abundant energy that’s affordable, but also the climate benefit. What is the solution set. I try to be fair to Republicans on this show, but I have not heard many Republicans arguing for something that would qualify me as a solution set for climate change. So when you say that, what are you thinking. I mean, I think insufficiently ambitious for sure. But the IIJA, the bipartisan infrastructure law actually contained a fair amount of investments in clean energy technologies that Republicans supported. So clean hydrogen hubs, direct air capture spending, spending on storage, a fair amount of carbon capture a fair amount of technology investment on the more kind of innovation oriented view, where it gets much harder is on anything that is very seriously about deploying mature, clean energy technologies at scale or regulatory mandates that would achieve that aim and/or restrict fossil fuels. Yeah I mean, I think there’s a challenge here, which is that what we see from the Republican Party is they tend to support the technologies that are less mature. And you can argue that that’s a rational technology policy strategy. There’s a case to be supporting innovative technologies as they mature and come down in cost. And I’ve supported that case for years. But there’s also I worry that the reason they’re doing that is because they’re not a direct threat to incumbent energy industries. So what is driving down consumption of gasoline is the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. What is driving down the consumption of natural gas in the United States is the growth of wind and solar in the power sector. And so when they become large competitive threats, then you have different factions within the Republican Party standing up to defend the oil and gas industry, channeling the advice from donors and politically connected folks in those industries to try to attack their competitors. You have an ideological culture war element of this that well, if liberals like these technologies, we have to hate them. And in this case, unfortunately, I think Donald Trump is much more strongly aligned with the culture war piece of it and probably a lot more susceptible to input from the fossil fuel aligned donors and members, and that won out over the more pragmatic bloc. So one thing that was part of the whole political theory of the Inflation Reduction Act was we were going to pull in all this investment in factories and clean energy, and that was both going to generate economic activity, but was going to generate jobs. And it did seem some of that investment was coming forward. So what did we achieve on that. And then what do we think will happen to those factories. People were planning to those people who were getting hired. Yeah, it’s a great question. I mean, there has been more than $100 billion worth of investment in clean energy related supply chains and factories in the Uc as a result of the IRA. Much of that has already started to get built, and the EV investment has been huge, with the US out investing, China and all other countries in 2024. Like this was working on the supply chain underscoring. Yeah in the global competitiveness context we were mounting a competitive defense. And now that’s being undermined by these policies like the 45X tax credit. The tax credit for manufacturing it was sustained was sustained. Which tells you something about it’s broadly popular. That’s true. But to Jessie’s point, the demand pull for the thing, the widgets we are manufacturing got totally taken away. The demand pull being the subsidies for subsidies for EVs. So like actually Rhodium Group found that US demand for EVs by 2030, when most of the manufacturing is online, will be less than half of what it was before this Republican bill because of the termination of the EV tax credits and the rollback of the clean vehicle regulations. If demand totally craters for the products these factories are now being incentivized to produce, we don’t need them anymore. It’s entirely plausible that we have now. And I do think part of the reason for fivex the manufacturing tax credits stuck around was because people saw it as very discreetly tied to a tax credit, and they wanted to save that tax credit for those factories. But industrial strategy is not just about the supply side. It’s about the other stuff. This is a place where what happened in the last couple of months just feels so strange to me. So Elon Musk becomes so close to Trump that he seems like the co-president in the early weeks and months of the administration, when liberal protesters want to target the right wing coalition’s great vulnerability. They begin protesting outside Tesla distributors. Donald Trump does like a Tesla infomercial on the lawn of the White House. They still keep all of the policy wrecking the EV credits. And now, of course, whether it’s because of that or not, I’m skeptical. That’s why Musk broke with Trump. But now, obviously, Musk is on the outs and saying he’ll start an America party. But they almost seem like this moment where if there could have been one good thing out of the Elon Musk Donald Trump alliance, it would have been Trump’s softening a bit on electric vehicles. Musk selling electric vehicles to Republicans. But instead, it’s like the Republican antipathy to electric vehicles was much stronger than the Trump Musk alliance. And that’s the thing that held. It also was true that Elon was not, that Musk was not advocating for retaining the EV. Yes that’s why I don’t believe that’s what shattered their relationship. Musk seemed perfectly willing to light Tesla on fire. Whatever else you want to say about Elon Musk’s politics, Tesla was America’s most capable national champion in electric vehicles. It was a world leading, world beating company, the only globally competitive company. But now it has destroyed its reputation among the people who buy its cars here and in Europe. So when you think about what’s going to happen to the most capable American manufacturer of electric vehicles versus the Chinese think these manufacturers, it’s like it doesn’t have support from Trump. It has lost support among liberals here and again in Europe. And it’s getting crushed by competition in China. I mean, it’s getting crushed in China. And the Chinese cars are good. Yeah Yeah they’re right. They’re so good. We can’t let them in here because we’re terrified that it would just take over our market functionally, instantly. If we let them in here, they would be the cheapest electric cars on the market. That’s right. Yeah, by a good margin. And so we’ve just ended this whole Elon Musk Donald Trump saga with the American a much weaker position. Yeah, I mean, one of the central industries we were trying to compete with China in. Exactly I mean, I like for all the talk about how tough Trump is on China, Biden had left our EV system in a much stronger position, and Trump and Musk collaborated to destroy it. Absolutely I mean, beyond how depressing the big step backwards is on the climate side. And this is the other I think, big lasting legacy of this bill. I mean, there’s all kinds of other anti-china provisions that they threw into all the other tax credits we haven’t talked about. Now have to basically demonstrate that there’s no Chinese content in your supply chain to get any of the remaining tax credits that persisted. But you can’t compete globally by just throwing up walls to Chinese influence or Chinese competition. You have to actually have a domestic competitiveness strategy. And there isn’t one right now. We’ve talked about the ways in which this bill gutted when solar electric vehicles. What did the bill do and what have been other Trump administration moves to actually accelerate the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure to try to help coal, right. Is there anything on the other side of that ledger. There’s a real wackadoodle coal thing in the GOP bill. GOP law, which is there is now a production tax credit for metallurgical coal, which is really nonsensical on just about every front. Not least because if you’re concerned about China and/or the domestic steel industry. Metallurgical coal is by and large exported, much of which is exported to China. You want to see what metallurgical coal is. It’s coal that’s used mostly for industrial processes, for power generation, largely steel production. So we are now subsidizing American metallurgical coal to be shipped to China. So they can make cheap and dirty steel, which they dump on global markets. That undercuts American steel producers. I mean, this is by no means the worst thing in this one big, terrible bill. But it is still it is just a glaring example of how backwards the policy is and how much of a corporate giveaway it is in the last 48 hours. It’s a tiny subsidy. It’s 2.5 percent and it’s only in place for a few years. So it is absolutely not going to affect any investment decisions to expand US metallurgical coal production. It’s just a straight giveaway to whoever owns those coal mines. And so we’re subsidizing coal production while raising taxes on clean energy production. It’s hard to swallow that for sure. You said earlier that the IRA and the other, the associated legislation, got us to percent of the interim net zero target. Just beautiful language here. What does the model say now. So our estimates that are under the current Biden era policies, we’re on track to get to about 40 to 43 percent below peak emissions levels. Now we’re probably going to be on the order of 20 percent to 24 percent below by 2030, and maybe closing in on 28 percent by 2035. So cut about half. So cut about half of the progress that we’ve made. That’s actually helpful. And can I actually say one thing here without repeating talking points that sometimes climate deniers and delayers use, it is absolutely important that the US reduces its emissions very rapidly. It’s a moral imperative. It’s important for demonstrating to the world that a developed economy can decarbonize without major sacrifice. That is important, that leadership is important, and the US is going to be like 13 percent of emissions. All of the emissions are going to come from non OECD economies that are developing. So one way to think about the US’s role in addressing climate is to actually take a step back and think, it’s not just about us decreasing decreasing our emissions as rapidly as possible. That is an important piece of it. But the investments in the innovative technologies that are going to represent 40 percent of the global emissions reductions, we now have a policy framework in the US for those more innovative technologies where we have an opportunity to actually lead in innovating, building and deploying those things. And importantly, diffusing them internationally. So like I get a little I get a little about the modeling anyway. I mean, I love Jesse and it’s important, but sure you do. I get a little. It’s also a model over here. Yeah like O.K. Enough but but I do think but I do think and I’ve been thinking a lot about in debates about Democratic politics and strategy, there’s been a lot of conversation about impulses of the coalition toward maximalism. And climate has this thing where it has been framed as a physical, scientific problem, where there are hard limits. If we do not fully solve the problem and get to net zero emissions or get there by some deadline, get there by some deadline, or in the next 10 years, if we don’t keep to 1 and 1/2 degrees, the planet’s going to fall off a cliff. That is a scientifically incorrect. It is true that there are uncertainties in the climate system, but every degree of warming every fraction of a degree of warming that we don’t, that we don’t cause matters. It matters a lot for the risks of climate change. And so I get a little I kind think that there’s a way in which we framed this such that it encourages that kind of impulse among the Democratic Party to say it’s all or nothing. Progress is not worth considering because we have to solve this problem completely in the next five years or the planet is doomed. That is just not true. And that also contributes, I think, to a mindset that we’ve just suffered this big political loss. It’s a truly substantive step backwards. Some people interpret that, well, now we’re done. Like we’ve lost. It’s over like there’s nothing we can do. We’re going to run out of time. And that’s not how it works. Well, let me try to get at how I understood the targets, because you’re of course right that every degree matters. There is no on/off switch for climate risk. But the way that this has been talked about almost universally within the climate movement, what I understood, Biden’s net zero targets to me, and what I understood all of your modeling to mean, is that the scientific community, however you want to define that, has looked at all of its models, looked at all of its research, and described zones that are of really frightening levels of climate risk. No, that’s actually not what the science says. And it’s a huge so great to talk about this because if that’s a communication failure, it sounds to me a little bit like I can’t tell the difference here between every degree matters. And we have been scaring you all unscientifically for decades in order to get you to move faster. But now that we’re moving slower, don’t worry too much. We were just to be clear, I wasn’t scaring people with that kind of rhetoric. So the science is very clear. Get there as fast as possible. We’re already seeing dangerous climate change around us today. So the idea that there’s some safe zone and some dangerous zone and there’s a threshold between the two is just not scientifically true. And the IPCC has never said that there’s no consensus in the scientific documents that frame it that way. What they’ve said is that every degree involves increasing risk. And that’s true. And so we have a sense of urgency. We want to make as much progress as possible, as rapidly as possible. But that’s what the science says. And as possible. Part That’s what politics and technology and society have to determine. And there’s No science that says what that is, right. That’s all US trying to hash this out and muddle through as best we can. Well, there is social science. Well, I see this is the war of. Well, give me the social science perspective, Jane. Well, I mean, I think the way that I’ve been thinking about this lately, because all of what Jesse said is right. And one of the reasons that I remain very anxious about climate risk is because there is a lot of uncertainty in the climate system. There are things we don’t yet understand the world. While it is true that our emissions trajectories seem to be improving relative to what they thought we would be, and I can say more about that in a minute. How the climate will respond to those emissions and importantly, what the potential for positive, which are actually negative feedback loops in the climate system might be, or tipping points, which is another set of concerns. There is a lot of uncertainty about those things. And it’s scary. And we don’t know. But the point is that we don’t know where they are, where they are. So I’ve been thinking about it as a race between feedback loops, kind of. It’s like a race. It’s a race of like the negative feedback, the positive but bad feedback loops in the climate system and the feedback loops that we’ve been trying to cultivate politically, where you’re driving down the cost of technologies, deploying more technologies, building political will. And that’s the problem. I think that’s it in a nutshell. When you said a minute ago, I want to make sure we don’t forget this, that we are seeing somewhat better outcomes than we might have feared Yes At the levels of warming that we’re currently experiencing. Just expand. What does that mean. I most people haven’t heard that. Yeah what I actually mean is not that the impacts are better than we thought, it’s that our emissions themselves are not as high as we predicted them to be. That’s largely because we’ve seen such rapid cost declines in these technologies and wide scale deployment of these technologies. The world is decarbonizing faster than we thought that it would but the climate is not responding in the ways that we predicted that it would. When you say the climate’s not responding, you’re referring to the fact that things have been extraordinarily hot. Yeah things are warming much more rapidly. And this is where you got to get Zeke on the show. But there’s lots of his father, who’s an excellent climate modeler. So we’re trying to figure out what’s causing that more that more rapid warming climate response. But the thing that we can definitely control is bending the bending the emissions trajectory down, which we’ve been more successful at than we thought we would be. All right. So there’s another then dimension of how the world is changing. That seems important here. So Jesse and I used to talk a lot about the basic theory of decarbonization was we’re going to electrify everything we can possibly electrify. That’s going to mean we need a lot more electricity. We’re going to hopefully generate that electricity using clean sources, and then we’re going to lay down a bunch of transmission lines to get that electricity where it’s going to need to go. When people modeled how much electricity we would need they were thinking about the trends as they existed in 2015 and 2018 and 2020, but now AI has become this absolutely massive consumer of electricity. So how has that changed the amount of electricity we are projecting that we will need in the next 5, 10 years. So our latest estimate is when we account for the reduced electrification due to the end of these tax cuts for heat pumps and for EVs and other things due to the Republican tax bill and the addition of data centers and AI to our forecasts, we’re expecting electricity demand to grow at a sustained rate of about 2 percent per year over the next decade. That’s enough to increase it by about 25 percent through 2035 from current levels. That’s a lot of additional electricity. So that’s more than our entire nuclear fleet, additional generation know that’s all demand growth, of which AI is probably about a quarter of that. And so it’s big it’s an added trend. And it’s increasing the power sector when it comes to decarbonization, which is twofold. It’s to both meet all of that demand growth with clean electricity sources, so we don’t dig a deeper hole while simultaneously reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for power generation. We’re still going to do that, but not as much as we thought. In fact, our estimates are that we’re going to lose about a nuclear fleet’s worth of clean generation. That would have been added. If we’d sustained tax cuts for wind and solar through 2035. That goes away. However, we’re still going to see wind and solar meet most of that demand growth, probably all of it on net. It’s just that we’re not going to eat as deeply into our existing coal fleet. So in a nutshell, be more expensive than it would have been if we had retained the credits in the IRA, where we were basically taxing our cheapest and most widely deployed energy supply. The one other thing about the demand, though, that’s worth noting, that’s different about the broader economy wide in electrification demand is the I demand is going to happen fast like that. That is like that’s like near-term demand consumption of a city scale in one spot, as opposed to EVs, which are diffused over wide areas. It’s a particular challenge for the grid, particularly the transmission and distribution. Grids need to be people who are big nerds on energy. Not as big as you, but big who tell me that they are worried now about the grid being able to hold up, that they’re worried in the next 5, 10 years about outages, about blackouts, about different kinds of grid failures, because we’re adding so much of such a different kind of electricity demand. Like, how do you think about that interaction between the grid we have and the energy we’re about to need. And I think that’s certainly a risk. I mean, we’re going to see demand growing rapidly. If we can’t grow supply rapidly enough, then the risk is twofold. One, energy prices are going to go up because supply is not keeping pace with demand, and the risk of outages goes up because we might have the normal demands met. But if things go out of sample, we get an extreme heat wave or an extreme cold event or something like that happens. We have far less Slack in the system to absorb that if we haven’t added enough new supply. What we’ve basically what the Republicans have basically done is ensure that we’re going to deploy less new electricity, that the new electricity we deploy is more expensive. And that because of that, we rely more on existing coal and gas plants that weren’t otherwise used. So we’re going to be paying more for new clean electricity and paying more to use dirty old power plants and raising the risk that we’re not able to keep up with demand growth. All because we can’t we’ve raised taxes on the most important sources of New electricity. You gestured at this a minute ago, but we’ve been talking a lot about the effect of all this on decarbonization. What about the effect on the energy bills people pay. Yeah I mean, this is really quite brutal. I don’t know if I have the numbers on the top of my head, but there have been a bunch of analyses that electricity, large electricity buyers and others have done. Independent analysts of the impact on electricity rates associated with repeal of the IRA. And they are significant and they vary across the country. But in some cases I think it’s on the order of like 15 percent on average, a 15 percent increase in retail bills. But of course, that can be 2 percent in some states and 30 percent in other states. Some of the states quite substantial 30. I mean, it’s really quite bad. And we’re in a moment, as where affordability and cost of living is quite top of mind for those in the present, but also for everybody. The other thing that’s going to happen, though, is we’re because we’re deploying less electric vehicles, we’re going to consume more gasoline and nationally and diesel, and that’s going to drive up prices at the pump too. The estimates are that could be on the order of a 5 percent increase in gasoline prices. So another way to think about it is that Republicans just voted for a 5 percent gas tax rate by slowing the deployment of EVs, right. And so none of this stuff makes good economic sense, even if you don’t care about climate, especially if you care about the affordability challenge. And so I do think it’s going to exacerbate something Jane and I have talked about a lot the next wave of energy politics, I think, is going to be centered around affordability and the rising stress of meeting energy bills. Our estimates are from the repeat project, that energy bills will go up by about $280 per household per year in 2035, again with a lot of variation across households. That’s like a 13 percent increase in how much we pay for energy, both utility bills and gasoline and heating. How do you think, Jane, about the politics of affordability here on the Democratic or climate concerned side. Because there’s always been a tension. On the one hand, you want to care about affordability. You want energy to be affordable for people who need it. And on the other, if you are trying to phase out a bunch of fossil fuel infrastructure, that’s not just a relentless race to the cheapest energy possible. You are making energy on the margin more expensive by trying to phase all this out and move us on to renewables. Yeah I mean, the politics of those things are bad and brutal, and we should be very honest with ourselves about this. I mean, one of the lessons going into the IRA, and I think coming out of it is that there is a mythology that there are a silent block of climate voters that represent the majority of the American public who are willing to sacrifice in the name of climate. And while I may wish that to be true, it is obviously not true. We have run the experiment many times now. I think, Ezra, if you look at for solar, wind and batteries, my view is that the most important thing we can do going forward, if we take affordability seriously and we take climate seriously, is remove all of the non-market barriers to deploying this stuff as rapidly as possible everywhere. And that’s going to be tough for the environmental. What are those non-market barriers. There are very significant challenges around to planning and transmission planning and siting. We just don’t really do it well. We don’t really do it anywhere. There are huge issues with permitting that you will be not unfamiliar with, both at the federal level and frankly, a of state and local. Yeah, a ton of state and local. I mean, you have renewable energy projects, fighting at County commissions everywhere across the US and often losing. And you have localities and counties just banning the building of clean energy projects. So here is a frustration I had with the Biden administration. I would talk to people in it. You were in it. We didn’t have this conversation that much, but I had it with your colleagues and they knew all these problems. The only permitting reform they ever backed was this half hearted backing of Joe Manchin’s sidecar deals. That was not their ideal permitting reform, and was, of course, somewhat poisoned in the eyes of progressives because it was what Joe Manchin wanted and it would clear out way for this pipeline. And so on. But they never and frankly, Democrats in Congress really didn’t propose. This is what we think the ideal permitting system to accelerate clean energy deployment would look like. What would it look like. Like what. What if you were writing that bill Jane, what would you write in it. Well, I think one thing to say is that, again, Texas is quite a good example of where this has gone, has gone reasonably, reasonably well. So just looking at Texas, if we’re to take a couple of lessons here. One thing is that Texas, unlike many other markets in the United States, has done very proactive transmission planning. So they had these what was it, the Krebs clean, renewable energy renewable energy zones. And they did it, by the way, under George W Bush and Perry. So like so that’s that we should be doing that at across the country, which is basically saying like we know where the renewable potential is. We don’t need to wait for a developer to come and say, hey, I’d like to connect to the grid, just build the big highway out there and let people connect on ramps. And that’s what they did. And it worked very well. So basically they created the transmission infrastructure before they built the energy. Exactly Yeah. There’s also, I think, easier interconnection processes, which is getting more attention. Now there are more than 1000gw of clean energy projects. I mean, maybe they’re not all real, but they’re waiting to be connected and cannot get connected. And I think we haven’t even really done the work to fully diagnose the problem. But a part of it is just automating the application process. O.K, let’s slow this down. Every energy wonk talks about this endlessly. I don’t think it makes any sense when a normal person hears it. When we are talking about the problems in these interconnection queues, what are we talking about. We’re saying basically, if you want to connect to the power grid, because the physics of the power grid is complicated and it’s all connected, and we don’t want the grid to ever fail, they have to basically run a study to make sure that under any conditions that you’re connected to the grid, you’re not going to cause a problem, you’re not going to cause something to blow out and some cascading failure. And right now, those studies are meticulously done by individual, highly skilled power engineers who were in short supply. And they can take years more than the average times more than three years, which is just insane. Could ChatGPT do ChatGPT. Could not. But a chat agent could run all the simulations, and then a smart single power engineer could assess them at the end of the day, right. Like, we can make these limited skilled positions superpowered with AI. And in fact, that’s exactly what’s happening now because this has become such an issue just recently. I do think there’s a lot of politics of why this hasn’t been solved, because basically the incumbents in the industry like having high barriers to entry to New competitors. But as demand has started to grow rapidly as capacity, prices, prices, to bring on new electricity spiked in one of the biggest power markets in the country, and that’s driving now 20 percent rate hikes in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland. It’s become very politically salient. You’ve got Governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania suing the grid operator to be like, hey, do a better job. And you’ve got large data centers being like, hey, we’d like to connect in three months, not in three years. All of a sudden, now that they’ve got this pressure, the grid operator is like, Oh, actually, we could do this in three months, so we could be doing this much faster. We should be. And I don’t, frankly think we should. We should stand for anything longer than a few months to complete that process. So that’s one thing. Also, just like straight up permitting issues, they just have much laxer kind of friendly to industry regulations on permitting new energy projects in Texas. And that helps that certainly helps. They also have and this is like well beyond the bounds of my expertise. But the structure of their particular electricity market tends to be much friendlier to New entrants. And building a new generation, highly competitive and easy to get into the market basically. So like but but but I think what’s frustrating to me, candidly is like we have ample evidence now these are many of these are mature technologies that we both say as the climate movement. These are the cheapest, cheapest and easiest things to build. And then when it comes to getting serious about why it’s not happening, why it’s not happening at the rate it needs to happen, it does raise some difficult questions for our own coalition around balancing conservation objectives and community engagement processes with our decarbonization goals. And for that reason, I think there’s just been a lot of hesitancy around leaning in on this stuff. And if we’re being honest, any deal that happens federally on this stuff is probably going to have to apply not just preferentially to clean energy technologies. It will probably be like a truly all of the above permitting regime. But the thing is, if you look at currently all energy projects in the US that have completed environmental impact statements under Nepa, for instance, over the last decade. Clean energy dominates fossil projects like it would almost undoubtedly advantage clean energy over fossil. Yeah, just in the power sector, 95 percent of the new capacity we’re adding to the grid right now and over the next couple of years is wind, solar, and batteries. 95 percent just making it easier to build period will structurally advantage building clean energy, because that’s most of what we want to build. The climate change is an emergency and we have to solve it in seven years. And you think the primary way to do that is to block all fossil infrastructure. Why would you take that deal. Yeah, this is why I think the misunderstanding of the climate problem and the science of the problem has been really problematic for this kind of agenda. So I want to slow down what you just said there, that you’re saying that the climate movement trained itself on the idea that the thing we have to do is keep the dirty energy in the ground and stop all new fossil infrastructure from being built, because that would dig us our deeper hole and lock in these assets. And so proposals that would create that would make it much, much easier to build energy of all kinds, even though it would disproportionately lead to clean energy being built, runs afoul of that intuition that there was. I always saw this in the fight over the mansion, the various mansion bills. There was much more activation around this one big natural gas pipeline than there was excitement over the much bigger and total emissions impact, changes to transmission line permitting and siting and and authorities. Yeah, but I want to hold here on the Biden administration for a minute. What you just said a minute ago is probably right that any almost certainly if I said it is any big deal would have had to have been in all of the above deal because you would have needed Republican votes just given the structure of Congress. But that’s often true at the end of a process. There could have been a proposal on this is what we would like it to look like. This is what we think progressive or liberal or Democratic permitting reform would look like. And Yes, now we need to get into the negotiations. And there’s going to be horse trading and concessions. How come I never saw that. I think there were very smart people working very much behind the scenes, but I think there was a real fear. I think, frankly, probably a misguided fear, although I understand why people had it, that sticking your neck out on this publicly in any way, as a self-proclaimed climate champion, you would be tormented basically if you did this. And you might lose funding. And if you’re an environmental organization, you might be viewed as an enemy of environmental justice. And that’s brutal. Like that’s a deeply unfun position to be in. And we haven’t yet. I think it’s a reflection of the fact that we have not yet successfully built an environmental or a climate movement that creates the permission, structure or incentive to really lean in on this stuff. I mean, you’ve written about this, Ezra. I mean, the environmental movement that is that provided most of the horsepower to date for climate politics and climate policy was built to stop bad stuff, not to build good stuff. And there’s been a recognition of that for years. I mean, Bill McKibben, who is a big proponent of the maximalist approach in many ways to climate politics, also recognizes that the only way we solve the problem is to build lots of stuff. And he’s trying to figure out how to activate people around coming to County commissions and fighting for wind farms or solar farms now. But this is a big shift for that kind of political coalition. And it’s going to require, cleaning the slate and starting from scratch in many ways to build institutions and processes that are fit for purpose. And that’s going to remove some of the key tools that environmental groups have been and are still using to stop the bad stuff. And that’s just a really difficult coalitional politics to navigate. So I think you’re right to finger. This is the area where the Biden administration fell short in proposing something. Even to date, congressional Democrats have not proposed a comprehensive, pro abundance, energy permitting reform proposal that could be used to anchor a further discussion with Republicans going forward, and I think they should. Let me grab two other pieces of that. So one which has come up a few times here is the planning capacity. I think oftentimes people hear these arguments for pro energy, abundance permitting, and all they hear is a deregulatory dimension of it. It is always in all of my reporting on this. There need to be more bodies and capacity. There’s the question of various kinds of environmental reviews, which both have which both raise the question of, do we need such intensive environmental reviews on things that we to be clean energy, but also raises a question of, do we have the people needed to create and then respond to all the environmental reviews ping ponging back and forth from the states and the government and so on. How about that dimension of it. What would it look like to add state capacity to the planning functions and implementation functions that allow these things to get built. I mean, to be fair, the IRA did include actually $1 billion of enhanced funding for all of the agencies involved in Nepa review. Did that survive. Well, it was spent under the Obama years, so ideally, that would be like an ongoing appropriation. But that’s just one piece of this broader mess. I mean, my view of this is that we should be thinking about creating a one stop shop process for all federal approvals required for these pieces of key national infrastructure. And that process should have a finite length, and it should not necessarily be a thumbs up decision every time. But as long as it’s a clear short decision and it is appropriately staffed to do that job, well, then industry can go in and make the best case for the project and get an answer pretty quickly. And if the answer is no, they can pivot to the next project. And so it’s not that we need to make it really basically disregard all environmental impact. It’s that we need to make these processes streamlined, centralized and fast so you can get a thumbs up or thumbs down decision that can’t be dragged out in court for 50 years or 30. What Like the Department of Commerce creates a strategic Infrastructure Agency. Sure I mean, we didn’t electrify the country to begin with by just tweaking existing regulatory institutions. We created a whole new agencies, created publicly owned utilities. We created rural electrification loan programs, we have to be that creative if we want to be building at scale a new set of infrastructure across the country the Department of Defense today announced a quite muscular industrial policy intervention to basically take equity, meaningful equity stakes in a domestic critical minerals company to produce rare earths for electric motors and defense applications. Like there’s a version of this agenda on permitting, on planning and industrial policy that is actually not deregulatory. That is really about a much more muscular and centralized state. I think I mean, look, I worked in the White House. I think I used to be of the view like Oh, hire more people to more state capacity to do a better job on the if you do not have the political permission structure, you could just have a lot of people block it like it doesn’t. It actually doesn’t matter. So that actually is the core of the problem. I mean, look yeah, look what they did for the chips. Act like trying to build these semiconductor fabs is they recognize that they weren’t going to get their permits done on time to actually get built. They were just like, we’re just going to reorient this stuff and try to do it very fast and wave a whole bunch of things. Yeah, they try to get things done. They exempted it from the National Environmental Policy Act. Exactly so like if we think it’s important as a national priority to build more energy infrastructure, to have cheap, affordable, clean electricity, to power economic growth, to power the industries of the future, we’re not going to get there with the status quo. So it’s 2025. There’s going to be a midterm election next year. It is very likely, or at least very plausible, that Democrats win the House. It is less likely, but not totally implausible, that they win the Senate, though that would be quite hard. Yeah, rough math, but in a world where Democrats have a lever of power. And so that they are now, if the administration wants appropriations speaker Hakeem Jeffries has to sign off on it before we even talk about next time Democrats wield unified power. What should be on their agenda for 2027? O.K, I have I’m spending a lot of time thinking about this right now. And I think as a general matter, kind of even leaving the electoral stuff aside, if we just took a step back and said, what are the most important things to do in the next few years. Because there’s ways to make progress on all of them. In most political contexts, you’re just not going to get exactly what you want thing one is remove non-market barriers to wide scale deployment of the commercial clean EnergyTech. I think the permitting bill needs to be a huge priority of the climate movement maybe thing one. And that’s possible because you could actually get a fair amount of that’s the thing we’ve always thought could be a bipartisan. There would be things liberals don’t like in it. But you can imagine a divided government doing totally major permitting only actually, in a way like I. But I think the intra coalitional politics within the Democratic Party on this are potentially going to be tough and the climate movement needs to figure out where they want to land on this, because if you actually care about deploying clean energy rapidly and at scale, we have to do this. There just is no question. So that’s thing one thing two, in my view, is the deployment led innovation agenda. So roughly half probably less of global emissions reductions that we’re going to see are going to come from not renewables and electric vehicles, all the other stuff that’s not yet at commercial scale. The Uc is remarkably good at inventing new technologies and demonstrating them. And we’re trying to get better at deploying them too. So in those categories. So that’s things like technologies in the power sector that generate electricity, that are not solar and wind advanced nuclear power or geothermal or carbon capture or whatever. I think there’s an innovation agenda on that could garner bipartisan support. The third pillar, I think, is how do we get serious about diffusing all of these technologies from OECD to non-oecd economies. And even there, I mean, look what’s happening with development funding. A lot of that is energy for economic development, clean energy for economic development. So what’s happening to development funding as a matter of US politics is deeply disturbing for many reasons. And this is one of them. But I do think there may be some opportunity on trade to better. Well, we’ll see to better integrate climate into our trade policy. And I think the US is going to be more muscular in its kind of approach to economic statecraft as it relates to energy and supply chains, whether that’s countering the rise of China in other countries or whatever. But you’ll see that third pillar is not what people typically think of when they think of international climate action where they think of is like, rejoin the Paris Accord and more multilateralism at the UNFCCC on climate targets. What I’m proposing is something that I think could happen, even in a world where it’s not run entirely by Democrats. I mean, I think a long term tax credit, an investment tax credit on the order of 10 percent for all new carbon free electricity. Beyond the ones that are less mature and get the higher level currently would make sense from a public policy perspective. I mean, there is a public good value to having more and cheaper energy. There’s a public good value for that energy being cleaner. And if we’re not going to subsidize it and we’re not going to penalize the dirty stuff, it’s not going to be provided at the scale that we want. But that’s a much smaller and much less expensive subsidy than the one that was implemented under the IRA. I don’t think we’re going to get back to that regime, where we’re basically covering half of the cost of a wind or solar farm out for the next decade. One of the areas that I’m most concerned about beyond climate of the impacts of this bill, is that it has basically upended the electric vehicle and battery competitiveness strategy that was implemented over the last several years, in a pretty thoughtful way to try to counter the rise of China, which is just utterly dominating global markets right now for electric vehicles. We were just at the point where we were starting to see major investment in the US battery supply chain and electric vehicle deployment. We were seeing new models, a more competitive market, and our automakers investing in a real strategy to be competitive in that space. And if you look globally at the future of the auto industry, it’s all electric and autonomous. And if you want to do autonomous vehicles, you also need them to be electric. For the most part, they have to have a large enough batteries and onboard power infrastructure to run all the computers and sensors that you need to run an autonomous vehicle, and China is all in on that stuff. Its entire market is devoted to that now. And the US, if it doesn’t find a way to compete in that space, will find itself with an automotive industry that is basically shut off from all other global markets, and that is only supplying a shrinking share of even our own domestic market, where internal combustion engine vehicle sales peaked long ago and are only declining. And we just blew that all up. Our whole industrial strategy there was just basically destroyed by this bill. Something has to replace that. And I do think there is bipartisan interest in having a competitive auto industry and in having the ability to produce batteries. I mean, just look this executive order around rare earths. Like just from a defense. Only interest like the future of warfighting will involve batteries everywhere as well. The times ran this piece recently comparing energy and energy related exports of China and the US. And it was really striking. I mean, you look the US exports $117 billion in crude oil, China 844 million. We export $42 billion in natural gas. China 3 billion. So it’s like you look at the energy of the past and we’re way ahead. But then China exports $40 billion in solar panels and modules. We export $69 million worth of it. They export $65 billion worth of lithium ion batteries. We export $3 billion. Their EV exports are way ahead of ours right now. I mean, China’s been absolutely going all out to try to win these industries. Part of the IRA was trying to win some part of them back. And even if you don’t care at all about the clean energy implications, it’s pretty clear these are growing industries. Yeah, I mean, I look at China and I look at the emergence of what is like the first global electro state versus Petro states, we’re basically doubling down now as a Petro state with the Republican strategy. We should be clear, way behind right. It’s not that we’re like losing our edge. We are already way behind in these industries. And the IRA and the infrastructure law were pretty concerted efforts to try to get back to a point where we could compete. And if those are gone, something else has to be there. Or we’re basically just giving up. We’re unilaterally disarming and saying what, China. Go for it. The entire world auto market is yours. You had signaled that maybe in the list of innovative technologies we are still funding, there is something that could become a big deal when you look at those more nascent technologies, green hydrogen, I mean, people are very excited about advanced geothermal a couple of years ago. I can’t quite tell if that is sustained at the same level. I love it. Hot rocks. Hot rocks. Yeah what looks most promising there. If you were. If you were really placing bets. What should we really be throwing ourselves behind. I mean, I do think that advanced geothermal is the most promising thing right now, and it’s not surprising that the United States as a Petro state, that drilling is extremely good at drilling wells and has drilled millions of them. What makes advanced geothermal advanced. So there’s two different flavors of it, but the one that’s advancing most rapidly is basically using directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques that were developed originally to extract shale gas and oil. The spillover effect of public innovation, it’s also publicly driven innovation, were are now being applied in a very different geology to create very different reservoirs. So totally different engineering design, but the same kind of core techniques to basically create a bunch of fractures in the ground that you can circulate water through and extract the heat from the Earth. The other strategy is a closed loop geothermal technology. And I should disclose I’m on an advisory board of a company that does this called ever technologies. And they basically just drill lots of out and back loops. And both of those technologies allow us to basically build geothermal anywhere we can drill into hot rock, as opposed to needing a kind of natural hot springs type formation of fissures that naturally circulate water. Whereas this could these technologies could allow geothermal to be built at terawatt scale globally. So we could be building hundreds of gigawatts nuclear fleets worth of advanced geothermal in the long term. And the US has by far the best competitive position in that area because of the strength of our oil and gas industry. So this could be one where we do have a competitive edge, but it’d be nice if we had a longer list than that. I mean, advanced nuclear, I don’t buy it. I mean, this is one of the ones where, Yes, maybe talk that out because I think people are interested to know is advanced nuclear something I should believe in. Give me the case for advanced. No it is, but whether the US can compete. Yeah I mean, I see it absolutely. I think Jesse and I are totally agree that advanced nuclear is worth investing in both Fusion and fission. What makes it advanced. Much smaller. Really much smaller. More compartmentalized and contained. Slightly different designs. Mechanisms to self cool. So that you’re not dealing with the large scale cooling infrastructure that you need at generation three plants. Some of them use different coolant loops and things like that, both inherently safe. And I think more importantly, since the nuclear fleet is already incredibly safe, are hopefully cheaper to build. And that’s the key one, which is why the smaller can you get economies of scale by manufacturing. But so your skepticism was not that the technology is real. Your skepticism was that we would be good at it. Exactly and so like the first designs will be approved in the next couple of years. The first one just was, but there will be a few more coming. It just takes years to build these things. So the first demonstration reactors, the first of a kind, will come online in 2029 or 30 or 31 or 32. Meanwhile, China is already building them. They have small modular reactors that they’re building. They have gas cooled high temperature reactors that they’re already building the Koreans are out there selling large scale reactors and building them in the UAE on time and on budget. The Chinese are offering that now to competitors around the world, too. And so while it is an area where we have a lot of engineering know how and a lot of technical capability in the United States and a good investment environment to support innovative firms, we are starting we’re starting a decade behind. That’s my problem. We’re starting, well, 5, 10 years behind our competitors in South Korea and China. And so I hope we can compete there. But it’s by no means a slam dunk. So two things that I think are more relevant as we go up the risk ladder of climate change. One is that various forms of carbon capture and removal or direct air capture, which I know you’ve been involved in, become more salient. So most of the technologies we’re talking about are ways of generating energy without creating any emissions. But if we can begin to suck emissions out of the atmosphere and do something with them, maybe we can begin to reverse the damage you’ve already done or about to do. I know you’ve been engaged in efforts to create a market for that. Why don’t we start with that one. What do you think of direct air capture. How plausible is it. At what scale. Like in a situation where we’re in really bad shape, where the risk is turning out to be worse than we had hoped. How much does that. How much could we actually pump into that or pump out through that. Yeah, I mean, I think there are a lot of open questions here and we need to work to figure it out as quickly as possible. My view on this has always been we need to know if it is. The models are assuming that it exists at large scale to solve for the climate problem. So we have an obligation to do the instrumental work to figure out if that’s possible to begin with. And we’re starting to do that, which I think is very good. The challenge with removing CO2 from the ambient air and putting it somewhere permanently, is that it’s hard to do like thermodynamically it can be difficult to do. And the bigger problem is what I’ve been spending, had spent time working on, which is the market development problem, which is who will pay for cleaning up this invisible trash that no one seems to actually care about. That is like that is the big. I think that is the bigger challenge than the technology or the economics. It’s largely just like who pays. I mean, it is a pure. And so what was going on, the thing you worked on, just be clear about it was stripe, which is a digital payments processing company, basically created a side project to create some market for people to try to demonstrate they could do this and stripe would pay them. When you talk about things that government should be doing, that really felt to me like one where the government should be putting money behind a very risky technology in order to try to create a market, in order to try to create the innovative loop that would make this viable. And it was and it has I mean, it has. So the Bipartisan infrastructure law had several billion dollars to demonstrate direct air capture facilities. There is a tax credit that we got enhanced in the Inflation Reduction Act, which remains in The New bill, extended that would give you $180 per ton of CO2 that you pull from the ambient air and store permanently. So there are some policy infrastructures that is nowhere near the scale of investment that you need to make these things real. So that’s first of all. I mean, I think there are one of the things we’re discovering is that there are carbon permanent carbon removal pathways. So there’s direct air capture, but there are other pathways that had not really been top of mind for folks a few years ago, things like enhanced rock weathering, where you’re grinding up a bunch of basalt rocks and putting them in, increasing their surface area and exposing them to moisture so that they more rapidly do what they would do anyway, which is draw CO2 down and store it permanently. Jane loves rocks, I love rocks, I love rocks, but so. But the point with some of these technologies is that there are non-climate co-benefits. There are agricultural, you can have productivity and yield increases as a consequence of doing this on fields where you’re better managing the pH of soil so the land is more productive. So I tend to be more optimistic because I really believe that for now, we need to be very candid with ourselves, which is painful for those of us who are concerned about the climate crisis. That society’s willingness to pay for pure climate action is very low. It is certainly not high enough to do large scale carbon removal at the cost today, at scale. So our view, I think that’s somewhat shared here, is that the role of technology in politics and economics here, this goes to my feedback versus feedback analogy or metaphor. Is that our role our job is to get the cost of these technologies down as much as possible, such that the marginal unit of political will, for the sake of pure climate benefit required to do this stuff, is as low as humanly possible. So the role of these technologies and our impact now should be to keep them alive or give birth to them in many cases and get them to a level where we understand the risks, we understand the benefits, and ideally, we’ve reduced the cost by some degree. So that if we get to a point where we decide, O.K, we really need these. Then there are real option and not an option in a model or a made up, option on a piece of paper. Well then how does that affect the set of technologies we call geoengineering? And for all sorts of very good reasons, people, I think, worry about trying to manipulate the climate with our slightly better than monkey brains. But if we’ve screwed it up, we might try to unscrew it up if things get particularly bad. Totally how do you think about the funding and exploration of geoengineering as a kind of a hedge. Yeah my view on this and I did a dissertation on solar geoengineering, which is the set of ideas. We’re talking about here. I think, for me, the right way to think about the potential value of solar geoengineering for managing climate risk is that we don’t have that many tools to manage climate, to manage increased temperatures that are fast acting, and solar geoengineering masking some of the incoming warming in the way that you could is one of very few tools that could work really fast if we were in a dire situation. So to me, at a pure level of scientific, is this worthy of scientific inquiry. For me, the answer is Yes. Now, technologies aren’t just inherently good or bad. They need to be governed and steered in ways. And my concern about solar geoengineering research and deployment is that we have such low trust in institutions right now that the ability to do science in these riskier in these domains, in a way that’s like truly aligned with global societal benefit is just difficult to imagine. On the other hand, we’re spending a lot of money and time and a lot of other technologies that I’m quite concerned about the global impact of them and that we don’t subject them to the same level of scrutiny. So to be fair to my colleagues, I will say yeah, let’s create a godlike artificial intelligence that we explicitly intend to use to replace human beings in the work that gives them both wages and dignity. But yeah, and have no plans and have no plan. And just like whatever. Like people seem like they can make a lot of money at it. Go forth. But this. How dare we even think about it. Having worked on geoengineering for a long time, it is very frustrating, because I’ve been in countless social, scientific, academic meetings where we all opine and opine, should we or shouldn’t we. Should we even do the research. Who should do the research. And at the same time that we were doing that, this is happening and no one cares. It’s like it actually is. And then once it happens, it’s almost unwatchable. We’re just going to build all the data centers and hope for the best. Totally because and I think because I see that there is potential promise in solar geoengineering for reducing suffering. I’m very worried about research on this topic and agenda setting on this topic and the cultural politics of this topic being overtaken by a Silicon Valley essentially I don’t think that is good for the long term politics or substance of solar geoengineering. And so I am concerned about cultivating even less trust in this set of potential technologies based on who seems to be excited about them and who isn’t. Let me end on this. So imagine some world Democrats take back power in 2028. They do win the Senate. They do win the presidency. They’re going to be facing after this bill, a very different fiscal position than the Biden administration was facing. So the idea that it will be easy to spend hundreds of billions of dollars may or may not be true. By then, it will be hard to raise. It’s always hard to raise taxes, and the tax code is going to be pretty broken after this. I mean, just it’s so shot full of holes that I’ve at least come to the view that full on tax reform might be something we need to consider in a way we haven’t in a very long time. And when taxes can work in a lot of different ways. But one way you can use them is you can raise money by taxing things you don’t like carbon taxes, which used to be a thing we talked about all the time in the climate space have fallen out of favor. They’re considered too politically hard. They’ve not been all that politically stable. On the other hand, nothing else is working out exactly perfectly either. In a world where you are in a very, very difficult fiscal position. But our carbon tax is something that we should be putting back on the table. Is that an idea that in 2029, it’s time will have finally come. Yeah let me say that what I think we need to be doing at that point is figuring out a way that we can continue to drive accelerated deployment of mature technologies and solutions to decarbonize the economy. Maybe it’s a much smaller tax credit. Maybe it’s a regulatory policy that doesn’t have a direct fiscal impact, but its impact on household expenditures is small enough that it doesn’t have political blowback or it’s indirect enough. I mean, it’s look, the Highway Trust Fund has been bankrupt, and we have not been able to raise the gas tax even at the rate of inflation. And so the idea that we’re going to have a substantive carbon price even because it’s fiscally necessary, I just don’t think is very plausible. But a $10 a ton one, which would make a difference in the power sector at making coal less competitive and making renewables more so would only raise the price of gasoline by less than 10 centimeters a gallon in a world where EVs are a competitive option. Maybe that’s politically possible, but I think we need to be very clear. It’s not going to be $100 per ton carbon price that is going to transform the energy economy. It’s going to be the thing. It is one of several options that we can use, I think, for that last mile pull of mature technologies into the market at a pace that reflects their public good nature of being clean and helping decarbonize. The other thing I will say about carbon pricing is that it does run into your broader point about the politics of regulation and the constraints on increasing energy prices and the politics of affordability. Yeah, exactly. Tax their energy. So do you want to advise the Democratic Party to take that position in the name of climate. I mean, that’s a hard sell. It would have to be in the context of a tax reform that did other things people really liked. This is the thing I want to think about in the coming months or years. But what would it look like if we actually tried to rethink the tax code in a pretty fundamental way, such that I don’t think if you step forward and your pitch is, hey, I have a carbon tax. Your life is what it is now, plus a carbon tax. That’s not going to work. No, but if you said this tax code is completely broken. It is taxing the wrong things. We are taxing too much work from the wrong people. We are letting too many things we want less of proliferate. We have made it too easy to be a hedge fund manager, right. You can imagine something that is part of a much bigger pitch. And as part of that pitch, there’s a modest tax on pollution. Yeah which is what we’re talking about here. And so, no, I would not say that the centerpiece of a Democratic administration that cares about this should be a carbon tax. But I would say that I think we are going to be in a world in the next Democratic administration where the fiscal position is much worse and the tax code is completely broken. And I think it would be a mistake for the entire debate to be can you reverse some of Donald Trump’s tax cuts. Yeah, I agree. I think you have to begin to rethink this and then ask yourself, what is a set of principles at the core of that rethinking that make both actual substantive sense, policy sense and make political sense. It doesn’t mean every component of that will be hugely popular. Nobody likes paying taxes on anything, but would they prefer there’s a little bit more tax on pollution as opposed to more taxes on them working. There are things you could think. The problem I have with this is that it’s so hard to proactively predict the way this will play out politically, and you will see so much polling that supports what you’re saying, as we have seen for ever on climate, everyone’s like, oh, the polls show everyone likes support. And then we run the experiment where there’s state ballot initiatives or whatever, even for modest carbon prices, and they fail. But I don’t disagree with you, and I’m happy to run whatever experiments that we want to run. I just say that on the evidence from the world’s experiments with carbon pricing, is that it generally works best when it is not carbon pricing for the sake of carbon pricing, but carbon pricing that is raising revenue, that’s providing public goods that people want. We got to pay for schools, we got to pay for roads, we got to pay for all this stuff. And so how are we going to raise that money. Well, one of the ways we’re going to do it is through congestion pricing in New York City. Now it’s working quite well. So I do think in the context of we need revenue raisers to make a fairer, more progressive tax code, it shouldn’t be off the table. But I do think we have to be very clear about the politics of affordability will also be quite high at that point. I think that is a good place to end. So our final question, what are three books you’d recommend to the audience. And Jane, as we started with you, we’ll start Jesse with you. He’s going to say “Abundance.” Classic. No, as I have just finished reading “Abundance.” The next one on my list is Marc Dunkelman’s “Why Nothing Works,” which I think is probably a great place for folks who have read your book to pick up next. I’m excited to pick it up. I haven’t read it yet, but it’s on my nightstand. The next one. I would say, is “Energy: A Human History” by Richard Rhodes. A historian that I think rightfully puts energy at the center of the human story. How we make and use energy is central to how we structure society. And I guess maybe in that note, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy to take a break from all this heavy stuff. And so one that I’ll call out is Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy. I think it’s a great example of a story of how humanity might muddle through the next couple hundred years that I think grapples with how changing technology co-evolves with society in really interesting ways. And I’ve always found it that futurism helps open my mind to maybe this could go in a different way than we think. We don’t know what the future’s going to look like. We don’t know what options are going to emerge to give us a new tool in our toolkit. We definitely don’t know how that’s going to have ramifications for society, whether that’s AI or something else. And so Robinson’s work, I think is a really great way to just engage in speculative history of the future. Well, I’m way less nerdy than Jesse. So my first recommendation my first recommendation is Norman Rush’s “Mating,” which is just — I just read that. Did you love it? I loved the first two-thirds of it. In my view, that novel is sublime and beautiful and funny and an exploration of love and anthropology and science and justice. And I love that book. The social scientist recommended the social science love story. That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. The second one is “Frontiers of Illusion” by Daniel Sarewitz, who is just a brilliant thinker around science and technology policy — and science and society. And it just does a really great job laying out both the myths, the myths that we believe about science and how it operates and how we need to be. We need to seriously, take a look at those myths in order to enhance the relationship of science to social outcomes that we want to achieve. And then the last one is Donald MacKenzie’s “An Engine, Not a Camera,” which is also kind of a social studies of science book, but it’s a really brilliant analysis of the role of economic models and theory of finance, not as descriptive representations of empirical reality, but as actual drivers of how those markets operate themselves a book of models. These modelers need to understand their power, and it’s just a great book. And I think about it all the time in the context of the role of models in climate and environmental policy. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, thank you very much. Thank you.

The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.
Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.
(Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).","A recent spike in demand for electric vehicles ahead of soon-to-expire federal tax credits has led Connecticut to lower some of its own incentives for car buyers, officials said this week.

The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced on Thursday that it would lower its standard rebate for purchasers of new EVs and plug-in hybrids from $1,500 to $500, due in part to what officials said was a more than 30% increase in demand for the rebates before federal tax credits expire on Sep. 30.

During a virtual meeting with reporters and public stakeholders Thursday, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said the sudden spike in demand had forced the agency to begin “rationing” its incentives to ensure the ongoing fiscal health of the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Vehicle Purchase Rebate program.

“The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said. “We’re trying to be good stewards of that money.”

The new, lower standard rebates will take effect Aug. 1. The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.

Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.

While DEEP did not immediately provide data on the number of state rebates that have been requested or approved since the federal law took effect, automakers have been publicly pushing customers to take advantage of the tax credits before they go away.

Tesla — which cannot sell its cars directly to buyers in Connecticut — recently published a banner advertisement on its website about the expiring tax credits, urging customers to “Take Inventory Now.”

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

Barry Kresch, the president of the EV Club of Connecticut, said that while he understood DEEP’s rationale for lowering its incentives, the move comes at a precarious time for the industry. Nationally, EV sales are expected to hit a slump later this year after the expiration of the tax breaks, he said.

“I’m sad to see the reduction of the incentive, because I think it was effective,” Kresch said. “Hopefully it can come back, depending on how the market looks.”

The number of EVs in Connecticut has quadrupled since 2020, but still only account for about 2.7 % of registered vehicles in the state. Despite the limits on direct sales, Tesla cars are by far the state’s most popular brand of EVs, followed by Toyota, Jeep and Chevrolet.

Oliver Johnson, a sales manager at Toyota of Stamford, said his dealership has experienced a slight increase in interest in the automaker’s EV lineup — led by the plug-in hybrid RAV 4 — since the new law went into effect. The dealership typically sells under a dozen EVs a month, he said, meaning the bump resulted in about three to four additional sales.

Johnson said that customers in the market for EVs are well aware of the deadline. “Everyone knows about it,” he said.

Since launching in 2015, the CHEAPR program has issued more than 21,000 rebates worth over $42 million, according to DEEP. The program is funded through a fee assessed on new vehicle sales and registrations.

This year’s standard rebate was already reduced in January from last year’s maximum of $2,250, due to strong demand. It had previously been set to drop again in August, to $1,000, prior to DEEP’s announcement of further cuts on Thursday. (Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).

In its announcement on Thursday, DEEP said officials would work with the CHEAPR Board to discuss potentially increasing incentives again to meet demand following the expiration of the federal tax credits in September.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tesla-charging-station-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 19:01:09.381590

Despite being relatively small, the carnivorous honey badger has few natural predators, thanks to its thick skin, durability, and ability to wriggle free from even the most dangerous of situations. It is, frankly, badass.

The honey badger’s hardiness and its you’ll-never-take-me-alive disposition have inspired athletes, T-shirt schleppers, and motivational speakers. And it’s a pretty fitting mascot for the community solar industry right now.

Solar photovoltaic and wind projects, long derided by the guy in the Oval Office, got the short end of the stick in the Republican budget reconciliation bill, seeing tax credit eligibility phased out and cut off sooner than originally promised by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Those that don’t get a shovel in the dirt ASAP risk losing financing, complicating deals with lenders and power purchase agreements (PPAs) with offtakers. If developers can get approval from the locals to break ground, which is far from a given in some parts of the United States, they’ll have to sort out the implications of back-and-forth tariffs, which are complicating supply chains and driving up construction costs.

Add in tricky foreign entity of concern (FEOC) clauses that endanger tax credit eligibility, and simply put, some power projects no longer pencil out. Accordingly, there has been a rush to the exits, even in strong markets like Texas. E2 counts 16,500 American jobs lost so far this year; more than $22 billion (and counting) has been taken off the table. Enverus Intelligence Research estimates 70% of solar and 43% of wind capacity are not resilient to losing investment and production tax credits.

Despite all of that and more, community solar persists. Small-scale, local photovoltaic projects are cropping up left and right, and slowly, frameworks to support the industry are coming together and moving through state legislatures.

“There’s this broad set of benefits that community solar brings to the table that are – I don’t want to say uncontroversial because everything’s political right now – but tend to have appeal from all different types of stakeholders,” ventured Tom Hunt, the CEO of Pivot Energy, a developer of distributed scale solar and storage projects based in Denver, Colorado.

“In markets across the country, there is bipartisan recognition that community solar can lower energy costs, provide customer choice, and drive local economic growth,” concurred Jeff Cramer, CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), a trade association of which Hunt is chairman of the board.

Wood MacKenzie has projected U.S. community solar capacity to surpass 14 gigawatts (GW) by 2029, although the global consultancy admits long-term growth depends largely on state and national policy. There are many reasons why distributed solar projects might be more appealing than their residential or utility-scale brethren, but at the end of the day, they can all be distilled into a straightforward axiom: Time is money.

Go Queue Yourself: The Perks of Not Getting Stuck

One of the primary perks of distributed generation projects is staying out of transmission-level queues, which can delay project timelines tremendously.

“Larger transmission-level queues have very lengthy interconnection processes and are generally crowded across the country, whereas community solar projects follow distribution-level interconnection processes, which are much quicker,” detailed Aaron Halimi, founder and president of Renewable Properties (RP). “In this business, time is money.”

PJM, for example, oversees the largest power grid operator in the United States, and it hasn’t accepted new requests to interconnect since 2022, when the regional transmission organization (RTO) paused its queue to evaluate reforms aimed at accommodating massive spikes in study submissions. PJM predicts its 2025 peak demand will increase by 30 GW by 2030, largely attributable to data center growth in the region. A long line of utility-scale generation projects is prepared to lower capacity prices by increasing competition, but when those projects will come online is a bit of a mystery. Community solar projects, on the other hand, use existing infrastructure to connect to the grid, making them much more nimble.

RP is currently developing and operating in 16 states, with hopes to expand if legislation falls in favor of doing so. Pivot Energy aggregates projects, typically in the 5 megawatt (MW) range, and finances them together into portfolios that are then presented to corporate clients in volumes closer to 100s of MW. Hunt says that allows his company to bring a site online within 18 to 24 months, compared to a typical 3-5 year timeline at the transmission level. Such speed and flexibility provide immediate capacity relief in developing regions experiencing rapid load growth from the diaspora of data centers, electric vehicle (EV) adoption, new manufacturing facilities, or whatever.

Community solar projects are typically cited closer to electric load, which saves money on transmission construction, making the sector attractive to regulators seeking to postpone multi-billion-dollar upgrade costs that inevitably get passed on to consumers. The people living in the neighborhoods where the projects end up tend to appreciate them, too.

Small in Scale, Close to Communities

The relatively small size of community solar projects makes them inherently more local, delivering tailored benefits to a specific area that larger utility-scale endeavors simply cannot. That often means developers become fast friends with farmers.

“Landowners are among our most important project partners,” confirmed RP’s Halimi. “When we lease land, it’s a 35+ year relationship, and we have some great testimonials on our website about how we communicate with landowners. From the start, we aim to be transparent and clearly describe the solar development process, deliver on our promises, and address their concerns.”

“Most of our land owners tend to be farmers,” echoed Pivot’s Hunt. “They may have 25-30 acres that they’re not utilizing. It’s maybe less productive, or they just don’t want to farm as much acreage right then. They can then get revenue on that, keep it in the family as land that they still control, which will eventually get decommissioned and returned to them in its natural state. And that’s just a really appealing thing for those landowners and thus for a lot of the communities involved.”

With a footprint often limited to a couple of dozen acres rather than the hundreds or thousands encompassed by the sprawl of utility-scale farms, a community solar installation doesn’t dominate the landscape. Small scale allows for customization, too.

While citing its 9.1 MW Slayton Settlement Projects in New York, Renewable Properties got word from the locals that siting the arrays on the landowner’s old dairy farm would change the character of the land and the surrounding agricultural community. To address their concerns, Halimi’s team committed to creating an agrivoltaics project and hired the area’s sheep farmers to manage the project’s ground cover.

“The sheep have just arrived, and we’ll soon be adding beehives for honey cultivation,” beamed Halimi. “In addition, the steady lease income is enabling the landowner to maintain ownership and keep the land in the family. This is a big one, as many farmers are struggling throughout the country and have turned to solar as a means to keep their farms in their family for generations to come.”

Pivot Energy recently completed a project in Weld County, Colorado, a community rich in oil and gas infrastructure. Residents had very specific desires to keep land owned by local farmers, ensuring that water rights remain within the community as much as possible. Pivot partnered with local rancher Tom Brown, who Hunt reports is now expanding his flock because of the stable business agrivoltaic practices now provide.

Positive Policy Percolating

While federal support for some types of renewable energy projects is evidently waning, supportive community solar policies are steadily spreading through state legislatures, and roadblocks that once stood in the way of progress are being removed.

After years of fighting against it, Georgia Power is among the latest to agree to work “in good faith” to enable a path forward for the Solar for All program by modifying its customer-sited solar-plus-storage pilot. Florida has also introduced a bill to better tap into the benefits of community solar.

“Clean, affordable energy should be within reach for everyone—especially in Florida, the Sunshine State. Unfortunately, nearly half of all households and businesses can’t install rooftop solar because they rent, share buildings, or can’t afford the upfront costs,” lamented U.S. Representative Kathy Castor. “That’s where community solar comes in. It allows neighbors to share the benefits of nearby solar projects—saving them money on their electric bills without needing solar panels on their own roof.”

“This bill helps expand these initiatives, especially for working families,” Castor added. “It supports states and local governments, creates jobs, and helps cut harmful pollution. By boosting access to shared solar energy and investing in storage, each community solar project creates $14 million in local economic investment and over 90 jobs.”

Tireless pressure from communities and advocacy organizations prompted Minnesota lawmakers to repeal language from SB 2855 and its House companion, protecting Minnesota’s Community Solar Garden program. According to supporters, the program is poised to deliver billions in economic benefits, lowering energy costs for all subscribers and expanding affordable access for low-to-moderate-income residents.

“This is a major win,” surveyed Vote Solar’s Midwest regional director, Patty O’Keefe. “During a time when state-level action is crucial, it is a major win to see that Minnesota lawmakers side with communities and the clean energy advocates to keep the Community Solar Garden program intact.”

Recent growth has been further accelerated by robust markets in New York, Maine, and Illinois, which each broke annual capacity records last year and accounted for 83% of national volumes. Minnesota is the next largest market.

“Here in California, we’re optimistic about AB 1260, which would specifically direct the CPUC to ensure that community solar-plus-storage projects are fairly compensated,” shared RP’s Halimi, who has noted that the Midwest is really heating up.

“Wisconsin and Missouri are drafting bills, and Montana looks even more promising. The Pennsylvania House of Representatives just passed HG 504, which would establish a community energy program in the state,” he continued. “We’re working as much as we can to support CCSA and their community solar advocacy efforts in these states.”

Additional recent community solar progress includes:

American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC): Sponsored by conservative county commissioner Lori Saine, conservative legislative member organization ALEC unanimously passed a resolution that supports community solar and agrivoltaics permitting for farmers.

Virginia: Governor Glenn Youngkin signed SB 253 and HB 106 into law. expanding shared solar access by 150 MW for Dominion Energy customers and establishing a new 50 MW program in Appalachian Power territory.

Colorado: Governor Jared Polis inked SB 24-207, a bill that will modernize the state’s community solar program and enable a new dispatchable distributed generation program.

New Mexico: The state’s Public Regulation Commission expanded the state’s community solar program by 300 MW of new capacity.

Alaska: The Republican Legislature and Governor passed SB 52 to create a new third-party community solar program in the state. This marks the first super-majority Republican state to pass enabling legislation for community solar.

Massachusetts: The state passed a climate bill that streamlined local permitting for community solar projects, instituted net crediting, and reformed interconnection, enabling 800 MW of distributed generation.

The Road Ahead

In order for community solar to really achieve liftoff velocity, the investment tax credit (ITC) for photovoltaic projects probably needed to stay in place.

“The ITC [was] absolutely critical to the solar industry but thereby also to the entire electricity sector,” Hunt told Factor This. Pivot Energy was among a chorus lobbying hard to make the case for keeping ITC eligibility in place, as was Renewable Properties, which pushed for a more sensible wind-down in Washington.

Despite losing out on the chance to cash in on future tax incentives, many small-scale solar developers believe a steady pace of development will continue. The sheer amount of power needed to feed AI demands it, and whether The Powers That Be like it or not, solar is the most cost-effective and fastest-to-market generation solution available. Well-capitalized companies will keep building. Lenders will still invest. But picking the right partners for projects is more important than ever.

Halimi thinks tariffs will likely stoke inflation and slow economic growth, creating challenging conditions for the broader economy, but the United States is insatiably thirsty for electricity, and solar is primed to handle some of the quenching.

“Even if we have a recession, the demand for kWhs in the U.S. is going to keep the underlying fundamentals for the energy markets in a good place for developers,” RP’s founder predicts. “Tariffs may make markets more volatile, but I don’t see that volatility impacting project-level investing (tax equity, debt, or sponsor equity). Tariff uncertainty generally leads investors to a flight to quality. The U.S. infrastructure market is dominated by renewable energy projects, and that is as high-quality as it gets.”

Hunt says it’s mostly business as usual at Pivot, since projects have long investment cycles, there is a chance to safe harbor some tax credit eligibility once construction begins.

“We’re operating assuming existing law stays in place but not being blind to potential changes,” offered Hunt. “You try to build some resiliency into developing high-return projects that may be able to withstand a hit.”

It’s safe to say that all community solar companies operating in the U.S. would like to see more federal support. They’d also prefer the tariff seesaw stabilize soon and would appreciate a few more state-level legislators who recognize the value in distributed energy.

Solar installers rush to complete projects before the loss of tax credits

John Rogers, 25, handed a solar panel to his co-worker, who hoisted the 45-pound, six-foot-long rectangle onto his shoulder and lugged it up a ladder to the roof of a house in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.

The company where they work, EIS Solar of Pittsburgh, has had a busy month.

“I mean, Squirrel Hill’s been getting a lot more panels, but a lot of places have been getting a lot of panels,” Rogers said. “Whether it’s flat, steep, tall, pretty short — if we can put panels on it, we most definitely will,” he laughed.

Even with the day’s rain, the crew completed the residential installation within a day.

Since the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed by President Trump on July 4, the phones at EIA have been ringing off the hook, according to owner Joe Morinville. They’re hearing from old customers wanting to upgrade or add battery systems. “And there’s all kinds of new customers coming in,” he said. “It’s about four [times] the amount of inquiry prior to the House bill, and now that it’s passed, it’s accelerating even further.”

There’s a rush because a 30% tax credit for residential solar projects is abruptly expiring at the end of this year. The credits were scheduled to run until 2032, under President Biden’s landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The Trump law also scraps tax breaks for larger-scale solar projects early at the end of 2027.

Morinville said he ramped because of those tax breaks.

“We bought trucks, we hired people, we doubled our staff. We grew in order to meet that demand,” he said.

EIS works mostly on commercial projects, such as the Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid, but Morinville expects some small, local solar installers that have, until now, been growing to go bankrupt.

“The Congress came in and cut our legs out from under us. It doesn’t make any sense,” he said. He feels that the message now is clear: “We don’t need you guys anymore. You’re done. You know, you’re all canceled, right?” he said.

Federal roadblocks for solar amid growing power demand

President Trump isn’t just rolling back clean energy tax breaks; he’s targeted the solar and wind industries with more roadblocks for renewable projects in favor of natural gas, oil, and coal.

“It’s quite ironic that the President basically has called a 9-1-1 on an energy emergency, as he’s called it, and essentially at the same time is destroying the fire department,” said Sharon Pillar, founder of the non-profit PA Solar Center.

It comes at a time when energy bills are on the rise, as electric grids in parts of the country voice concerns about demand outpacing supply.

PJM, the regional grid operator that includes Pennsylvania, paid record-high prices for electricity in its recent auction. For consumers, this means bills could rise by up to 5%. PJM sees increasing demand driven by the growth of power-hungry data centers, artificial intelligence, and electrification.

At the same time, the solar industry is booming. Along with energy storage batteries, it is expected to account for 81% of new energy generation capacity nationwide in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In Pennsylvania, the Public Utilities Commission announced this week that the state doubled its solar generation capacity in just 17 months, with more pending PJM’s approval.

“We’re seeing literally hundreds of schools, farms, businesses, nonprofits, municipalities going solar because it’s saving so much money for them over a long period of time,” Piller said. “So the investment is upfront in the technology, but those savings will accumulate over the lifetime of the solar system, which is 30 years or more.”

Piller credits Biden-era tax incentives for the industry’s leap and the job growth. There are now more than 4200 solar jobs in Pennsylvania. She points to Pittsburgh-area companies like EOS Energy Enterprises, a battery maker, and Vitro Glass, which has started manufacturing products for the solar industry.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act puts those jobs in jeopardy, Piller said, because investors and developers plan large-scale projects based on the expected tax breaks, which may not happen in the shortened timeframe.

“The new bill that just passed, basically, I think the aim was to destroy the growth of renewable energy,” she said.

Renewable factories have been onshoring to the U.S.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, supports the phasing out of the clean energy credits in the new law. She said one reason is that the manufacturing of renewable energy components still relies on fossil fuels.

“Because wind and solar, the components of those are made in China with coal-fired power plants, said Furchtgott-Roth, pointing out that China dominates the global supply chain for solar components and storage batteries.

At the same time, the U.S. solar manufacturing has been growing, according to Sean Gallagher of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. According to SEIA, over 100 solar manufacturing facilities have opened due to manufacturing tax incentives in the IRA. Gallaher said plants are now at risk in states like Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

“The irony of the [new law]: It’s going to lead to factory closures and people losing their jobs in the very districts of the members of Congress who voted for the bill,” he said.

This week, Reuters reported that plans to increase production at a solar panel manufacturing plant in Indianapolis have been suspended, and plans for a solar cell facility in Minnesota are now under review, among other projects.

President Trump visited Pittsburgh in July for an energy summit, touting $90 billion in energy investments, largely focused on building natural gas and nuclear capacity to power data centers and AI.

But according to Gallagher, nuclear projects can take decades to build, and natural gas plants also take time.

“In the meantime, you could build tens of thousands of megawatts of solar,” he said. “We’re going to do less of that simply because this administration has put its thumb on the scale for older, dirtier forms of energy instead of taking advantage of everything that America has to offer.”

Meanwhile, Joe Morinville of EIS Solar says homeowners who want the tax credits for panels and batteries need to get in line soon, because there’s a limit to how many projects they can complete by the end of the year.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Solar-Installer2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 16:03:30.246507

“By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project — ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in the department’s announcement. “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs.”

Kentucky leaders react

State Sen. Danny Carroll, R-Paducah, said in a statement the site selection is affirmation of the state’s position as a leader in energy policy and economic opportunity. Carroll sponsored legislation earlier this session that created the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority. A total of $40 million was allocated in the state’s budget to fund the authority and its related research efforts.

“Paducah’s potential as a nuclear and innovation hub is clearer than ever,” Carroll said in the statement. “We have the people, the partnerships, and the bipartisan momentum to turn this designation into something transformative for our economy.”

In a statement, state Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, said the department’s inclusion of a Kentucky site is exactly what the state has been preparing for.

Bledsoe, who co-chairs the Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force, said the group has taken deliberate steps to get ahead of the AI curve by “crafting a responsible policy framework while also evaluating what it takes to build out the infrastructure AI demands.”

“In the second phase of our work, we’re looking at everything from workforce development to cybersecurity to energy capacity,” Bledsoe said. “This federal announcement aligns directly with those efforts and reinforces the connection between smart policy and smart infrastructure.”

Longtime Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell also praised the Department of Energy’s Paducah selection. Earlier this year, the Republican senator said his office contacted the Energy department and was in support of the Western Kentucky city’s submission to be considered for the AI infrastructure program.

“The site at Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant has long held a critical role in advancing U.S. national security, and is poised, yet again, to be a national leader in an emerging and important technology,” McConnell said in a statement. “I am proud of the Paducah community and its workforce and know they are prepared to continue working closely with the Department of Energy to further instill (the plant’s) role in national security while helping facilitate greater U.S. leadership in AI.”

History of Paducah site in Western Kentucky

The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is one of the nation’s largest former uranium enrichment facilities and is now undergoing necessary preparation for future redevelopment, according to the energy department. Enriched uranium is a critical piece of nuclear power generation. The plant was constructed in 1952 to support the nation’s nuclear program at the time and then was used to make nuclear fuel for commercial power plants.

Operations stopped at the plant in 2013 when the facility was turned over to the energy department’s environmental management program. The program has managed extensive cleanup activities at the site since the 1980s and is deactivating parts of the plant. The Portsmouth Paducah Project Office is continuing other aggressive remediation at the site.

McCracken County’s 1st District Commissioner Bill Bartleman told the Herald-Leader he suspects the Paducah site was picked because it already has the available electricity and infrastructure in place for something to be developed. Plus, he said, the community would welcome a move back to nuclear production.

“We have a positive history of nuclear energy in West Kentucky,” Bartleman said. “For 60 years, we did uranium enrichment. It was a major part of the federal government and in the defense of the country. So, we’re very positive on nuclear energy and we think that this is just a piece of that because it’ll allow for, probably, creation of other jobs and new types of nuclear power plants.”

Paducah’s Republican Rep. Steven Rudy, who is part of the Kentucky Rural Electric Cooperative Caucus, said the plant was a major employer for years and it’s crucial to envision the site as something new.

“We have a trained workforce, we have a lot of assets and we feel like there’s getting ready to be a nuclear revolution in this country. We want to be in the middle of it,” Rudy told the Herald-Leader. “... We’re a community, unlike most, that welcome nuclear with open arms.

“We think that’s going to be key to American energy independence,” he said. “We’re looking at all of the above, not just one particular thing, as we focus on diversifying our nation’s and our state’s energy portfolio.”",https://www.kentucky.com/latest-news/hhnq6h/picture42498612/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/14wnNH.So.79.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 16:04:48.689997

“Clean, renewable energy like solar helps reduce air pollution, fights climate change, and helps meet our growing electricity needs. This is a momentous milestone, and there is now enough installed solar capacity in Pennsylvania to power 350,000 homes,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “Putting more solar power onto the grid is part of Governor Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan – an all of the above energy plan to create jobs, lower energy costs for consumers, and fight climate change.”

The celebration took place in front of a 342-kW solar array at Gifford Pinchot State Park’s Quaker Race Day Use Area, which provides shade for ADA-accessible picnic areas and parking while generating clean energy. By 2030, DCNR will derive all of its electricity from renewables, about half of that through solar installations, according to the Shapiro administration.

“This park uses clean energy from the sun and provides shade for cars in the parking area, modeling a practical way we can take climate action and serve visitors in an innovative way,” DCNR Deputy Secretary Mike Walsh said. “For 30 years, DCNR has been managing Pennsylvania’s natural resources with sustainability at the forefront. With leadership from Governor Shapiro, we continue to focus on the stewardship that strengthens communities and enhances our quality of life.”

Increasing renewable energy like solar is part of Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan. The plan would create or protect more than 15,000 Pennsylvania jobs, save more than $660 million for consumers by 2040, and generate more than $11 billion in clean, reliable energy investments, according to the Shapiro administration. Updates to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard through the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) proposal would incentivize more clean energy as part of Pennsylvania’s electricity mix.

Further investments in clean energy could come from Community Energy projects that allow communities to jointly invest in local energy projects and sell excess electricity to the grid. And the proposed Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction (PACER) PACER would establish a cap-and-invest program to set Pennsylvania’s carbon limit and invest in reducing electricity costs. Under PACER, 70 percent of the revenue generated would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bills.

As DEP celebrates its 30th anniversary in 2025, the Shapiro Administration is committed to protecting Pennsylvanians’ air, land, and water from pollution.

“Congress created a program to provide funding for shelter for migrants.
But the state recognized that more was needed and sought federal funding through the Shelter and Services Program.
That means the administration can’t refuse to pay out funds already approved by Congress “simply because of policy objections,” the complaint states.
Brown is asking the court to declare DHS’s decision to terminate the Shelter and Services Program unlawful and order the federal agency to restore the funding program.","SEATTLE – Attorney General Nick Brown today filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for unlawfully canceling more than $4 million in congressionally approved funds intended to help the state provide shelter and support to migrants as they await further action on their asylum or other immigration claims.

Since 2019—in a law signed by President Trump in his first term—Congress has provided funds to help states, local jurisdictions, and nonprofit organizations offer emergency food and shelter to noncitizen migrants after their release from DHS custody. As tens of thousands of humanitarian migrants arrived in Washington between 2022 and 2024, local shelters and municipalities struggled to meet the needs of these newcomers, which prompted the state to take action, including by applying for federal funds through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Shelter and Services Program.

FEMA, which is part of DHS, awarded Washington more than $4 million in SSP funds. But before Washington could request payment under the award, FEMA unlawfully froze and later terminated the funding in a continuation of the Trump administration’s efforts to deprive states, like Washington, of federal funding to support the health and safety of migrants.

“Once again, the Trump administration is breaking the law and ignoring Congress,” Brown said. “Congress created a program to provide funding for shelter for migrants. But now the president has illegally yanked the funds, ignoring the separation of powers, simply because he doesn’t like the program.”

As the complaint notes, by creating a program intended to relieve overcrowding in federal short-term detention facilities, Congress “made a conscious choice to provide funds in a manner that would benefit some individuals who may have entered into the United States unlawfully.”

As a result of broader migration trends that resulted in millions of people crossing the southwest border into the U.S. between 2019 and 2024, the number of noncitizen migrants present in Washington climbed ten-fold to 45,603 in 2024 from 4,156 in 2022. The state’s housing and homeless crisis response system was strained, and most emergency shelters were already filled each night, leaving thousands of newly arrived migrants homeless.

Washington responded by appropriating $25 million for the Washington Migrant and Asylum-Seeker Support Project (the WA MASS Project), which was launched in October 2024 to help newly arrived migrants meet their basic needs such as shelter, food, and access to medical care. But the state recognized that more was needed and sought federal funding through the Shelter and Services Program.

Brown argues in the complaint that DHS violated the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine because the Constitution grants “the power of the purse” to Congress and not the president. That means the administration can’t refuse to pay out funds already approved by Congress “simply because of policy objections,” the complaint states. He also alleges that DHS has violated the Administrative Procedure Act by taking actions that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.

Brown is asking the court to declare DHS’s decision to terminate the Shelter and Services Program unlawful and order the federal agency to restore the funding program.

A copy of the complaint is available here.

At least that was the consensus of experts at the Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency EXPO and Policy Forum held Thursday in the Rayburn House Office Building.
That measure, actually a package of legislation, largely dismantled the Inflation Reduction Act, one of President Joe Biden’s signature accomplishments and the largest federal investment ever in renewable energy and provisions aimed at curbing climate change.
“Your hard work in the dark years showed energy efficiency and the embrace of renewable energy would really work,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said during a mid-morning session.
“This proving ground aims to scale up and integrate these different technologies’ generation and use to enhance demonstration of these future energy systems for commercial deployment,” she said.","WASHINGTON — In terms of percentages, there hasn’t been a surge in energy demand comparable to what the world is experiencing today since the end of the second World War.

That said, there has probably never been less clarity on how to meet that demand.

At least that was the consensus of experts at the Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency EXPO and Policy Forum held Thursday in the Rayburn House Office Building.

That’s not to say a pall hung over the event; only that it was the first conference the Environmental and Energy Study Institute has hosted on Capitol Hill — along with the House and Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucuses — since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term and the recent passage of the Republican tax cut and spending bill.

That measure, actually a package of legislation, largely dismantled the Inflation Reduction Act, one of President Joe Biden’s signature accomplishments and the largest federal investment ever in renewable energy and provisions aimed at curbing climate change.

When the dust had settled over passage of the Republican bill two weeks ago, sweeping cuts had been made to incentives earmarked for solar and wind energy projects and for advancing the adoption of renewable vehicles.

There were plenty of winners, however, including nuclear power, the fossil fuel industry and the complementary geothermal and hydrogen sectors.

“There’s no doubt things have changed,” said Charles Bolden, senior director of congressional affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, an industry advocacy group with over 1,300 member companies.

“As a result, some of our members are taking a new look at their business models, but more importantly, the changes that have occurred have made us work all that much harder on our messaging,” he said.

“One of the things that we’ve been working on is making sure we’re talking to members of Congress and other entries about the dramatic increase in energy demand that is occurring, and telling them that we’re ready to stand the gap.”

“The message from the solar sector in the current environment is we’re reliable, we’re affordable, and we can deploy our assets at a faster pace than any other energy resource,” Bolden said.

Patrick Hughes, senior vice president of strategy and industry affairs at the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, said even before the policy shift in Washington, getting a handle on just how much more energy is needed was no easy task.

“We were seeing wildly different projections about what to expect,” Hughes said.

“Finally, we decided we had to look at this with our own lens, based on our own assumptions, and our conclusion was we are going to see something close to a 50% increase in electricity demand by 2050,” he said.

Hughes said while artificial intelligence and the ever-larger number of data centers it needs to grow are driving much of the increase in demand, these are not the only factors driving the hunger for mega-, giga- and terawatts.

“It’s the growth of the economy as a whole,” he said. “Yes, it’s data centers. But it’s also the electrification of homes and buildings and the industrial sector. It’s electric vehicles, in the medium and longer term. And it’s the creation and implementation of technologies that are going to be key to meeting that demand.”

Over the course of eight hours on Thursday, forum attendees and presenters discussed all this and more in sessions highlighting green and more energy efficiency building, building resilience and comfort, rural energy, transportation and mobility, and energy security.

Throughout the day, members of the House and Senate stopped by to tell stories from their districts and provide encouragement to those circulating between the meeting room and exhibition hall.

“Your hard work in the dark years showed energy efficiency and the embrace of renewable energy would really work,” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said during a mid-morning session.

“You plowed through, day after day, year after year, legislative session after legislative session, and you ultimately succeeded,” Welch said, seeking to bolster any lagging spirits in the wake of the dramatic gutting of many hard-won incentives and policies two weeks ago.

“You did the work and it showed,” he continued.

“So, okay, now we’ve had a setback with the Trump administration and what it’s done to the IRA, but at the same time, we’re also getting encouraging feedback from Republicans whose districts are not being affected … [and] those who had projects they thought were going to be in their district that are suddenly on the chopping block. So we have to stay the course,” he said.

“The story of the present moment is about trying to figure out what the right course to follow is; it’s not about providing people with proof of concept; it’s about dealing with a political reality that is, quite frankly, bizarre,” Welch said.

“So don’t give up. You’ve succeeded before and together we’ll get the nation back to the confident, forward-facing approach that a successful country has to have in order to sustain its success,” he said.

Shannon Bragg-Sitton, associate director of energy, environment science and technology at the Idaho National Laboratory, also spoke of the “really shocking” increase in energy demand and how the drive for more data centers, more electrified transportation and domestic manufacturing is driving that demand even higher.

“There’s no question we have a lot of work to do to meet those demands, and this rapid increase means we don’t have the luxury to choose our favorite energy source,” Bragg-Sitton said.

“If our nation really is seeking to become self-reliant, we really need to embrace existing technologies,” she continued. “That means embracing some of our fossil fuel resources, existing large scale nuclear — which has the opportunity for power upgrades that will enable us to get another power plant’s-worth of output from some of those plants — alongside renewable energy sources such as geothermal, hydro power and biomass, as well as wind and solar, and also emerging technologies like small-scale nuclear.”

Bragg-Sitton said the research directorate she leads in Idaho “is really focused on bringing those technologies together, focusing on advancing integrated energy technologies from their initial concept to the point that they can be adopted and deployed by industry.”

“The new technologies we develop in partnership with industry will change our energy paradigm,” she said.

She then went on to explain that a core focus of work at the laboratory is creating more connected systems that can capitalize on efficiency gains in the system to better meet dynamic energy demands.

“In other words, in the case of data centers, we’re looking to create configurable systems in which we can manage energy input from multiple [sources] and make real-time decisions about when to send energy in from the grid and direct heat for electricity to storage so we can use it to meet later demand or support the production of other products, like steel and fertilizers,” Bragg-Sitton said.

“These technologies will use robust control systems, and they’ll leverage all of the AI that we’re hearing about,” she said.

But Bragg-Sitton also acknowledged seizing a promising future isn’t easy.

“One of the challenges that we have is that new technologies often take too long to develop and deploy,” she said. “They cost too much, and it takes a long time to develop the human capital to operate these systems. This presents a gap in these products coming to the marketplace.

“Before industry can really move forward, they need to fill these gaps and understand how these technologies will play in the market. This is where our national laboratories become indispensable,” she said.

Bragg-Sitton said one of the projects the Idaho National Laboratory is championing is the development of a proposed energy technology proving ground.

“This proving ground aims to scale up and integrate these different technologies’ generation and use to enhance demonstration of these future energy systems for commercial deployment,” she said.

“This proving ground will offer unique co-located capabilities that aren’t found elsewhere in the U.S., or in the world, frankly, facilitating opportunities for strategic partnerships across these various energy technologies.”

The initiative is set to begin getting underway in August, with additional systems being added over the course of the next year.

“We see this as a great opportunity to really achieve some of the bold goals that we have set out,” she said.

Bragg-Sitton concluded her remarks by saying that if the U.S. is to achieve the energy dominance the administration has identified as one of its goals, “we really need to prioritize synergistic solutions.”

“We need to get every Watt that we can out of all of these energy sources, and we also need to ensure that they move swiftly from universities and laboratories to the marketplace … so we can truly secure a powerful, resilient energy future despite these dramatic increases in demand.”

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the release.
The Paducah site was listed among more than a dozen federally-owned facilities across the U.S. being considered for AI infrastructure development in April.
“We've gotten a lot of interest in the Paducah site.
We're now, instead of one of 16 sites on DOE property [under consideration for AI facility developments], we're now one of four.","A western Kentucky site was among the four tabbed by the Department of Energy Thursday to be potential future homes of “cutting edge data center and energy generation projects.”

Plans are expected to move forward to develop artificial intelligence infrastructure and low-cost energy solutions at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant alongside “private sector partners.” The other DOE facilities slated for potential development are located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and in Idaho and South Carolina.

The DOE release said that the former Paducah uranium enrichment facility and the other three sites were chosen because they were well-suited for large-scale data centers, new power generation and other infrastructure.

This announcement comes after a slew of executive orders from President Donald Trump geared towards “unleashing American energy,” speeding up the permit process for data centers and deploying advanced nuclear technologies for national security – all with the aim of ensuring the country is leading the way in the AI and energy fields.

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the release. “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs.”

Trump also issued an executive order this week to prevent the use of “woke AI” in the federal government, something tech industry experts say could result in companies creating ""anti-woke"" versions of chatbots with fewer safeguards to land lucrative government contracts.

The Paducah site was listed among more than a dozen federally-owned facilities across the U.S. being considered for AI infrastructure development in April.

Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce president Sandra Wilson said developing industry around the former enrichment facility is a long-term goal of her organization.

“We've gotten a lot of interest in the Paducah site. We're now, instead of one of 16 sites on DOE property [under consideration for AI facility developments], we're now one of four. And you know, it's a great potential for us for reindustrialization,” she said.

Bruce Wilcox is the president and CEO of Greater Paducah Economic Development. He said that the western Kentucky city is an “optimal location” for potential projects like this.

“We have unparalleled electrical infrastructure, access to significant amounts of additional natural gas capacity, a strong fiber network, and a strong labor force with a supply chain to grow our labor force even more,” he said in a statement. “We have also designated our community as a nuclear friendly community with a unified vision to be a world leader as we work with prospective nuclear companies from the enrichment process all the way through the supply chain to power generation.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy confirmed that the next step for the Paducah site, and the others, is a Request for Proposals (RFP) process intended to solicit potential development plans from private sector partners for each of the facilities. Those solicitations are expected to be released in the coming months, with partners selected by the end of 2025.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bdc30fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1234x648+58+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F0f%2F94def7024f30b2dbcf99c2cd3ce1%2Fpaducah-plant.png,N,,2025-07-25 16:04:53.230982

Ethylene oxide has been classified as a carcinogen and chloroprene as likely carcinogenic.
The new requirements Regan adopted would cut combined emissions of more than 100 toxic chemicals, including ethylene oxide and chloroprene, by 6,200 tons per year.
Along with the push to roll back regulations, his administration hopes to spur what it calls the ""Great American Comeback.""","Trump's proclamation issued July 17 grants the two-year exemptions to Shell, BASF, Dow, Union Carbide, Denka, Sasol, Westlake and a handful of other companies in Louisiana.

The proclamation doesn't always make clear to which facilities it applies for those companies. It also doesn't apply to all 51 Louisiana operations affected by the Biden-era pollution requirements, even though some companies that didn't get exemptions in Louisiana received them in other states, including Phillips 66 and Ineos.

State regulators said they knew some companies had sought the exemptions — the Trump administration had previously sought out requests from companies in March — and have been monitoring their status.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's secretary promised to enforce the rules on companies that have not received the exemptions with no changes in how the agency oversees their operations.""

""I appreciate the administration carefully reviewing the Louisiana facilities mentioned and ensuring that companies here are following proper regulations,” DEQ Secretary Courtney Burdette said in a statement.

'Start to Live Again'

Sharon Lavigne, who runs the local community group RISE St. James, which advocated for the regulatory changes known as the HON rule, alleged the exemptions would lead to more death for people in communities in the Mississippi River industrial corridor. Lavigne had attended the ceremony in Washington to introduce the new rule.

""When we signed that HON rule, we had hope that our community would be able to start to live again,"" she said. ""Why would they take away this HON rule? It doesn't make sense for us to go backwards instead of forward.""

One Louisiana industry group said, however, that the exemptions simply offered companies time to comply without forcing shutdowns, supply disruptions and job impacts.

The rules, they said, posed difficult technical challenges and didn't offer realistic timelines to accomplish them when ""there are simply not enough contractors or equipment currently available to facilitate this nationwide manufacturing effort.""

""And while our members are making strides to meet these requirements, time is needed for facilities to implement solutions safely and effectively without jeopardizing public safety,"" said Hisa Turner, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Chemical Association.

Two national industry trade groups had asked the White House for a blanket exemption for all their members, documents show, which Trump hasn't granted. But some companies also filed their own individual exemptions, including Dow Chemical and its subsidiary Union Carbide Corp., in Texas and Louisiana.

At Dow in Plaquemine, for example, the company told the EPA that it would take up to three years to design and build new controls for small emissions of ethylene oxide from wastewater at its Glycol II unit.

In a March 31 exemption request, Dow officials said the unit makes ethylene oxide, which is used as a medical sterilizer but also an important additive in U.S. government jet fuel and aircraft deicing fluids. The company said it would have to shut the unit to meet the current deadline in the second half of 2026.

In a statement, Dow officials said the new exemptions for Dow and Union Carbide, which they termed deadline ""extensions,"" are ""appropriate and necessary to address technical challenges and to ensure the continued safe and efficient operation of these facilities.""

""Safety and integrity are at the core of both companies’ operations, and they remain dedicated to reducing ethylene oxide emissions to levels that meet or exceed federal and state regulations,"" said Glynna Mayers, a Dow spokeswoman.

Officials with Denka Performance Elastomer, which ceased operations in May due to market conditions, escalating costs and the burden of complying with new regulations, welcomed the exemption but said they were continuing their shutdown process.

""We continue to safely transition the facility to a mothball status while exploring all available options for the future of the site, including a sale of the facility,"" officials said in a statement.

Biden's then-EPA administrator, Michael Regan, had formally proposed the rules a little more than two years ago in front of the then still operating Denka complex near LaPlace.

At the time, the Biden administration was making a push to rein in pollution for fence-line communities and raise the profile of environmental justice questions that have swirled for years around those areas with a largely minority makeup.

Leading up to that effort, over the past 15 years, EPA scientists had learned that ethylene oxide and chloroprene, an emission tied to neoprene production at Denka, were far more potent than earlier understood. Ethylene oxide has been classified as a carcinogen and chloroprene as likely carcinogenic.

The new requirements Regan adopted would cut combined emissions of more than 100 toxic chemicals, including ethylene oxide and chloroprene, by 6,200 tons per year. Those changes alone were expected to reduce long-term cancer risk from toxic emissions by 96% for fence-line communities, the EPA said last year.

The rule would have also cut a different class of emissions that contribute to smog, known as volatile organic compounds, by 23,000 tons per year, generating an estimated $767 million in savings through 2038 from reduced health impacts due to short- and long-term exposure, EPA documents say.

Coming into office this year after hammering the former administration over what he called economically disruptive regulatory overreach, Trump, through his EPA head, has already made sweeping moves. He has aimed to eliminate the consideration of the environmental justice in regulatory decisions and taken steps to cut EPA's science and environmental justice arms.

Along with the push to roll back regulations, his administration hopes to spur what it calls the ""Great American Comeback.""

'Buying Enough Time'

Nicholas Bryner, an LSU environmental law professor, said Trump has the power under the Clean Air Act to issue the two-year exemptions. But arguing that the technology doesn't exist and that U.S. national security interests are implicated is a ""pretty tough standard"" to meet, he said. He said he expected the exemptions to face lawsuits.

Adam Kron, supervising senior attorney with environmental group Earthjustice, said he sees the exemptions as an interim step in eventually doing away with the regulations, pointing to similar moves related to coal-fired power plants.

""It's basically the same goal, which is, you know, buying enough time to roll back these rules, Kron said.

The Biden EPA estimated the HON rule's suite of control improvements and fence-line monitoring requirements would have cost industries $1.8 billion through 2038, regulatory filings say. The EPA argued that wouldn't pose a big impact to company bottom lines or supply chains.

The agency estimated in regulatory filings then that the changes would have boosted the cost of key products from those industries by one-tenth to one-half of a percent and caused generally minimal supply disruptions due to costs representing less than 1% of the multinationals' annual sales.","https://img.chemicalprocessing.com/files/base/ebm/chemicalprocessing/image/2025/07/6883b10e1f26168099d6f714-shutterstock_1873346806.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-07-25 18:07:43.387968

Announced during Maritime Minister Mike Kane’s visit to Clydeport in Glasgow on July 24, 2025, the funding has been described as “crucial” in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future.

Awarded from the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), successful companies will be given a share of funding to support the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies such as ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, solar and electric.

Among the recipients is GT Wings, the UK-based wind propulsion company behind AirWing, the world’s ‘first’ commercially available jet sail, which received an additional £1 million in funding through CMDC6.

Investment in green fuels is expected to revitalize coastal communities by growing local economies and boosting jobs and skills.

CMDC has provided over £136 million funding to date to 142 organisations, as part of the wider UK SHORE funding – the government’s flagship program dedicated to decarbonizing maritime – for over 300 organizations, including 250 SMEs.

Successful projects include the installation of electric chargepoint networks across ports, including at Aberdeen, the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel at Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, and the demonstration of a green hydrogen shore power system at the port of Leith.

“It’s so exciting to see investment in green fuels and technologies spurring on skills, innovation and manufacturing across the UK, delivering on our Plan for Change missions to kickstart economic growth and become a clean energy superpower,” Kane commented.

“We’ve charted a course to net zero shipping by 2050 and this £30 million will be crucial in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future, so we can clean up sea travel and trade.”

During his visit to Clydeport, the minister met with workers from the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, which is looking to help Smart Green Shipping scale up the manufacturing of the FastRig windsail going forward. Built nearby in Glasgow, the FastRig is a high-tech wing sail which can be installed onto vessels, reducing fuel use and emissions by up to 40% per annum. The project received £3.3 million from the third round of the CMDC and has now been successfully deployed at sea.

“Clean maritime is a vital part of a wider mission to decarbonise transport. Advanced manufacturing is critical to enable companies to scale up novel solutions that deliver emissions reductions and allow the creation of new jobs in these industries of the future,” Chris Courtney, CEO, National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, said.

“We’ve spent the past 2 years working on the CMDC-funded MariLight projects, led by Glasgow-based Malin Marine Consultants, part of the Malin Group, supported by industry partners, where we demonstrated how advanced manufacturing can cut lead times, lower carbon, and enable localised production in shipbuilding. It’s great to see continued momentum through the programme, and we look forward to supporting Smart Green Shipping’s journey as it scales.”

“CMDC3 support enabled SGS, a Scottish based business, to demonstrate the safety and robustness of FastRig, our Clyde built wingsails, and to build out our digital decision-making platform, FastReach,” Diane Gilpin, Smart Green Shipping (SGS), CEO, highlighted.

“Over the last 3 years SGS has invested £7.6 million in R&D, 60% of that in Scotland. We’ve drawn upon engineering design skills in adjacent sectors like renewables and oil and gas, and digital expertise created in Scotland’s vibrant tech community. We are also working alongside the National Manufacturing Institute of Scotland to design circular manufacturing solutions to reduce embedded emissions and minimise use of precious materials while creating good green jobs as part of a sustainable just transition.”

The minister also met with Peel Ports and local workers at Clydeport’s King George V Docks. Delivering £3 million of investment to support the growing demand for handling huge wind turbine components for the renewable energy sector, Clydeport is keeping Glasgow’s shipbuilding heritage and manufacturing expertise alive, equipping it to meet the modern-day needs of the sector.

“It’s fantastic to see government and industry working together to back innovation and today’s visit reinforces how Glasgow’s maritime legacy is helping to drive the UK’s clean energy future,” Jim McSporran, Port Director at Peel Ports Clydeport, stressed.

Building on its commitment to clean up shipping and deliver on the UK’s climate ambitions, UK SHORE is also delivering £3.85 million to the Clean Maritime Research Hub.

Formed from a consortium of 13 universities across the UK, dedicated to conducting scientific research in clean maritime, the funding will enable the hub to continue its important research, and support the installation of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University. The centre will develop the maritime sector’s understanding of the potential impact of liquid hydrogen – which is emission free – in the clean maritime transition.

In related news, the UK recently presented a new, major plan to decarbonize its fleet by 2050 while supporting coastal economies.

In a March 25, 2025 statement, British Maritime Minister Mike Kane unveiled the government’s new ambition pertaining to all vessels that operate in UK waters and dock at the country’s ports in which support would be provided to ensure the ships would be carbon-free and that vessel owners, operators as well as scientists could turn emission-free voyages into reality.

At the center of this plan are alternative fuels as well as the necessary infrastructure to provide charging or refueling facilities for vessels as part of the nation’s transition to sustainable energy sources.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/25143414/Screenshot_3-2.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1753446855,N,,2025-07-25 16:03:38.328280

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Data-Centers-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:07:15.173583

Tract, a prolific Denver-based data center developer, wants to build a 1.75-million-square-foot technology park/data center on part of a 253-acre property across five parcels in Randolph Township, a site that would be annexed by the city of Cannon Falls.

The city launched an environmental review of the project in January. This week, the city released a final environmental review document, known as an Alternative Urban Areawide Review, which looks at “cumulative impacts of anticipated development scenarios” in a given area.

Jon Radermacher, Cannon Falls city administrator, said state agencies still have a chance to comment on the AUAR through Aug. 5.

Next steps include an annexation deal. Most of the land for the development is currently in Randolph Township, Radermacher said, so the city is working through “an orderly annexation agreement” with the township.

In the meantime, the city of Cannon Falls is the “responsible government unit” for the project. Radermacher said the city’s comprehensive plan is “satisfactory for this type of development,” so a comp plan amendment won’t be necessary.

The AUAR reveals that construction could begin in 2026. The sale of the property is contingent on the land use approvals. Under the best-case scenario, Radermacher said, that could happen as soon as this fall.

“Their indication has been they want to start some of the construction phases as soon as they can,” Radermacher said.

Data centers were a hot topic of conversation at the legislature this year. During the 2025 special session, the legislature set up Minnesota’s “first statewide regulatory framework for data centers,” according to the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota.

Craig Johnson, a lobbyist for the League of Minnesota Cities, said people who were trying to find ways to block data centers from being built were “trying to make cities be the bad guy” and place requirements on cities that would “make us have to block them.”

In the end, Johnson said, the Legislature did not put any of those new requirements in place.

“The real big issues with these, primarily, are water use and energy use. And then ancillary to that is, where do you put them?” Johnson said.

Tract, for its part, is no stranger to the Twin Cities.

Finance & Commerce reported last September that the developer wanted to bring roughly 2.5 million square feet of cloud infrastructure space to a Farmington site that includes the Fountain Valley Golf Course and existing school district property.

Site plans for the proposed Farmington Technology Park show up to 12 data center buildings and two administrative buildings on a 342-acre site south of 220th Street and east of Chippendale Avenue.

Included in the plans are 1.6 million square feet of data center space on a “northern campus” and 933,800 square feet on a “southern campus,” according to a city staff report.

The Farmington City Council approved the project in December, but residents subsequently sued the city over worries about noise, the project’s location and other concerns, according to media reports.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Cannon-Falls-map.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 16:04:38.089119

Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board.","As North Carolina lawmakers prepare to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a controversial energy bill, constituents are receiving mailers from a dark money entity with ties to Duke Energy’s industrial and commercial customers.

Citizens for NC Jobs registered with the state as a nonprofit in January and launched a Facebook page three days after lawmakers introduced the legislation in March. The group is specifically targeting Democrats who voted with Republicans to pass the measure, likely aiming to maintain the members’ support ahead of the override vote.

Senate Bill 266 eliminates Duke Energy’s 2030 carbon emissions limits and shifts costs and risks from the company’s shareholders and industrial customers – including power-hungry data centers – to residential users. Eleven Democrats in the House and three Democrats in the state Senate broke with their party last month and joined the Republican majority to pass the controversial bill.

The measure aims to make building large-scale methane gas and nuclear plants more economically attractive for Duke Energy by forcing customers to pay for them before the plants are operational through a financing mechanism called construction work in progress or CWIP. With CWIP, customers rather than shareholders would be on the hook for repayment if a project falls through. The consequences of CWIP continue to be evident in South Carolina, where Santee Cooper customers are still paying $9 billion for an abandoned nuclear reactor project at the V.C. Summer plant, which never generated power due to delays and cost overruns. After the Summer project collapsed, four executives from a partner utility company involved in the project were criminally sentenced for fraud and lying to federal investigators.

S. 266 would also shift costs from large-load customers to residential users. Currently, Duke Energy’s residential customers in North Carolina use just over 40% of all the power the company purchases, rather than generates itself, and they pay for about 41% of the costs. An analysis by EQ Research found that under S. 266 residential customers would continue to use the same 40% of purchased power but would bear almost 49% of the costs. This cost shift to smaller-load users is being considered as a growing number of power-hungry data centers are eying North Carolina for expansion.

Another analysis released this week by BW Research found that S. 266 would also lead to a loss of over 50,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in unrealized state tax revenue due to a decline in power sector investments, and to a state energy capacity shortfall of as much as 12 gigawatts. The analysis used modeling by the North Carolina Public Staff, which advocates for customers’ interests at the state Utilities Commission.

S. 266 was introduced by former state Sen. Paul Newton, who retired from his job as Duke Energy’s North Carolina president in 2015. He claimed the bill would save the utility’s North Carolina customers $13 billion but did not release the analysis or explain how the figure was calculated. In response, a trio of North Carolina State University professors specializing in utility economics conducted their own analysis of the proposal and found it could potentially raise customers’ bills by $23 billion by 2050 due to volatility in the price of methane gas, upon which Duke Energy is becoming increasingly dependent.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed S. 266 earlier this month. He said the bill’s climate provision was “sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,” while the cost-shift section meant “families will pay more so that industry pays less.”

Legislators may vote to override the veto as early as July 29 when the Senate and House reconvene. The House passed S. 266 by a final vote of 75-36 and the Senate by a vote of 29-11. Overriding a governor’s veto requires a three-fifths supermajority of lawmakers present at the time the vote is called, so the margin needed can vary. Assuming full attendance, Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate, but House Republicans have only 71 members – one short of a supermajority.

Industrial interests tied to the mailers

Constituents of some of the Democrats who voted with Republicans on S. 266 have received mailers from an obscure nonprofit about the upcoming override vote that repeats challenged claims about cost savings to customers and asks recipients to call and thank their representative for supporting it.

The Energy and Policy Institute obtained a copy of the mailer targeting state Rep. Ray Jeffers, a Democrat who voted for S. 266. He represents parts of Durham County and Person County, where Duke Energy is among the largest employers and taxpayers.

The text on the mailer says it was paid for by Citizens for NC Jobs, a nonprofit that registered with the state in January 2025 and launched a Facebook page on March 13, three days after the legislation was initially introduced as S. 261. Newton, the former Duke Energy executive, resigned from the Senate to take another job, and the text was cut from his bill and pasted into a stripped-out S. 266 that had been introduced to speed rebuilding in the western part of the state after flooding from Hurricane Helene.

In paperwork filed with the state, Citizens for NC Jobs disclosed its registering entity as “WASLAW” and gave among its addresses that of Ward and Smith, a North Carolina law firm. Ward and Smith practice before the North Carolina Utilities Commission as counsel for two organizations representing the interests of Duke Energy’s large industrial and commercial customers: Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) and Carolina Utility Customers Association (CUCA). Susan Vick, a lobbyist for the groups, told EPI that her firm merely registered the paperwork for the nonprofit, has had no further contact, and was unaware of the mailers.

Citizens for NC Jobs’ registration paperwork also lists the exact same mailing and principal office address, down to the suite number, as the North Carolina Chamber, the state’s top business lobby. Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board. Last year, Duke’s state president Kendal Bowman co-chaired a Chamber fundraising campaign. The NC Chamber did not respond to EPI’s request for comment.

The NC Chamber has lobbied legislators to support S. 266. In an email obtained by EPI, NC Chamber lobbyist Alyssa Morrissey accused Gov. Stein’s veto statement of “cherry pick[ing]” data on the bill’s cost. In lobbying materials reviewed by EPI, the NC Chamber dismissed the N.C. State analysis as a “scare tactic” and urged a vote to override Stein’s veto. In another email obtained by EPI, Morrissey told lawmakers this week that utilities have addressed the methane gas price volatility issue, arguing that they have “various mitigation strategies” to manage it. However, an analysis conducted last year by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund showed that since 2017 methane gas has been the primary driver behind rising Duke Energy electric bills in North Carolina.",https://energyandpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ray-jeffers-mailer-uncropped.1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 15:04:56.590064

Policy shift risks $373 billion in clean energy investments

New tax credit rules could make even fewer projects eligible for incentives

Solar manufacturers concerned about demand for U.S.-made products once credits expire

(Reuters) – Singapore-based solar panel manufacturer Bila Solar is suspending plans to double capacity at its new factory in Indianapolis. Canadian rival Heliene’s plans for a solar cell facility in Minnesota are under review. Norwegian solar wafer maker NorSun is evaluating whether to move forward with a planned factory in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And two fully permitted offshore wind farms in the U.S. Northeast may never get built.

These are among the major clean energy investments now in question after Republicans agreed earlier this month to quickly end U.S. subsidies for solar and wind power as part of their budget megabill, and as the White House directed agencies to tighten the rules on who can claim the incentives that remain.

This marks a policy U-turn since President Donald Trump’s return to office that project developers, manufacturers and analysts say will slash installations of renewable energy over the coming decade, kill investment and jobs in the clean energy manufacturing sector supporting them, and worsen a looming U.S. power supply crunch as energy-hungry AI infrastructure expands.

Solar and wind installations could be 17% and 20% lower than previously forecast over the next decade because of the moves, according to research firm Wood Mackenzie, which warned that a dearth of new supplies could slow the expansion of data centers needed to support AI technology.

Energy researcher Rhodium, meanwhile, said the law puts at risk $263 billion of wind, solar, and storage facilities and $110 billion of announced manufacturing investment supporting them. It will also increase industrial energy costs by up to $11 billion in 2035, it said.

“One of the administration’s stated goals was to bring costs down, and as we demonstrated, this bill doesn’t do that,” said Ben King, a director in Rhodium’s energy and climate practice. He added the policy “is not a recipe for continued dominance of the U.S. AI industry.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has defended its moves to end support for clean energy by arguing the rapid adoption of solar and wind power has created instability in the grid and raised consumer prices – assertions that are contested by the industry and which do not bear out in renewables-heavy power grids, like Texas’ ERCOT.

Power industry representatives, however, have said all new generation projects need to be encouraged to meet rising U.S. demand, including both those driven by renewables and fossil fuels.

Consulting firm ICF projects that U.S. electricity demand will grow by 25% by 2030, driven by increased AI and cloud computing – a major challenge for the power industry after decades of stagnation. The REPEAT Project, a collaboration between Princeton University and Evolved Energy Research, projects a 2% annual increase in electricity demand.

With a restricted pipeline of renewables, tighter electricity supplies stemming from the policy shift could increase household electricity costs by $280 a year in 2035, according to the REPEAT Project.

The key provision in the new law is the accelerated phase-out of 30% tax credits for wind and solar projects: it requires projects to begin construction within a year or enter service by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits. Previously the credits were available through 2032.

Now some project developers are scrambling to get projects done while the U.S. incentives are still accessible. But even that strategy has become risky, developers said.

Days after signing the law, Trump directed the Treasury Department to review the definition of “beginning of construction.” A revision to those rules could overturn a long-standing practice giving developers four years to claim tax credits after spending just 5% of project costs. Treasury was given 45 days to draft new rules.

“With so many moving parts, financing of projects, financing of manufacturing is difficult, if not impossible,” said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene. “You are looking to see what is the next baseball bat that’s going to hit you on the head.”

ABOUT FACE

Heliene’s planned cell factory, which could cost as much as $350 million, depending on the capacity, and employ more than 600 workers, is also in limbo, Pochtaruk said in an interview earlier this month.

The company needs more clarity on both what the new law will mean for U.S. demand, and how Trump’s trade policy will impact the solar industry.

“We have a building that is anxiously waiting for us to make a decision,” Pochtaruk said.

Similarly, Mick McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar, said “a troubling level of uncertainty” has put on hold its $20 million expansion at an Indianapolis factory it opened this year that would create an additional 75 jobs.

“NorSun is still digesting the new legislation and recent executive order to determine the impact to the overall domestic solar manufacturing landscape,” said Todd Templeton, director of the company’s U.S. division that is reviewing plans for its $620 million solar wafer facility in Tulsa.

Five solar manufacturing companies – T1 Energy, Imperial Star Solar, SEG Solar, Solx and ES Foundry – said they are also concerned about the new law’s impact on future demand, but that they have not changed their investment plans.

The policy changes have also injected fresh doubt about the fate of the nation’s pipeline of offshore wind projects, which depend heavily on tax credits to bring down costs. According to Wood Mackenzie, projects that have yet to start construction or make final investment decisions are unlikely to proceed.

Two such projects, which are fully permitted, include a 300-megawatt project by developer US Wind off the coast of Maryland and Iberdrola’s 791 MW New England Wind off the coast of Massachusetts.

Neither company responded to requests for comment.

“They are effectively ready to begin construction and are now trapped in a timeline that will make it that much harder to be able to take advantage of the remaining days of the tax credits,” said Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward.

Currently, ERCOT operates almost entirely within Texas to avoid triggering FERC oversight under the Federal Power Act.
Impacts on the Texas Energy Market Should this bill pass and interconnections proceed: Grid reliability would likely improve, especially during weather emergencies, as utilities gain access to external backup supply.","If recently introduced Texas legislation (H.B. 199) passes, the state’s famously independent power grid could begin a transformation that reshapes how energy is bought, sold, and regulated across the Lone Star State.

The bill would permit ERCOT—the Electric Reliability Council of Texas—to interconnect with power grids outside of its historically isolated region. That change could mark the end of ERCOT’s long-standing exemption from federal regulation and open the door to new infrastructure, greater grid resilience, and a rebalanced energy market.

What Would Change?

Under H.B. 199, utilities in the ERCOT power region—including municipally owned and cooperative utilities—would gain the legal authority to:

Build and operate transmission infrastructure that links ERCOT with neighboring grid systems (e.g., SPP or MISO)

Purchase wholesale power from outside the state to help stabilize supply during peak demand

Synchronize their operations with external grids, removing the longstanding electrical isolation

If passed, this could mean that by the late 2020s:

Electricity could flow into Texas from other regions during winter freezes, summer heat waves, or other emergencies—alleviating blackouts like those experienced during Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Texas-generated renewable power could be exported more easily, creating new revenue streams for wind and solar developers.

The state would lose full control over how wholesale electricity markets operate, inviting oversight from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The Regulatory Future of ERCOT

By September 1, 2027, the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) would be required to identify which transmission lines are eligible for interconnection. Those utilities would then be mandated to seek the necessary federal approvals and begin physical interconnection work.

A completed interconnection—either synchronous or non-synchronous—would likely bring ERCOT under partial federal jurisdiction for the first time since its creation. Currently, ERCOT operates almost entirely within Texas to avoid triggering FERC oversight under the Federal Power Act.

If implemented, H.B. 199 would establish a formal process for applying for interconnection certificates, bypassing older requirements that prioritized public convenience and necessity.

Utilities would instead only need to prove that the interconnection does not pose a “significant and imminent risk to public health and safety”—a markedly lower bar.

Impacts on the Texas Energy Market

Should this bill pass and interconnections proceed:

Grid reliability would likely improve, especially during weather emergencies, as utilities gain access to external backup supply.

Market volatility could ease during periods of peak demand, as power could be imported instead of relying solely on in-state generation.

Clean energy development could accelerate, with improved pathways for selling surplus wind and solar power beyond Texas borders.

At the same time, energy independence advocates argue that Texas would lose a measure of its regulatory autonomy. FERC would have increased jurisdiction over wholesale transactions and transmission policies—something many Texas lawmakers have long tried to avoid.

The study was conducted by Citizens Action Coalition and “exposes how Indiana’s monopoly utilities have imposed the most severe electric bill increases on residential customers in at least two decades — with some families paying nearly $50 more a month than just one year ago.”

Using data from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the utility-focused customer advocacy group compared Tuesday, July 1 residential bills for 1,000 kWh of usage from 2024 and 2025.

“Things keeps getting worse for Hoosier consumers and our state leaders continue to allow it to happen,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the coalition. “Based on this trend, the rhetoric regarding affordability emanating from the Statehouse appears to be nothing more than lip service. Hoosier consumers can no longer afford monopoly pricing. Something must change, soon”

The statewide average increase was nearly double the prior year’s record increase of 9.3%, the analysis found.

“Indiana has been growing, and Indiana’s utilities have an obligation to keep pace with that demand and power a modern economy,” the Indiana Energy Association said in a statement.

“In recent years, our energy companies have made substantial investments in additional power generation and modernization of the state’s century-old electric grid that delivers that power. We’ve added advanced technology to the electric grid that reduces power outages and hardens the grid against severe weather. There also have been substantial investments in evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to keeping affordability top of mind, while also making the investments needed to provide reliable electricity.”

IEA is a trade association that represents Indiana’s investor-owned electric utilities and local distribution gas companies.

Here are some findings about individual utilities from the analysis:

NIPSCO residential customers were hit hardest: $50 per month, or 26.7%, increase in just one year, compounding a 17.8% hike in 2024. This follows an IURC-approved settlement opposed by CAC.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.nujournal.com/images/2016/11/28163139/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:06:59.648847

We’re all familiar with the experience of sitting in traffic.

The typical U.S. driver lost 43 hours to traffic congestion in 2024, or roughly 50 minutes per week. In the Colorado River and Roaring Fork Valleys, traffic continues to increase. From 2013 to 2023, there was a 23% increase in traffic on Highway 82 in south Glenwood. Over the same period, there was a 33% increase in traffic on I-70 west of Silt. In June 2025, south Glenwood reached a record high of average daily traffic for the month: 29,375 vehicles.

In this region, driving can seem unavoidable. Some commuters travel more than 700 miles, or 20 hours, a week. Changing the way we get around isn’t a one-fix solution, and our infrastructure is built around single occupancy vehicles as the primary mode of transit.

However, I’m curious if we can get creative about how we get around in our region. Try asking yourself, can I carpool with a coworker? Would the bus be a more efficient and safer way to get to that concert? What if I biked to the gym as a warm up activity?

This August, a new program from Clean Energy Economy for the Region (CLEER) is inviting our community to reimagine how we get around. Starting August 4, residents of, and visitors to, the Colorado River and Roaring Fork Valleys can participate in a fun, region-wide mobility challenge called Two Rivers Connect. And there’s an app for that!

In the Two Rivers Connect app you can log all the ways you get around instead of driving alone. Bike, walk, carpool, take the bus, or work remotely. When you log a trip, you will be entered to win prizes like an e-bike, lift tickets, and local gift cards. The more trips you log, the more chances you have to win.

One of the best parts of the Two Rivers Connect app is the carpooling feature. In the app, you set your start and end location, the time, if it is a regular trip or a one time trip, and whether you would prefer to be a driver or a passenger. If you would prefer to carpool with people that work at the same place as you, you can also select your employer, and only share your carpool with your coworkers.

We’re inviting local employers to get involved and encourage their teams to participate. Employers can offer small incentives, or even challenge another workplace to a friendly competition. It’s also an opportunity to support staff wellbeing and build community.

If you’re looking for inspiration for how to get around without a car, ask a middle school student. They know how to hail the Carbondale Downtowner or Ride Glenwood to get to the grocery store, use a WE-cycle bike to go to a friend’s house or hop on a Roaring Fork Transportation Authority (RFTA) bus to go skiing. If all else fails, they are good at persuading friends and adults to carpool, bike, or walk, no matter the weather.

I’ve been traveling to meetings using RFTA. It requires a little more planning, but I can use the Wi-Fi on the bus to review my presentation notes, or send up follow-up emails after the meeting.

Almost every person in the Colorado River and Roaring Fork Valleys has their own commuting successes and challenges. Join me in trying a new way to get around. You might just find a more enjoyable way to travel!

Sign up for email updates and you’ll receive a notification to download the app. Or, if you’re an employer, email me at tworiversconnect@cleanenergyeconomy.net to set up incentives and prizes for your employees.

If we all work together, we can experience more of that feeling you get when the light turns green and you’re making progress to your destination.

From 2030 to 2035, North Carolina would see nearly 50,700 fewer jobs annually and over $47.2 billion sacrificed in power-plant construction, the study says.
“This study conveys in real terms the impact of arbitrarily removing a market signal that has proven to be a job creator and an economic booster for North Carolina,” said Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.
​“This bill fails that test.” In his veto message, Stein also referenced another study, from EQ Research, showing the measure would make energy more expensive for North Carolina households.
“[SB 266] shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people,” Stein said.","A controversial bill to unravel North Carolina’s climate law would cost the state more than 50,000 jobs annually and cause tens of billions of dollars in lost investments, a new study finds. The research comes days before the Republican-controlled state legislature aims to override a veto of the measure by Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat.

First passed by the Senate in March, the wide-ranging Senate Bill 266 repeals the 2030 deadline by which utility Duke Energy must curb its climate pollution 70% compared to 2005 levels. It leaves intact a mandate that the company achieve carbon neutrality by midcentury.

Senate leader Phil Berger, a 13-term Republican from Rockingham County, has said his chamber will vote on the override Tuesday, July 29. The House, which approved the bill with bipartisan support in June, could attempt an override of Stein’s July 2 veto the same day.

Conducted by BW Research for clean energy nonprofits, the new analysis draws on earlier projections from Public Staff, the state-sanctioned customer advocate. That modeling showed that without a near-term climate goal, Duke would build about 40% less new generation capacity over the next decade — leaning harder instead on aging fossil-fueled units to meet demand.

The fresh research calculates the economic losses of foregoing those new power plants, including massive amounts of solar and wind along with 300 megawatts of new nuclear and 1,400 megawatts of combined-cycle gas plants.

From 2030 to 2035, North Carolina would see nearly 50,700 fewer jobs annually and over $47.2 billion sacrificed in power-plant construction, the study says. More than $1.4 billion in tax revenue would also be left on the table.

“This study conveys in real terms the impact of arbitrarily removing a market signal that has proven to be a job creator and an economic booster for North Carolina,” said Josh Brooks, chief of policy strategy and innovation with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association.

BW Research finds that if SB 266 became law, Duke would have 12 fewer gigawatts of capacity in 2035 to meet peaks in power demand, like those that happen on unusually cold winter mornings. Experts say the company would likely have to purchase more out-of-state power or rely more heavily on fossil fuels as a result.

“This limitation hampers the state’s ability to meet current energy needs and undermines its competitive edge in attracting energy-intensive industries,” the analysts say.

The new study is the second to show how Public Staff’s modeling belie claims from SB 266 proponents that the bill will save money and promote more power generation.

Late last month, three researchers from North Carolina State University found that with fewer solar, wind, and nuclear plants as projected by Public Staff, Duke would have to burn almost 40% more natural gas between 2030 and 2050.

Under a worst-case but plausible scenario for gas prices, the trio found, customers could pay $23 billion more in fuel costs on their electric bills by midcentury as a result. The figure would cancel out projected consumer savings from building fewer new sources of generation, a fact not lost on the governor.

“My job is to do everything in my power to lower costs and grow the economy,” Stein said in a statement when he vetoed SB 266 early this month. ​“This bill fails that test.”

In his veto message, Stein also referenced another study, from EQ Research, showing the measure would make energy more expensive for North Carolina households.

“[SB 266] shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people,” Stein said. ​“Families will pay more so that industry pays less.”

Still, the findings from independent researchers and the three NC State professors may not be enough to counter the lingering narrative that SB 266, dubbed the Power Bill Reduction Act, will help customers.

Duke Energy and major industrial groups have lined up in support of the measure — the latter falsely suggesting that solar power investments have raised electric rates.

The North Carolina Chamber, the state’s major business lobby, says the bill’s enactment would provide ​“businesses and consumers with more affordable, predictable energy costs.” The group plans to include SB 266 in its annual scorecard rating legislators’ performances.

Perhaps most daunting for clean energy advocates and other bill opponents is that several Democrats appear swayed by these arguments. While Republicans have enough members to overrule Stein in the upper chamber, they’re one vote shy in the House. With all members present, that means the 11 House Democrats who previously voted for SB 266 would need a change of heart to uphold Stein’s veto.

House Speaker Destin Hall, a Republican from Caldwell County, says that won’t happen.

“I’m disappointed in the governor’s veto of the ​‘Power Bill Reduction Act,’ which would have delivered cheap, reliable energy to North Carolina, cut the red tape that is choking innovation and long-term energy solutions, and saved consumers over $12 billion dollars,” Hall said in statement moments after Stein rejected the bill. ​“Considering the strong bipartisan support in both chambers, we anticipate overriding this veto.”

But Will Scott, Southeast climate and clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund, hopes the study will help change lawmakers’ minds.

“This shows that passing this legislation is going to have negative consequences for our ability to meet growing demand,” he said, ​“and that’s going to have knock-on economic impacts across the state.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-farm-virginia-amazon.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=75fcc70f50dde00b98b9cdc67ea14328,N,,2025-07-25 15:05:04.145233

“We are done letting fossil fuel executives write the rules while our communities pay the price,” Omar said in a statement on the proposed legislation.
Climate think tank C2ES found in an independent analysis that U.S. emissions will be 8 percent higher because of the new Trump law.","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other critics of the Trump administration’s environmental policies are renewing a push for legislation that would end energy subsidies that the critics say will “destroy the planet.”

The proposal, dubbed the End Polluter Welfare Act, is a revival of past environmental advocacy efforts from Sanders and others, but it adds in targeted responses to President Trump’s agenda-setting One Big, Beautiful Bill Act signed into law this month after passage by GOP majorities in the House and Senate.

“Donald Trump has sold out the young people of America and future generations,” Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nominations in 2016 and 2020, said in a statement Friday. “The fossil fuel industry, with the support of Trump, is more concerned about their short-term profits than the wellbeing of the planet.”

“No more polluter welfare for an industry that is making billions every year destroying the planet,” Sanders added.

The Hill reached out to the White House, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of the Interior for comment.

The latest progressive-driven proposal would cut more than $190 billion in federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry over the next decade, including $20 billion in bonuses designated for coal, oil, methane and pipeline companies through Trump’s massive tax and spending overhaul. It also would also prevent the Trump administration from opening new public lands to drilling and mining.

Other lawmakers who have signed onto the legislation include Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). It has more than 20 additional House backers.

“Fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their product harms the climate, but have made obscene profits while communities are left to clean up the mess,” Mahyar Sorour, a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club, said in a statement. “Taxpayers cannot afford to write a blank check to Big Oil and Gas companies through subsidies, corporate giveaways, and sweetheart deals.”

Republicans, under Trump’s tight control, hold majorities in the House and Senate, so it’s unlikely the legislation will gain much traction ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle. However, opponents of Trump’s shift in environmental policies argue they want to highlight potential ramifications from the administration’s efforts.

“We are done letting fossil fuel executives write the rules while our communities pay the price,” Omar said in a statement on the proposed legislation. “The End Polluter Welfare Act will finally hold polluters accountable and eliminate these harmful subsidies once and for all.”

The “big, beautiful bill” is projected to significantly ding the country’s efforts to reverse the effects of climate change and add more emissions that will exacerbate global warming.

Note: Everything I mention is a tax credit, not a rebate.","The Trump administration is prematurely halting important tax incentives for clean energy purchases. If you were thinking about reducing your fossil fuel impact and taking advantage of the tax savings, it’s time to move right now.

New electric vehicles (EVs) can generate a $7,500 tax credit. Used EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) can qualify for a $4,000 tax credit. (Check the specific qualifications online.) But these credits no longer apply for purchases after September 30. The tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June 2026.

Clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal heat pumps can still produce a 30 percent tax credit, but only for installations completed by December 31. There’s still time to get these systems in place, but you have to line up purchases and installers as soon as possible.

There’s also a program that provides credits for qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers (up to $2,000), and for efficiency improvements like insulation, doors, windows, and home energy audits (up to $1,200). But these credits disappear December 31.

If you’re serious about reducing your energy footprint, these are meaningful steps you can take today while still getting a big break on the costs.

Here is how the tax breaks have worked out for my family.

The Cars

In December, we bought a plug-in hybrid and got the $4,000 tax credit. Used vehicles have to be purchased through a dealer to get the credit, which is what we did in this case. But in January, we bought an EV that was for sale by an individual. How did we manage to get the credit? First of all, we had bought the plug-in hybrid under my name, and we were buying the EV under my wife’s name, since an individual can get only one of these vehicle tax credits every three years. We also used a reputable online dealer called KeySavvy, which handled the transaction as a kind of middleman for a trivial cost. And KeySavvy, as a dealer, was able to take the tax credit themselves, dropping our purchase price by $4,000 and eliminating the need for us to claim the credit on our tax return. It was all very professional and painless. (By the way, used cars need to be at least two model years old to qualify.)

Solar Panels

We bought some solar panels as part of a group purchase organized by local energy leader Lonnie Gamble. But prices are reasonable no matter how you get them. Then I worked extensively with a designer at SignatureSolar.com, at no cost, to spec out the other main components we needed. I got our utility company, Access Energy, to sign off on our plans, and I expect to get it all going in the next month or two, well before the deadline.

It feels wonderful to have these two electric vehicles, especially because—very soon—they will be powered by the sun, with enough juice left over for most of our other electrical needs. Being able to take advantage of the assistance that previous administrations have offered to spur the adoption of alternative energy helped make this possible for us. And it is still possible for you, but only for a short time.

Note: Everything I mention is a tax credit, not a rebate. You have to have enough taxable income to make use of the credits.",https://www.iowasource.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/chevy-bolt-2023.gif,N,,2025-07-25 18:05:31.623399

This is the first year since 2016 that dicamba has not been allowed to be used on crops, according to Nathan Donley, the environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity, a national conservation nonprofit.

Environmental groups say they will once again go to court to try to block it.

“This is an unfortunate roller coaster ride that the country has been in for about 10 years now, and it’s just incredibly sad to see our Environmental Protection Agency being hijacked by this administration and facilitating decisions that are objectively going to make our environment less healthy,"" Donley said.

The EPA said via email that it “will ensure that farmers have the tools they need to protect crops and provide a healthy and affordable food supply for our country” and the agency is “confident these products won’t cause issues for human health or the environment.”

The EPA added that the proposal will be open for public comment for 30 days and included a list of proposed guidelines on the use of the three dicamba-containing products in question.

Dicamba is a common weed killer and has been used for over 50 years in the U.S., but it has become more widespread on farms in the past decade, according to data from the EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey.

The day's top national and international news.

Researchers have been working to better understand the health risks it might pose to humans. A 2020 study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found that dicamba exposure was linked to some cancers, including liver cancer and a type of leukemia affecting the blood and bone marrow.

Dicamba can also drift far from its intended targets to kill other plants on neighboring farms and in local ecosystems, posing threats to wild flora and fauna, according to the National Wildlife Federation.

An agency can tweak a decision after a court strikes it down, and then dicamba would be approved until a new legal challenge succeeds. Past court rulings on dicamba have taken years, “leaving many farmers with questions and uncertainty in the middle of the growing season,” National Agricultural Law Center staff attorney Brigit Rollins said in a background summary of dicamba legal cases.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2022/06/GettyImages-955095570.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C0px%2C0px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-07-25 16:03:50.414606

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other critics of the Trump administration’s environmental policies are renewing a push for legislation that would end energy subsidies that the critics say will “destroy the planet.”

The proposal, dubbed the End Polluter Welfare Act, is a revival of past environmental advocacy efforts from Sanders and others, but it adds in targeted responses to President Trump’s agenda-setting One Big, Beautiful Bill Act signed into law this month after passage by GOP majorities in the House and Senate.

“Donald Trump has sold out the young people of America and future generations,” Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nominations in 2016 and 2020, said in a statement Friday. “The fossil fuel industry, with the support of Trump, is more concerned about their short-term profits than the wellbeing of the planet.”

“No more polluter welfare for an industry that is making billions every year destroying the planet,” Sanders added.

The Hill reached out to the White House, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of the Interior for comment.

The latest progressive-driven proposal would cut more than $190 billion in federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry over the next decade, including $20 billion in bonuses designated for coal, oil, methane and pipeline companies through Trump’s massive tax and spending overhaul. It also would also prevent the Trump administration from opening new public lands to drilling and mining.

Other lawmakers who have signed onto the legislation include Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). It has more than 20 additional House backers.

“Fossil fuel companies have known for decades that their product harms the climate, but have made obscene profits while communities are left to clean up the mess,” Mahyar Sorour, a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Sierra Club, said in a statement. “Taxpayers cannot afford to write a blank check to Big Oil and Gas companies through subsidies, corporate giveaways, and sweetheart deals.”

Republicans, under Trump’s tight control, hold majorities in the House and Senate, so it’s unlikely the legislation will gain much traction ahead of the 2026 midterm election cycle. However, opponents of Trump’s shift in environmental policies argue they want to highlight potential ramifications from the administration’s efforts.

“We are done letting fossil fuel executives write the rules while our communities pay the price,” Omar said in a statement on the proposed legislation. “The End Polluter Welfare Act will finally hold polluters accountable and eliminate these harmful subsidies once and for all.”

The “big, beautiful bill” is projected to significantly ding the country’s efforts to reverse the effects of climate change and add more emissions that will exacerbate global warming.

The massive package, which adds $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next decade before accounting for interest costs, exemplifies how Congress can use sweeping reconciliation bills to advance narrow interests at the expense of fiscal responsibility.

Marketed as essential for economic growth and national security, OBBBA primarily benefits wealthy individuals, established industries, and well-connected special interests. It permanently extends tax cuts for high earners, dramatically expands subsidies for already-profitable fossil fuel and agriculture industries, and pours tens of billions into new defense contracts, while slashing social safety net programs and eliminating incentives for emerging clean energy sectors.

What follows is a breakdown of the winners and losers in OBBBA. By cataloguing the bill’s specific provisions and their costs, we aim to provide taxpayers with the transparency they deserve about how their government spends their money.

The Winners

High-Income Taxpayers

Taxpayer Cost: Hundreds of billions in lost revenue from estate, income, and business tax breaks.

OBBBA delivers a suite of permanent and long-term tax advantages for high earners, expanding their ability to shield income and wealth from federal taxes. The bill doubles the federal estate tax exemption to $15 million per person ($30 million per couple), allowing ultra-wealthy families to transfer vast fortunes tax-free.

Top-bracket individual income tax cuts, first enacted in 2017, are made permanent—locking in lower rates and delivering the largest dollar benefits to the highest-income households.

For business owners and investors, the bill locks in the 20% deduction for pass-through income (Section 199A) and restores the full bonus depreciation, both of which reduce effective tax rates for those with large profits and capital reserves. Expanded eligibility for publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) and continued favorable treatment of pass-through entities further enhance tax sheltering opportunities. The cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions is temporarily raised from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029 for those earning up to $400,000—delivering targeted relief to upper-middle and high-income residents in high-tax states.

High-income taxpayers also stand to benefit indirectly from OBBBA’s industry subsidies. Massive new spending on defense, fossil fuels, and biofuels boosts the value of corporate holdings and pass-through income streams tied to these sectors—benefiting owners, investors, and shareholders.

Artificial Intelligence

Taxpayer Cost: $1.5 billion on AI development in federal agencies.

The bill provided $150 million for the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop artificial intelligence models and make them available to the scientific community on top of $1.4 billion for various DOD-related AI activities. In a possible setback to AI firms, the final bill stripped a provision from the original House draft thatwould have implemented a 10-year moratorium on state-level regulation of artificial intelligence models and systems entered into interstate commerce.

Already Highly Subsidized Farmers

Taxpayer Cost: $67 billion in increased Farm Bill spending.

The bill plants nearly $70 billion in increased spending across a variety of federal farm programs normally authorized in a Farm Bill. The biggest cost comes from increases in government guaranteed minimum crop prices for a range of row crops (such as corn, cotton, wheat, and rice) by 11% to 21%, depending on the crop. A related provision allows farmers to enroll 30 million new acres into these programs. The Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program alone is expected to result in $50 billion in additional farm income subsidies, with especially generous checks for rice, cotton, and peanut growers.

Agricultural Accountants, Lawyers, and Lobbyists

Taxpayer Cost: $2 billion+ and billions in economic inefficiency.

The Agriculture section of OBBBA will be a boon to individuals who help farm operations maximize their payouts from federal programs. Lawmakers increased the limit an individual farmer can receive annually from farm subsidy programs from $125,000 to $155,000 and set the limit to increase annually with inflation. A loophole that previously allowed farms structured as “joint ventures” or “partnerships” to treat limits on payments at each partner’s level, as opposed to the whole operation, was expanded to include all partnerships, S Corporations, and LLCs.

At the same time, the bill weakens a 40-year-old rule that prevented farm subsidies from going to operations or individuals who earn more than $900,000 in adjusted gross income annually. Now any farmer or farm operation, whether their income is $100,000 or $100,000,000, can receive farm subsidies as long as they make at least 75 percent of their income from farming, ranching, or “similar activities.” The bill leaves the definition of “similar activities” up to the Secretary of Agriculture. One should expect a wave of activity from folks lobbying to influence that definition and laying out the paperwork to restructure farms to harvest more taxpayer cash.

Shipbuilding

Taxpayer Cost: $29,016,301,000.

Much of OBBBA’s funding for shipbuilding is marked for particular capabilities that apply to contractors across the shipbuilding industrial base, such as $500 million for “advanced manufacturing techniques in the shipbuilding industrial base.” However, there are clear industry winners tied to increased funding for the procurement of specific ships.

Two prime contractors, Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works (BIW), stand to profit from the bill’s inclusion of $5.4 billion for two additional guided missile destroyers, or DDGs. The bill also includes $4.6 billion for an additional Virginia-class submarine, for which General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) is the prime contractor and HII is a major subcontractor. Bollinger Shipyards will likely cash in on the bill’s inclusion of $1.8 billion for a Landing Ship Medium, while General Dynamics NASSCO stands to gain from the bill’s $2.7 billion for T-AO oilers.

Beyond traditional Pentagon contractors, tech companies focused on emerging military technology like unmanned autonomous systems will also reap billions in contracts from this section of the bill, though precisely which companies will profit from which line items is more difficult to parse.

Golden Dome

Taxpayer Cost: $24,413,000,000.

OBBBA includes over $24 billion for various missile defense technologies that collectively represent an initial investment in President Trump’s concept of a plan for the Golden Dome. These funds will likely be divided amongst a wide range of Pentagon contractors, with a few prime contractors managing the bulk of the work.

A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report found that the cost of deploying space-based interceptors (SBIs) “designed to defeat one or two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) fired at the United States by a regional adversary, such as North Korea,” could cost up to $542 billion. While many have since characterized this as an estimate of costs for the space-based component of Golden Dome, the notion that this cost would deliver a system capable of reliably intercepting the ICBMs of a peer-level adversary like Russia or China, let alone a full-scale attack from such an adversary, is thoroughly misplaced. Physicists have pointed out that the technology to viably defend the United States against ICBMs and hypersonic missiles does not exist. But even if pouring enough resources into this effort could change that—which is far from clear—the results would be destabilizing, as adversaries would seek to improve their offensive capabilities to get around the new defenses.

Nuclear Weapons

Taxpayer Cost: $14,688,300,000.

OBBBA includes over $14 billion for nuclear weapons. As the prime contractor for both the Sentinel ICBM program, which received $2.6 billion in the bill, and the B-21 nuclear bomber, which received $4.5 billion, Northrup Grumman is likely one of the biggest winners in this tranche of funding. Northrup is also involved in sustainment contracts for Minuteman III, which received $500 million in the bill and is slated to be replaced by the Sentinel.

Aircraft

Taxpayer Cost: $8,643,680,000.

OBBBA includes over $8 billion for aircraft research and procurement. Boeing is likely one of the biggest winners, with $3.15 billion in the bill to increase production of its F-15EX aircraft and $400 million to accelerate production of the F-47, the Air Force’s sixth-generation fighter. Boeing secured its role as the prime contractor for the F-47 earlier this year. The company also stands to profit from the bill’s inclusion of $100 million to accelerate production of its MQ-25 aircraft. The bill also includes $750 million to accelerate production of the F/A-XX, the Navy’s sixth-generation fighter, which Boeing and Northrup Grumman are currently competing over.

Not to be left out, Lockheed Martin will likely profit from the bill’s inclusion of over $361 million to prevent the retirement of the F-22, and will definitely profit from $440 million to increase production of C-130J aircraft.

There’s also $600 million for the development, procurement, and integration of Air Force long-range strike aircraft, and $500 million for the development, procurement, and integration of Navy long-range strike aircraft. It’s unclear if this funding would support Northrup Grumman’s B-21, the sixth-generation fighters for the Air Force and Navy, or some other set of aircraft.

Munitions

Taxpayer Cost: $25,380,700,000.

OBBBA includes over $25 billion for munitions and supply chain resiliency. This includes over $16 billion spread out over 67 line items, as well as an additional $8.8 billion for various industrial base funds to make grants, purchase commitments, investments, and loans.

One winner is RTX, which is the prime contractor for advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles (AMRAAMs). These missiles have three line items in the bill, including $250 million for procurement, $225 million for expanding production capacity, and $50 million “for the mitigation of diminishing manufacturing sources.”

With $400 million to produce heavy-weight torpedoes, Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for MK-48 heavy-weight torpedoes, is likely a winner. Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and RTX also have contracts for the MK-48, and may benefit from this increased funding, as well as a $70 million line item for the improvement of heavyweight torpedo maintenance activities.

Oil and Natural Gas

Taxpayer Cost: Billions in lost royalties and bid revenue, delayed methane fees, and expanded tax breaks.

OBBBA delivers major wins to oil and gas producers. It makes federal leasing cheaper and easier, both onshore and offshore. Onshore, the Department of Interior (DOI) must offer at least 50% of nominated parcels at quarterly lease sales and hold a replacement sale if fewer than 75% of acres receive bids. The bill extends drilling permits from three to four years and requires DOI to approve applications to commingle production from multiple sources. It also mandates five lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska and four in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge over the next decade. The bill rolls back taxpayer protections by slashing royalty rates for new onshore leases from 16.7% to 12.5%, repealing the $5 fee for submitting expressions of interest (EOIs), and reopening noncompetitive leasing—allowing companies to sidestep bidding entirely.

Offshore, the bill requires at least 30 lease sales in the Gulf of America by 2040 and six in Alaska’s Cook Inlet by 2032. It lowers royalty rates for new offshore leases to between 12.5% and 16.7%, down from a minimum of 16.67% and a maximum of 18.75%.

OBBBA also delays implementation of the methane waste emissions fee and repeals a requirement to impose royalties on all gas produced, including gas that is flared, vented, or used onsite. These changes reduce industry costs while cutting off revenue streams for taxpayers.

On the tax side, the bill allows oil and gas companies to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) from their adjusted financial statement income when calculating their corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). While the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates this will cost $427 million over the next decade, earlier analyses pegged the price tag closer to $1 billion.

Coal

Taxpayer Cost: Reduced royalty payments and expanded leasing on public land.

The Trump Administration has long called for the return of King Coal. OBBBA furthers this effort by increasing subsidies and expanding access to federal lands for coal mining. The bill gives the DOI 90 days to: 1) publish environmental reviews and hold lease sales for currently pending applicants; 2) authorize mining on all federal coal reserves and adjacent state or private lands with previously approved mining plans; and 3) open an additional 4,000,000 acres for leasing. OBBBA lowers the federal coal royalty rate from 12.5% to just 7% for the next 10 years. Earlier drafts of the bill would have gone further, halting the implementation of new resource management plans in the Powder River Basin that significantly reduced the federal land available for coal leasing.

The bill also creates a new subsidy for metallurgical coal—used in steelmaking—by expanding eligibility for the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (45X). Under the new language, metallurgical coal qualifies as a critical mineral, making producers eligible for a 2.5% tax credit through 2029. Other critical minerals remain eligible for a 10% credit through 2030, with the credit phasing down to 0% after 2033.

The bill provides an additional boost for coal by amending the Section 1706 loan guarantee program, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to repurpose or replace existing energy infrastructure that has ceased operation, or to reduce, use, or sequester greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. OBBBA amended the language to redirect the program to support electricity supply at time intervals to “maintain or enhance grid reliability”, which is generally referring to coal and nuclear power. The IRA appropriated $5 billion through FY2026 and provided a $250 billion loan guarantee authority. OBBBA extends the deadline to FY2028 and provides an additional $1 billion for the loan guarantee program.

Timber

Taxpayer Cost: Increased harvest mandates with minimal safeguards.

OBBBA mandates the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) increase timber sale volumes from federal lands over the next decade. USFS is required to increase timber volumes by 250 million board feet and BLM by 20 million board feet every year from FY2026 to FY2034, compared to what was sold in the previous fiscal year. For USFS, which administers the bulk of federal timber sales, the additional 250 million board feet represents an 8.7% increase over the 2.9 billion board feet sold in FY2024. If met precisely, this mandate would require USFS to sell at least 37.2 billion board feet from FY2026 to FY2034. In addition, the final bill requires the USFS to enter into no fewer than 40 and the BLM no fewer than 5 timber sale contracts, with each contract lasting at least 20 years.

Nuclear

Taxpayer Cost: Over $3.2 billion in new tax preferences.

While the up to $15-per-megawatt-hour nuclear production tax credit (45U) remained largely untouched, nuclear scored a big win with a special carveout in the Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y). That carveout—especially the expanded eligibility for the 10% bonus credit—amounts to a major new subsidy for the nuclear industry.

The 45Y credit offers a 10% bonus credit for facilities located in “energy communities,” and OBBBA expanded that definition to give nuclear a further boost. The new definition includes “advanced nuclear energy communities”—areas where at least 0.17% of direct employment has been tied to an “advanced nuclear facility” since 2009. While previous statutes defined advanced nuclear as a reactor design approved after 1993, the final bill drops that cutoff for bonus eligibility, allowing nearly all nuclear facilities to qualify, since most designs date back to 1970-1990. Existing nuclear plants generally do not qualify for 45Y unless they expand operations, but if they do, they can now also claim the bonus credit.

The only limitation added to the nuclear production credit was a set of new restrictions on foreign and foreign-influenced entities—rules that apply to many credits across the bill. Earlier Senate versions would have barred credits for facilities using fuel produced in North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran after 2027 (with exceptions for contracts in effect before 2023), but that restriction was dropped from the final bill.

Additionally, OBBBA allows certain income from advanced nuclear facilities to avoid corporate-level taxation by expanding eligibility under the Publicly Traded Partnership (PTP) rules. PTPs are generally taxed as corporations, but if 90 percent or more of their gross income comes from qualifying sources—like rents, gains on real property sales, or income from natural resources—they can instead be taxed as partnerships. OBBBA adds several new qualifying income streams, including income from generating electricity at advanced nuclear facilities. This effectively allows nuclear companies and their investors to form PTPs that shield income from corporate taxes. Across all new qualifying sources, this expansion will cost taxpayers more than $3.2 billion from FY2025 to FY2034.

The nuclear industry will also benefit from the extended and expanded Section 1706 loan guarantee program, which now has $6 billion through the end of FY2028 to administer $250 billion worth of loan guarantee authority for any nuclear facility to continue or expand operations.

Biofuels

Taxpayer Cost: Expanded and overlapping tax credits for mature bioenergy industries.

The Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) for low-emission transportation fuels is the only energy tax credit expanded and extended in OBBBA. Originally created in the IRA to replace expiring biofuel incentives, 45Z offers a maximum credit of $1.00 per gallon for non-aviation fuel and $1.75 per gallon for aviation fuel (if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met). The final bill extends the credit’s expiration from the end of 2027 to the end of 2029 and lowers the lifecycle GHG assessment standards—broadening eligibility, particularly for first-generation, food-based biofuels like corn ethanol and biodiesel. However, the bill disallows credits for fuels that use feedstock grown outside the U.S., Canada, or Mexico.

One minor loser in the biofuels category: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Previously, SAF was eligible for a maximum 45Z credit of $1.75 per gallon ($0.35 without bonuses), while other fuels could claim only $1.00 per gallon ($0.20 without bonuses). So, while SAF benefits from the overall expansion and extension of the credit, under OBBBA all fuels—SAF included—are capped at the same $1.00, erasing SAF’s premium.

OBBBA also revives a previously expired credit for small producers of agri-biodiesel—including certain corn- and soy-based biodiesel—and doubles its value from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon. The megabill specifically clarifies that this small agri-biodiesel producer credit can be claimed on top of 45Z, allowing qualifying biofuel producers to double dip these credits.

Carbon Capture and Storage

Taxpayer Cost: Increased 45Q payouts and preferential tax treatment.

OBBBA increases the value of the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit (45Q) for companies that capture carbon dioxide they emit or from ambient air and use it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR)—a technique that injects carbon into depleted wells to extract more oil—and other uses. Before OBBBA, the credit amount varied based on end use, with higher rates for geological sequestration and lower rates for EOR or other uses. Under the new law, all new facilities can claim up to $85 per ton—or $180 per ton for direct air capture (DAC) facilities—regardless of how the captured carbon is used.

Like nuclear energy, carbon capture also benefits from changes to Publicly Traded Partnership (PTP) rules. OBBBA allows income from CCS-related activities—including electricity generation at qualifying CCS facilities—to avoid corporate-level taxation if structured as a PTP. To qualify, a facility must meet 45Q’s minimum capture thresholds and capture at least 50% of its total carbon output.

Hydropower

Taxpayer Cost: Additional PTP tax shelters and taxpayer-funded projects.

Hydropower also benefits from changes to the definition of “qualifying income” that allow publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) to avoid corporate-level taxation. Under OBBBA, income from producing electricity or thermal energy using a hydroelectric or non-hydroelectric dam can now flow through tax-shielding PTPs to avoid corporate taxation.

Additionally, hydropower may benefit from the $1 billion appropriated to the Bureau of Reclamation to improve existing conveyance facilities—systems used to move water, including for hydropower—and surface water storage facilities. Notably, these funds will not be subject to matching or cost sharing requirements, meaning that taxpayers will carry much of the financial risk of these projects.

The Losers

SNAP Recipients

Taxpayer Cost: $186 billion in cuts over ten years and higher state administrative costs.

OBBBA reshapes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), cutting benefits, tightening eligibility, and shifting costs to states. The federal work requirement now applies to able-bodied adults without dependents up to age 64—ten years older than before—and parents of children as young as 14 are no longer exempt. The bill also removes previous exemptions for homeless individuals, veterans, and individuals that turned 18 while in foster care (previously they were exempt until the age of 24).

Individuals may face reductions in benefits depending on how their states manage the program. The state share of administrative costs for the program is doubled, costing $26 billion. For the first time in program history states will also be required to cover up to 15 percent of the benefits paid to recipients. States with payment error rates above 6% will face new financial penalties, covering between 5% and 15% of benefit costs depending on their error rate. If states are unable to reduce their error rate – which is often the result of paperwork or processing errors – or are unwilling to cover the additional financial burden, they may reduce eligibility or even withdraw from the program.

Overall, the law reduces federal SNAP spending by $186 billion over ten years. By 2034, annual cuts are expected to exceed 24%, leading to an average benefit reduction of $18 per recipient per month starting in 2026. The total number of participants is expected to drop by 2 to 2.9 million. Vulnerable groups—including refugees, veterans, and near-retirees—will be disproportionately affected.

Medicaid Users

Taxpayer Cost: Coverage loss for 10 million Americans, reduced federal support, and higher uncompensated care costs.

OBBBA imposes sweeping changes to Medicaid that shrink enrollment and shift costs to states. For the first time, work requirements are mandatory for many adult enrollees: childless adults without disabilities aged 19–64 must log 80 hours per month of employment or “community engagement” to retain coverage. The law also ends 12-month continuous eligibility, replacing it with biannual redeterminations that increase churn and procedural disenrollments.

The bill tightens income verification rules and limits coverage for some immigrants, restricting access for mixed-status households and recent lawful entrants. At the same time, it cuts federal matching funds for Medicaid expansion and limits the use of provider taxes and supplemental payments that states have relied on to finance their programs.

These changes are projected to push 10 million people off Medicaid over the next decade. Hospitals and clinics, particularly in expansion states, anticipate major drops in insured patient volume and surges in uncompesated care. The burden will fall hardest on safety-net providers, who already operate on thin margins. Pregnant women and parents of children under 14 are exempt from work rules but still face more frequent paperwork and redetermination requirements.

Wind and Solar

Taxpayer Cost: Reduced investment in clean energy, rescinded grant funds, and early termination of credits could stall wind and solar deployment—undercutting long-term returns on federal investments and increasing reliance on more expensive energy sources.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out two key tax credits for wind and solar energy projects: the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit and the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit. These credits were originally scheduled to phase out beginning in 2033—dropping to 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035, and zero in 2036—or starting in the year after U.S. GHG emissions from electricity production fell to 25% of 2022 levels, whichever came first. Under OBBBA, wind and solar facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 must be placed in service before 2028 to qualify—effectively ending eligibility eight years earlier than previously planned. The bill terminates the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit for wind components produced and sold after 2027. The bill also repeals the special 5-year cost recovery for wind and solar energy properties—as defined under Section 48—constructed after 2024.

OBBBA doubles the rent that wind developers must pay to lease federal land by increasing the encumbrance factor from 5% to 10%. It also imposes a flat capacity fee of 3.9% on the gross proceeds from solar and wind electricity sales, with a potential 10% reduction for wind projects if at least 25% of the leased land is authorized for another use. In a modest win for developers, a last-minute change lowered the final capacity fee from 4.58%—the rate proposed in the House-passed bill and an early Senate draft.

The megabill also rescinds currently unobligated funding from grant and loan programs aimed at supporting wind and solar development. This includes funding for interregional electricity transmission studies related to offshore wind and money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund’s Solar for All Program, which offered grants for rooftop solar projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Electric Vehicles

Taxpayer Cost: Elimination of vehicle and charging tax credits, along with rescinded loan and grant funding, weakens market incentives for zero-emission vehicles—jeopardizing past taxpayer investments in clean transportation and domestic manufacturing.

OBBBA eliminates three tax credits for purchasing “clean” vehicles after September 30, 2025: the Clean Vehicle Credit (30D), which offered up to $7,500 for a new vehicle; the Used Clean Vehicle Credit (25E), which provided up to $4,000 or 30% of the sale price (whichever was less) for a previously owned vehicle; and the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit (45W), which covered the lesser of 15% of a commercial vehicle’s cost or the amount by which it exceeded the cost of a comparable “unclean” vehicle.

The megabill also terminates the tax credit for “clean” vehicle refueling properties placed in service after June 30, 2026. Originally created in 2005, the Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit (30C) applied to equipment used to recharge electric vehicles or to store or dispense “clean-burning fuel,” primarily biofuels. The IRA later limited it to projects in low-income or rural communities.

OBBBA also rescinds currently unobligated funding from grant and loan programs aimed at supporting zero-emission vehicles. This includes the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, which provided direct loans for manufacturing facilities producing advanced technology vehicles, and funding for the Clean Heavy-Duty Vehicles Program, which offered grants and rebates for zero-emission trucks and buses.

Energy Efficiency

Taxpayer Cost: Ending energy efficiency credits and pulling back related program funds forfeits future energy savings and cost reductions, shifting more burden onto taxpayers through higher energy use and infrastructure demand.

OBBBA eliminates four tax credits for activities that improve building energy efficiency:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C), which offered a 30% credit for energy efficient home improvements like exterior doors and windows;

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (25D), which provided a 30% credit for residential clean energy property like solar panels;

The Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (179D), which allowed certain deductions for energy-efficient commercial building owners; and

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L), which offered $2,500 or $5,000 credits for new homes that met specific energy efficiency standards.

The final bill went further than earlier versions in cutting support for efficiency. The Senate added—and passed—a provision to terminate the 179D deduction that had not been included in the House-passed version.

The megabill also rescinds unobligated funding from grant and loan programs designed to support energy efficiency improvements. This includes the State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grants Program, which supported workforce training for residential home energy upgrades, and the Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program, which funded the purchase and installation of advanced industrial technologies.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WinnersLosersTCSThumb2.png,N,,2025-07-25 17:05:05.265243

The soul of a nation does not die in a single act. It dies by a thousand quiet erasures — ink fading on budgets, labs emptied before the morning coffee brews, data deleted not by accident but decree. We are living through one of those erasures now, and the consequences won’t just be political. They’ll be personal. They’ll be ecological. And they’ll be deadly.

This month, the Trump administration began dismantling the Office of Research and Development (ORD) at the Environmental Protection Agency — one of the most essential and underappreciated bulwarks of public health and environmental truth in the federal government family. Gone. Not restructured, not refined — eliminated. More than 1,500 scientists and staff were handed their walking papers. America’s scientific backbone, replaced with a ghost agency whose purpose seems less to inform and more to obscure.

What did ORD do, you ask? Everything that mattered. Everything that now vanishes into bureaucratic ash.

Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and poor white communities will feel the weight of this loss first.

- Advertisement -

ORD was the compass guiding EPA’s regulatory decisions. It was the heart-pumping lifeblood that fueled our national defense against lead in water, mercury in air, microplastics in rivers, and PFAS in our bloodstreams. It studied how wildfire smoke seeps into lungs, how heat domes suffocate neighborhoods, and how chemical runoff poisons the Mississippi as it winds through forgotten towns. ORD didn’t just publish papers. It empowered frontline regulators, emergency responders, and communities to act with science in hand and justice at the forefront.

ORD’s scientists didn’t just wear lab coats. They wore grief like armor. They were the ones who mapped potential cancer clusters in Black and Brown communities, who traced asthma epidemics to diesel corridors, who showed—repeatedly, insistently, courageously—that the burden of pollution is not carried equally across our society. They exposed uncomfortable truths. And that, perhaps, is why they were erased.

Because science, real science, doesn’t flatter power. It confronts it.

And so now, the vacuum begins.

ORD at EPA — arguably the most direct line of defense between toxic industry and human life — is gone.

- Advertisement -

Many are asking the question, What will happen in the short term? The impacts are already measurable. States depend on ORD’s guidance to design effective clean air and water programs. Without it, they are flying blind. Tribal nations, already fighting for sovereignty and survival, now face the loss of vital technical assistance. Small towns navigating industrial contamination are met with silence instead of strategy. School districts seeking to protect children from lead exposure find themselves without the tools that ORD once provided. Meanwhile, chemical companies celebrate the quiet.

Long-term? The consequences are generational.

Climate models will weaken, exposure assessments will stall, and pollution will become a footnote, rather than a flashing warning. Regulations will be less grounded in fact, more rooted in lobbying. And the erosion won’t be evident at first — it rarely is. But look closer, and you’ll see it in the spikes of pediatric asthma in South Bronx, in the boil-water advisories in rural Alabama, in the cancer alleys stretching across Louisiana like bruises. You’ll see it in the death of watchdog science.

And let us be honest: the communities that will suffer most are the ones already gasping.

Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and poor white communities — those at the margins, those who’ve lived too long downwind and downstream — will feel the weight of this loss first. Because science is not just abstract knowledge. It is armor. It is leverage. It is the data you bring to court when suing a company that dumped poison in your backyard. It is the report you hand to a mayor to shut down a polluting plant. It is the study you quote when fighting for clean buses, safe soil, or breathable futures.

And now that armor is stripped.

They exposed uncomfortable truths. And that, perhaps, is why they were erased.

The Trump administration tells us this is about “efficiency.” They say ORD was “redundant.” They speak in the language of savings while the cost accumulates in our lungs, our livers, our children. Let’s not be fooled. This isn’t fiscal prudence. This is ideological warfare — a deliberate campaign to silence the science that speaks too loudly about injustice, that dares to quantify inequality, that reveals environmental racism for what it is: structural, sustained, and state-sanctioned.

We must also organize, document, and remember.

What they’ve killed is not just a federal office. It’s a covenant.

A covenant that said: We will use our best knowledge to protect you. That your health matters. That your environment is not disposable. That your breath is worth defending.

We are in the middle of a mass scientific exodus. Climate scientists at NOAA have been muzzled. Public health experts at HHS are sidelined. Wildlife biologists at Interior reassigned. And now, ORD at EPA — arguably the most direct line of defense between toxic industry and human life — is gone. Not because it failed. But because it succeeded.

Because it made too many powerful people uncomfortable.

So what now

We must mourn, yes. But we must also organize, document, and remember. Every time a child wheezes during a Code Red air day, every time a mother pulls bottled water from her EBT card, every time a farmer in the Delta sees her land poisoned — let the record show: it didn’t have to be this way. The tools existed. The science existed. The Office of Research and Development existed.

Until it didn’t.

Until politics, once again, chose profit over people.

And we, the people, must choose differently. While we still can.",https://seattlemedium.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Louisiana-Cancer-Alley.webp,N,,2025-07-25 14:07:19.631880

But then I got nailed with a parking ticket too—for using a public charging station, but apparently parking the “wrong” way, which happens to be the only way this particular car can park. Now, the City of Ferndale, Michigan, seems to care very much. And I ended up with a fight on my hands because of where the BMW i4’s charging port is located.

The City Of Ferndale V. Kevin Williams

I’ve explained this before here at InsideEVs. I may be based in Columbus, Ohio, but I pick up media-tester cars for my reviews in Detroit. The fleet companies that run this system are content to drive the cars down to me here in Ohio, but sometimes I need a break from Ohio, so I’ll drive there to get them.

It kills like three birds with one stone, since it’s a three-hour, roughly 200-mile drive that can include a range test and 10-80% DC fast-charging test, while also making the fleet company’s life a little easier, since they won’t have to send a driver down for basically half of a workday.

Everybody wins, including you, the reader. Plus, I like going to Detroit to see friends or go thrifting or just have lunch.

On this particular late March afternoon, I drove to Ferndale, Michigan, a suburb just outside of Detroit. I headed to a parking lot I know (near a sadly now-closed coffee shop) with public 9.6-kilowatt, Level 2 chargers. In this BMW i4 tester, I reckoned that by the time I had a little snack and sip of coffee, the i4 would have been topped off to 100%—perfect for the pseudo range test I’d be performing all the way home.

These parking spaces are also pull-forward only; no backing in is allowed. That presented a dilemma, however, for the i4, as its charging port is in the rear of the car. So I backed in.

I figured that most local parking enforcement wouldn’t be dumb enough to ticket a car that is using the service. After all, I’ve done this before in a Kia EV9 about four months prior, and a Fiat 500e even before that, and nothing ever happened. Also, I’ve paid for the space. I’m not parking illegally.

Welp, I was wrong. The i4 was ticketed for reversing into a pull-in only space. Also, the i4 M50 magically turned into a BMW 1M. I don’t know how they missed the open charge door and plug protruding from the rear of the car.

Parking And Ports

I don’t know who on Ferndale’s city council made these pseudo-entrapment EV chargers, because it’s not clear if the charging cable is long enough to reach the rear of every car in a pull-in situation. After all, charging ports are all over the place, and all Teslas—which are still most EVs in America—have always had their ports in the rear.

But what this meant was that I’m not the only victim, either. PlugShare has a comment from a Model 3 owner who also got a back-in ticket for charging their car.

Plugshare Ferndale

You know, the Tesla Model 3. Only the world’s second-best-selling EV, ever.

Maybe because it’s these Detroit-area urban planners only considered the mostly front-port EVs of GM and Ford, and nothing else. A Chevy Bolt or Mustang Mach-E would never have these issues, since all of those cars have charging ports on the front of the car.

I was incensed. But then, I’ll admit, part of this story is on me: I should’ve appealed the ticket right away, but kind of forgot about it. The i4 became a Nissan Ariya; the Ariya turned into a Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid. Eventually, I ended up in China (twice), the first trip about 10 days after my ticket. It all kind of fell by the wayside.

But then the ticket worked its way through the city of Ferndale, got passed to BMW North America, which technically owns this car, and then back to me. And yes, If you test cars for a living like we do, you’re still on the hook for tickets and criminal infractions. And I had passed the period in which I could appeal the ticket.

Now, I have a “You Must Pay” summons from the City of Ferndale, giving me 14 days to do so before I face a number of civil infractions, including a potential warrant for my arrest.

Ferndale Summons

All of this, for backing into a parking space that I paid for. To use a free Level 2 charger.

I was mad all over again. But, I figured I’d make things right and call the city’s courthouse and figure out why this happened, and if there was anything I could do.

Can You Fight City Hall?

The conversation started nicely. They asked me for the reference number and looked up the ticket. I tried to explain, “Hey, I backed in to use the electric vehicle charger. The car I was driving, a BMW i4, has its EV charging port located in the rear. I don’t think it’s fair that I’ve got a ticket for backing in when I need to do that to use the equipment,” I said.

“Well, you backed in, didn’t you?” replied the other person on the other end of the line at the Ferndale courthouse.

“Yes, but I can’t use the charger without —“

“But, you backed in, right?”

Sensing this wouldn’t go anywhere and that I could feel myself getting more irritated, I changed my approach. Instead, I asked if I could appeal the ticket. At first, they said yes, but I would have to come to court. When I told them I do not live in town, they said, “Oh, well, it’s on Zoom.”

Oh wow, I had the joy of looking forward to spending part of my day fighting a traffic ticket via an online video conferencing software. What a time to be alive. I’m sure a parking ticket is worth the magistrate’s time.

The Zoom court date was moot entirely, as the narrow 10-day window for disputing the charge had passed. The clerk on the other end said, “Oh, well, can’t you just have your job pay it?” (Editor’s Note: No. –PG)

Photo by: Kevin Williams/InsideEVs

Sure, the ticket is only $78. And I will readily admit that I should’ve done something about this right away, and potentially tried to appeal it in court. I don’t know what that would’ve done, but it might’ve worked.

Ultimately, it’s just the principle of the thing. These laws and rules were made either in ignorance of electric cars or in spite of them. Why install chargers, then penalize folks for using them, especially since not every make and model has the charging port in the same location? We’re seeing this now as the Tesla Supercharger network opens up to more models; charging cables just aren’t compatible with every model without odd parking jobs.

But Tesla’s a private company that’s opening up a “we’ve always done things this way” charging network to lots of other cars. City government and urban planners have to serve everyone. Why didn’t anyone consider this, unless the entire point is purely revenue collection? Is every rear-port EV going to walk away with a ticket if they try to use Ferndale’s EV chargers? How is that fair?

This doesn’t even begin to touch on the terrifying social or civil implications that could come with a bad parking job to charge a car. An arrest warrant? Really?

To me, Instances like this are this are why some EV skeptics and even EV owners get fed up with EVs. It’s hard enough finding a working, high-quality charger. With all these strange caveats can be frustrating and discouraging. Some would even insist, intentionally so.’

I reached out to the city of Ferndale for comment on its rules. Someone from ParkFerndale did reach out, and after a short e-mail go-around, I was able to get the ticket dismissed.

They explained that they have a new policy to first write a warning to drivers who back in, before going straight to ticketing. However, the representative did say that ""The provisions prohibiting backing into parking spaces are applicable to all of our off-street parking lots/facilities in Ferndale and not just EV charging locations.""

So, it seems EV drivers might be out of luck in the future. I got this ticket dismissed because I reached out for comment as a reporter; what happens to normal folks who don't have that luxury?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/L3XOg3/s1/i4-parking-ticket-slot.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:05:31.446311

“[We] probably could have a few rough quarters,” Musk stated, directly addressing concerns about the company’s near-term financial outlook. The cautionary statement comes as Tesla navigates a changing landscape for electric vehicle sales in the United States.

Impact of Expiring Federal Credits

The federal electric vehicle tax credit program, which has provided buyers with up to $7,500 in incentives for qualifying electric vehicle purchases, has been a significant driver of Tesla’s sales in the American market. As these credits approach their expiration date, Tesla faces the prospect of selling vehicles at effectively higher prices for consumers.

Industry analysts suggest the expiration of these credits could create several challenges for Tesla:

Reduced consumer demand as the effective purchase price increases

Pressure on profit margins if Tesla absorbs some costs to maintain sales volume

Increased competition from other manufacturers with newer EV models

Market Position and Competition

Tesla has dominated the electric vehicle market for years, but the company now operates in an increasingly competitive environment. Legacy automakers and new entrants have expanded their electric vehicle offerings, many of which still qualify for federal incentives under current regulations.

Without the federal credits, Tesla may need to adjust its pricing strategy or accelerate cost-cutting measures to maintain its market position. The company has previously reduced prices to stimulate demand, a strategy that has impacted its profit margins.

Financial Implications

Musk’s warning about “rough quarters” suggests Tesla is preparing investors for potential declines in revenue, profit margins, or both. The company has experienced record growth in recent years, but maintaining that trajectory without federal incentives presents a significant challenge.

Financial analysts note that Tesla’s stock price has partially reflected these concerns, with shares experiencing volatility as investors weigh the company’s long-term potential against short-term headwinds.

The expiration of federal credits comes at a time when Tesla is investing heavily in new technologies, including advanced driver assistance systems and manufacturing improvements. These investments could further pressure short-term financial results while potentially strengthening the company’s long-term position.

Tesla’s warning highlights the broader question of whether the electric vehicle market has reached sufficient maturity to thrive without government incentives, or if sales will slow across the industry as these programs expire.

As the deadline for credit expiration approaches, industry observers will be watching closely to see how Tesla and other manufacturers adapt their strategies to address changing market conditions.",https://www.selfemployed.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tesla_ev_tax_credits_1753366082.webp,N,,2025-07-25 14:04:29.577300

Published: May 26, 2025 in Nature Communications DOI: 10.1038/s41467-025-60245-y Abstract: Mass timber products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing steel and cement.
Here we investigate the global carbon and land use impacts of adopting mass timber products, focusing on cross-laminated timber as a case study.
Including emission reductions from steel, cement, and traditional wood products, the net reduction of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions will be 25.6–39.0 GtCO2e.","A new study finds that adopting cross-laminated timber as a primary construction material could have significant environmental benefits, from carbon storage to global reforestation and increased forest cover.

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is created by stacking multiple layers of timber and then adhering the layers together. This results in strong, light wooden panels up to 60 feet long, big enough to form an entire wall or other structures. These panels are also fire-resistant. When exposed to fire, the outer layer of a CLT panel turns to char, which seals the rest of the wood away and prevents it from igniting.

Because CLT is such a promising construction material, researchers wanted to determine the effects of adopting it more broadly. To do this, they combined an environmental assessment tool known as a life cycle assessment (LCA), which tracks the environmental effects of a product throughout its life cycle, with the Global Timber Model (GTM), an economic model which examines the effects of land use and policy on the global timber market. The addition of the LCA set the study apart from prior research, said Kai Lan, lead author and assistant professor in the North Carolina State University College of Natural Resources.

“The LCA tracks the environmental impact of the product from the raw material stage all the way to transportation, manufacturing, use phase and end of life,” Lan said. “We decided to combine these two tools because traditional research only examines these products at certain stages of their lifecycle, not the entire process.”

Researchers integrated data from the two tools to predict the economic and environmental impacts of a broad move toward CLT in construction globally. They found that a move to CLT would increase forest cover worldwide, as the production of CLT would necessitate larger and more intensely managed forests to supply raw timber. While a small portion of natural forest would need to be converted, the increase in managed forests and plantation land could lead to an overall increase in forest area of nearly over 30 million hectares globally by 2100.

These increases are not uniform, however. Places like the United States and western Europe would see large increases in forestland, but tropical areas near the equator would see reductions specifically in natural forests.

Economically, the GTM showed that increased demand for CLT results in an increase in timber prices, as projected forest cover increases only add around 11% to the global wood supply even in the most aggressive adoption scenario. This leads to a 26.3% increase in sawtimber prices and a 25.9% increase in pulp wood prices by 2100, compared to no CLT adoption. Sawtimber is used to make traditional wood products like plywood, lumber and wood panels, while pulp wood is used in paper products.

Increasing forest cover also carries significant benefits for carbon sequestration, as both the CLT itself and the forests needed to create it store carbon. Depending on how quickly the global market adopts CLT, researchers predict that CLT demand would increase the amount of carbon stored on land by 20.3–25.2 gigatons (carbon dioxide equivalent) by 2100. This effect is amplified by lowering demand for traditional construction materials like steel and concrete caused by an increase in CLT demand.

“When we increase usage of CLT, we decrease demand for those traditional construction materials. When you use less traditional materials, you emit less greenhouse gases while creating those materials,” Lan said. “All of these effects combine over the entire life cycle of the CLT to create the environmental benefits.”

Abstract: Mass timber products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing steel and cement. However, the increase in wood demand raises wood prices, and the environmental consequences of these market changes are unclear. Here we investigate the global carbon and land use impacts of adopting mass timber products, focusing on cross-laminated timber as a case study. Our results show that higher wood prices reduce the production of traditional wood products but expand productive forestland by 30.7–36.5 million hectares from 2020 to 2100 and lead to more intensive forest management. If the cumulative global cross-laminated timber production reaches 3.6 to 9.6 billion m3 by 2100, long-term carbon storage can increase by 20.3–25.2 GtCO2e, primarily in forests (16.1–17.7 GtCO2e) and in cross-laminated timber panels (4.1–8.1 GtCO2e). Including emission reductions from steel, cement, and traditional wood products, the net reduction of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions will be 25.6–39.0 GtCO2e.",https://news.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pexels-joao-vitor-heinrichs-862489-5022456-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:07:00.513199

In April, Perth, Australia-based Woodside Energy Group announced its $17.5 billion final investment decision for the foundation of Louisiana LNG, its new liquified natural gas (LNG) production and export facility in Calcasieu Parish. It’s the largest foreign direct investment project in Louisiana’s history.

“Our ‘all of the above’ approach to energy is working,” said Governor Jeff Landry at the project announcement. “We have four active LNG terminals in Louisiana — more than any other state. With more than 30,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, Louisiana is the place to be when it comes to LNG.”

Woodside already is a participant in Louisiana’s offshore energy industry, but this project has global implications, noted Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill: “The project benefits from access to abundant low-cost gas resources in the United States and boasts an asset lifespan of more than 40 years. It also has access to well-established interstate and intrastate gas supply networks.

“The marketing opportunities Louisiana LNG offers across the Pacific and Atlantic Basins leverages Woodside’s proven LNG marketing capabilities and complements our established position in Asia,” she added. “This will position Woodside to even better serve global customers and meet growing energy demand.”

Speaking of billions of dollars in LNG-related investment, in March LNG supplier Venture Global announced plans for a brownfield expansion at its Plaquemines LNG facility south of New Orleans. The company says the planned expansion would represent an approximately $18 billion additional investment in the state, bringing Venture Global’s total investment in current and planned U.S. projects to over $75 billion.

“Our planned expansion of Plaquemines will make it the largest LNG export facility built in North America, supplying LNG to our allies while making a substantial impact on the U.S. balance of trade,” said Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel in a company release. “In a capital-intensive commodity industry, capital will always flow to the most competitive projects, and we believe that an expansion of Plaaquemines is one of the most economically efficient opportunities available to quickly meet growing LNG demand.”

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

Speculation—never confirmed by Tesla—pegs its price at around $25,000, compared to the Model 3, the company’s cheapest car, which starts at $42,500.
Then it would show people in the US they can get a better car in Q3 for the same/better price as the cheaper car in Q4,” one user said.
The Stakes The arrival of a cheaper Tesla could be a game-changer, unlocking a vast new market of buyers who have been priced out of the EV revolution.
When asked about the new model, Musk quipped, “It’s just a Model Y.","For nearly a decade, it has been the holy grail for Tesla fans and the key to its mainstream future: a truly affordable electric car for the masses. After years of promises, delays, and speculation, the company confirmed on Wednesday that the long-awaited cheaper Tesla is finally moving from myth to reality.

In its Q2 2025 earnings release, Tesla stated, “We continue to expand our vehicle offering, including first builds of a more affordable model in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025.” This is the most concrete evidence to date that what many have dubbed the “Model 2” is in production. The confirmation sent a ripple of excitement through the market, suggesting Tesla is finally making good on a promise that dates back to Elon Musk’s original “Master Plan,” written in 2006.

The so-called ‘Model 2’ has long been rumored as a smaller, mass-market vehicle for customers priced out of Tesla’s current lineup. Speculation—never confirmed by Tesla—pegs its price at around $25,000, compared to the Model 3, the company’s cheapest car, which starts at $42,500.

However, the excitement was quickly tempered by the complex reality of Tesla’s current business challenges. During the company’s earnings call, CFO Vaibhav Taneja revealed that the rollout will be slower than initially hoped. The reason? A strategic choice to prioritize a last-minute sales blitz of its more expensive models before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expires on September 30th.

“We started the production of the lower-cost model as planned in the first half of 2025,” Taneja told analysts. “However, given our focus on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in reverse, before the EV credit expires and the additional complexity of ramping a new product, the ramp will happen next quarter slower than initially expected.”

Elon Musk provided a slightly more optimistic, if still distant, timeline, telling analysts, “We’ll be running with the more affordable models available for everyone in Q4.” He also sought to reassure investors that affordability would not come at the expense of profitability.

“The goal with those products was not to negatively impact revenue or gross margin, but just to make a car that everyone loves and wants at a more affordable price,” Musk said.

Many Tesla fans were disappointed and quickly voiced their frustration on X, Musk’s social platform. “I don’t understand why they are delaying it. Could they not initially sell it in other countries. Then it would show people in the US they can get a better car in Q3 for the same/better price as the cheaper car in Q4,” one user said.

For a long time, Tesla’s enormous market capitalization was based in part on the fact that the carmaker would produce a car that millions of people could afford. Last year, Musk suggested that Tesla had shelved its plans for an affordable model.

The Stakes

The arrival of a cheaper Tesla could be a game-changer, unlocking a vast new market of buyers who have been priced out of the EV revolution. A successful launch could help Tesla combat slowing sales and increasing competition from Chinese automakers who have flooded the market with low-cost EVs.

But major questions remain. While the company has not revealed official pricing or specifications, Musk offered a clue about the car’s identity during the call, seemingly putting an end to years of ‘Model 2’ speculation. When asked about the new model, Musk quipped, “It’s just a Model Y. Let the cat out of the bag there.”

This suggests the affordable car will be a simplified or stripped-down version of its best-selling SUV, rather than an entirely new vehicle built on a different platform. It’s a more affordable take on the company’s best-seller. “I bet it uses the same body with scaled back features,” said Gene Munster, analyst at Deep Water Management. “This is just like Apple does with the iPhone. But if it really looks just like the Y, it will cannibalize the Y. I have to think more about that trade off.”

Still, the “slower ramp” means that by the time this cheaper Model Y is available in significant numbers, the federal tax credit that could have made it even more affordable will be long gone.

For Tesla, the stakes are enormous. Delivering a successful, profitable, mass-market vehicle would fulfill a core part of its founding mission. But after years of waiting, the company must now prove it can execute on its most important promise yet, all while navigating a more challenging and competitive landscape than ever before.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/A-Blue-Tesla-at-a-Charging-Station-.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:04:28.726728

A big part of that Q2 decline has to do with Tesla, which remains the U.S.’s top EV seller but has suffered stateside and around the world thanks to CEO Elon Musk’s stint in the White House. This week, Tesla reported its profits dropped 16% in Q2 compared to the same period last year. Tesla doesn’t report its sales, but it delivered nearly 60,000 fewer vehicles in Q2 compared to a year ago.

General Motors, meanwhile, had better news to share. It sold 46,280 EVs in Q2, more than double its sales in the same period last year. That’s still a far cry from Tesla’s 380,000-plus deliveries, but it was enough to make GM the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S. And slower EV sales across the industry aren’t deterring GM CEO Mary Barra, who said the company sees EV production as its ​“North Star.”

Trump calls off loan for major transmission line

The Trump administration this week canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, putting its future in jeopardy, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

The planned transmission line, which was granted its loan guarantee under the Biden administration, is meant to bring wind and solar power generated in the Great Plains to cities further east. It has been in the works for more than a decade, and construction on its first phase was slated to start next year.

While the Grain Belt Express had support from utility regulators and large electricity consumers along the line’s route, Missouri Republicans turned against it in recent weeks. The state’s Republican attorney general launched an investigation into the project earlier this month, and Sen. Josh Hawley said he made a direct appeal to President Trump to pull back federal support.

The U.S. EPA is planning to demolish the bedrock of many of its climate change-fighting regulations, The New York Times reports. The agency is reportedly preparing a rule that would rescind the 2009 ​“endangerment finding,” which scientifically established that greenhouse gases harm human health. That finding underpins many of the EPA’s landmark emissions rules, including regulations targeting pollution from cars, factories, and power plants. If the finding is revoked, it would immediately end all those limits and make it harder for future presidential administrations to reinstate them.

The draft of the rule change doesn’t dispute that climate pollutants like carbon dioxide and methane drive global warming or put people’s health at risk, according to the Times. Instead, it claims the endangerment finding oversteps the EPA’s authority. The new rule is almost certain to face legal challenges if it’s finalized.

The legislation permanently extends the 20% §199A Qualified Business Income deduction and preserves most individual tax rates established under the TCJA.
It increases the §48D advanced manufacturing investment credit from 25% to 35% for qualified property placed in service after December 31, 2025.
In addition, the Act made significant changes to §45X, known as the advanced manufacturing production credit.
The §45X tax credit is available to manufacturers of certain clean energy components, e.g., certain battery cells, critical minerals, or inverters.","On July 3, 2025, Congress passed House Resolution 1 (the Act) following a narrow 218-to-214 House vote. As industries across the country assess the implications of this sweeping legislation, the manufacturing sector emerges as one of most impacted industries.

The Act preserves the 21% corporate tax rate, providing continued certainty for business planning and investment. More notably, it delivers meaningful enhancements to capital expenditure investments. The legislation permanently extends 100% bonus depreciation, providing a full first-year deduction for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025. It also introduces a new temporary provision allowing for 100% depreciation for certain nonresidential real property used in domestic manufacturing, production, or refining of tangible personal property through 2030. The original use of the property must generally commence with the taxpayer. If original use did not commence with the taxpayer, the property must not have been used in a qualifying production activity between January 1, 2021 and May 12, 2025 to qualify for this new provision.

Significant improvements were made to Section 179 expense; the maximum deduction increases from $1 million to $2.5 million for property placed in service after December 31, 2024, reduced by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property exceeds $4 million (previously $2.5 million).

The Act reinstates full expense of domestic research and experimental (R&E) costs for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, reversing prior changes that required capitalization and amortization. Taxpayers may elect to take a deduction for the unamortized balance of domestic R&E costs previously capitalized. The deduction may be recognized in full in the first tax year beginning after December 31, 2024, or may be recognized ratably over a two-year period starting with the first tax year beginning after December 31, 2024. In addition, taxpayers who qualify as a small business may have the option of filing amended tax returns to claim deductions for their previously capitalized domestic R&E costs in the tax year they were incurred. As was required prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), the Act will now generally require taxpayers to reduce their deductions by the amount of research and development credit claimed unless the election to reduce the credit amount is made by the taxpayer, in accordance with Code §280C.

Adjustments were made to the business interest expense limitations under §163(j) to raise the threshold from 30% of tax basis earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to 30% of tax basis earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), offering broader deductibility for capital-intensive manufacturers.

The legislation permanently extends the 20% §199A Qualified Business Income deduction and preserves most individual tax rates established under the TCJA.

For multi-generational manufacturers, the Act raises and makes TCJA’s estate tax exemption permanent, excluding more taxpayers from the impact of the estate tax.

The Act makes adjustments to international tax provisions, including what was previously known as foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) (now called foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI)) and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) (now called net CFC tested income (NCTI)). For more on international tax changes in the Act, see our FORsights™ article, “International Tax Rebranded: Key Items in the Reconciliation Bill.”

Finally, the Act also made sweeping changes to clean energy tax credits. It increases the §48D advanced manufacturing investment credit from 25% to 35% for qualified property placed in service after December 31, 2025. In addition, the Act made significant changes to §45X, known as the advanced manufacturing production credit. The §45X tax credit is available to manufacturers of certain clean energy components, e.g., certain battery cells, critical minerals, or inverters. Metallurgical coal was added to the list of critical minerals eligible under §45X and will be available for metallurgical coal produced in 2026 through 2029. The Act eliminates the 45X credit for wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Together, the Act broadly impacts those participating in and making investments in American manufacturing.",https://www.forvismazars.us/getmedia/b6dc08bd-10e3-45bd-837a-2959193d690d/941796726-landscape-large.jpg?width=1920&height=1080&ext=.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:07:12.298117

Richardson",,,,,https://tylerpaper.com/2025/07/25/east-texas-residents-sue-area-plant-alleging-it-disregarded-dangers-of-cancer-causing-emissions/,"A lawsuit has been filed in Marshall’s federal court against Eastman Chemical Co., alleging the company’s Longview-area plant has knowingly exposed residents to dangerous cancer-causing emissions.
“Eastman’s self-reported EtO emissions from the industrial plant show Eastman has emitted high levels of EtO for decades.
While most of these EtO emissions are from controlled sources, approximately half of these emissions are ‘fugitive emissions’ that have escaped, and continue to escape, the industrial plant,” the lawsuit states.
“As a result of exposure to the EtO Eastman emitted, Mrs. Ferguson was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017.
“Plaintiffs’ cancer diagnoses are an injury that the statutes were designed to prevent by limiting individual’s exposure to pollutants.","A lawsuit has been filed in Marshall’s federal court against Eastman Chemical Co., alleging the company’s Longview-area plant has knowingly exposed residents to dangerous cancer-causing emissions.

The lawsuit was filed by plaintiffs Linda Dorsey, Doyle Dorsey, Jo Lee Ferguson, Kathryn McKinney, Raegan Muse, and Robert David Muse, Jr., who either live or work near the plant just outside Longview. Ferguson, McKinney, Linda Dorsey and Raegan Muse are breast cancer survivors.

The lawsuit claims Eastman has ignored the dangers of ethylene oxide – an odorless, colorless and carcinogenic gas released at the facility as part of its production process.

“Plaintiffs are innocent bystanders who lived, worked, and frequented businesses in close proximity to the industrial plant for years and were regularly exposed to EtO in the air they breathed each day,” the lawsuit states. “Although EtO has been classified as a human carcinogen for decades, Eastman disregarded EtO’s harmful properties and continued, and continues, to release EtO into the surrounding community — entirely unbeknownst to area residents and workers.”

Eastman received an extension until Sept. 4 to file a response to the lawsuit.

The company’s Longview-area plant is one of 12 ethylene oxide production facilities in the U.S. The facility released 155,483 pounds of ethylene oxide between 2008 and 2018, making it the fourth-largest emitter in the country, according to Air Alliance Houston, a clean air advocacy group.

The plaintiffs cite Eastman’s self-reported EtO emissions to support their claims.

“Eastman’s self-reported EtO emissions from the industrial plant show Eastman has emitted high levels of EtO for decades. While most of these EtO emissions are from controlled sources, approximately half of these emissions are ‘fugitive emissions’ that have escaped, and continue to escape, the industrial plant,” the lawsuit states. “As a result, and unbeknownst to them, individuals living and working near the industrial plant face some of the highest cancer risks in the United States. These individuals, including plaintiffs, have been unknowingly inhaling EtO on a routine and continuous basis for decades.”

According to the lawsuit, although the plant self-reported that it released more than 565,000 pounds of EtO into the Longview-area community from 1987 to 2022, that doesn’t tell the entire story.

“According to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s database, there have been numerous emission events in which the industrial plant released unauthorized EtO into the surrounding community,” the lawsuit states. “On December 10, 2003, Eastman reported pump rupture that led to an ‘estimated’ 300 pounds of EtO emitted; on October 4, 2006, Eastman reported a leak that led to 160 pounds of EtO emitted, again, based on ‘engineering best estimates’. Through just these few examples of reported emission events, Eastman has released more than 30,000 pounds of EtO in excess of its otherwise reported emissions.”

The plaintiffs allege the emissions have caused grave health concerns for workers and residents who live, work and attend school in the communities surrounding the plant.

According to research by global health organizations, adverse health effects identified from EtO exposure include various cancers, such as blood, lymphoid and breast cancers, the lawsuit states.

“In 1977, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (‘NIOSH’) raised concerns that EtO may be a carcinogen and concluded that occupational exposure to EtO may increase the frequency of genetic mutations in humans,” the lawsuit states. “In 1981, NIOSH released a subsequent report and recommended that EtO be regarded as a potential occupational carcinogen. NIOSH based its recommendation on additional evidence of EtO’s carcinogenic, mutagenic, and reproductive hazards and studies showing an increased cancer risk.”

Additionally, plaintiffs noted the 1990 revision of the U.S. Clean Air Act included EtO as a hazardous air pollutant. Moreover, the International Agency for Research on Cancer along with the federal Department of Health and Human Service’s national toxicology program all recognized EtO as a known human carcinogen, the lawsuit states.

“The EPA has determined that EtO is carcinogenic to humans by the inhalation route of exposure,” according to the lawsuit. “Human exposure to EtO through inhalation significantly increases the risk of developing various forms of cancers, including breast cancer and cancers of the blood, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoid.”

To further support lawsuit claims, the plaintiffs pointed to a 2023 order Eastman entered into with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality because of a failure to prevent unauthorized emissions.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit also said EPA’s compliance database shows, in the past five years, the Longview-area plant has had 12 fiscal quarters with “significant violations” of the Clean Air Act, and its compliance status with the EPA is listed as “high priority violation.”

Dorsey, who lived near the plant from 1973 to 2005, during the time Eastman reported it emitted more than 370,000 pounds of EtO, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017.

Ferguson, who has lived near the plant for more than 30 years, noted she was exposed to the chemical during the period Eastman reported it emitted more than 400,000 pounds of EtO.

“As a result of exposure to the EtO Eastman emitted, Mrs. Ferguson was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017. Mrs. Ferguson’s cancer returned as stage 4, metastatic, inoperable breast cancer in 2020,” the lawsuit states.

McKinney lived near the plant for 10 years from 2008 to 2018 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018. During that time period, Eastman reported it emitted more than 137,000 pounds of EtO.

Muse lived near the plant for more than two decades, and during that time, Eastman reported emitting more than 260,000 pounds of EtO. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and had a recurrence in 2022.

“Plaintiffs consistently, and without any knowledge, inhaled toxic levels of EtO in and around their homes, their places of work, and in Longview generally,” the lawsuit states. “At the time of their diagnoses, plaintiffs were neither on notice nor aware that they had been inhaling toxic levels of EtO for years.”

Plaintiffs allege Eastman was negligent in its actions.

“Eastman had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation of the industrial plant, including testing of EtO emissions, mitigation of EtO emissions, manufacture and use of EtO, and emission of EtO, including a duty to ensure that its manufacture of EtO would not cause those exposed to it to suffer unreasonably dangerous side effects,” the lawsuit states. “Eastman failed to exercise reasonable care in the testing of EtO emissions, mitigation of EtO emissions, manufacture and use of EtO, and emissions of EtO in that Eastman knew or should have known that its EtO emissions would result in exposures to EtO by innocent bystanders, resulting in a high risk of unreasonably dangerous side effects, including, but not limited to, cancer.”

In addition to emitting dangerous and/or excessive amounts of EtO from the industrial plant, the lawsuit alleges Eastman’s plant also was negligent by failing to adopt, implement and/or enforce reasonable and sufficient measures to mitigate and/or reduce emissions of EtO from the industrial plant to potentially non-harmful levels; failing to adequately track, record, and/or monitor the amounts or levels of emissions of EtO; failing to adequately track, record, and/or monitor the amount of EtO present in the air surrounding the industrial plant; failing to adequately, accurately, and thoroughly report the levels of EtO being emitted from the Industrial plant; failing to select and utilize safer, alternative methods to produce EtO at the industrial plant; and allegedly concealing from the public the nature and extent of EtO emissions from the industrial plant.

The lawsuit further claims that Eastman failed to warn people who live and work in the surrounding community of the EtO exposure.

“Eastman knew or should have known members of the public, including plaintiffs, would foreseeably suffer injury as a result of Eastman’s failure to exercise reasonable care,” the lawsuit states. “As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned negligence, plaintiffs suffered injuries that are permanent and lasting in nature, including physical disability, mental anguish, diminished enjoyment of life, and loss of income, as well as financial expenses for hospitalization and medical care.

“Eastman had a duty to maintain the purity of the air resources consistent with protecting health, general welfare, and physical property of the people,” the plaintiffs contend. “Plaintiffs’ cancer diagnoses are an injury that the statutes were designed to prevent by limiting individual’s exposure to pollutants. As a proximate result of the wrongful and tortious acts of Eastman as alleged herein, each plaintiff’s health was adversely impacted by the devastating effects of cancer and its corresponding treatment. Eastman’s wrongful conduct as alleged herein was the proximate cause of plaintiffs’ damages and has caused plaintiffs to incur damages in an amount to be proven at trial.”

The plaintiffs are seeking a judgment awarding restitution and/or other equitable relief, including, without limitation, restitutionary disgorgement of all profits and unjust enrichment that defendant obtained from plaintiffs as a result of the unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business practices.

Plaintiffs are also seeking a judgment awarding damages under common law and/or by statute, and punitive damages; compensatory damages; general damages; actual loss of earnings; punitive damages in an amount sufficient to punish Eastman and deter future similar wrongdoing; and a judgment awarding plaintiffs their costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees as permitted by statute or law, and pre- and post-judgment interest.",https://tylerpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/07/07242025_mnm_news_Eastmanlawsuit.webp,N,,2025-07-25 18:06:50.444274

The OBBBA is a sweeping tax and spending law with significant environmental implications, including the rescission of funding for certain environmental programs allocated by the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA), postponement of implementation of certain environmental programs created by the IRA and creation of new environmental programs intended to expedite environmental reviews. This Alert highlights the key environmental changes in the OBBBA and should be read in conjunction with our tax team’s Alert on the OBBBA.

Modification/Rescission of Funding for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Programs

The IRA, discussed in our August 2022 Alert, established both new and supplemental environmental programs intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with associated allocated funding mechanisms. The OBBBA modifies and rescinds funding for certain of these programs with unobligated balances, including the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (the GGRF), and the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act (the AIM Act), among others.

MERP: The MERP was established to provide financial incentives and disincentives to encourage the reporting of greenhouse gases, the monitoring of methane, and the reduction of methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) previously received over $1.5 billion in funding in the IRA for the MERP. Earlier this year, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to rescind EPA’s rule implementing the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC), a per-ton fee on methane emissions above a specified threshold. The OBBBA rescinded unobligated funds from the MERP and postponed EPA’s imposition of the program’s WEC to calendar year 2034.

GGRF: The GGRF established funds to finance clean energy projects, support clean energy technology deployment in disadvantaged and low-income communities, and fund residential solar projects. The IRA previously appropriated $27 billion in funding for the GGRF. The OBBBA rescinded all unobligated funds allocated to the GGRF.

Air Pollution Monitoring and Control: The OBBBA also rescinded unobligated portions of the IRA that provided funding to address air pollution, including sections of the IRA that allocated:

$117.5 million for deployment, integration, support and maintenance of fenceline air monitoring, screening air monitoring, national air toxics trend stations, and other air toxics and community monitoring;

$50 million for expansion of the national ambient air quality monitoring network with new multipollutant monitoring stations and replacement, repair, operations and maintenance of existing monitors;

$37 million for certain air emissions monitoring and emissions source testing activities;

$25 million for grants and other activities authorized under subsections (a) through (c) of Section 103 and Section 105 of the Clean Air Act;

$5 million for providing grants to states to adopt and implement greenhouse gas and zero-emission standards for mobile sources; and

$5 billion for development and implementation of grants ($250 million) and plans ($4.75 billion) to reduce greenhouse gas air pollution.

Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) Program: The RFS is a federal program that requires a certain volume of renewable fuel be used to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil fuel in transportation fuel, home heating oil or jet fuel. The IRA allocated $5 million to EPA for the evaluation of the environmental and public health effects of fuel or fuel additives and analysis of the impacts of transportation fuels. In addition, the IRA had appropriated $10 million to EPA for grantmaking and other activities to support investment in advanced biofuels. Unobligated funds for these initiatives were rescinded in the OBBBA.

The AIM Act: The AIM Act directs EPA to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). HFCs are commonly used in applications such as air conditioning, refrigeration, fire suppression and aerosols. The IRA appropriated $20 million to EPA for monitoring, managing, and phasing out HFC production and consumption. Additionally, the law had previously appropriated $15 million to EPA for grants for technologies that reclaim and destroy HFCs and $3.5 million to deploy new implementation and compliance tools. The OBBBA rescinded unobligated balances appropriated under the IRA to implement the AIM Act, including funding for competitive grants created by this legislation.

Climate Commitments: The IRA allocated $5 million to EPA to support enhanced standardization and transparency of, and progress toward, meeting corporate climate action. The OBBBA rescinded unobligated IRA funds allocated to EPA for (1) enhancing standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2) enhancing transparency regarding progress toward meeting such commitments and implementing such plans; and (3) progressing toward meeting such commitments and implementing such plans.

Environmental Justice Programs: The IRA appropriated $2.8 billion to EPA to award grants to community-based nonprofit organizations and an additional $200 million to provide technical assistance to entities receiving grants. The OBBBA rescinded unobligated funding for environmental and climate justice block grants allocated to disadvantaged communities. The OBBBA also rescinded funding for certain transportation-related environmental matters, including unobligated funding for grants, rebates and loans to help identify and reduce diesel emissions from goods movement facilities and associated vehicles in low-income and disadvantaged communities, and unobligated funds. $60 million was previously allocated for certain grants and activities to monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants at schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Rescission of Funding for Environmental Reviews and Recovery Plans

The IRA allocated funds to federal environmental agencies for increasing the efficiency of the federal environmental review and approval process and to further study and monitor the impacts of climate change. The OBBBA rescinded funds for certain of these programs.

EPA Reviews Generally: The OBBBA rescinds unobligated funding allocated in the IRA for the development of efficient, accurate and timely EPA reviews in permitting and approval processes. The IRA allocated $40 million to hire and train personnel, develop programmatic documents, procure technical or scientific services for reviews, develop environmental data or information systems, stakeholder and community engagement, purchase new equipment for environmental analysis, and develop geographic information systems and other analysis tools, techniques and guidance.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Reviews: The OBBBA rescinds unobligated funds of the $32.5 million that IRA provisions allocated to support data collection efforts by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) relating to: (1) disproportionate negative environmental harms and climate impacts; (2) cumulative impacts of pollution and temperature rise; (3) to establish, expand and maintain efforts to track disproportionate burdens and cumulative impacts; and (4) to support efforts to ensure that any mapping or screening tool is accessible to community-based organizations and community members.

Endangered Species Act (ESA) Recovery Plans: The IRA allocated $125 million funds to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop and implement recovery plans under paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) of subsection (f) of Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act, which are conservation programs for threatened and endangered species. The OBBBA rescinds unobligated funds allocated to these recovery plans.

Opt-in Fee Programs to Expedite Environmental Review and Permitting

NEPA: The OBBBA creates a new process under NEPA that gives project sponsors the option to pay a fee to guarantee that a NEPA review will be completed by a set deadline. If the fee is paid, the environmental assessment (EA) must be completed no later than 180 days after the fee payment date and an environmental impact statement (EIS) will be completed no later than one year after the date of publication of the notice of intent to prepare the environmental impact statement. The fee amount is 125% of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement or 125% of the anticipated costs to supervise preparation of the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement if it is being prepared by a project sponsor. These changes are expected to accelerate and streamline NEPA review by expediting timelines for the completion of EAs and EISs. An earlier version of the bill included a provision that would have allowed developers to pay a fee to bypass judicial review — however, that provision was ultimately removed in the final version of the legislation. Moreover, this change follows a series of other significant updates to NEPA including: (1) the D.C. Circuit decision in Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration and Iowa v. Council on Environmental Quality (2024), which held that the CEQ lacked authority to issue binding regulations to implement NEPA; (2) Executive Order 14154, which directed CEQ to provide guidance on NEPA implementation and propose rescinding regulations; (3) CEQ’s final rule rescinding its NEPA regulations, which became effective in April 2025; and (4) the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 2025 decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, which effectively limited the scope of NEPA reviews to the direct impacts of a proposed action.

Looking Ahead

Key environmental changes in the OBBBA include rescinding funding of many environmental programs created by the IRA, which will likely result in the discontinuation of offices and departments within EPA and other federal agencies intended to administer those programs. Additionally, the OBBBA’s changes will require federal agencies to issue new rules and guidance regarding environmental programs, including the opt-in fee program created for NEPA.

Looking beyond the OBBBA, on July 22, 2025, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The bill will now need to be debated and approved by both houses of Congress. The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill includes a 23% funding reduction ($2.1 billion) for EPA. If passed, the House’s appropriations bill would significantly reduce funding for EPA’s operations and prohibit EPA from using appropriated funds to enforce or implement certain environmental regulations, including certain regulations under the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and certain hazardous waste and pesticide laws. For example, the bill prohibits EPA from using allocated funds to impose the methane fee on oil and gas producers, enforce the Biden EPA’s final Good Neighbor Plan for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards, and advance a Biden-era draft risk assessment of two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in biosolids.

The DOE’s latest announcement aims to intersect future AI demand with electricity resource adequacy includes the selection of four sites within which to create collaborations. Those sites are on lands including the Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky and Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

Leadership at all four federal locations will work with DOE to seek to partner with private sector counterparts on developing AI-enabled data computing centers and power generation projects. President Trump outlined such a plan in his recent executive orders on accelerating federal permitting of data center infrastructure, nuclear reactor technologies and encouraging broader deployment of baseload energy resources such as natural gas and nuclear.

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” said Chris Wright, Secretary of Energy, referring the collaboration which developed the first atomic bomb during World War II. “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs.”

Trump is not alone in his declarations that the U.S. cannot afford to lose an AI technology race to China, as such sentiments have echoed by numerous business and political leaders. In the meantime, meeting the demand load from future AI facilities could require more than 125 GW of new electricity capacity nationwide.

Behind-the-meter power is a key solution to ensuring ""America's AI dominance,"" Toby Neugebauer, private equity investor and co-founder of energy startup Fermi America, said during his company's announcement to build co-located power with data center capacity in the Texas Panhandle. ""Without it, we're handing China the keys to AI. There will only be one winner.""

Earlier this month, the DOE announced it was pushing ahead with a new pilot program to accelerate development of advanced nuclear power generation such as small modular reactors. The Trump Administration also wants to tighten supply chains for critical elements such as uranium to fuel nuclear reactors.

The push to energize growing AI capacity has united leading firms on both sides of the data center and energy sectors. The collaborations across the spectrum include projects by PPL, Blackstone, Chevron, Google, Microsoft, Constellation, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, Oracle, GE Vernova, Meta, Caterpillar, Equinix, Bloom Energy, SB Energy and EdgeConneX, among others.

Par Pacific, Mitsubishi, Eneos Form Renewable Fuels JVs in Hawaii

Par Pacific, Mitsubishi and Eneos have formed a joint venture company called Hawaii Renewables to produce renewable fuels in Kapolei, Hawaii, according to a July 22 news release.

Construction is already underway for the facility at Par’s refinery and is expected to be complete by year-end. The facility will produce about 61 MMgal/d of renewable diesel, SAF, renewable naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases, making it the state’s largest renewable fuels manufacturing facility. Up to 60% of the production will be SAF.

“This strategic partnership will combine Par Pacific’s advantaged West Coast and Pacific asset base and operational capabilities with Mitsubishi’s global integrated business, including access to Mitsubishi’s Petro-Diamond Inc. Terminal in Long Beach, California, and global feedstock procurement expertise,” the companies said in a news release. “As Japan’s leading energy company, ENEOS will strengthen the partnership by leveraging its historical success in fuel refining and trading across Asia-Pacific and North America.”

Mitsubishi and Eneos will form a joint venture company called Alohi Renewable Energy and acquire a 36.5% stake in Hawaii Renewables for $100 million, according to the release. Par Pacific will hold the remaining interest in Hawaii Renewables.

Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

Finland’s Neste Tops Earnings Forecast on Soaring SAF Sales

(Reuters) Finnish biofuel maker and oil refiner Neste reported stronger-than-expected core earnings for the second quarter, driven by soaring sales of SAF.

Neste’s comparable quarterly EBITDA rose 42% from a year earlier to 341 million euros (US$401 million).

Analysts had expected 302.5 million euros on average in a company-provided consensus.

“Our sustainable aviation fuel sales increased close to 80% quarter-on-quarter, benefiting from additional SAF production capacity at our renewables refinery in Rotterdam,” CEO Heikki Malinen said in a statement.

The rise in SAF sales drove the sales volume in Neste’s renewable products unit to a new quarterly record of 1,096 thousand tonnes. The unit’s sales volume margin fell 5% to $361/tonne but exceeded analysts’ forecast of $329/tonne.

“We saw positive developments in the biofuel regulation both in the U.S. and EU, largely supporting long-term renewables demand,” said Malinen, who joined the company last year.

RBC analysts said in a research note that the second quarter was a “key litmus test” for Neste’s new management, adding the results boded well for investor sentiment.

However, Malinen warned that the market environment was volatile and headwinds from global trade tensions were expected to continue.

Rio Tinto, Chilean Miner ENAMI Form JV for $3B Lithium Project

Chile’s state-owned Empresa Nacional de Minería (ENAMI) has partnered with metals and mining company Rio Tinto to develop the Salares Altoandinos lithium project in Chile’s Atacama region.

The two companies on July 23 said they signed the binding agreement to form the joint venture. The move followed Rio Tinto’s selection as the preferred partner for the project earlier this year and its move to acquire a 51% controlling interest in the project. Rio Tinto said it will also provide its direct lithium extraction technology and up to $425 million for pre-feasibility and other studies.

“The Salares Altoandinos project represents a significant opportunity to develop a large-scale, long-life, low-cost lithium brine resource,” said Rio Tinto Minerals CEO Sinead Kaufmann. “We are committed to the highest environmental standards and to ensuring any potential development is guided by transparent, respectful and ongoing engagement with local communities in Chile’s Atacama region.”

Pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026, Rio Tinto said.

Together, the companies could invest up to $3 billion in the project, according to ENAMI. Operations are expected to begin in 2032.

Salares Altoandinos is estimated to hold more than 15 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent, based on the state-owned company’s estimates.

Geothermal

Quaise Hits Drilling Depth Milestone with Millimeter Wave Technology

Geothermal driller Quaise Energy said on July 22 it had successfully drilled to a depth of 100 m through granite using its proprietary millimeter wave technology in Central Texas.

The drilling technology uses a gyrotron to melt rock without the use of downhole hardware, giving access to superhot rock of around 400 C. Quaise said the superhot rock enables geothermal plants to generate more energy than traditional geothermal.

“The Earth holds an enormous reservoir of clean energy—energy that could fundamentally change how we power our world if we can reach it,” said Quaise Energy CEO Carlos Araque. “Quaise has now demonstrated that millimeter wave technology can do what no other technology can do: drill perfectly clean holes through some of the hardest rocks on Earth in record time. This milestone brings us closer to making geothermal energy a practical solution to power communities virtually anywhere.”

Quaise Takes Geothermal Tech Deeper, Hotter in Texas Hill Country

The milestone was the first demonstration of the technology in a field outside the laboratory. While Quaise said the 100 m depth is a fraction of that required for its first power plants, granite drilled in the field test is the same type of hard rock blanketing the basement layer of the Earth’s crust. “Drilling efficiently through the basement layer is the only way to unlock superhot geothermal worldwide,” the company said.

Next steps include using a gyrotron that packs 10 times as much power than the one used in Central Texas.

Quaise has its sight set on 2028 for completion of a pilot power plant in the western U.S.

Hydrogen

CPS Energy to Pilot Modern Hydrogen Methane Pyrolysis Technology

Municipal utility CPS Energy plans to pilot Modern Hydrogen’s technology converting natural gas into hydrogen, the San Antonio, Texas-based company said July 22.

The step was taken as CPS looks to deliver cleaner energy to its customers.

“By exploring this innovative opportunity to produce clean hydrogen using our existing natural gas system, we are moving forward on our commitment to deliver reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for our community,” CPS Energy CEO Rudy Garza said.

Modern Hydrogen uses a thermal non-catalytic process to produce hydrogen and solid carbon, starting with natural gas. The process involves heating natural gas to a point where it is hot enough to dissolve the carbon and hydrogen bonds—about 2,000 F or hotter.

The process takes place inside Modern Hydrogen’s MH500, which can be bolted onto existing infrastructure to remove carbon from natural gas, LNG or RNG.

CPS said the pilot is intended to be scalable while maintaining reliability and affordability for its customers. If successful, future deployments could be beneficial for regional power hubs, fleet depots or transit systems in reducing grid strain, the company said.

“Creating new markets for Texas natural gas is both a good energy policy and a long-term investment in the regional economy,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright. “Deployments like this show how innovative technologies can unlock new value from the Eagle Ford and other prolific basins. This is about keeping American energy competitive, reliable and local—exactly the kind of leadership Texans expect.”

Air Liquide Reaches FID for Electrolyzer Project in Netherlands

Air Liquide said it will invest more than 500 million euros (US$587 million) to build, own and operate a 200-megawatt (MW) electrolyzer in the Port of Rotterdam.

Called ELYgator, the electrolyzer is a first-of-its-kind technology that integrates proton exchange membrane and alkaline technologies on the same site, Air Liquide said July 23. The company is targeting year-end 2027 to begin operations.

The final investment decision followed support from the Dutch government through its OWE subsidy scheme for large-scale electrolytic hydrogen production.

“This investment decision is an important milestone and demonstrates our commitment to renewable hydrogen development,” said Emilie Mouren-Renouard, group executive committee member in charge of supervising activities in Europe for Air Liquide. “We firmly believe that robust, large-scale initiatives like ELYgator will deliver a real impact for the European industry and heavy-duty mobility sectors.”

BP, Woodside, Fortescue Scrap Hydrogen Projects

(Reuters) BP will exit its planned green hydrogen production facility in Australia as the British energy major pivots back to oil and gas, a spokesperson said July 24.

The company was one of several announced exits from hydrogen projects this week.

Australia’s Woodside Energy on July 24 said it was abandoning its H2OK hydrogen project in Oklahoma, citing cost escalation and weaker-than-expected demand in the low-carbon hydrogen sector. Australia’s Fortescue also said it would scrap its U.S. and Australian green hydrogen projects.

BP informed its partners in the Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) that it intends to exit the project as operator and equity holder, a BP spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement. BP currently has a 63.57% stake in the project, according to the company's website. The other joint venture partners include privately owned InterContinental Energy and CWP Global.

The oil major has slashed planned renewables spending and refocused investments to oil and gas after underperformance in recent months led to criticism from investors.

The AREH aims to develop up to 26 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind capacity to produce as much as 1.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year, making it one of the world’s largest renewable energy projects.

Woodside’s exit from the H2OK project will result in an impairment loss of about $140 million on a pre-tax basis. “We have made the decision to exit the H2OK Project, demonstrating our disciplined approach to portfolio management,” the company said.

Abandoning the Queensland and Arizona projects also allowed mining giant Fortescue to trim its spending plans, raising the prospect it could maintain its dividend payout ratio at its full-year results on Aug. 25, said Glyn Lawcock, an analyst with Barrenjoey in Sydney.

Fortescue said it was assessing options to repurpose the assets and land for the Arizona Hydrogen Project and the PEM50 Project in Gladstone, Australia. It expects a preliminary pre-tax writedown of about $150 million in its second-half results, linked to spending on those businesses.

Fortum Acquires ABO’s Wind Assets in $82MM Deal

Finland-headquartered Fortum on July 23 said it is acquiring a 4.4- GW portfolio of wind projects in Finland for about EUR 70 million (US$82 million) from German renewables developer ABO Energy.

The acquisition, which is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2025, comes as Fortum targets growth in the Nordic region. Projects in the portfolio are in various stages of development. Fortum said the first projects could reach ready-to-build status within one year.

“One of Fortum’s strategic targets is to develop at least 800 MW of ready-to-build onshore wind and solar projects by the end of 2026,” the company said in a news release. “With the acquired portfolio, Fortum’s pipeline of onshore wind and solar projects in the permit process across the Nordic countries reaches approximately 8 GW, with more in early development.”

Investment decisions for each project will depend on power market conditions, it added.

Blaming Trump, Equinor Books a $955MM US Offshore Wind Writedown

(Reuters) Norway’s Equinor booked on July 23 a $955 million impairment on an offshore wind project in the U.S., citing U.S. tariffs and the uncertainty of the U.S. regulatory environment under President Donald Trump.

Harbored hopes from the industry that projects in the U.S. would revive the sector were dashed on Trump’s first day back in office in January when he suspended offshore wind leases. Then in April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum shut down Equinor’s Empire Wind development in New York state. He later lifted the stop-work order on the project. For Equinor, however, the damage has been done.

On July 23, Equinor reported its net operating income for the second quarter fell due to having to book a near billion-dollar impairment on its U.S. offshore wind projects.

Equinor CFO Torgrim Reitan said a combination of tariffs, the U.S. administration changing its mind on developing offshore wind and the removal of tax credits had affected the value of the group’s large onshore terminal in South Brooklyn, built to serve offshore wind farm installations.

“(The impairment) is driven by regulatory changes in the U.S., particularly related to that investment tax credits have been taken away for new developments. You also have tariffs, and there’s also a presidential order stopping permitting of new offshore wind projects,"" Reitan told Reuters.

“It is those new offshore wind projects that drive the impairment, because we have a terminal, the South Brooklyn Marine terminal, where we had assumed two more developments than our own Empire Wind to pay for that. That is now unlikely.”

Out of the $955 million impairment, $763 million is related to Empire Wind 1 and its South Brooklyn Marine Terminal project, with the remainder related to the lease of the Empire Wind 2 farm, the company said.

As a result, deploying new charging infrastructure in these regions often runs up against capacity limitations, permitting delays, and high upgrade costs.
Patel: Investor sentiment toward EV charging infrastructure has remained positive, even in a shifting and unclear political climate.
This shows how strategic siting tied to real-world behaviors (like rideshare activity) drives utilization and, over time, fosters broader EV adoption.","XCharge North America (XCharge NA) is a provider of high-power electric vehicle (EV) charging and battery-integrated solutions designed to strengthen the North American electrical grid. Since its inception in 2022, XCharge NA has developed a suite of products designed to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of EV charging, most recently launching its GridLink product in October 2024. Beyond rapid EV charging, GridLink’s bidirectional charging capabilities stabilize and strengthen the grid by storing energy and returning it back to the system during peak demand periods. By optimizing energy management and improving grid resilience, GridLink reportedly addresses some of the most pressing concerns associated with large-scale EV adoption.

POWER had a chance to question Aatish Patel, co-founder and president of XCharge NA, to learn more about GridLink and trends the company has observed in the EV charging space. Highlights from the interview follow.

POWER: Your GridLink technology offers bidirectional charging capabilities. Based on your deployment data so far, what percentage of EV owners are actively participating in vehicle-to-grid services, and what financial or other incentives have proven most effective in driving adoption?

Patel: Our deployment data to date shows that active participation in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services among EV owners remains minimal. While the promise of using EVs for demand response and backup power is real, it hasn’t yet translated into widespread adoption. What we are seeing, however, is clear momentum where the economics make sense, especially in battery-to-grid (B2G) applications.

The strongest motivator is financial. Technologies like GridLink have been instrumental in driving adoption, not because of the novelty of V2G or B2G, but because they offer tangible savings and operational advantages. GridLink reduces both infrastructure and operating costs by eliminating the need for costly “make-ready” upgrades, owing to its ability to support 208 VAC and 480 VAC without hardware modifications. That adaptability translates into less intensive installations and dramatically lower deployment costs.

Moreover, with substantial onboard storage capacities—215 kWh and 430 kWh—GridLink enables energy operators to optimize battery usage strategically. This allows for lower kWh rates through demand charge management and time-of-use optimization, directly improving margins and enabling more competitive market pricing.

POWER: Grid capacity concerns continue to dominate discussions around widespread EV adoption. From your perspective and data, which regions of North America are showing the most substantial grid constraints when it comes to charging infrastructure deployment, and how is this affecting your expansion strategy?

Patel: Both California and Texas are facing the most substantial constraints in grid capacity, according to our data. These two states lead the pack not just in EV adoption, but also in overall power demand, which puts additional pressure on their already stressed grids. As a result, deploying new charging infrastructure in these regions often runs up against capacity limitations, permitting delays, and high upgrade costs.

Beyond those high-demand states, we’re also seeing serious challenges in regions across North America that lack baseline infrastructure altogether—not just in terms of grid capacity, but also in broader logistical readiness. These areas may not have sufficient power delivery, but they also often lack the foundational infrastructure needed for any kind of large-scale technology deployment.

It was with this in mind that we designed GridLink to be inherently adaptable. Its compatibility with both 208 VAC and 480 VAC (without costly hardware modifications) means it can be deployed quickly and efficiently across a wide range of power environments. This flexibility reduces the burden of installation, limits the need for costly grid upgrades, and accelerates infrastructure buildout, even in regions with significant grid limitations like rural areas.

As we scale, our expansion strategy is focused on speed and adaptability. We’re prioritizing deployments where grid flexibility is critical and where GridLink’s capabilities can make the biggest impact in overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks.

POWER: In the current political climate, how has investor sentiment toward EV charging infrastructure changed in the past six months, and what metrics are investors most focused on when evaluating the sector’s health?

Patel: Investor sentiment toward EV charging infrastructure has remained positive, even in a shifting and unclear political climate. I believe widespread EV adoption is no longer a question of “if,” but “how fast.” That’s why the demand for robust, scalable charging infrastructure is now an urgent priority—and savvy investors recognize the opportunity.

That said, the tone of the investment conversation has shifted. Over the past six months, we’ve seen a marked shift away from enthusiasm driven by government incentives or policy tailwinds. Instead, investors are more focused on profitability and long-term viability. They’re looking for real businesses with sustainable models, not just short-term plays chasing subsidies.

Metrics that matter most now include unit economics, deployment scalability, operating margins, and technology differentiation—especially in solutions like V2G and B2G that offer clear paths to monetization through grid services and energy optimization. As long as there’s a sound business case (and innovations like GridLink prove that there is) investors are eager to participate and push the infrastructure buildout forward.

POWER: Looking at your utilization data across different regions, what patterns are emerging regarding the relationship between public charging availability and EV adoption rates? Is there evidence supporting the “build it and they will come” approach, or are other factors more decisive?

Patel: XCharge NA’s data confirms that widespread adoption of EVs at scale isn’t just dependent on building infrastructure, but rather on building the right infrastructure in the right places. The most important factors in the utility of any infrastructure are visibility, reliability, and accessibility. It makes logical sense: A charger that’s visible, accessible, and consistently functional will get used. One that’s tucked away, poorly maintained, or inconvenient won’t—no matter how many EVs are on the road. So, while the “build it and they will come” mindset has some truth to it, I think we’d say the better way to frame it is: build it well and build it where it matters.

Take our deployment near an airport in Harahan, Louisiana. Since installation, usage has steadily increased, driven largely by Uber and Lyft drivers operating in and around that high-traffic hub. This shows how strategic siting tied to real-world behaviors (like rideshare activity) drives utilization and, over time, fosters broader EV adoption.

This is exactly why we emphasize infrastructure that fits the location. GridLink’s adaptability allows us to deploy quickly and cost-effectively across a wide variety of environments, but we never treat siting as one-size-fits-all. Success isn’t just about adding chargers to the map—it’s about making each one count.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xcharge-ev-charging-gridlink.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:08:46.037632

Palisades is now authorized to receive new fuel and formally transition licensed reactor operators to on-shift status, owner Holtec International said. This marks the first time a previously shut-down U.S. nuclear plant has received regulatory approval to return to operations.

Other approvals include reinstating various documents and programs that were in place prior to shut down. Among these are the technical specifications, emergency plan, emergency action levels and physical security plan, as well as programs for quality assurance, maintenance and in-service inspections. A May 2025 report from the NRC concluded that there were no significant environmental impacts from restarting Palisades.

There are still several licensing actions under NRC review and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031. Testing, inspections and maintenance continue as the 800-megawatt (MW) plant continues to progress towards a restart.

Holtec acquired the plant in June 2022 just after it was shut down. In early 2023, the company applied for federal funding to repower Palisades, which it received in the form of a $1.5 billion loan. The company has already signed long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the full power output with rural electric co-ops Wolverine Power Cooperative and Hoosier Energy which serve rural communities in Michigan, Illinois and Indiana.

Palisades now employs almost 600 employees – nearly triple its workforce from mid-2022. They are supported by approximately 1,000 skilled contractors.

Dave McCormick announced about $90 billion worth of new investments in PA energy, infrastructure and AI-related projects at his summit last week at CMU. Isn’t this exactly the type of event a GSD (Get Shit Done) type governor like Josh Shapiro should have organized?

Yes, indeed.

That successful, forward-looking summit is the exact type of enterprise our GSD governor, deep into his first term and headed toward a re-election race — and an always-being-hinted-at-2028-presidential-run — should have organized…

But of course Shapiro and his entire, sprawling administration did not do that, and couldn’t do that, as he’s been standing athwart the state’s burgeoning energy industry since he became governor.

Rather than working to boost it, or even to just get out of its way, Shapiro’s been fighting to impose more taxes on our entire energy generation system through his foolhardy fight to force PA into RGGI — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

Basically, RGGI is an excuse to impose more regulations and taxes on us via our electric bills. The Shapiro Administration’s unnecessary PUSH for this has for years paralyzed our energy sector to the point where PJM, which manages our grid, recently warned of looming power shortages.

As the Commonwealth Foundation has noted, “Shapiro appealed the court decision that ruled the carbon tax imposed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was unconstitutional.”

Rather than get on with his supposed GSD agenda, Shapiro went back to the courts to attempt a redo. Nor did he “lift a finger to fight against federal overreach,” à la former Pres. Biden’s ban on liquefied natural gas.

It’s hard to trumpet Pennsylvania’s home-grown energy abundance when you’re at war with it.

Kudos to McCormick and our home-grown power generation and distribution firms for being able to look past that, and fight through Shapiro’s RGGI-induced inertia and look toward the future and realize our need for increased electricity generation. And welcome as well to the other companies that also announced new investments in the state — it’s a great start.

As several summit participants noted, it just makes sense to locate new electric generating plants here because they are very close to (and in some cases, right on top of) the natural gas that will power many of them.

The sprawling coal-fired Homer City electric generating complex in Indiana County, now being torn down and rebuilt into a sprawling natural gas-powered generating complex, was originally sited there because it was right in the middle of western Pennsylvania’s coal fields.

And the same now goes for the gas-fired plants. Duh!

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Commonwealth is the nation’s second largest producer of natural gas and also the second largest net supplier of total energy to other states. (In both instances only Texas outranks Pennsylvania.)

For decades NEPA’s (northeast Pennsylvania) hard anthracite coal kept the heat on in East Coast urban centers, while the bituminous coal of western Pennsylvania powered the industrial revolution.

There’s a certain logic in moving to ensure the state’s vast natural gas (and other) resources power the next energy-intensive phase of America’s growth. Enter McCormick, as Shapiro has been AWOL.

It’s nice — and appropriate — that McCormick invited Gov. Josh Shapiro to one session at the summit, and equally as nice that Shapiro accepted.

But McCormick was the star of the show, and filled the void unfortunately created by Shapiro’s well-practiced nonchalance toward Pennsylvania’s energy-related sectors.

Both men were playing to type: McCormick, the hedge fund investment manager/dealmaker and Shapiro, the prevaricating career politician who’s never held a job in the private sector – outside a short-term gig at a law firm.

Now the hard part begins — getting those projects McCormick curated and announced across the finish line.

Perhaps Shapiro can be helpful in that endeavor, or perhaps…we need a new governor who is more focused on this, rather than on endless self-promotion. Imagine if Shapiro would devote as much time to spearheading a new energy renaissance as he does to pushing his “cringeworthy” social media strategy.

Yes indeed.",https://broadandliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/53025066070_f638af3531_k.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:07:16.424303

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Thursday supported committee approval of an appropriations bill that would make resources available for Mississippi water systems, wastewater infrastructure, and unique cultural projects.

The FY2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill was approved on a 26-2 vote, which makes it available for debate by the full Senate. The bill funds the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Forest Service, and other agencies.

“Mississippi, unlike western states, doesn’t have a lot of federal land holdings, but the Interior appropriations bill is important for the help it can give our communities to address water and wastewater infrastructure and historical site management. I am pleased to support this measure and look forward to its consideration by the full Senate,” Hyde-Smith said.

Among the items of interest to Mississippi in the FY2026 Interior Appropriations Bill:

$7.8 million for the Cities of Clinton, Bolton, and Raymond for Regional Wastewater Improvements

$2.5 million for the DeSoto County Regional Utility Authority (DCRUA) Effluent Pump Station Project

$1.17 million for the City of Natchez for Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements

$500,000 for the City of Louisville for Historic Strand Theater Preservation and Restoration

There are significant policy provisions that would benefit Mississippi, including:

$20 million for the American Battlefield Protection Program

Report Language for Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to continue mineral assessments on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (Ole Miss)

Report Language to direct EPA to continue to update and refine its draft of the Rodenticide Strategy

$49 million for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund

Report language adopted via amendment directing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore, enhance, and better manage habitat for waterfowl and wildlife at the Mathews Brake and Yazoo National Wildlife Refuges, in partnership with local landowners and nonprofit conservation organizations.

Within EPA funding, the committee approved $2.8 billion for the Clean Water and Drinking Water Revolving Funds that have been used successfully by communities throughout Mississippi to tackle water and wastewater infrastructure issues.

The National Parks in Mississippi would also benefit from the $3.3 billion to support our nation’s parks, preserve historic sites, and sustain staffing capacity to address visitor services and park management needs.

The Senate Appropriations Committee has now approved six of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which Senate Majority Leader Thune has committed to bringing to the full Senate for consideration. The Senate voted on Tuesday to proceed to consideration of the FY2026 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill.

The Heat Vulnerability Index the Defusing Disasters group developed is set to debut to the public next month.
The Heat Vulnerability Index takes research on that difference a step further — pulling data from local hospitals and health departments.
People at home can also use the Heat Vulnerability Index to guide their decisions.
""You can go and see like, 'Oh, my area is really vulnerable according to this heat vulnerability tool, so maybe I should be more careful when there's a heat wave,'"" said Hay-Chapman.","Everyone in the Chicago area was feeling the heat wave this week, and on the Evanston campus of Northwestern University, researchers were studying it.

The researchers have been tracking the heat, and the way it impacts parts of the city differently, in a brand-new way that could ultimately provide relief for some Chicagoans.

The Northwestern researchers have developed a tool called the Heat Vulnerability Index — a brand-new tool they say can make a real difference for those most impacted by the hot temperatures we all have been feeling.

They also focus on how climate change plays a role.

""With climate change, the main effect that we see is the number of days we call heat waves days,"" said researcher Finley Hay-Chapman.

Hay-Chapman is part of the Defusing Disasters Working Group, led by the Buffett Institute at Northwestern. Teams on the project work to target and address the issues caused by extreme weather events in Chicago.

""We can sort of get a clearer sense of sort of which community areas are most vulnerable to heat, but also why,"" said Hay-Chapman.

The Heat Vulnerability Index the Defusing Disasters group developed is set to debut to the public next month.

""And it will be able to pop up what is actually causing this vulnerability here,"" said Hay-Chapman.

It is well-known that heat is felt differently throughout Chicago. The Heat Vulnerability Index takes research on that difference a step further — pulling data from local hospitals and health departments.

The researchers use hospital health outcome data to determine when people are visiting the hospital during heat waves.

For the first time with the Heat Vulnerability Index, the public can go in a use a tool allowing them to connect the dots between warming climate and impact on health.

""Not only will they be able to link it to their health through this map, they will also be able to understand why,"" said Hay-Chapman.

Hay-Chapman said Chicago's South and West Side are the main areas where researchers are seeing the most vulnerability to heat.

""There are areas which have lower access to critical resources in the face of climate change we might want to focus on in future climate policy,"" he said.

The goal once the Heat Vulnerability Index is published is to use the tool to make changes in areas feeling extreme heat most intensely — solutions such as increasing green space, planting more trees, addressing pollution issues that are worsened during heat waves, and even infrastructure changes such as subsidized air conditioning units.

A spokeswoman for Chicago's Department of Environment confirmed it is working with the Northwestern group. the department said a public survey is happening right now:

""The City is committed to working in partnership with the community to better understand its needs, values, and priorities. We believe that learning from the lived experience of the Chicagoans most impacted by heat leads to more effective and equitable outcomes. As part of this commitment, we are collaborating with the Defusing Disasters group to ensure community voices shape the policy solutions.

""In addition to analyzing data from the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI), the Defusing Disasters group is actively gathering public feedback through a survey. Once the data and community input have been collected and reviewed, the City will work closely with the group to incorporate the takeaways into clear, actionable recommendations for implementation.""

A building partially collapsed during the storms in west suburban Lyons. The apartment building is located at Ogden and Powell avenues, according to Lyons police Chief Thomas Herion.

Blume said U.S. negotiators reacted positively to the company’s proposal to reduce the tariff burden by $1 for every $1 invested in the country.
The lower end of that forecast assumes the 27.5% U.S. tariffs will stick in the second half, while the upper end foresees the levies being cut to 10%.
“We need a good compromise” on tariffs, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.","Volkswagen AG said it expects U.S. tariffs to come down to a more manageable level, bolstering the export-reliant automaker after it tallied $1.53 billion in expenses in the first half due to President Donald Trump’s trade war.

The shares gained as much as 4.1% after Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume said he expected European Union and U.S. negotiators to eventually agree on duties of around 15%, from the 27.5% the car industry faces currently. The German manufacturer is also pursuing a separate offset with the Trump administration in return for raising its spending in the country.

“We can offer huge investments, and then have the opportunity to discount the tariff level, but also with the potential to export from the U.S. to the rest of the world,” Blume said during an earnings call.

Any reprieve from Trump’s trade war, which is weighing on profits and reordering supply chains, would be welcome news for the industry. Volkswagen on Friday cut its full-year outlook after the levies hit its Porsche and Audi brands. Just last week, Stellantis NV announced a surprise €2.3 billion first-half net loss after scrapping investments and tallying the impact of mounting trade tensions. Optimism around tariffs also contributed to share gains for Mercedes-Benz Group AG, BMW AG and Stellantis.

Volkswagen is building a factory in the United States to make Scout-branded rugged SUVs and pickup trucks, and is weighing to set up local production for Audi. It may also export more vehicles from its factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where it currently makes SUVs mostly for the North American market. Blume said U.S. negotiators reacted positively to the company’s proposal to reduce the tariff burden by $1 for every $1 invested in the country.

Analysts also cited progress Volkswagen is making on restructuring its costly German operations and slowing a sales slump in China, where local carmakers led by BYD Co. are dominating in electric vehicles.

“Some of the worst problems have been addressed,” Citi analyst Harald Hendrikse said in a note. The namesake VW brand “is starting to benefit from its significant restructuring and capacity cuts, and we think Audi and Porsche will also start to recover” by next year.

The maker of the VW Golf earlier Friday lowered its operating return on sales outlook to as low as 4%, from at least 5.5% previously, and pared back expectations for revenue and free cash flow. The lower end of that forecast assumes the 27.5% U.S. tariffs will stick in the second half, while the upper end foresees the levies being cut to 10%. Audi and Porsche don’t operate factories in the United States and import all of the cars they sell there.

“We need a good compromise” on tariffs, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “A solution that fits both the needs of the American administration, but also European automakers.”

Volkswagen is counting on partnerships with Rivian Automotive Inc. in the United States and China’s Xpeng Inc. to bolster its products, though new models from those efforts won’t be available until next year. Some of its peers are dealing with tumult in top management, with Stellantis having recently named a new chief executive officer and Renault SA seeking a permanent CEO.

The group’s trucking business Traton SE late Thursday cut its outlook due to the trade hurdles as well as weak economic growth in Europe and declining orders in Brazil. The unit’s adjusted operating result slumped 29% in the second quarter.

There were some bright spots. The namesake VW brand has seen EV sales rise in Europe in recent months, thanks to rebates and buyers increasingly shunning Tesla Inc. over Elon Musk’s political activities. The company sees strong order intake momentum continuing through the end of the year in Europe after EV deliveries rose 73% there in the second quarter, driven by robust demand for models including the VW ID.5, the Audi Q4 e-tron and the Skoda Enyaq.

On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest.
“This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities.
When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government.
Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state.","After a proposed provision in the recent Republican tax break and spending cut law that would have opened up millions of acres of federal lands for sale was axed, Colorado climate leaders and public lands advocates still didn’t have much to celebrate.

That’s because the massive federal policy bill‘s surviving provisions governing oil and gas leasing on federal lands are “an egregious step back for the environment,” according to Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

The law makes it easier to lease federal lands in several Western states for oil and gas extraction. It also limits the ways by which this land can be regulated and lowers the royalty rate that oil and gas companies must pay the government, among other related provisions.

“This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it’s hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure,” Hornbein said. “It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.”

The law, achieved through the reconciliation process in Congress and signed July 4 by President Donald Trump, who calls it the “big, beautiful bill,” mandates that the secretary of the Interior Department make federal lands available for oil and gas leasing on, at minimum, a quarterly basis in nine states, including Colorado. The available lands are governed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.

Those agencies handle swaths of public lands that are typically multiuse. On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest. The lands are also often used for commercial purposes, including by tourism and recreation companies, and for resource extraction. The state is home to 24 million acres of federal land.

By prioritizing oil and gas leasing above other uses for certain lands, the law “hurts everybody but the extractive industries,” said Colorado Springs resident and outdoorsman David Lien.

Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.

“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said. “To use a hunting term, I’d say the reconciliation bill passed by Congress has gutted public lands, in respect to extractive industries.”

The Bureau of Land Management declined an interview request for this article.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a statement on Tuesday. “This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The Department is proud to implement President Trump’s agenda and get the federal government back to working for the American people.”

Limited regulation

Federal lands used for oil and gas leasing are regulated by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management through a variety of means, including resource management plans, which are long-term land-use blueprints.

Prior to the signing of the GOP reconciliation bill, these plans served as a starting point for regulation, not a finish line. But the law has made it so the government “may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval included in the resource management plans” for oil and gas leases, according to a Bureau of Land Management statement.

Allison Henderson, the southern Rockies director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this provision poses a “significant risk” to the environment, water supplies and vulnerable species of animals that live on public lands, because resource management plans “do not provide kind of the nitty-gritty, site-specific types of mitigation measures that are necessary.”

Resource management plans are typically updated every 10 to 20 years, and a single plan can often cover a wide region spanning hundreds of thousands of acres. Henderson said this makes the plans not adaptive or area-specific enough to be adequate as the exclusive means for environmental regulation of oil and gas leases on federal lands.

“The RMPs are doing these broad, kind of general covers of big picture stuff,” Henderson said. “So this provision really seems to be like it’s trying to prevent anything more protective from going forward, which means that a lot will fall through the cracks.”

Lower royalty rate

Beyond its anticipated adverse effects on the climate, the law also decreases the revenue that states and the federal government bring in from leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction.

When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government. The GOP law sets the royalty rate for new onshore oil and gas leases at 12.5%, which is below market rate and significantly lower than the Biden-era royalty rate of 16.67%. This change means the government is expected to earn billions of dollars less in royalties over the next decade.

Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state. In 2024, oil and gas lease royalties for onshore federal land in Colorado totaled $131 million, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior natural resource revenue database.

“In addition to being a significant attack on public lands, this is also going to be causing us to lose billions of dollars in royalties, and then who knows what the ultimate billion dollars of cost it’ll be as a result of the climate emissions that are going to end up happening because of these leases,” Henderson said.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_OILGAS_GARFIELDCO_019.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:06:20.239989

The multi-year agreement includes chemicals, associated management services, and the deployment of Leucipa™ automated field production solution to optimise operations.

Through the agreement, Baker Hughes will provide DRAs from its FLO product line to support the transportation of both light and heavy crude from offshore platforms to storage and refining facilities in Texas and Louisiana. The use of DRAs and midstream solutions will significantly increase the capacity of the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline and Poseidon systems, each of which is operated and 64% owned by Genesis Energy, allowing for increased oil production and enhanced crude slate flexibility in the Gulf.

“As America’s energy demand continues to grow, it is crucial that midstream capacity keep up with production to avoid bottlenecks,” said Amerino Gatti, executive vice president of Oilfield Services & Equipment at Baker Hughes. “Fortunately, technology provides the solution to this challenge. By utilising DRAs to reduce friction between pipelines and the hydrocarbon resources that flow through them, as well as AI to optimise their operation, Genesis can increase its capacity without the need for large investments of time and capital, all while helping the country meet its energy needs.”

The advanced chemical formulations are manufactured using proprietary technology that allows them to more efficiently dissolve in crude, making them highly effective for a variety of crude types, including those produced along the US Gulf Coast. Their versatility across temperature ranges, ability to maintain crude quality, and innovative delivery systems enhance pipeline efficiency and improve operational flexibility.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick.
“The current regulations do not provide for a realistic timeline to make the changes needed to meet the standards set by the HON Rule,” Cresson said.
In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations.
Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations.","A recent proclamation from President Donald Trump will allow 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.

A week ago, Trump issued what the White House labeled “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” His action creates a two-year exemption to regulations the Environmental Protection Agency published in May, called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants – or the HON rule for short.

“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”

The Louisiana facilities now exempt from the HON Rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar plant

Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II plant, Plaquemine

Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge

Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville

Westlake Vinyl, Westlake

BASF Corp., Geismar

Rubicon, Geismar

Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles

TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville

Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace

Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles

DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Anne Rolfes, director of the environmental group Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick. If anything, it didn’t go far enough,” Rolfes said. “Our congressional delegation should be up in arms about the White House rollback, but instead they are doing as they have always done: serving the needs of the chemical industry instead of the health and safety of the people. It continues to be up to us – to ordinary people in Louisiana – to protect ourselves from this industry.”

David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said the organization’s members strive for regulations that provide environmental protection and regulatory certainty for industry. He sees president’s proclamation as a step toward that objective.

“The current regulations do not provide for a realistic timeline to make the changes needed to meet the standards set by the HON Rule,” Cresson said. “There are simply not enough contractors or equipment currently available to facilitate this nationwide manufacturing effort, and while our members are making strides to meet these requirements, time is needed for facilities to implement solutions safely and effectively without jeopardizing public safety.”

Many of the facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have a history of environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers arguably having the highest profile.

In February 2023, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging its neoprene operations “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare” for the cancer risks its chloroprene emissions pose.

The Biden administration demanded Denka reduce emissions of chloroprene and ethylene oxide, another carcinogen, at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days to bring down its toxic emission levels, compared with two years for facilities in other parts of the country.

Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.

Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed.

In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations. The EPA has identified five census tracts in the LaPlace area as having the highest exposure to chloroprene in the nation — all attributed to the Denka plant.

Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.

A July 2023 explosion at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine produced a fire that burned for nearly two days before being brought under control. The same facility saw a string of emergencies dating back to 2019. The unit involved in the explosion two years ago was involved in four previous unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, according to state records. The toxic compound is highly flammable and can cause kidney damage from prolonged exposure.

In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and forced nearby schools to place students under lockdown until a dark cloud of smoke over the Lake Charles area cleared. Federal records show the plant has an extensive history of spills, accidents and injured workers.

Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals for an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that resulted in a fire that burned 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to make synthetic materials and jet fuel.

Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, has argued the agency is authorized – but not mandated – to enforce the Clean Air Act, based on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/07/4.-Dow4-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:08:41.512446

Geothermal has a promising future too.

Either way we need to start diversifying our energy production and fossil fuels are not going to save us.

With all of our electric bills going up (and lots of posts about it in here), this outlines how creating clean energy here in New Jersey would increase supply, lower utility rates, and create new jobs.

Seems notable that environmental groups, building trades unions, consumer groups, and business leaders are all united on anything let alone something as big as this.

From the link:

The Jersey Renews coalition lays out a clear path forward: Expand solar power, build infrastructure for offshore wind, electrify transportation and modernize the grid with battery storage.

Unlike fossil fuel jobs tied to out-of-state extraction and international markets, clean energy jobs would stay in New Jersey. A union electrician installing solar panels, a steelworker fabricating offshore wind components, a construction crew building electric-vehicle charging infrastructure — they’re all powering a stronger, more self-reliant New Jersey economy. Already, more than 50,000 workers across the state are employed in clean energy jobs, many of them in construction, manufacturing and the skilled trades.

And for ratepayers, the benefits are just as clear. Locally-produced energy means more predictable utility bills and less exposure to global energy price shocks.

The delays would undermine financing and force tribes to abandon renewable projects worth millions in potential economic development growth.
Delays in approval could affect both generation facilities and transmission infrastructure serving tribal projects.
The report will include recommendations on reconciling the elevated review with expiring tax credits, according to the internal memo.
The Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association (MTERA) said it would stifle growth in the tribal energy sector.","A new Department of Interior policy requiring personal approval from Secretary Doug Burgum for all solar and wind projects threatens to create a bureaucratic bottleneck that could kill tribal renewable energy developments already racing to meet shortened federal tax credit deadlines.

The sweeping requirement, which covers 69 separate activities from leasing to right-of-way permitting, arrives as tribes face a critical July 2026 deadline to begin construction on projects seeking to qualify for federal tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Those credits expire entirely for new projects after 2027.

Tribal energy advocates warn the new review process could push viable projects past eligibility deadlines. The delays would undermine financing and force tribes to abandon renewable projects worth millions in potential economic development growth.

“They already have a backlog of everything from trust land applications to land leases and other work going on over there,” said a tribal tax and land lawyer who requested anonymity. “Adding these extra steps could legitimately kill a lot of these projects if they aren’t timely about the reviews.”

Interior announced the policy July 17, after an internal memo was leaked to the Associated Press before it was publicly released. Officials said the change will ensure “thorough and deliberative” evaluations and “level the playing field” for coal and natural gas.

The policy cites Executive Order 14315 — titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies For Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources” — as the impetus for the change.

“These actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars,” Acting Assistant Secretary Adam Suess said in a statement. “American Energy Dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable baseload energy, not regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

But the new policy has drawn criticism beyond Indian Country, with critics characterizing it as a “a tsunami of red tape and roadblocks for private investment” and a “shadow ban” on renewables that contradicts Trump’s stated goal of reducing regulatory burdens on energy development.

“Can you imagine if Secretary Burgum ran his billion-dollar tech company like this — reviewing every single IT ticket himself?” Kabir Green, director of federal affairs for nature at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told Politico. “That kind of micromanagement would paralyze any operation, and here it's being used deliberately to snuff out renewable energy development.”

Critics point to a similar policy enacted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who required her personal approval of all department expenditures over $100,000 — a move that drew criticism after it delayed FEMA’s flood response in Texas. The policy led to a lapse in emergency call center staffing, leading FEMA to miss thousands of assistance calls in the days following the disaster, according to reporting by the New York Times. Tribal advocates warn Burgum’s approach at Interior risks repeating the same mistakes, turning top-level oversight into a choke point that could derail vital projects.

The elevated review requirement arrives as Congress phases out federal tax credits for renewable energy. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act created a two-step phase-out. Projects must enter service December 2027 to claim credits. But projects that begin construction or spend %% of their budget by July 2026 have until 2029 to put their project into service and claim the credit.

Projects that do not start construction by 2027 become ineligible for wind and solar credits entirely. That places many tribal utility scale projects out of the running, per prior Tribal Business News reporting.

Delays in approval could affect both generation facilities and transmission infrastructure serving tribal projects. Any hold-up may push projects past the 2027 deadline, killing financing eligibility and increasing borrowing costs, the tribal tax expert said.

Interior has 45 days to report on implementation to the White House Office of Management and Budget and the Treasury. The report will include recommendations on reconciling the elevated review with expiring tax credits, according to the internal memo.

When asked about the timing of the approvals process, the current backlog of tribal energy projects and assertions that the process was overly cumbersome, an Interior spokesperson declined to comment.

Native leaders push back

The new review policy prompted swift criticism across Indian Country. The Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association (MTERA) said it would stifle growth in the tribal energy sector.

“This creates significant administrative barriers that could impede Tribal Nations' sovereign rights to develop clean energy projects on their own lands,” MTERA wrote on social media. The nonprofit said the “additional bureaucratic requirements threaten to slow critical renewable energy development across Indian Country.”

The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy called the policy “a bureaucratic roadblock designed to quietly kill” renewable projects in Indian Country.

“This undermines tribal sovereignty,” Alliance President Cherí Smith wrote on social media. She said the policy threatens “tremendous economic growth, job creation, energy independence, strengthened American energy supply, and national security benefits these projects deliver.”

Meanwhile, legislators are battling proposed cuts to other tribal programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee passed a fiscal 2026 appropriations bill on Thursday, allocating $41.45 billion to Interior overall, $12 billion of which would go to tribal programs. The Senate bill ignores nearly $1 billion in proposed cuts to those tribal programs.

It is widely acknowledged that China is cementing its role in clean energy industries, significantly contributing to the global green transition as a responsible great power.

According to a recent article by MIT Technology Review, ""China is the dominant force in next-generation energy technologies today. It's pouring hundreds of billions of USD into putting renewable sources... This investment has been transformational for the country's economy...""

Authored by Casey Crownhart, the article goes on to say, ""The numbers don't lie: By a lot of measures, China is the world's leader in energy.""

Crownhart analyzes how China is rising as a clean power behemoth with three charts.

""China is on an absolute tear installing wind and solar power,"" she says. By the end of 2024, China had installed close to 900 gigawatts of solar capacity, and this fast-paced development has carried on into 2025.

China's electric vehicle (EV) market is also booming, accounting for over 60 percent of global EV sales. Its customers include established markets like Europe and growing ones like Brazil.

Besides, EVs have also seen a growing demand in the domestic market. In the first half of 2025, China registered a record 5.62 million new energy vehicles, up 27.86 percent year on year, a record high, according to data released by the Ministry of Public Security.

In an interview with the journalist Walter Isaacson, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said the cost and quality of Chinese EVs is ""far superior"" to what he sees in the West.

An article from The New York Times (NYT) said, ""Not only does China already dominate global manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, EVs and many other clean energy industries, but with each passing month it is widening its technological lead."" China holds close to 700,000 clean energy patents, accounting for over half of the global total, NYT added.

The meaning behind those numbers is more important than the numbers themselves.

The success of the green transition is steering China's economy toward high-quality development, while China's green technologies provide better options to address climate problems.

Reducing emissions has never been a more pressing issue than it is today, considering the more frequent extreme weather caused by climate change.

Thanks to its green tech boom, China is fulfilling its commitment to cut carbon emissions. The country saw its emissions decline in the 12 months up to May 2025, the BBC reported, adding that this was the first time emissions fell even as demand for power across the Chinese economy grew rapidly. ""It is a moment to celebrate,"" the BBC said.

NYT noted that affordable Chinese-produced solar panels, batteries, and EVs have enabled many major economies — including Brazil, South Africa, and India — to shift to cleaner technologies. ""That affordability is crucial for bringing down global emissions.""

Crownhart echoed the view. Between 2015 and 2025, China has tripled its spending on renewable energy development, she wrote. ""Looking ahead, China is still pouring money into renewables, storage, grids, and energy efficiency technologies.""",https://www.stdaily.com/resource/templateRes//202403/03/228/images/icon.ico,N,,2025-07-25 14:04:41.692266

Owning an EV is a great way to reduce the emissions of dirty fuels, as they don't produce tailpipe exhaust: the more EV drivers, the less emissions.

Battery swapping can make the process of driving an EV even easier and reduce issues, as the swap stations perform regular maintenance and monitor the batteries, ensuring their condition between charges.

Renewable energy is increasingly recognized for its significant role in combating climate change, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security globally. Among various alternative energy sources, wind power has emerged as a key driver of the clean energy transition.

Wind power capacity in the United States has grown significantly over the past couple of decades, rising from 2.4 gigawatts (GW) in 2000 to more than 153 GW in 2024. Per a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), wind power output increased 6.4% year over year in 2024, accounting for 10% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation. The lucrative tax credits, coupled with cost reductions in wind energy production led by technological advancements, have rekindled wind project growth.

There has been a major swing in the U.S. generation mix over the years, driven by the significant growth in wind generation capacity. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, wind power accounted for approximately 27% of capacity additions on average to the U.S. power system since 2010.

The wind energy market is capitalizing on several favorable trends, including growing electricity demand driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered data centers, widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EV) and rapid industrialization. Per the latest Short-Term Energy Outlook published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. grid is projected to add 7.7 GW of wind generation capacity in 2025, reflecting an increase from 5.1 GW added last year.

This projected increase will be supported by large offshore wind projects, including the 800-megawatt (MW) Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts and the 715-MW Revolution Wind in Rhode Island. States like Texas, Massachusetts and Wyoming will see nearly half of 2025 wind capacity additions.

Leading wind energy companies like Dominion Energy, Inc. D, DTE Energy Company DTE, Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. BEP and Arcosa, Inc. ACA present compelling opportunities for investors, given their strong foothold in the market, research and development capabilities and market expansion. As clean energy technologies evolve, they are set to capitalize on growth opportunities and provide lucrative investment prospects.

According to AutoLeap, an auto repair shop management software, major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are expanding EV lineups and investing in battery technologies that deliver longer ranges, faster charging and improved recyclability.

Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) continue to play a transitional role, especially in regions where full electrification is not yet feasible.

As outlined by Dentons, a multinational law firm, hybrids are a practical solution for reducing emissions while infrastructure catches up.

Circular economy and sustainable materials

The adoption of circular economy principles is gathering pace.

Deloitte highlights increased use of recycled aluminium, bio-based plastics and eco-friendly interiors across the sector.

According to Research and Markets, a market research store, OEMs are now embedding circularity into vehicle design and end-of-life strategies like recycling, remanufacturing and material recovery are becoming standard.

“The potential for decarbonisation in industrial manufacturing is enormous,” says Martijn Karrenbeld, Global Market Sector Director, Industrial Manufacturing at Arcadis.

“It is a major global consumer of energy and contributor of carbon, so every sustainability gain we make really matters.

“Wherever you are on your decarbonisation journey and whatever your motivation, maturity or measure, we’re keen to understand how we can work together to make a planet-positive difference.”

Green manufacturing and renewable energy

Green manufacturing is another priority.

According to the European Automotive Decarbonisation and Sustainability Summit 2025, manufacturers are integrating solar, wind and other renewable sources into their operations, while modernising equipment for greater energy efficiency.

PwC notes that this transformation extends across global supply chains, where data transparency and energy use monitoring are key areas of focus.

Regulatory and market drivers

Strict regulations are accelerating the shift.

The environmental NGO Transport & Environment reports that the EU’s 2025 target of 93.6g of CO₂ per kilometre for new cars is driving a surge in EV development.

Similar legislation in other regions is creating global momentum, according to Dentons.

Circular economy and reporting mandates

Deloitte explains that upcoming EU directives are mandating the use of recycled content in car manufacturing, particularly for batteries.

These rules also introduce quotas for secondary raw materials and enforce design-for-reuse strategies.

On the corporate side, Deloitte notes that the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), effective from 2025, requires automakers to provide detailed disclosures on sustainability performance, adding further pressure to align operations with climate goals.

Measurable progress

Deloitte reports that European automakers have cut emissions from operations by 20% since 2021, despite an increase in production volumes.

Globally, the automotive industry is targeting a 90% reduction in emissions by 2050 as part of broader net zero commitments.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are expected to make up 20–24% of the EU’s new car sales in 2025, according to Transport & Environment, with sales likely to grow further as infrastructure expands and affordability improves.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b7369878a393f58e839fb823389df241:9621d3a15b4692ce8ab2ee2ee556f264/an-ev-vehicle.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:04:46.266081

For those seeking exposure, a diversified portfolio of undervalued utilities and energy storage innovators—coupled with a hedging strategy against policy risks—offers a compelling risk-reward profile.","The U.S. renewable energy infrastructure sector is at a defining inflection point, driven by a confluence of policy momentum, technological innovation, and surging demand for clean power. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), combined with the urgent need to decarbonize the energy grid, has created a structural tailwind for investors who can identify undervalued players positioned to benefit from this transformation. Yet, despite the scale of the opportunity, markets remain underreactive—offering a rare window to capitalize on mispriced assets.

The IRA: A Catalyst for Decades of Growth

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 remains the linchpin of the U.S. clean energy transition, with its tax credits and incentives reshaping the economics of renewable infrastructure. By 2025, the IRA's provisions have extended and modified the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), while introducing technology-neutral incentives like the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E) and the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (Section 45Y). These credits now apply to a broad range of zero-emission technologies, including energy storage, hydrogen, and advanced nuclear, creating a level playing field for innovation.

However, the landscape is evolving. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1), passed in July 2025, has accelerated the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects, terminating them for projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 2026. This has triggered a scramble among developers to secure permits and financing, compressing timelines and inflating valuations for late-stage projects. Meanwhile, the Act's foreign ownership restrictions (FEOC rules) add complexity, forcing firms to reevaluate partnerships and supply chains.

Despite these headwinds, the IRA's broader framework remains intact, with energy storage and grid modernization emerging as the most resilient sectors. According to the Q1 2025 U.S. Energy Storage Monitor, the market added 2 GW of new capacity in the first quarter alone, with utility-scale projects leading the charge. Indiana, for instance, quadrupled its operational storage to 256 MW, while over 10 GW of new projects are queued for interconnection.

Undervalued Utilities and Energy Storage Firms: The Hidden Gems

While the spotlight often shines on high-profile solar and wind developers, the real alpha lies in utilities and energy storage firms that are strategically aligned with the IRA's objectives but remain underappreciated by the market.

Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) stands out as a case study in innovation and policy alignment. In Q2 2025, the company delivered a non-GAAP gross margin of 48.6%, bolstered by $41.5 million in IRA incentives. Its fourth-generation IQ Battery, with 30% higher energy density, and the upcoming IQ9 microinverter (set for Q4 2025) position it to dominate the residential and commercial storage markets. Despite a 42.3% year-to-date decline in its stock price versus the S&P 500's 7.2% gain, Enphase's ecosystem of tools—SolarGraph and Enphase Care—creates a durable moat, streamlining installer workflows and enhancing customer retention. Analysts like Oppenheimer have set a $86 price target (117% upside), suggesting the market is underestimating its long-term potential.

Other undervalued names include NextEra Energy (NEE) and Vistra Energy (VST), which are leveraging their grid infrastructure and regulatory expertise to monetize IRA-driven demand. NextEra's recent investments in battery storage and hydrogen production align with the Act's clean hydrogen incentives, while Vistra's pivot to renewable generation and demand-response solutions positions it as a key player in grid resilience. Both firms trade at discounts to their intrinsic valuations, reflecting short-term concerns about interest rates and regulatory hurdles—risks that appear overpriced given the sector's defensive characteristics and long-term growth trajectory.

The Risks and the Reward

The path forward is not without risks. The Trump administration's threat to rescind unspent IRA funds and its pro-fossil fuel rhetoric have created policy uncertainty. Additionally, the acceleration of tax credit phaseouts under H.R. 1 could disrupt project pipelines, particularly for smaller developers. However, these risks are largely short-term and should not overshadow the structural tailwinds.

The energy transition is irreversible. Electricity demand is projected to grow 1%–2% annually through 2035, driven by data centers, EVs, and industrial electrification. Meanwhile, energy storage costs have fallen 80% since 2015, making it a critical tool for grid stability. For investors, the key is to focus on firms with strong balance sheets, IRA-aligned strategies, and pricing power—attributes that Enphase, NextEra, and Vistra exemplify.

The Call to Action

Markets are underreacting to the scale of the energy transition. While the S&P 500 has clawed back from its 2024 lows, utilities and energy storage stocks remain in the doldrums, trading at multi-year lows relative to their growth prospects. This mispricing presents an opportunity for investors who can look beyond near-term volatility and focus on the long-term.

For those seeking exposure, a diversified portfolio of undervalued utilities and energy storage innovators—coupled with a hedging strategy against policy risks—offers a compelling risk-reward profile. The window to act is narrowing: as the IRA's incentives mature and the energy transition accelerates, the cost of waiting will rise.

That is horrendous.” In terms of emissions per capita, China is still less than the US — but comfortably exceeds the EU and UK.
Ma said it would be wrong to view the coal plants as a traditional part of the grid.
“So, yes, there are more coal plants, but we can see quite rapid reduction of coal generation hours,” Ma said.
That Chinese emissions would peak around now should not be a surprise.","“We are seeing the beginning of a decoupling,” said Ma Jun, from the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a non-profit Chinese research organisation. “The deployment of solar is massive.”

Ever since much of the world pledged to aim for net-zero carbon emissions, ever since the economies of Europe set out to do something unprecedented in the history of humanity — move from a dense and easy source of energy to a diffuse, difficult and variable source — there has been a niggling argument facing environmentalists.

What is the point of doing this, sceptics would ask, when China is adding more emissions in a year than entire countries? What can Britain do, when China’s carbon footprint is about 30 times as big and getting bigger?

Now, though, it is not getting bigger. It is, as one environmentalist put it, the end of the “But China” argument.

But is it? “There are lots of environmentalists saying, ‘I told you so,’” said Sir Dieter Helm, a professor of economics at Oxford University. “‘It’s all working,’ they say. ‘Isn’t it wonderful the Chinese have turned the tide, and are building all these renewables and are going to peak their emissions?’”

Indeed it is, he said, compared with the alternative — but we should also look closely at what is going to happen to the many dozens of coal plants they are still building. “If China’s emissions plateau at the current level, that’s a climate disaster. That’s not a great success. That is horrendous.” In terms of emissions per capita, China is still less than the US — but comfortably exceeds the EU and UK.

There are two narratives about China and net zero. For the first, go to the Northern Shaanxi Mine. There, in China’s biggest coalmine, a mountain’s worth of carbon has been pulled out of a scarred, dusty, black hellscape. It is still being pulled out. Last year, China started construction of 94 gigawatts of coal-fuelled power plants. To put that in scale, it is enough to power Britain’s grid twice over.

In this first narrative, while the West frets about wind turbines and veganism, here trucks the size of houses shift dirty fuel for a superpower still going all in on coal.

For the second narrative, go to the Kubuqi desert of Inner Mongolia, China. There, across an area the size of New York, all you can see is solar panels. They sit, silent, turning sunshine on worthless ground into valuable clean energy to be sent south. Last year, China had 500GW of wind and solar projects under construction.

While the West argues about the cost of renewables, in this narrative China is building more than the rest of the world combined. It is monopolising silicon and lithium. It is electrifying everything it can electrify. Cars. Industry. Trains. It is winning the next great industrial revolution: to become the world’s first electrostate.

Which narrative is true? Both. It is indeed building a coal station a week — give or take. But its biggest bet by far is on renewables.

The proximal reason its emissions are falling, despite coal capacity going up, is in part because of something else entirely. Construction is falling too. A real estate crash means less carbon-intensive cement is being poured into the foundations of apartment blocks.

But, there is hope this is more than a blip. Ma said it would be wrong to view the coal plants as a traditional part of the grid. “China is going through a very difficult, but crucial, transition,” he said. “How we adapt to a high penetration of renewable energy is a new challenge.”

As Britain knows, when it is cloudy and the wind does not blow, you need a backup. Batteries and other storage are not ready at scale yet. This is why, in the UK, we still have so many gas plants — which a lot of the time sit unused. “So, yes, there are more coal plants, but we can see quite rapid reduction of coal generation hours,” Ma said. “We are paying a high price for energy security — building all this redundancy.

Can we believe the statistics, about those generation levels — and emissions in general? They are compiled from official sources, by Lauri Myllyvirta, from Finland’s Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

Rich Collett-White, from Carbon Tracker Initiative, a think tank that analyses the energy transition, said that while there were always questions about how much we can trust Chinese statistics, he and other analysts thought the trajectory made sense.

He said: “A lot of the data that’s out there is based on customs, and tracking commodity flows. That’s fairly straightforward to verify, and I think would be quite difficult to fake.”

It also fits with their policies. That Chinese emissions would peak around now should not be a surprise. It is exactly what President Xi promised. The country pledged to start reducing emissions before 2030, and reach net zero by 2060. Some observers expect the Chinese leader to announce a new target for 2035 at the UN general assembly in September.

Richard Folland, also from Carbon Tracker, said that we often ignored this in the UK debates. He added: “The approach the Chinese government take on targets is that they tend to underpromise and overdeliver.” For him, being five years ahead of schedule makes sense. “It is important. It is a pivotal moment when China starts bending that curve downwards.”

Is this job done, then? Globally, said Helm, the situation is dire. The concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere — ultimately the only statistic that matters, and the only one you can absolutely trust — keeps on going up regardless. But, he conceded, “this is better than if China was going the other way”.

And for Ma there is a message too to the rest of the world. He said: “Now is a very important moment. We hope there will be recognition that actions are being made in China.” If, sometimes, the rest of the world has used supposed Chinese inaction as an argument for their own inaction, he said, the reverse would not be true.

He added: “We will keep on doing this by ourselves. But if there’s a chance to work together, with those who care about this issue, hopefully we can.”

Change will not be fast. Over the next year, China will once again emit a staggering amount of carbon. Of every three carbon dioxide molecules put into the atmosphere, one will be Chinese.

There is, critics point out, enough coal power being built that that could easily remain unchanged.

Yet there is another China too. In the deserts of Inner Mongolia, endless solar farms catch the light. Stand on the shoreline of the Yellow Sea, and the sunrise that once scattered red in the air pollution glows red on the spinning blades of turbines.

It is the biggest bet by far that a different kind of power is possible, and with it a riposte in steel and silicon to the argument, “But China …”.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F3d40b9c6-ebb9-49fb-a518-77af31bb4752.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-07-25 14:04:52.587241

(Louisiana First) — President Donald Trump granted air pollution rule exemptions to multiple Louisiana chemical facilities.

A release from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) said the facilities will be exempt from changes to the EPA’s Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HON NESHAP). According to the EPA, these air pollutants can cause cancer.

A July 17 proclamation from the White House named over 10 Louisiana plants granted a two-year exemption, including Shell Geismar, BASF Corporation, Denka Performance Elastomer and more.

Per Trump’s proclamation, the final HON rule published in May 2024 “imposes substantial burdens” on chemical manufacturers currently operating under strict regulations.

“The HON Rule imposes requirements that assume uniform technological availability across facilities, despite significant variation in site conditions, permitting realities, and equipment configurations. A disruption of this capacity would weaken key supply chains, increase dependence on foreign producers, and impair our ability to respond effectively in a time of crisis. These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to America’s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness,” according to the proclamation.

LDEQ Secretary Courtney Burdette said the agency was aware some plants applied for the exemption, and state-level leadership was monitoring. Facilities would be required to implement fenceline monitoring if operations involve any six high-risk chemicals.

“LDEQ will continue to enforce existing HON rules that still apply to these plants with no changes in how the agency oversees their operations. I appreciate the Administration carefully reviewing the Louisiana facilities mentioned and ensuring that companies here are following proper regulations,” Burdette said.

Congressman Troy A. Carter called the move to grant exemptions “reckless” in a Friday statement.

Read his full statement below:

“As the U.S. Congressman from Louisiana—where most of these petrochemical facilities are located—I find it appalling that this administration shows so little regard for the health of communities, families, and workers living near these plants.

“I’ve always believed that industry and communities can coexist—but only when the safety and well-being of people come first. No one should have to risk their life or health for a job. Every person deserves clean air and safe water.

“Granting twelve petrochemical companies in Louisiana a two-year exemption from a 2024 rule that aimed to reduce pollution and cancer risk is reckless. That rule was designed to lower emissions of toxic chemicals like ethylene oxide and chloroprene by over 6,200 tons a year and reduce cancer risk by up to 96% for nearby communities.

“Polluters and violators should not get a free pass. We can protect jobs and protect people—but profits should never come at the cost of public health. I am committed to holding these companies—and this administration—accountable.”

The Tijuana River begins in Baja California, Mexico, and discharges into the ocean at Imperial Beach.
According to the agreement, Mexico will shake loose $93 million in money it previously committed, known as “Minute 238 funds.” Deadlines for several long-discussed improvements will also come sooner — some this year — it says.
One example is the 10-million gallons per day of treated effluent that currently flows into the Tijuana River from the Arturo Herrera and La Morita wastewater treatment plants and will now go to a site upstream of the Rodriguez Dam, southeast of Tijuana.
“This is a massive step forward for the Tijuana River,” said Tom Kiernan, president and chief executive of the environmental group American Rivers.","Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the Trump administration to “a permanent, 100% solution to the decades-old Tijuana River sewage crisis” in a new agreement signed with Mexico on Thursday.

“I smelled for myself that foul smell that so many residents of Southern California have been complaining about for so long,” Zeldin said, adding that President Trump was highly motivated after hearing from Navy Seals who must train in the polluted waters of the Pacific Ocean where the Tijuana River meets the sea.

“Today, what we are demonstrating is that, yes, it can be done,” said Mexico Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources Alicia Bárcena, preparing to sign the memorandum of understanding, or MOU.

Pollution in the 120-mile long river has been so egregious that recent studies have shown that even the air above the river or the spray where it reaches the surf is dangerous.

The Tijuana River begins in Baja California, Mexico, and discharges into the ocean at Imperial Beach. The pollution consists of sewage, including drugs and pharmaceuticals that people ingest, plus industrial discharges.

According to the agreement, Mexico will shake loose $93 million in money it previously committed, known as “Minute 238 funds.” Deadlines for several long-discussed improvements will also come sooner — some this year — it says. One example is the 10-million gallons per day of treated effluent that currently flows into the Tijuana River from the Arturo Herrera and La Morita wastewater treatment plants and will now go to a site upstream of the Rodriguez Dam, southeast of Tijuana.

Zeldin said technical experts, leadership and U.S. staffers identified these as high priorities. The MOU also commits the two countries to taking into account Tijuana’s growing population, to make sure that infrastructure improvements are not outstripped by changes on the ground.

“This is a massive step forward for the Tijuana River,” said Tom Kiernan, president and chief executive of the environmental group American Rivers. It has listed the river as the second most endangered in the U.S.

Kristan Culbert, associate director of California river conservation at American Rivers, said she hoped the MOU negotiated by this administration “will be the catalyst for a major turnaround for this river. The people and wildlife that depend on it deserve clean water and healthy ecosystems.”

San Diego County Supervisor Paloma Aguirre was more cautious. She said the agreement does not necessarily address the range of dangerous chemicals the river is carrying. As it flows to the U.S. side, it may have gone through a sewage treatment plant, but that may only remove bacterial contaminants, not industrial pollutants.

“Unless this pollution is eliminated at the source, our community will continue to suffer,” the supervisor, who is also the former mayor of Imperial Beach, said. Her concerns are backed up by recent research.

Yet Aguirre also expressed optimism. “Today’s agreement is a sign that our voices have been heard. I hope to see real progress in the next few months, and not the next few years.”

Zeldin stressed cooperation with his counterpart, Bárcena. When asked about leverage that will assure changes are made, Zeldin cited money that could be withheld by the U.S.

He emphasized it’s the first agreement between the two governments under this administration. “We’re very proud of that,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a29829b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5257x2760+0+373/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F06%2Fe43d261e432caf3f1e9fcf658368%2F1513105-me-tijuana-river-lrj-edit-0001.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:34.469275

All regions of the U.S. will be more vulnerable to blackouts, according to the report.
In a large part of the West, including Oregon, Idaho and Washington, blackouts could average nearly 18 hours a year.

The grid reliability report reflects the Trump administration’s embrace of fossil fuels and takes aim at state policies that call for an increasing share of electricity to come from wind and solar.

Absent intervention, the nation’s power grid will be unable to meet the demand of industries and data centers needed to win the artificial intelligence arms race, according to the report.

“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power like coal and natural gas,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

President Trump directed the Energy Department to do the report, which borrowed from a previous study by the North American Electric Reliability Corp. The report looked at planned closures of coal and natural gas plants and projected what would happen if they were almost entirely replaced by wind and solar installations.

All regions of the U.S. will be more vulnerable to blackouts, according to the report. Hours of inadequate power nationwide would increase to 817 hours a year from the current eight hours, according to the report.

The risk of blackouts would vary by region. In California, power shortages could increase to seven hours from zero hours now. In a large part of the West, including Oregon, Idaho and Washington, blackouts could average nearly 18 hours a year. Other parts of the country, particularly portions of the Northeast, would be more prone to blackouts, according to the report.

Washington’s clean-energy law requires utilities to phase out coal and natural gas. The state’s only coal plant will close at the end of the year. The law doesn’t outright forbid new natural gas plants, but the prospects for building one are “highly suspect,” said Nicolas Garcia, Washington Public Utility Districts Association policy director.

“I’m not sure how one would go about putting one on the ground given today’s regulatory environment,” he said.

Washington has come close to having too little electricity in recent years during extraordinary cold spells and heat waves. The Energy Department study confirms other grid reliability forecasts and shouldn’t be dismissed as a partisan report, said Kurt Miller, Northwest Public Power Association executive director.

Washington state’s energy policy has been “climate-centric,” but should shift to “reliability-centric,” he said.

“I think our policy currently lacks balance,” Miller said. “The new state policy should be that before we shut down any on-demand generation there has to be something with similar characteristics to take its place.”

Washington’s official energy strategy, developed by the state Department of Commerce, counts on Montana and Wyoming transmitting massive amounts of wind energy via new transmission lines by mid-century.

“We are relying on actions in other parts of the country to keep our lights on, and that’s a bit of a concern,” Garcia said.

The state energy strategy continues to provide valuable guidance to policy makers, Amelia Lamb, Commerce Department spokeswoman said in an email.

“We continue to see that the best path to affordable and reliable energy for our families and our economy is one built on energy efficiency, gradual conversion to electricity for transportation, buildings and industry, and expansion of our transmission and clean power generation system,” she said.

Even if Montana and Wyoming were willing to supply wind power to Washington, federal intervention may hold them back.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will terminate tax credits for wind and solar projects that begin construction after 2027. Trump has signed executive orders to increase coal production and ordered federal agencies to withhold permits for new wind projects.

The order has shut down wind development and threatens state climate goals, according to a federal lawsuit by blue states, including Oregon and Washington.",https://capitalpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/07/Energy-Shortage-Photo-2025-08-01.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 18:05:52.911389

""You have a problem now, and you have got to start somewhere.” For now the water keeps rising, one sunny day at a time.","The sun was setting in a cloudless sky when salt water crept across Canal Drive, pooling over storm drains and glinting beneath mailboxes. No hurricane. No nor’easter. Just an ordinary high tide riding on a higher sea.

On days like this, parts of Carolina Beach can feel stranded. Researchers told the town council this week that salt water reached its streets on more than 60 days over the past year. Down East, some communities now see water on the road roughly one day in three.

Those counts come from the Sunny Day Flooding Project, a multiyear collaboration of scientists who lowered sensors into storm drains and paired them with time‑lapse cameras to capture what offshore tide gauges miss: tides forcing brine backward through aging pipes, a brief rainstorm trapped behind a swollen high tide, wind piling water onto a shallow sound.

Each “flood day” is any amount of water on the roadway. Even a thin briny film, the team says, corrodes cars and asphalt, carries petrochemicals and fecal bacteria back into nearby marshes, closes roads to ambulances and delivery trucks, and catches visitors unaware.

“It’s flooding a lot more on land than we previously thought, and it’s impacting people’s daily routines,” said Katherine Anarde, a coastal engineer at North Carolina State University.

>> May 2024: NC State researchers find increased fecal contamination in coastal waters due to sunny day flooding

This week’s briefing drew in part on a peer‑reviewed study published in June by Anarde and University of North Carolina planning scholar Miyuki Hino. Using one year of data from three North Carolina towns, the study found land‑based sensors recorded 26 flood days in Beaufort, 65 in Carolina Beach and 128 in Sea Level. Federal tide‑gauge thresholds often missed the majority of those events or, in some cases, overestimated them. “Our study shows that [the tide‑gauge] approach does not accurately capture how often flooding takes place or how long those floods last,” Hino said.

For longtime resident Bob Ponzony, it’s more than an inconvenience. Standing beside his canal‑side home, he grew emotional as he listed the dolphins, manatees and crabs that frequent the waterway. When the street floods, he said, “all of the pollution from the cars and the bug spray and the trash cans washes back into the harbor. We’re stewards of that body of water.”

Carolina Beach leaders are wrestling with cost. “It is an eye opener. It is devastating, because there really is no solution,” Council member Jay Healy said after the presentation. A frequently discussed bulkhead project along a vulnerable stretch would cost about $4 million for 85 properties, or roughly $47,000 per lot. Sequencing pumps, higher roads and other defenses could push the bill toward $20 million and still would not be a permanent solution. During a flood, Healy warned, an ambulance might not reach a resident in distress.

Climate change is the backdrop. Rising seas mean tides that once lapped below the curb now reach into stormwater networks built decades ago for lower water. Local modeling shared Tuesday used federal projections: roughly 3 inches of sea‑level rise by 2030, about 7 inches sometime in the 2040s or 2050s, a foot between 2050 and 2070. Tides that today stop at the edge of the pavement will, within a decade or two, cover it more deeply and more often. Flood days that are now disruptive could grow into longer closures with greater health and economic risks.

Researchers emphasize there is no single fix. In Carolina Beach, tides and wind dominate; in rural Carteret County high groundwater and clogged ditches turn modest rains into street‑blocking pools. That variability, Hino said, means “no one size fits all solution.” Instead communities can “buy time” by sequencing strategies: maintain or replace one‑way valves that fail when reeds or oysters jam them open, add targeted bulkheads, install pumps, elevate roads or in some cases consider moving infrastructure out of harm’s way.

Frequent tidal flooding matters has an inland impact as well. Vacationers from the Triangle and the Piedmont pour money into coastal economies. As flood days multiply, public dollars from across North Carolina are likely to help fund defenses or emergency response. More accurate measurements, the scientists argue, give towns evidence to compete for those resources and to weigh which investments protect both ecosystems and property values.

“With many things related to climate change, the best time to act was maybe 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, but the next best time to act is today,"" Hino said. ""You have a problem now, and you have got to start somewhere.”

The last surge of investment started in 2021, when the market for renewable energy and other climate technologies looked very different. Favorable policies under President Joe Biden bolstered the sector and made it a hotbed of activity even for venture capitalists who weren’t previously involved in the space.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, for example, invested billions in clean energy, electric vehicles, and other climate-friendly technologies. That act built on tax credits for electric vehicles, carbon sequestration, and other initiatives provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2021. On the venture capitalist side, those policies led to expensive deals that pushed the annual VC deal value over $60.5 billion in 2021 and $53.8 billion in 2022, according to the PitchBook report.

Now some climate-favorable policies and tax breaks are gone under President Donald Trump, and tariffs are raising the cost of clean energy in the U.S. (China remains the leading supplier of solar panels, wind turbine components, and lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency.)

Many “tourist investors” who temporarily entered the climate space during its period of high growth have taken these changes as a sign to scale back investments or leave the space. This, combined with declines in the number of VC deals in the tech sector more broadly, has added to climate tech’s troubles.

However, venture capitalists who specialize in climate tech investments aren’t worried. In fact, they see opportunities for growth that may outweigh the financial risks these policy and market changes bring.

Part of their confidence in the sector comes from having experienced past boom-bust cycles in climate technology markets. The CleanTech 1.0 era—a period in the mid-2000s when venture capitalists heavily staked renewable energy startups that ultimately failed—was a formative experience for many of today’s climate tech investors. They observed not only how these businesses failed but also how others succeeded in their wake as the need for climate-friendly solutions grows.

“Climate change is the macro of all macro trends,” says Andrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures. “Maybe not as a human, but as an investor, the macro on climate is amazing. The challenge becomes greater by the day and that means the opportunities just become greater by the day.”

Additionally, many of the changes on the policy side have greater impacts on mature industries that venture capitalists are less directly involved in, says Matt Eggers, managing director at Prelude Ventures. Venture capitalists tend to invest in startups and other early-stage companies with potential to grow.

While there is always innovation going on behind the scenes of mature industries, some that are well-established (like traditional solar and wind technologies) are less appealing to investors looking for groundbreaking new technologies or unexplored areas of industries.

What many dedicated climate tech investors are looking for remains the same as when the sector hit its peak three years ago—new or improved technologies that are scalable and have strong market potential.

Last year, North America remained the largest market for climate tech investment, and it saw big gains in the energy sector, according to the PitchBook report. In particular, growth was notable in dispatchable energy sources whose output is easily increased or decreased to meet demand, and in infrastructure to produce, store, and transport hydrogen. Similarly, the first quarter of this year saw more investments in energy, with large fusion and nuclear deals.

“We’ve got technology that we’re really excited about in the portfolio,” Eggers says. He and Beebe both see opportunities in companies using electrification and artificial intelligence to transform the climate tech sector. Beyond the technology, Eggers adds that investors look for companies with strong leadership teams and ideas that appeal to big or fast-growing markets, particularly those that have been disrupted by the types of policy and economic changes plaguing many industries today.

“When there’s disruption, there’s opportunity,” Eggers says. This extends to the investment space as well, where investors are finding promising companies to fund in this now less-crowded area of the venture market.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-91368908-climate-tech-vc-money-2025_e6c69d.jpg",N,,2025-07-25 12:08:06.281649

Africa’s trade and logistics systems, historically focused on exporting raw materials, could be entering a new era driven by renewable energy value chains. This is a key finding of the report, ""Africa Strategic Intelligence Brief: Unpacking an African Renewables-Based Economy,"" published in June by the REN21 network. The report analyzes how resources, trade, policies, and finance interact in building a renewables-based economy.

REN21 highlights several initiatives. One example is the special economic zone between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which aims to process nickel locally for battery production. Morocco is involved through its electric vehicle manufacturing capabilities, and the report sees this as an example of inter-African cooperation based on industrial complementarities.

On the electricity front, regional markets are expanding. By 2040, the African Single Electricity Market could become the largest electricity trading platform, primarily for renewables. The integration of renewables into regional power pools is presented as a driver of growing energy exchange. In this context, the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) illustrates its role in supporting systems affected by droughts and serving as a backup for aging coal-fired power plants.

REN21 also stresses the importance of aligning national, regional, and continental industrial policies, particularly through the Africa Green Industrialisation Initiative (AGII) and Africa’s Green Mineral Strategy (AGMS). These initiatives aim to strengthen local processing and support the manufacturing of green technologies in Africa.

The continent's resources are considerable. It holds 45% of the world’s technical potential in renewable energy and a significant share of critical mineral reserves for the energy transition.

,Congress,2025-07-25 15:02:51+00:00,Inside Climate News,Activists Pledge to Resist Any Federal Effort to Lift Fracking Ban in Delaware River Basin,"Jon Hurdle, Jerry Redfern, Capital & Main",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/25072025/activists-will-resist-any-federal-effort-to-lift-delaware-river-fracking-ban/,"“The Delaware River frack ban was put in place with public participation, backed by science and fact to be protective of the Delaware River watershed and its communities,” the pledge says in part.
Bresnahan criticized the fracking ban earlier this year at the event attended by the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The Delaware River Basin extends across four states, but only two—Pennsylvania and New York—also contain the gas-rich Marcellus Shale.
In February, a federal judge dismissed a suit by landowners in Wayne County, northeast of Scranton, seeking to overturn the DRBC’s fracking ban in their area.
If the Trump administration finds a way to lift the Delaware Basin frack ban, it will also find activists pledged to resist it, said Carluccio.","Fears that the Trump administration is looking for ways to lift a longstanding ban on fracking for natural gas in the densely populated Delaware River Basin—which includes part of Pennsylvania—have prompted environmentalists to seek public support for a commitment to defend the regulation.

Activists are promoting a “Pledge of Resistance and Protection” of the watershed in response to what they see as a series of attempts by the administration and some of its supporters in Congress to hobble the Delaware River Basin Commission, an interstate agency that formally banned fracking in the region in 2021 after a moratorium that began a decade earlier.

“The Delaware River frack ban was put in place with public participation, backed by science and fact to be protective of the Delaware River watershed and its communities,” the pledge says in part. “We must continue to stand strong for our environment, and to uphold the pillars of law, science and facts that helped the DRBC make the sound decision that the watershed will not survive, nor will we, if fracking is allowed.”

The Trump administration hasn’t made specific moves to target the ban. But environmentalists’ confidence in the rule has been shaken after multiple actions by President Donald Trump to increase fossil fuel production, including declaring an “energy emergency” and directing agencies to roll back federal policies that “impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” such as natural gas.

Environmentalists were further spooked after U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a new Republican congressman from northeast Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in May that would require a federal review of the DRBC and other commissions in the Mid-Atlantic, including responsibilities that overlap with federal obligations, and recommend any reforms. Bresnahan criticized the fracking ban earlier this year at the event attended by the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Delaware River Basin extends across four states, but only two—Pennsylvania and New York—also contain the gas-rich Marcellus Shale. New York banned fracking statewide in 2014, citing health risks.

Environmentalists say that allowing the industry to drill in Pennsylvania’s part of the watershed would risk contaminating drinking water for some 15 million people, including in Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, with toxic chemicals used in fracking. The critics point to many instances of air and water pollution in heavily fracked areas such as southwest Pennsylvania, and they say that increased production will also worsen climate change.

The gas industry says it protects drinking-water aquifers from fracking chemicals by encasing drills in multiple layers of steel and concrete, and complies with all state and federal laws on fracking safety.

Pennsylvania’s gas industry and its supporters in the state legislature have unsuccessfully fought the DRBC’s frack ban through legislation and litigation for years, arguing that landowners in two watershed counties should be allowed to lease their property to companies active in the rest of the state’s Marcellus Shale. In February, a federal judge dismissed a suit by landowners in Wayne County, northeast of Scranton, seeking to overturn the DRBC’s fracking ban in their area.

The Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents Pennsylvania’s natural gas industry, said it wants the Delaware River Basin fracking ban to be lifted, but has not “formally communicated” with the Trump administration on the issue.

“The Marcellus Shale Coalition strongly supports lifting the DRBC’s unjust ban on safe, responsible natural gas development. This ban has long violated the property rights of Pennsylvania landowners and ignores nearly two decades of demonstrated, highly regulated shale development in the Commonwealth—including in the neighboring Susquehanna River Basin,” coalition spokesman Patrick Henderson said in a statement.

Still, a study released in 2019 by the University of Delaware found that the watershed represents only 3.3 percent of the Marcellus Shale. The study found that the financial value of potentially recoverable natural gas in that part of the field is dwarfed by the estimated value of the area’s drinking water supply, forests and recreation.

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there,” said Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center and one of the authors of the report. “The gas, which is a fossil fuel, is a non-renewable resource that can be exhausted pretty quickly. Protect the drinking water first because it’s much more valuable.”

In banning fracking, the DRBC “acted appropriately” to protect the interests of the people who live in the watershed, Kauffman said. He plans to update the study this year.

One Trump administration move involving the DRBC added to environmentalists’ jitters that more might be coming. The agency’s federal representative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, proposed a resolution last month to end future federal funding for DRBC work on climate change, and for its policy of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. The resolution was unanimously approved by governors of the watershed states—New Jersey and Delaware in addition to Pennsylvania and New York, all run by Democratic administrations.

The surprising agreement prompted speculation that the governors were picking their battles with Trump. The federal government has mostly failed to pay its share of DRBC’s running costs since the 1980s, and so the funding cut would have little effect.

DRBC’s executive director, Kristen Kavanagh, said the agency has received no federal funding through the Army Corps since the resolution. But she said the DRBC’s Advisory Committee on Climate Change, a panel of 18 experts, including academics and water-company executives, will continue its work. Its next scheduled meeting is Aug. 27.

Bresnahan’s commission review bill, meanwhile, has advanced in committee and awaits a full vote in the House.

His office did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the bill. But Tracy Carluccio with the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, who instigated the pledge, called the legislation a ploy to interfere with the running of an agency that has prompted a sharp improvement in water quality since its inception in 1961, and reinforced that through its ban on fracking.

“This attempt to poke around the DRBC’s inner workings is nothing more than a politically motivated witch hunt, designed to intimidate and disrupt the DRBC,” Carluccio said.

DRBC spokespeople declined to comment on the bill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also did not respond to requests for comment. But its administrator, Lee Zeldin, attended a meeting in Northeast Pennsylvania with Bresnahan and some pro-fracking state lawmakers in March, according to a press release from the congressman and a story from the River Reporter, a news site in a New York community just over the Pennsylvania state line.

Asked there whether the Trump administration would try to open up drilling in Northeast Pennsylvania, Zeldin said, “President Trump is someone I feel confident we can approach [with] any good idea [and] his response is going to be that he wants to get it done as quickly as possible,” the news site reported.

If the Trump administration finds a way to lift the Delaware Basin frack ban, it will also find activists pledged to resist it, said Carluccio. By mid-July, the document had about 1,100 signers online.

“We have found that people want to make positive commitments that affirm personal power,” she said. “The pledge is like an oath or a vow founded on a person’s allegiance to the issue. We know that there is strong and resolute dedication from people to never allowing fracking to occur here and the pledge is a public statement that each person makes to stake their ground.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1465625246-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:06:23.708349

“The NRC’s approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy,” Holtec President Kelly Trice said. Palisades would be the first U.S. plant to be brought back online after decommissioning.

NRC noted that there are still several licensing actions under review “and additional requirements that need to be met before the plant can start up under the original operating license, which would expire March 24, 2031.”

The nuclear regulator also said it has approved the transfer of operating authority for the plant and its independent spent fuel storage facility from Holtec Decommissioning International to Palisades Energy.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-25 15:01:58+00:00,The Nevada Independent,"For future growth, Nevada needs solar. Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' won't help.","Amy Alonzo, thenevadaindependent.com, amy-alonzo",,,,,https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/for-future-growth-nevada-needs-solar-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-wont-help,"Most of that is in the form of battery storage (more than 54,000 megawatts) and solar (more than 72,000 megawatts).
Nevada currently produces about 15,000 megawatts of power annually through renewable sources, according to the Governor’s Office of Energy.
While adding additional red tape for solar and other renewable energy development, the department is streamlining processes for traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources such as coal.
Residential solar The cuts also affect residential solar credits — they are slated to expire at the end of this year.
“Nevada, despite the whims of Washington, has long decided clean energy is a bipartisan issue to get behind,” Olson said.","Increasing power bills and significant cutbacks in Nevada’s burgeoning solar industry are among some of the consequences that clean energy experts say to expect from the recent passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The act repeals nearly all of the estimated hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits enacted under former President Joe Biden and rescinds any unobligated funds for clean energy and climate programs created during his presidency. Biden enacted various ambitious climate-related acts in his effort to reduce national emissions, including offering substantial tax credits on utility-scale and residential solar construction.

Although the credits were set to eventually expire, their accelerated cancellation (some as soon as this fall) could have outsized effects on Nevada, a state that leads the nation in solar generation per capita and relies on solar energy for about a third of all power produced within the state.

Clean energy advocates worry that rolling back the credits will push Nevada to rely even more heavily on imported fossil fuels such as natural gas, raising electricity bills higher in Nevada than in states that produce their own natural gas. Experts are predicting a loss of 140 gigawatts of solar production nationwide through 2035, and, as a result, the average American’s energy costs are expected to rise by about $280 over the next decade. In Nevada, experts project even larger increases, with bills rising by as much as $320 by 2035.

At the same time, the state’s demand for power isn’t slowing. NV Energy is forecasting “unprecedented load growth” in the coming decades with much of that pressure coming from industry and data centers. But if solar production slows, it could be harder to whet the state’s appetite for power given that solar is the leading power source being added to the national grid.

“In an age where we need to make it easier to build and integrate a diversity of technologies, this really shoots the country as a whole … in the foot,” said Emilie Olson, principal at Advanced Energy United, an industry association pushing for a 100 percent transition to renewable energy.

A scrambled equation

Since 2022, federal clean energy tax credits have spurred more than $15.5 billion in investment and created more than 21,000 jobs in Nevada, according to Steve Hamile, chair of the Nevada Solar Association. Nevada leads the nation with the most solar jobs per capita — for every 100,000 residents, roughly 269 are employed in a solar-related industry, such as installation, manufacturing and recycling.

Nevada ranked fourth in the nation for total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined last year, and there are more than 130,000 megawatts of proposed renewable energy development set to come online in Nevada through 2030. Most of that is in the form of battery storage (more than 54,000 megawatts) and solar (more than 72,000 megawatts).

Nevada currently produces about 15,000 megawatts of power annually through renewable sources, according to the Governor’s Office of Energy. One megawatt is equivalent to the power required to serve about 600 households, according to NV Energy.

Under the new law, utility-scale solar tax credits previously set to expire at the end of 2032 — as well as other credits for renewable sources such as wind — will be rolled back much sooner; now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to qualify for credits.

But what it means for a project to be “under construction” is open to interpretation, leading Trump to issue an executive order outlining the details of what projects must have accomplished to qualify for the credits. That definition is expected to be released by the U.S. Treasury next month; until then, uncertainty remains, according to Hamile.

In the wake of the executive order, the Department of the Interior also announced any decisions relating to utility-scale solar projects — whether they be related to leases, biological opinions, construction or operating plans — must receive specific approval from the department.

The move “is leveling the playing field” for cost-effective and secure energy sources such as natural gas and coal, according to the department, ending “regulatory favoritism towards unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

Olson disagrees, saying the pending clarification from the Treasury combined with the Department of Interior order “really scrambles the equation” for what rollout of upcoming utility-scale solar projects looks like.

While adding additional red tape for solar and other renewable energy development, the department is streamlining processes for traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources such as coal.

Residential solar

The cuts also affect residential solar credits — they are slated to expire at the end of this year.

There are roughly 135,000 solar customers in the state, according to NV Energy; Hamile predicts there will be a rush of people trying to take advantage of the residential solar tax credits during the next several months followed by a sharp drop in sales at the start of next year. But it’s not just sales that will be affected, he said.

“It’s not only a labor-intensive business, it’s an equipment intensive business,” he said. “The ancillary support around solar companies is extensive, so the impact will be felt in a wide variety of industries.”

Combined, the state is likely to lose as many as 7,000 solar-related jobs over the next decade, according to Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Increased load forecasts

With the shortened timelines for credits, some solar and storage projects already under construction in Nevada could be completed, but dozens of others in the early stages of development face what Olson says are major hurdles. As a result, she says Nevadans will see a mismatch in energy supply and demand by the end of the decade that will consequently increase prices and see the state rely more on natural gas or other forms of imported electricity.

That mismatch will be driven in part because NV Energy’s load forecasts — the amount of power it projects that it needs to be able to supply — is expected to grow substantially over the next two decades.

The state already relies heavily on renewable resources, but that solar generation barely makes a dent in the amount of power the state uses. Nevada consumes more than 11 times the amount of energy it produces, in part because it doesn’t mine coal or produce natural gas.

The utility’s load forecasts are expected to increase about 2 percent in Southern Nevada and more than 4 percent across Northern Nevada over the next two decades, according to NV Energy’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan.

What the utility is calling “unprecedented load growth” is primarily being driven by roughly three dozen large-scale projects across the state, including 12 data centers. The projects will need about 7,600 megawatts of additional power, with the dozen data centers requesting the bulk of that — 5,900 megawatts by 2033.

An NV Energy spokesperson said in a statement that the utility is continuing to “evaluate” federal legislation and executive orders; the company also requires new data centers to secure an energy supply commitment covering transmission and distribution costs prior to the new projects being built.

The need for more energy comes after state lawmakers effectively pushed the utility to shutter its last coal plants more than a decade ago and increased the state’s renewable energy portfolio standard, the percentage of energy that must come from renewable sources.

Utility-scale resources such as solar are attractive because of their relatively quick buildout time of just a handful of years in comparison to natural gas and geothermal plants, Olson said, pointing out that those power sources won’t be able to “scale up for near-term demand.”

That is, in part, because there is a substantial lag time in building out new gas plants because of a multiple-year backlog in turbines needed to power the plants, O’Brien said.

“Solar is the cheapest and most effective way to build energy production in Nevada. De-insentivizing the utilities from doing so is really detrimental,” O’Brien said. “What we’re seeing is in the next four or five years [is] we’re not going to be able to add in new gas plants to fill in the gap left by solar and wind.”

In February, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasted that 63 gigawatts of new utility-scale energy would be added to the U.S. power grid this year, but only about 4 gigawatts would be from natural gas — the rest were from wind, solar and battery storage.

O’ Brien and Olson pointed out that it is now incumbent on the state to push forward policies incentivizing renewable development.

“Nevada, despite the whims of Washington, has long decided clean energy is a bipartisan issue to get behind,” Olson said. “It’s smart finances and the state has so many resources.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2023/07/Granholm061121_001.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:05:20.864859

“We believe that shortfalls from auto batteries can be offset by the expansion of the ESS business, while minimizing fixed costs by reallocating resources and improving cost efficiency,” Lee said. “We expect meaningful profit improvement in the second half.”

Article content

Operating profit for the second quarter ended June 30 was 492.2 billion won ($358 million) while revenue was 5.6 trillion won, both in line with preliminary results announced earlier this month. LG Energy’s shares fell as much as 3.1% in early trading.

The company sees at least 20% annual growth in the US for ESS batteries over the next few years on the back of surging electricity needs and AI data centers, according to Kim Min Soo, who leads LG Energy’s battery planning and management department.

Article content

In May, LG Energy began producing ESS batteries at its plant in Michigan. It aims to expand annual production capacity to 17 GWh by the end of this year and 30 GWh by 2026, which would entail a conversion of some electric vehicle battery lines. Such localized production also makes the company eligible for investment tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

An ESS manufacturing hub in North America is a response to the “shift there toward non-Chinese suppliers,” Lee said, adding that LG Energy is currently in talks with multiple customers for “meaningful” contracts.

The relatively upbeat assessment contrasts with an increasingly gloomy outlook for the global EV sector. European sales of battery-electric cars grew at the slowest pace this year in June, prompting automakers to call for further measures to stimulate demand.

Article content

Meanwhile in the US, where the EV tax credit will expire in September, President Donald Trump’s import tariffs continue to squeeze carmakers. Tesla Inc., an LG Energy customer, just had one of its worst quarters in over a decade and Elon Musk warned of difficult times ahead.

Article content

Jung Jaewook, vice president for planning and management at LG Energy, said Europe will continue to pose challenges in the latter half due chiefly to the intensifying competition with Chinese rivals. China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, is the world’s biggest supplier of EV cells, while No. 2 is BYD Co., also Chinese.

Again, the company seeks to respond by switching some production lines over to ESS batteries at its plant in Poland and targeting the high-end market.

Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings report, coupled with Elon Musk's blunt warnings about “a few rough quarters,” has sent shockwaves through investor sentiment. While the company's revenue narrowly beat expectations and earnings per share aligned with forecasts, the broader implications of its performance—declining regulatory credit revenue, expiring tax incentives, and rising tariffs—have raised urgent questions about the sustainability of EV growth. For investors, this moment demands a careful balancing act: recognizing near-term risks while evaluating the long-term strategic positioning of EV stocks in a rapidly shifting landscape.

Short-Term Risks: A Perfect Storm of Policy and Profit Pressures

Tesla's Q2 2025 results revealed a sharp decline in auto revenue, dropping from $19.9 billion in Q2 2024 to $16.7 billion this year. A key culprit: the 51% year-over-year drop in revenue from auto regulatory credits, which fell to $439 million from $890 million. This decline reflects the impending expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit under the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a policy shift that has forced Tesla to accelerate sales before the incentive vanishes at the end of September.

Compounding the issue are Trump-era tariffs, which have added $300 million in costs to Tesla's operations. The company's CFO, Vaibhav Taneja, acknowledged during the earnings call that these tariffs, combined with the loss of regulatory credit revenue, will pressure margins in the short term. Meanwhile, shifting consumer preferences—particularly a growing demand for hybrids and more affordable models—have further strained Tesla's ability to maintain its market dominance.

The market reacted swiftly to these headwinds. Tesla's stock fell more than 8% in post-earnings trading, marking a new low for the year. Analysts at UBS downgraded the stock to “Sell,” while Morgan Stanley maintained a cautious “Top Pick” rating, emphasizing the need for patience as Tesla navigates this transition period.

Investor Sentiment: A Tug-of-War Between Optimism and Caution

Investor sentiment has been split. On one hand, Musk's focus on AI, robotics, and robotaxi services has reignited long-term optimism. The launch of Tesla's robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to other U.S. cities by year-end highlight the company's ambition to transition from an EV manufacturer to a tech-driven infrastructure platform. Musk's assertion that FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles are “10 times safer” than conventional cars has also bolstered confidence in the company's autonomous driving roadmap.

On the other hand, near-term challenges loom large. The expiration of EV tax credits, coupled with Trump-era tariffs, has created a volatile environment for automakers. Tesla's global delivery numbers fell 13.5% year-over-year in Q2, and its U.S. market share dropped to 43.4%, a significant decline in a sector once dominated by the company. With production delays for its more affordable “Model 2” and rising competition from Chinese automakers like BYD and Xpeng, investors are bracing for a period of uncertainty.

Long-Term Strategic Positioning: Can Tesla Weather the Storm?

Despite the immediate headwinds, Tesla's long-term vision remains ambitious. The company's investments in AI, robotics, and energy infrastructure—exemplified by its Optimus humanoid robot and the expansion of its Supercharging network—position it to capitalize on emerging markets. The robotaxi service, in particular, represents a high-stakes bet on the future of mobility. If successful, it could unlock new revenue streams and redefine Tesla's role in the transportation ecosystem.

However, execution will be critical. Tesla must scale its robotaxi service while managing the transition to higher-margin products. The company's ability to navigate regulatory hurdles for autonomous vehicles and maintain leadership in AI-driven innovation will determine whether it can outpace competitors like Waymo and Uber.

For the broader EV market, Tesla's struggles are a bellwether. The expiration of tax credits and tariffs are likely to slow EV adoption in the U.S., but they also force automakers to innovate. Companies that can adapt—by reshoring production, optimizing supply chains, or developing unique value propositions—may emerge stronger.

Investment Advice: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the key lies in hedging against short-term volatility while staying positioned for long-term growth. Here's how to approach the EV sector:

Short-Term Cautiousness: Avoid overexposure to EV stocks in the near term, especially those heavily reliant on regulatory incentives. Tesla's stock remains volatile, and further declines could occur if Musk's “rough quarters” materialize.

Diversify Within the Sector: Look for EV companies with strong balance sheets and diversified revenue streams. For example, firms investing in energy storage, battery recycling, or AI-driven logistics could benefit from the broader transition to electrification.

Monitor Regulatory and Tariff Developments: The EV sector is highly sensitive to policy changes. Track updates on tax credit extensions, tariff adjustments, and international trade agreements, particularly in markets like Europe and China.

Long-Term Bet on Innovation: For investors with a higher risk tolerance, Tesla's AI and robotaxi initiatives represent a compelling long-term opportunity. However, success hinges on execution and regulatory approvals.

Global Perspective: While the U.S. market faces headwinds, EV adoption is growing in Europe and Asia. Consider companies with a strong international presence, such as BYD or Rivian, to mitigate U.S.-centric risks.

Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for EVs

Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings and Musk's warnings signal a pivotal moment for the EV market. The near-term risks—expiring incentives, tariffs, and production delays—are undeniable. Yet, the long-term potential of autonomous driving, AI, and robotics remains a powerful catalyst. For investors, the challenge is to separate noise from signal, balancing caution with conviction. As the EV sector navigates this transition, those who adopt a strategic, diversified approach will be best positioned to weather the storm and capitalize on the opportunities ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-25 15:04:46.720434

“Texans will pay higher power bills as clean energy development slows because of tax credit cuts, economists say” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Economists expect that the development of solar and wind farms nationwide will slow and electricity prices will rise in the coming decade because of significant rollbacks to tax credits that benefited those industries, in addition to other economic uncertainty.

Texas, which has built more wind power than any state and is a top contender for the most solar power, faces this projected slowdown as grid operators predict soaring electricity demand.

Energy analysts have noted that an unusually high number of solar and battery projects in the state were already canceled or paused in the months leading up to the tax credit cuts because of uncertainty over how deep the cuts would be and the specifics of tariffs that would raise the price of steel.

From battery manufacturing in Brookshire to a solar product facility in Stratford, advocates worried that billions in announced investment and tens of thousands of planned jobs might get killed as project economics change.

With less renewable development likely comes lower employment, pressure on grid reliability and slower state economic growth, said Robert Stavins, a professor of environmental economics at Harvard University.

“From an economic perspective, it’s not good for Texas,” Stavins said.

Sweeping Democratic legislation that passed under former President Joe Biden dramatically expanded credits for clean energy producers. The policy changes brought billions of dollars of investment to Texas, much of it to red districts. The goal was to lower greenhouse gas emissions and establish the U.S. as a top clean energy manufacturer and producer.

President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill on July 4 in an effort to extend tax cuts from his first term and lower federal spending. Among its sweeping changes, the law dramatically shortens the time frame for when solar and wind companies can use the Biden-era tax credits.

Texas’ two Republican senators and 25 House Republicans all voted to end the subsidies early — with some, like Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin, grousing that Congress did not go far enough. Trump is now taking steps to restrict wind and solar project development further by slowing permitting timelines on federal land and tightening eligibility rules for projects trying to qualify for tax credits before they phase down.

On top of that are the unknowns around inflation, tariffs and geopolitics, which combine to create broad economic drag, said John D. Sterman, professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

“All that uncertainty just makes business people very uncomfortable, and that generally depresses investment everywhere,” Sterman said. “It’s not just what’s in the Big Beautiful Bill.”

Economists and energy analysts have been crunching the numbers on how bad the fallout for solar and wind companies could be from the new law. The business-friendly regulatory environment and ample windy and sunny places that fueled Texas’ clean energy boom should help keep some business coming. But experts say wind, solar and battery growth will still be hampered.

The research group Energy Innovation Policy and Technology estimated that by 2035 in Texas there will be 54 fewer gigawatts of solar developed and 23 fewer gigawatts of wind developed because of the policy changes. One gigawatt can power around 250,000 homes in Texas during high demand.

This is because, with the expiration of the federal tax credits, some clean energy projects simply won’t make financial sense to build anymore. As a result, gas plants will need to run for more hours to meet demand, which will drive gas prices higher and push the price of power higher too, experts said. A Princeton analysis predicted that because of the new policy, greenhouse gas emissions will increase, while electricity bills in Texas will rise by 5% by 2035.

“For Texas, where you’re really relying on these types of new generation facilities to meet surging demand and to keep prices low, as well as increase reliability, it’s going to be tough,” said Shane Londigan, a climate and energy senior policy adviser at think tank Third Way. “Those cost increases are going to be felt.”

How tax credits boosted clean energy development in Texas

Texas has long been known for producing oil and gas; it produces more than any other state. But it’s also become a clean energy magnet.

In addition to having ample good places to develop solar and wind projects, the electricity market is deregulated, meaning energy producers compete to provide cheap power. Combined with a relatively quick process to connect to the grid and a simpler permitting regime than other states, Texas set the stage for wind, solar and battery power to succeed.

Wind power began taking off here in the mid-2000s. Solar power started picking up about a decade later. The amount of utility-scale solar farms built in Texas jumped from about 5 gigawatts in 2020 to 27.5 gigawatts by the end of 2024, according to a study from Columbia Business School.

Cheaper and quicker to build than gas-fired plants, Texas’ wind and solar buildout made it the “advanced energy capital of the country,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance.

In 2022, Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA — a landmark climate law that expanded tax credits for clean energy companies and consumers alike in an effort to generate more energy, create new jobs in the sector, establish renewables manufacturing in the U.S. and bring down energy costs.

The expanded federal subsidies created all sorts of cost savings, including for manufacturing items like solar panels and electric vehicles, improving home energy efficiency and building an array of clean energy technologies.

Companies have invested over $62 billion in clean energy projects across the state since the passage of the IRA, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a project from research organization Rhodium Group and MIT to track clean energy investments. Much of the investment has gone to Republican districts represented by members who voted against the bill, including the Houston exurbs, the Panhandle, the Permian Basin and southwest Texas.

The renewables growth brought much-needed power to the state’s electric grid as demand rose. The state grid serves the majority of Texas and, unlike grids on the eastern and western halves of the country, largely stands alone.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the grid, repeatedly called for residents to conserve energy amid record-breaking heat in the summer of 2023, but the new solar farms helped to meet the high demand. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found solar power and batteries made a difference in keeping the grid running in summer 2024 too, without any conservation calls.

ERCOT predicts the grid will need to be able to provide vastly more power on the highest-demand summer days to come — 145,000 megawatts of power in 2031 compared to 86,000 megawatts in 2025. Economic and population growth in the state are driving that, along with new large electricity users such as data centers.

“Broadly speaking, a more diverse generation portfolio is a more resilient grid,” said Dan O’Brien, an Energy Innovation senior analyst.

Many more clean energy projects were expected to come to Texas with the tax credits in place: Companies have announced over $128 billion in planned investment for over 650 clean energy facilities in Texas, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. The announced facilities are expected to create close to 132,000 jobs.

But many of these projects were financed with the expectation that the subsidies would be available — and are at risk of not moving forward now that the credits are being phased out.

A June report from the investment bank Jefferies found a “large increase in Texas renewables development cancellations” in April and May. They found that roughly 4 gigawatts of battery projects and 3.5 gigawatts of solar projects were canceled in those two months and called May “the worst month in years for new development.”

Mark Rostafin, co-CEO of Irving-based renewable energy developer Vesper Energy, said the uncertainty around the tariffs and tax credits caused companies to tap the brakes on projects that weren’t already far along in the financing or construction process. He said his company was looking at what to do with its portfolio and waiting for more clarity while the bill was debated.

“The ambiguity locks up the market and that’s the more problematic piece,” Rostafin said. “Once we know the rules, the industry will go. We’ll go do the best we can with what we have in front of us.”

Texas could lose billions in investment and thousands of jobs

The One Big, Beautiful Bill phases out many of the subsidies that have supercharged wind and solar and other clean energy investment, starting a countdown for companies to get shovels in the ground on their projects.

Companies can receive tax credits of 30% for investing in, building and operating various energy production facilities, with bonus incentives to use domestically sourced materials. Democrats intentionally created a 10-year time horizon for the expanded credits to provide businesses with the certainty needed to pursue new projects, a provision that made the policy more popular and more expensive than expected.

Under the new law, clean energy investment and production tax credits for wind and solar projects will end in 2027. Projects need to be under construction by July 4, 2026 to be eligible for subsidies or be placed in service by the end of 2027.

But a new memo from the Interior Department, first reported by Politico, revealed that the Trump administration will seek to throw roadblocks up for new projects hoping to qualify for the tax credits in time by creating a federal permitting bottleneck requiring a number of approvals that the industry has described as inordinate.

“The final language that passed, while still horrific especially going forward, gave a fighting chance to a decent portion of the projects that have already been announced,” said Jesse Lee, senior adviser at political advocacy group Climate Power and former Biden White House senior official, adding, “There remains a question of how exactly they will implement this.”

Tax credits for consumers — like one that allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the cost of rooftop solar installation or equipment — will disappear at the end of the year. Manufacturing subsidies were preserved but with tighter qualification rules around ensuring content is sourced from non-Chinese markets.

Taken together, the costs associated with manufacturing parts and developing solar and wind energy will rise for companies as soon as next year. Industry experts predict a short-term rush to begin construction on planned projects and start up new ones.

In that regard, Texas is at an advantage.

“Texas is actually one of the few places where you could start a project in the middle of 2026 and actually maybe place it in service by the end of 2027,” said Rich Powell, the CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers’ Association.

Powell, who said CEBA members buy a third of their power from Texas, said his modeling indicates that the majority of planned solar and battery projects will be deployed, even without the credits. The development of new wind farms becomes more difficult without the credits, according to Powell.

Without the credit, project costs start to balloon rapidly. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that between the end of the investment tax credit and depreciation deductions, a utility-scale solar facility that requires $350 million in investment will cost $126 million more in 2027, without the credit, than it does today.

The Trump administration’s actions look completely at odds with professed Republican goals of American energy dominance and an “all-of-the-above” energy approach, said Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton energy systems expert.

“They’re standing in the way of building cheap, affordable, American energy supplies in the form of wind and solar, and they’re raising taxes on what we are going to be able to build,” Jenkins said. “So in a period of time when electricity demand is growing rapidly, especially in Texas … If we can’t add supply fast enough to keep up with demand, that’s a recipe for an affordability crisis, for prices to spike.”

Still, the costs for producing solar panels and batteries have fallen drastically and continue to get cheaper, said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School. And while he didn’t think the tax credit changes were good, it’s possible that solar power will continue to be a cheaper energy source than its competitors over the long term, even with a new set of financial rules.

“We will still build renewables; I still think that they will be the most common form of power that’s built,” said Doug Lewin, an Texas-based consultant and energy expert. “There’s going to be less of it. It’s going to be what is built is more expensive and that’s going to hurt the smallest consumers the most.”

31% of EV drivers reported longer service times than for gasoline-powered vehicles.

Wait times for electric vehicle service appointments increased in 2024, and a larger share of owners needed multiple visits to fully resolve repair issues, according to CDK Global’s 2025 EV Ownership Study. Could these findings further hinder already stagnant EV sales in North America?

The study found that only 28% of EV owners had their vehicle serviced and returned the same day in 2024, a decrease from 40% in 2023. Another 29% waited until the following day for repairs to be completed, while 14% reported three-day turnaround times, up from 9% the year prior.

CDK surveyed EV drivers between December 2024 and January 2025. Among respondents, 85% said they had visited a dealership service department at least once in the first year of ownership.

The study also found that 31% of EV owners believed their electric vehicle took longer to service than a gasoline-powered vehicle. That perception was more common among non-Tesla owners (34%) than Tesla drivers (23%).

Use of mobile and pickup services showed modest increases. Nineteen percent of respondents used mobile service in 2024, up from 14% in 2023. Nine percent said their vehicle was picked up by a dealership, compared with 6% the year before. However, 83% still brought their vehicle to the dealership in person.

While maintenance for EVs is generally less frequent, according to CDK, only 13% of owners reported paying for their service. Sixteen percent said the visit was for a recall.

When asked about service costs, 53% of non-Tesla owners said their EV was less expensive to maintain than a gasoline vehicle. Among Tesla owners, 41% reported the same.

“EV owners are waiting longer to have their cars serviced and it’s taking multiple visits to have their issue resolved,” said David Thomas, CDK’s director of content marketing and automotive industry analyst. “The fact that these numbers are getting worse is not a good sign as more non-Tesla EVs are on the road than ever before.”",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-Kia-EV9-Land-21.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 14:06:09.015636

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-25 14:42:11+00:00,Crain's Detroit Business,Tariff costs pile up for auto industry as metals prices rise | Crain's Detroit Business,"Crain's Detroit Business, www.facebook.com, John Irwin, Automotive News",,,,,https://www.crainsdetroit.com/automotive/tariff-costs-pile-auto-industry-metals-prices-rise,"U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum rose to 50% in June, double the 25% rate Trump set in March.
The steel and aluminum tariffs, meanwhile, have allowed U.S. metals producers to increase their prices.
Steel and aluminum tariffs “have played a significant role in supporting the domestic steel industry,” Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves said Monday during a call with analysts.
The U.S. auto industry buys most of its steel from American sources, though it does rely on imports for certain advanced high-strength steels and electrical steel used in e-motors, experts said.
There isn’t enough U.S. steel and aluminum capacity to meet the demand from the auto industry and other sectors if every company wants to source their metals domestically, experts said.","Domestic producers of steel and aluminum have raised their prices since President Donald Trump’s metal tariffs went into effect earlier this year, leading to higher costs for automakers and suppliers also grappling with tariffs on vehicles and parts.

Steel Dynamics on Monday said it sold steel in the second quarter for an average price of $1,134 per ton, 14% higher than in the first quarter. That same day, Cleveland-Cliffs said the average price of its steel stood at $1,015 per ton, up 3.4% from the previous quarter.

Those increases track with the rest of the steel market. Generally, prices have risen 10%-15% percent since the Trump administration announced tariffs this year, said Gerrit Reepmeyer, a partner in the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners. Even stronger dynamics are at play in the aluminum market, where prices have risen 30%-40% percent since the new tariffs were announced, he said.

“That equates to at least a few hundred dollars per vehicle just considering raw materials,” and doesn’t factor other auto-specific tariffs, including 25% duties on imported vehicles and parts, Reepmeyer said.

U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum rose to 50% in June, double the 25% rate Trump set in March.

Tariff expenses are starting to pile up for auto manufacturers and suppliers. General Motors Co., for example, said tariffs cost it $1.1 billion in the second quarter, while Stellantis expects a full-year tariff impact of $1.2 billion-$1.8 billion.

Chuck Dardas, president and CEO of Livonia-based AlphaUSA, said steel and aluminum tariffs are taking a $250,000 bite out of the bottom line each month — a big hit for a small, family-owned parts maker.

The company, which makes metal fasteners found on many Detroit 3 vehicles, is working on cost recoveries, but there have been no guarantees from customers as they work through billions of dollars of direct tariff exposure. AlphaUSA makes nuts using Canadian steel, which has soared in price because of the duties.

“To mitigate our plight, we have taken every part that we import and quoted them in the U.S. and in 100% of the cases the U.S price was higher than the 50% tariffed price,” Dardas said.

The cost of tariffs will ultimately fall on American consumers and could break small manufacturers if left in place, he added.

“Our company, as with thousands of companies like ours in many industries, cannot simply with a wave of a wand absorb tariffs of 50% or more,” he said.

The steel and aluminum tariffs, meanwhile, have allowed U.S. metals producers to increase their prices. They are seeing more demand for domestic metals. And they are taking advantage of the higher prices that result from making foreign metals more expensive.

Steel and aluminum tariffs “have played a significant role in supporting the domestic steel industry,” Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves said Monday during a call with analysts.

The Trump administration said it implemented the tariffs to spur manufacturers to buy more steel, aluminum and copper from domestic sources and to reduce dependence on imports.

That’s a “decent policy goal,” said Wilfried Aulbur, senior partner at Roland Berger. But tariffs on imported steel also make domestic steel more expensive by giving U.S. producers room to raise prices, and there’s no guarantee producers of steel and aluminum will use increased revenue to invest in their U.S. footprints to meet higher demand, he said.

“Who guarantees that those additional costs are being invested in efficiency and bringing costs down and not just getting passed on to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks?"" Aulbur said.

Many executives in the steel and aluminum industries are incentivized to boost their companies’ earnings per share and maximize profitability, sometimes at the expense of making investments or becoming more efficient, he said.

“It’s basically very short-term thinking and doesn’t allow us to be competitive in the mid- to long term,” Aulbur said.

The U.S. auto industry buys most of its steel from American sources, though it does rely on imports for certain advanced high-strength steels and electrical steel used in e-motors, experts said. The U.S., meanwhile, imports about half of the aluminum it uses.

There isn’t enough U.S. steel and aluminum capacity to meet the demand from the auto industry and other sectors if every company wants to source their metals domestically, experts said. And it would take years and massive investment to build up capacity to meet that demand.

“The timeline to build an e-steel facility with all the proper capabilities is awe-inspiring,” said Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at S&P Global Mobility. “These things don’t happen overnight.”

Steel and aluminum producers would need to be sure demand will still be there in several years to justify making such investments, Aulbur said. But a lack of long-term clarity on U.S. trade policy will make it difficult for many companies to do so, he said.

“Beyond the tariffs, the biggest problem is uncertainty,” he said. “We don’t know what’s going to happen because things change so often that it makes it difficult for people to plan and commit.”

Metal costs are likely to rise further, as Trump is expected to implement a 50 percent tariff on copper, a crucial material for EVs and vehicle electronics, effective Aug. 1.

Copper futures rose 12% after Trump announced his tariff plans.

“There’s reason to think it’ll go up even further when the tariffs hit,” Reepmeyer said.

And more goods are likely to be added to the list of products subject to steel and aluminum derivative tariffs, or duties that apply to the value of imported metals in imported goods. About $150 billion in goods are already subject to derivative duties, including auto components such as aluminum door hinges and bumper parts.

The Trump administration in May established a process for U.S. companies to request certain steel and aluminum products be added to that list. Industry experts expect to know more about which products will be added in the coming weeks.

While parts covered under the auto tariff are not also subject to steel or aluminum tariffs, importers of components that aren’t on the auto tariff list would be required to pay a 50% duty on the value of foreign steel and aluminum in those parts if they are added to the derivatives list.

“There are becoming fewer and fewer ways to get around tariff exposure,” Reepmeyer said.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-25 14:41:04+00:00,Jalopnik,Lamborghini Might Ditch Its Long-Awaited EV For A Plug-In Hybrid Instead - Jalopnik,Andy Kalmowitz,,,,,https://www.jalopnik.com/1921841/lamborghini-might-ditch-ev-plans/,"It's long been expected that Lamborghini's fourth model line — based heavily on the 2023 Lanzador concept — will be an electric vehicle when it finally launches.
It's now looking more and more likely that it'll launch in 2029 as a plug-in hybrid.
[...] ""The first decision [we made as a result of the EV market] is that Urus replacement would be, again, a plug-in hybrid, and that we postpone the launch of the fourth [model],"" he said.
To be fair, there's still a chance that the Lanzador — of whatever it turns into — will be an electric vehicle.
In reality, a Lamborghini EV always seemed like a bit of an afterthought for the automaker.","It's long been expected that Lamborghini's fourth model line — based heavily on the 2023 Lanzador concept — will be an electric vehicle when it finally launches. Well, that might not be the case after all. It's now looking more and more likely that it'll launch in 2029 as a plug-in hybrid.

The high-riding, four-seat grand touring coupe was supposed to be a preview of Lambo's first fully electric model, but new comments from CEO Stephan Winkelmann suggest that the brand is rethinking exactly what sort of powertrain it is going to put in the car, according to Australia's CarExpert. The CEO cited weakening demand for EVs — especially when it comes to ultra luxury vehicles and supercars.

Here's what Winkelmann said to CarExpert in an interview:

""We took two decisions so far based on the fact that the acceptance curve of the electric cars worldwide and globally, not only in our type of segment, is flattening, and this is even more true for our type [of cars],"" Mr Winkelmann told CarExpert.

[...]

""The first decision [we made as a result of the EV market] is that Urus replacement would be, again, a plug-in hybrid, and that we postpone the launch of the fourth [model],"" he said.

The original production version of the Lanzador was supposed to usher in a new electrified era for Lamborghini, but if it sees that the sales for that type of vehicle aren't there, why would it bother to build it? Sure, a high-riding super EV would be sick as hell, but I'm guessing the average Lamborghini owner is pretty partial to their internal combustion engine.

To be fair, there's still a chance that the Lanzador — of whatever it turns into — will be an electric vehicle. It was initially slated to go on sale in 2028, but it has now been pushed back a year, and the bosses over at Lamborghini haven't fully made up their minds yet on what sort of motor will be powering it, as Winkelmann explained to CarExpert:

""We have to decide whether we go one way or the other very soon, but today is still... it's possible [that it is a plug-in hybrid], but it's something which is still very open,"" Mr Winkelmann said.

[...]

""Again, we said we don't need to be there at the beginning, but we need to be there when the people are ready to buy these things. And for me, this is paramount for the success of a company like ours,"" Mr Winkelmann said.

A move like this isn't exactly shocking. The luxury automotive space — as a whole — seems to be tepid on the idea of an electric supercar. We've told you about how Ferrari is delaying its second EV because not even people want one, and how Maserati canceled an electric version of its MC20 supercar because there wasn't enough demand.

In reality, a Lamborghini EV always seemed like a bit of an afterthought for the automaker. Winkelmann reiterated his point to CarExpert that the Italian automaker's goal was to keep an internal combustion engine in its two flagship supercars as long as regulations allow that to happen.

Still, there is some electrification happening. As it stands, all three of Lamborghini's current vehicles: The Urus SE, Revuelto and Temerario are plug-in hybrids. Clearly, it sees the benefit of electrification, but I just feel its buyers want to hear a very loud engine when they hit the start button.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/lamborghini-might-ditch-its-long-awaited-ev-for-a-plug-in-hybrid-instead/l-intro-1753453471.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:41.695816

First, I'd like to introduce who are present today. Lee Chang Sil, CFO; Jang Seung-kwon, in charge of Finance and Accounting Group; Lee Sang-Hyeon, in charge of Finance; [indiscernible], in charge of Planning and Management; [indiscernible], in charge of Advanced Automotive Battery Planning and Management; [indiscernible], in charge of Mobility and IT Battery Planning and Management; Kim Min-Soo, in charge of ESS Battery Planning and Management; and [ Lee Hyeon Hee ], in charge of Corporate Strategy.

For your reference, the presentation for business performance and strategy will be conducted with simultaneous interpretation, after which we will have Q&A with consecutive interpretation. The presentation slide will be webcast live, and you can download the material from the corporate website.

In this conference call, I'm going to share our 2025 second quarter result and then CFO will share the recent business environment trend, key achievements and action plans for the second half, followed by Q&A session. Please note that the forward-looking statements included in the call are subject to change according to amendments in future business environment and corporate strategy.

First, let me talk about our Q2 business performance. First, shipment in North America increased due to stable product sales for EV and start of production at the new ESS site in Michigan. However, due to growing policy volatility during the quarter such as tariffs and customers' weakening purchase intention, the corporate-wide shipment decreased slightly Q-o-Q. With the softening trend in metal prices being reflected into ASP, the revenue declined by 11.2% Q-o-Q to record KRW 5.6 trillion.

In the automotive battery business, while the shipment volume increase in North America and Asia due to the volumes for the customers showing stable selling trends, the shipment volume in Europe decreased due to major customers' conservative battery inventory management, even with good EV sales. In the small battery business, despite the seasonal downturn in pouch demand for IT devices, the shipment increased slightly due to the full-scale sales of upgraded cylindrical product for EV and proactive response to LEV demand.

In the ESS battery business, with continued seasonal downturn impact, the ESS shipment declined Q-o-Q due to the reduction of the U.S. bulk shipment from China impacted by high tariff despite the start of operation at a new capacity in the U.S.

Regarding profit, despite the revenue decrease, with the product mix improvement from increased production of high-margin products and projects, along with considerable cost efficiency enhancement and cost innovation efforts such as material cost reduction, OP, excluding the North America production incentive, turned surplus for the first time in 6 quarters. With the North America production incentive recording KRW 490.8 billion, OP in Q2 marked a 31.4% increase to post KRW 492.2 billion and OP improved 2.8 percentage points Q-o-Q to record 8.8%.

As for major nonoperating items, even with translation gains on foreign currency-denominated borrowings and others impacted by a strong won against the USD at quarter end, due to net interest expense and evaluation loss from derivative relating to foreign currency-denominated corporate bond, the nonoperating loss amounted to KRW 590.2 billion. With the net loss before tax recording KRW 27 billion, the net profit marked KRW 90.6 billion.

Next, financial position. The asset at quarter end increased by about KRW 0.7 trillion compared to the previous quarter end to stand at KRW 63 trillion due to increase in cash and cash equivalents. Liabilities increased by about KRW 3.7 trillion to reach KRW 34.7 trillion compared to the previous quarter end due to borrowings increase, including the issuance of foreign currency-denominated bonds. Equity totaled KRW 28.3 trillion, down by about KRW 3 trillion due to foreign currency translation difference of overseas subsidiaries in line with significant interest rate fluctuation at quarter end.

The liability-to-equity ratio recorded 123% with net debt -- with debt-to-equity ratio of 74% and net debt-to-equity ratio of 54%. During this quarter, EBITDA generation was about KRW 1.4 trillion and EBITDA margin improved by 5 percentage points compared to the previous quarter end to 25%.

Regarding cash flow, during the quarter, even with CapEx spending of KRW 2.7 trillion for the North America capacity, due to cash inflow of around KRW 4.7 trillion, including funding of KRW 3.2 trillion such as corporate bond issuance, the cash balance increased by around KRW 1.9 trillion compared to quarter end to reach KRW 5.4 trillion.

With this, let me end my explanation. Next, CFO will present you on the second half business environment and our key achievement and action plans.

[Interpreted] Good morning and evening. This is CFO, Lee Chang Sil. Amid the continuing global economy and geopolitical uncertainties since the beginning of the year as the U.S. Tax Cut Act, which has had a significant impact on the battery industry, was confirmed, the volatility since gradually subsidizing. Accordingly, I'd like to explain the business environment landscape and our action plan for the second half of the year, together with the major policy updates.

First, since the Trump administration took office, as you know very well, the U.S. has been leveraging tariff actively as a tool for diplomatic and security strategies. Starting in April, a 10% universal tariff has been applied to all imports into the U.S., and now it is pressuring by applying different tariff rates for each country through negotiations. The China negotiations appear to be underway in multiple areas, including rare earth, but currently, Chinese products face high tariff of 73% for EV batteries and 41% for ESS batteries, implying its continued containment stance against China.

The IRA, which has been affecting the EV and battery industries in North America most directly, was amended due to the implementation of the OBBBA this month. Consequently, the EV subsidy for consumers up to $7,500 will expire after the end of this September. Such tariff impositions and early termination of the EV subsidy put a burden on OEM and highly likely to raise car price tags, slowing the growth rate of the North American EV market for the time being.

However, as now EVs incorporate AI features and self-driving tech services become visible, as more consumers are building -- experiencing autonomous driving, the intrinsic value of the EV is expected to go up more, bringing a bigger EV momentum for demand in the long run. Meanwhile, the amended IRA includes a new PFE, or prohibited foreign entity, clause, adding a supply chain requirement to the eligibility criteria of the AMPC for battery producers and ITC for companies investing in clean energy plant. In other words, the entities threatening the national security, key Chinese battery companies and entities designated as PFE deemed to be under significant influence of those entities cannot receive tax credits when investing in batteries or power facility in the U.S.

Additionally, all other manufacturers must ensure that the proportion of material sourced from the PFEs does not exceed 40% of direct material costs starting next year, and the proportion should gradually go down further by 2030. Therefore, we think that PFE companies will face many hurdles in entering the U.S. market directly. For raw material sourcing as well, it will become more important to secure non-PFE partners with price and quality competitiveness and operate NCM strategically within the allowed PFE sourcing scope.

Despite initial concerns about early phaseout, the AMPC will remain intact until 2032 without changes in the effective period. The original draft regarding the ESS installation project among the ITC-eligible items also remain the same. So if the construction begins by 2035, they can receive up to 40% of the CapEx as tax credits. In particular, in North America, the growing AI trend is accelerating data center expansion by big tech firms, which is causing a dramatic spike in power consumption.

That said, in addition to the demand arising from new renewable power plants, the need for ESS installations eligible for tax credits is rapidly increasing even at existing power plants. Additionally, if the local sourcing requirement in the U.S. are met, the ITC benefit can be maximized, further strengthening customers' demand for locally produced ESS in the ex China region.

Meanwhile, the EU announced a policy for investment support of EUR 850 million for the regional battery production projects to strengthen the local supply chain for EV, and the U.K. has also reintroduced EV purchase subsidies, which stopped in June 2022, with a budget of around GBP 650 million, actively boosting sales of domestically produced EVs. As both North America and Europe strive to expand their local battery supply chains and promote demand for domestically produced EVs like this, the customer trust and preference for battery companies capable of responding to local demand with stable operation capabilities will become even higher.

Amidst such considerable changing dynamics, LG Energy Solution is realizing notable progress. First, at our Michigan site, this May, we began mass-producing LFP-based ESS long cells, which offer improved energy density and cost competitiveness, thus securing the ESS production site in North America most preemptively and most promptly in the industry. Building on this, we would like to continue to respond to customers' ex China needs proactively. Also, as we are under active discussion with multiple customers with our diverse form factor portfolio, including prismatic type, we will be able to continue winning meaningful ESS orders focusing on power grids in North America.

Also for the new 46-series supply contract we signed with Chery Automobile in June, we plan to ship out from the second half of this year in Ochang site in Korea. And it holds significant meaning as our first cylindrical battery order with a Chinese OEM that typically prefers adopting domestic batteries. And we think that based on this, we'll be able to build a more diversified customer portfolio. Also, we have decided to establish a joint venture for preprocessing for used batteries with Toyota Tsusho in North Carolina, preparing our resource circulation system step by step across North America following our efforts in Europe.

Now let me explain the action plan for the latter half of this year. Although challenging business environment is expected in the second half as well, we intend to continue meaningful improvement in achievement and financial performance from the second quarter onwards by securing fundamental competitiveness through detailed action plans. First, in response to the EV demand slowdown, we aim to address this by increasing the revenue of the ESS business with rapidly growing power grid-centric demand and expanding the mass production of the new form factor for future growth and low -- new low to mid-chemistries to optimize the operation of the production line and maximize the capacity utilization as well.

Furthermore, we must reduce fixed cost burden. So we are resetting capacity expansion plans in line with the demand landscape and adjusting the timing and scale of ongoing projects in prompt response to the changes. And also, we are actively reallocating internal resources, including human resource operations, from the company-wide perspective with speed. Additionally, to strengthen our sourcing competitiveness, we are lowering the material cost ratio by persistently identifying low-cost materials and actively managing optimized supply chain strategies for each project through multidimensional assessment on supply regions, performance and cost by material type.

Regarding our business portfolio, to actively respond to the North American demand for decoupling from China and localization, with the ramp-up at our ESS site in Michigan, we will secure a stable 17-gigawatt hour level of ESS capacity in North America by the end of this year. Additionally, by converting some EV battery lines to ESS, we're going to expand the business by establishing over 30 gigawatt hour of ESS capacity in North America by the end of 2026.

Also, to respond to the European market where low- to mid-end EVs are mainly growing, we are preparing mass production of new cost-competitive products such as high-voltage mid-nickel and LFP batteries at our Poland plant in Europe. Also, we will preemptively secure additional orders for both EV and ESS applications with a new form factor like cylindrical 46-series and prismatic batteries while also exploring new markets such as new mobility and humanoid robots.

Lastly, we will also go all out for the development of competitive technologies. To meet customer needs through cost reduction, we will develop LFP batteries for EV applied with new processes and dry electrode processes, differentiating ourselves through enhanced cost competitiveness and fast charging performance. And we intend to develop LFP batteries for ESS with a new pouch product with a step-up in energy density while also preparing new form factor product with improved product specification through high-density design and cost competitiveness.

The newly developed LMR, or lithium manganese-rich, chemistry targeted for deployment in new-gen EVs of key customers by 2028 aims to achieve energy density improvement of over 30% compared to LFP while maintaining a similar cost. We aim to introduce fast-charging technology under 10 minutes across both 46-series and EV pouch products in the near future. Also, the dry electrode process, which is a key driver of cost innovation, will secure mass producibility in Ochang, Korea, establishing a system for sample supply within this year. From R&D perspective, we will swiftly secure materials and foundation technologies suitable for new products and achieve significant reduction in the lead time from product development to mass production based on AI and digital transformation.

Investors, analysts and shareholders, despite the challenged business environment, LG Energy Solution has successfully turned a profit in the second quarter without factoring in North America production incentive by firmly building on our internal strength and accumulated capabilities. The battery market, which has been on a growth trajectory, is now going through an unprecedentedly tough period of adjustment. However, by securing fundamental and structural competitiveness through swift response to market changes, we must achieve sustainable profit-making capabilities of our own. Thank you.

This is the end of the presentation. We'll have a Q&A session.

[Interpreted] So thank you for asking these questions. I do believe that the questions you have asked are what are the center of interest right now for the market. So thank you for them. For the first question you asked, which was the second half outlook for our business, I can address this. I am the CFO, Lee Chang Sil. And maybe for the second question, I can ask the related business division to address that question.

So as you are aware, in the U.S. right now, from country to country, the U.S. is coming to an agreement with various countries about their tariff policies. And as a result of that -- in addition to that, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has been finalized, which had led to some of the uncertainties related to the demand. So going forward, we do think that somewhat -- some of the volatility that we have seen within the secondary battery industry would be coming into a more moderate phase going forward.

However, as mentioned before, because the IRA in itself has been amended with new policies on one side for the consumer EV subsidies, it will be coming to an end earlier than initially expected. And we do think that naturally in the second half, the EV demand will be impacted. However, if you look at the EV auto sales trends in itself, they remain solid. And with regards to the battery inventory that remains within the industry, we do think that towards the second half of the year, there will be adjustments that will be taking place.

So if we look at the market, for the cylindrical EV customers that we have, there will be new models that will be launched in the market in the second half of the year. And also for IT manufacturers, there are also demands related to the new models that will be generated. So we do think that this will drive an increase in the mobility and IT device-related batteries. In addition to that, related to grid-related projects from the third quarter, we will be full fledgedly shipping out various production volumes from our site in Michigan. So in the second half, we do think that there will be a significant increase in our ESS-related revenue that we will be able to achieve.

To talk about our overall profitability, we do think that there will be a full-fledged adjustments of the existing CapEx plans that we have. And therefore, for a certain period of time, there will be somewhat of a slowdown in EV demand, which we think we can overcover with the ESS business growth that we will be able to see. So we are trying to use the existing capacity that we have in terms of the utilization to maximize it as much as possible. In addition to that, there will be some reallocation of resources and also some cost-efficiency efforts that will be put in place to minimize our overall fixed cost.

In addition to that, we will be trying to decreasing our overall material cost ratio by engaging in cost innovation efforts. And at the same time, for mobility and IT devices and ESS-related demand, which we do believe will continue to grow, we do think that this will continue to contribute to our profitability. So using the second quarter as a standpoint, we will try to continue with the meaningful momentum that we have been able to generate.

[Interpreted] So for the first question that you have asked with regards the changes that have been taking place in the tax act, what the overall impact would be on EV and ESS demand and what would be our strategy to address this going forward, maybe I can address that. From corporate strategy, I am [ Lee Hyeon Hee ].

So as the CFO did explain in detail in the presentation before, if we look at the overall situation, from the end of September, the overall EV subsidiaries that would have been provided will be going away. And there is a new prohibited foreign entity or PFE procurement condition that has been added on. So we do think that this will have an impact on the EV and ESS business environment.

To talk about the EV side first, right now, because the subsidies will be abolished going forward, we do think that on the OEM side, they will be pacing themselves a bit more in terms of their EV business expansion. And after the subsidies end, from that point of time until the early part or first half of next year, we do think that there will be an overall slowdown in the demand within the market. Nevertheless, we do think that the OEMs will be continuously expanding their low-end EV lineup so that they can lessen the burden that consumers may feel when purchasing new cars. And in addition to that, as autonomous driving becomes fully commercialized, with that, we do think that, that will increase consumers' willingness to pay for EV vehicles.

So for the company, from the first half of next year, we will be utilizing and putting our North American JV online. And we do think that, that will lead to a gradual increase in the overall volume growth that we see. So therefore, for EV customers that we have, we're talking about prismatic battery development, LFP and also lower-cost LMR solutions so that we can strengthen our fundamental competitiveness within this area.

On the ESS side, right now for power grid-related market demand, we do believe that next year, the overall demand growth will be above 60%, and that would be a very high level of growth that we would expect. So since the ITC credits are something that will be maintained, we don't believe that there will be a large overall change or impact from this. And because we do have local production capabilities and there continues to be a preference for non-Chinese providers, we do think that, that trend will continue going forward.

So therefore, utilizing the better conditions that we have on the supply chain side, we do think that we can apply lower-cost materials and strengthen our cost competitiveness with -- at the same time, also utilize the competitive edge that we have as being the only company that is able to provide LFP ESS batteries on the ground. So in light of the increasing demand or sharp increase in demand that we see going forward, we will continue to engage in marketing activities and continue to win orders going forward.

Yes. This is [ Lee Hyeon Hee ] again, and maybe I can address your second question, which was the new conditions for PFE that have been installed, what's the overall preparedness that we have or strategy that we have to achieve this and what we are going to do going forward. So even before the current changes take place, the company had been planning to create a supply chain that satisfied the previous FEOC conditions under the IRA that we require to be eligible for consumer subsidies. If you look at the new PFE-related procurement conditions, in some areas, we do actually believe that they are less demanding than the previous FEOC conditions. So we do think that we can utilize this to optimize our supply chain.

So first, under the current supply chain conditions, if you look at manufacturers or producers, they will be allowed to procure a certain percentage from PFEs each year. And these conditions will be limited to direct material. So we do think that this enables us to utilize some low-cost supply chains that are out there. In addition, since EV consumer subsidies will be abolished, we will no longer be required to source battery parts from the U.S. or critical raw materials from FTA countries. So this provides us more discretion in the way that we operate our overall supply chain.

And at the same time, for materials that we will be sourcing to be compliant with the PFE conditions, in the short term, that would be a bit more challenging. I do think that we would have a bit more time to prepare for the situation going forward. So thus, we can effectively utilize our existing suppliers, which have long-term supply capabilities and cost competitiveness, while over the mid- to long term, we would be able to dualize our supplier base and also ensure that we satisfy PFE conditions so that at the same time, we can increase or strengthen our cost competitiveness and improve our profitability.

[Interpreted] So this is the CFO, Lee Chang Sil. Maybe I can address your second question. I do think that although we have discussed this before, you still have a lot of questions about the second half outlook for the overall business. So maybe I can briefly provide an explanation. So if you look at the first half U.S. shipments that we had, which was relatively strong, and if you look at the drivers behind that, first, I do think that it was that for our key customers, their overall EV sales performance in itself was better than they initially expected. So that was one factor.

However, added to that, I do think that on the customer side, there was a lot of preemptive pull-in demand that they had because there were a lot of variables that could take place, for example, a lot of policy uncertainties within the market. So if you look at the second half, because the EV subsidies will be going away after September, we do think that, that will lead the OEMs to pace themselves in terms of their overall electrification expansion. And added to that, we do think that relatively, there may be more conservative inventory management as a result of that. So therefore, in terms of the growth momentum, I do think that for the time being, it cannot help but be somewhat limited.

However, that have been said, on the North American ESS side and the overall customer demand there, as mentioned before, it is stronger than -- much stronger than we had expected. And as the company that -- the only company that has local ESS production capabilities, we do think this would be a very attractive opportunity for our company. So as we have said for the time being, we do think that the void that we have on the EV side can be somewhat fulfilled with ESS demand that we would have going forward.

For the company, we will continue to review the market demand and customer needs so that we can come up with the most efficient operations for the capacity that we have, and this is something that we are in discussions with our customers about. So therefore, in terms of the production timing and sizes that we have from -- for the different sites, this is something that we're adjusting on a real-time basis to ensure that we can reduce any capacity loss or investment loss as much as possible.

However, one thing that we do believe that is very fortunate is that for the ESS demand in North America, there is a very solid trend that we see of growth. So therefore, we think that in North America, using the overall capacity advantages that we have with local production, we will continue to utilize some of the capacity that we have, including JV capacity, to cater to first, the ESS-related demand that we see and try to maximize the overall capacity efficiencies that we have for our operations.",https://ch.zonebourse.com/images/twitter_ZB_fdblanc.png,N,,2025-07-25 17:05:27.792779

The rule amendment aimed to reduce a thousand pounds of mercury emissions.
The EPA estimated the rollback of the MATS amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs for the oil and coal industry over a decade.","By Shannon Heckt

Seventy-three members of Congress, led by U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-VA, and Paul Tonko, D-NY, wrote to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop the roll back of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS).

The proposed rule changes would repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for the power sector under the Clean Air Act, as well as repeal 2024 amendments to the MATS that some believe led to the retirement of some coal-powered plants across the nation. Virginia currently has three coal-fired power plants in operation in Chesterfield, Halifax, and Wise counties.

The MATS amendments further reduced the amount of mercury, arsenic, nickel, and other toxic emissions from power plants. The plants were expected to invest in technologies to improve operation methods to cut back on those emissions. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave more than a third of the country’s coal-fired plants two-year exemptions from the rule.

“Congress gave EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate hazardous air pollutants, like mercury and arsenic from power plants,” the representatives’ letter said. “Rolling back the MATS rule is a cruel abandonment of the agency’s statutory obligations that will endanger children’s health, harm communities, and let the worst industrial polluters off the hook.”

The EPA announced the rule rollback in June and said it would be reset to 2012 standards that the agency believes already significantly reduced emissions.

“According to many, the primary purpose of these Biden-Harris administration regulations was to destroy industries that didn’t align with their narrow-minded climate change zealotry. Together, these rules have been criticized as being designed to regulate coal, oil and gas out of existence,” Zeldin said in a June statement.

The representatives are greatly concerned with the severe, disproportionate health effects the toxins have on communities on the fenceline and down-wind of the power plants. Mercury pollution also settles into waterways, impacting fish that could be consumed by people or animals. The rule amendment aimed to reduce a thousand pounds of mercury emissions.

“Mercury pollution harms infants and children by causing permanent brain damage with long-term harms such as development delays, learning disabilities, and birth defects. Due to environmental injustice, communities of color and low-income communities are more likely to live near coal-fired power plants and be exposed to this dangerous pollution,” the letter read.

The EPA estimated the rollback of the MATS amendments would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs for the oil and coal industry over a decade. The agency previously predicted $300 million in health benefits over the same period with the amendments in place, putting industry and human health at odds according to the congressional delegation.

“By rolling back the MATS rule, the Trump Administration is choosing corporate polluters over the health and lives of everyday Americans across the country,” the letter said.

The congressional representative asks the EPA to allow 75 days for public comment and the host multiple hearings on the rule change. They said the current 55 days and one public hearing is not enough to get a full understanding of the impact stemming from the change.",https://www.henricocitizen.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/07/JenniferMcClellan-Jan25-Mercury.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:27.543020

The cancellation stems from a review of agreements signed by the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) during the last weeks of the Biden administration.

“After a thorough review of the project’s financials, DOE found that the conditions necessary to issue the guarantee are unlikely to be met and it is not critical for the federal government to have a role in supporting this project”, the DOE said in a statement online.

“DOE is conducting a review of every applicant and borrower - including the nearly $100 billion in closed loans and conditional commitments LPO made between Election Day 2024 to Inauguration Day 2025 - to ensure every single taxpayer dollar is being used to advance the best interest of the American people”, the DOE added.

“This ongoing review positions LPO to move forward with a lower risk tolerance in lending practices and an uncompromising focus on expanding access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people.

“DOE remains focused on advancing projects that expand American energy dominance and deliver on President Trump’s commitment to lower energy prices for the American people”.

Grain Belt Express LLC, owned by Chicago, Illinois-based Invenergy LLC, indicated in a statement the project would push through with private funding.

“America is energy dominant and an AI powerhouse, and Grain Belt Express will be America’s largest power pipeline”, Grain Belt Express said. “While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee [cancellation], a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs”.

On July 11 Grain Belt Express vice president Jim Shield wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright urging the DOE to proceed to financial close amid attacks by Missouri Attorney-General Andrew Bailey and Senator Josh Hawley. Shield told Wright conditions in the conditional commitment had been met.

“The Grain Belt Express transmission line is a critical energy security project, supported by a broad, multi-state coalition of stakeholders”, stated the letter, shared on Grain Belt Express’ website.

“It is an open-access line that will deliver all forms of American energy based on customer demand and available market power, enhancing the ability of the largest grid operators to share power, including from generators directed to operate under DOE’s 202(c) authority”, the letter added.

“This 800-mile power pipeline is capable of delivering four nuclear power plants’ worth of electricity. It is the highest capacity and second longest line in U.S. history.

“By connecting four U.S. grid regions - also a historic first - the Grain Belt Express will deliver cost savings and strengthen reliability for 29 states and DC, more than 40 percent of Americans, and 25 percent of Department of Defense installations”.

The project obtained certificates of “public convenience and necessity” from Kansas and Missouri in 2019, Illinois in 2023 and Indiana in 2013.

According to the government’s online Permitting Dashboard, the environmental review and permitting process for phase I is expected April 2026. Enlistment on the Dashboard gives a project the benefits of transparency and efficiency under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST-41). Grain Belt Express made it into the Dashboard under the Briden government on February 20, 2024.

On May 7, 2025, Grain Belt Express said it had awarded $1.7-billion contracts to Quanta Services and Kiewit Energy Group Inc. Construction is expected to start next year, it said then.

In response to the DOE’s cancellation of support, the office of Bailey, the Missouri attorney-general, said in a statement the project is “a multi-billion-dollar green energy scam that threatened Missouri’s farmers, landowners, and rural communities”.

“If Invenergy still intends to force this project on unwilling landowners, we will continue to fight every step of the way”, Bailey said.

Rigzone emailed comment requests to Invenergy and Grain Belt Express about Bailey’s threat to have the project junked.

Separately, Hawley, a Republican senator for Missouri, also claimed victory, saying it was he who had secured a pledge from Wright to “halt” the project. Hawley has also accused the project of land grabbing.

In the letter to Wright, Shield, the Grain Belt Express vice president, said, “Senator Hawley and AG Bailey have pursued an unwarranted and unhinged crusade against the Grain Belt Express through media attacks and letters to you seeking rescission of the Grain Belt Express’ conditionally approved DOE loan guarantee, as well as AG Bailey’s own separate consumer protection investigation and request to the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) to reopen its Grain Belt approval”.

“Recent false accusations from Senator Hawley and AG Bailey saying that the Grain Belt Express will cost America billions instead of saving us billions, whether mistaken or purposefully declared, are misleading at best”, Shield added.

“The questions raised by AG Bailey were all considered and decided by the MPSC through a long and rigorous regulatory process that started in August of 2022 and appealed to exhaustion in the Missouri courts reaching finality on April 28, 2025”.

Missouri Farm Bureau president Garrett Hawkins said in a statement about the DOE cancellation, “This move demonstrates a long-overdue recognition of the voices of rural communities who have consistently and clearly expressed their deep concerns about the project’s impact on their land, livelihoods, and private property rights”.

In support of the project, environmental watchdog Sierra Club said of the DOE decision, “Missouri is a coal-dependent state, in the midst of a transition to cleaner sources of power. The Grain Belt transmission line would deliver 2.5 gigawatts of around-the-clock electricity - mostly from wind - to Missouri in the first phase of the project”.

“The project would provide options to Missouri towns for where they can buy power if looking for cheaper and cleaner electricity”, Sierra Club added.

Gretchen Waddell-Barwick, director of Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter, said the project “played by the rules, received multiple state approvals, and withstood legal challenges”.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2025/07/data-center-e1753438072135.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 20:03:30.655033

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

Can California bridge the gap?,"Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-07-25/the-trump-administration-is-gutting-epas-research-arm-can-california-bridge-the-gap,"In the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the research arm of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a robust if little-known California agency known as the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment is poised to take on an even bigger role to bridge the gap.
“They are left more vulnerable.” It also shifts the onus onto California and other states to fill the void left by the federal government.
The Golden State appears better positioned than many others carry on the work — particularly through the small but mighty department Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or OEHHA, located within the California Environmental Protection Agency.
While California remains dedicated to such science, she said other states may not be so lucky.
“California remains open for [a] rigorous, science-based approach to health and environmental protections,” Garcia said.","In the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the research arm of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a robust if little-known California agency known as the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment is poised to take on an even bigger role to bridge the gap.

The EPA this month announced that it was eliminating nearly 4,000 employees as part of a cost-saving “reduction in force,” the majority of which are staffers from its Office of Research and Development — whose research into environmental risks and hazards underpins nearly all EPA rules and regulations. The reduction will save the agency $748.8 million, officials said.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback,” read a statement from EPA administrator Lee Zeldin. “This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.”

The ORD had been in operation since the EPA was established by President Richard Nixon in 1970 and was focused on conducting scientific research to help advance the EPA’s goals of protecting human health and the environment.

Experts said the decision to break up the research office sends a chilling signal for science and will leave more communities exposed to environmental hazards such as industrial chemicals, wildfire smoke and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — or PFAs — in drinking water, all of which are subject to the department’s analysis.

“The people of this country are not well served by these actions,” read a statement from Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former EPA Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Science. “They are left more vulnerable.”

It also shifts the onus onto California and other states to fill the void left by the federal government. ORD’s research supported work around Superfund site cleanups and environmental disasters such as the Los Angeles wildfires or the East Palestine, Ohio, train derailment.

“There will be another East Palestine, another Exxon Valdez [oil spill] — some disaster will happen ... and those communities will be hurt when they don’t have to be,” said Tracey Woodruff, a professor at UC San Francisco and a former senior scientist and policy advisor with EPA’s Office of Policy.

The Golden State appears better positioned than many others carry on the work — particularly through the small but mighty department Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or OEHHA, located within the California Environmental Protection Agency.

“California has for some time developed a pretty robust infrastructure of assessing the health harms of toxic chemicals and pollutants,” Woodruff said. “So in that way, we’re better off than almost any other state because we have such a stellar group of scientists.”

Indeed, California is known for some of its more rigorous health-based standards and regulations, such as the Proposition 65 warnings posted by businesses across the state to advise people of the presence of cancer-causing chemicals, which are overseen by OEHAA.

By dismantling ORD, the EPA is further politicizing the independent science and research that underpins so many of the nation’s regulations, said Yana Garcia, California’s Secretary for Environmental Protection. While California remains dedicated to such science, she said other states may not be so lucky.

“We will continue to keep the work of OEHHA strong and remain committed to it, but we’re still getting a handle on what this loss really means,” Garcia said. “It is a huge loss to California. It is an even bigger loss to so many other states that don’t have an Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessments like we do.”

Kris Thayer, OEHHA’s director, came to agency from ORD, where she directed its IRIS program for identifying and characterizing the human health hazards of chemicals. She said the state is “absolutely going to be looking at every way that we can fill the void given our resources, but we are going to feel the pinch of this.”

“It’s not only that the quantity of assessments will be reduced, but the credibility of the assessments will be reduced, because they will be developed by programs where there’s a lot more opportunity for political interference in terms of the science that gets shaped,” she said.

Chemical industry and other anti-regulatory groups have lobbied for the EPA to limit ORD’s influence. A January letter addressed to Zeldin spearheaded by the American Chemistry Council and 80 other organizations said risk assessments developed by ORD were “being used to develop overly burdensome regulations on critical chemistries essential for products we use every day.”

In particular, they cited the government’s evaluation of chemicals including formaldehyde, inorganic arsenic and hexavalent chromium, which can be used or created by industrial processes. The groups charged the agency with a lack of impartiality and transparency, a slow process and limited peer review.

Thayer noted that a lot of assessment work conducted by ORD is used in California. On the other hand, a number of states and EPA programs also look to California’s assessments.

“We’re going to be monitoring how this unfolds, but we’re certainly going to be looking to do everything we can to meet capacity — we’re not going to be able to fully meet it — and recognizing that our work will not only impact California, but can be used by other states,” she said.

Garcia said California has hired a number of people from the federal government over the past year and is open to absorbing more EPA employees who were recently laid off. OEHHA has a number of open positions.

“California remains open for [a] rigorous, science-based approach to health and environmental protections,” Garcia said.

Woodruff, of UCSF, said she hopes to see California and other states invest more in OEHAA and other scientific agencies by offering better salaries and bolstering staff numbers. But ultimately, she said the Golden State can use this moment to become an example for others to follow.

“California could be a real leader for all the other states who also want to keep doing right by their by their constituents and continuing to address toxic chemical exposure,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee0711a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4339x2278+0+308/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2F10%2Fd4d5d1624654b9c2b8b686f8ab0a%2Fap25163575027245.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 11:01:05.399696

EOS Energy, a manufacturer of zinc batteries, had a small footprint in Turtle Creek, but after the Inflation Reduction Act became law, they were able to expand.
It was thanks to the IRA that EOS was able to engineer a manufacturing renaissance in Turtle Creek.
And at the same time, Turtle Creek wasn’t the only beneficiary of IRA programs.","Over the last three years, America has benefited from a clean-energy jobs boom, and now, President Trump and Congress are turning that boom into a bust. You wouldn’t know it, though, if you saw Trump’s speech in Pittsburgh last week. Despite the slew of promises he made about bringing new jobs to our area, he didn’t once mention the fact that his policies — including his repeal of clean-energy incentives — are jeopardizing many of the jobs we already have.

For decades after Westinghouse left Turtle Creek and the East Pittsburgh area, my town and neighboring communities struggled to attract businesses that could create jobs at the same scale. It wasn’t until the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included historic incentives for clean energy, that we were able to see the economic comeback we had long hoped for.

EOS Energy, a manufacturer of zinc batteries, had a small footprint in Turtle Creek, but after the Inflation Reduction Act became law, they were able to expand. They secured a $305 million loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Energy, and that guarantee was part of a program expanded dramatically by the IRA.

With this new funding, EOS embarked on Project AMAZE, which not only redeveloped the former Westinghouse site but also brought hundreds of new jobs to the area. These new jobs are paying family-sustaining wages, and many of the workers are unionized through the United Steelworkers.

Again, this is the kind of investment that we had been hoping for but hadn’t been able to attract. It was thanks to the IRA that EOS was able to engineer a manufacturing renaissance in Turtle Creek. And at the same time, Turtle Creek wasn’t the only beneficiary of IRA programs. In small towns throughout the Rust Belt, big investments in clean-energy manufacturing were made owing largely to incentives provided by the IRA.

Many of these towns were like our own: They had been abandoned decades ago by big corporations that had shut down local factories and shipped jobs overseas or to states unfriendly to labor, states where workers could be more easily exploited. The IRA was reversing all that, and then Trump took office and pushed Congress to repeal the IRA for purely political reasons.

Now, we’re seeing all this progress reversed. Companies that were planning to build new clean-energy facilities and create more jobs are canceling construction plans, and some have already announced layoffs. These cancellations and job losses didn’t come out of the blue: They are the direct result of Trump’s policy choices.

This is what happens when you withhold congressionally appropriated funds for clean energy. It’s what happens when you repeal almost all the incentives that spurred the clean-energy jobs boom that we’ve enjoyed in Turtle Creek, a boom enjoyed throughout the Rust Belt and across the United States.

I don’t say this to attack Trump but rather to highlight the emptiness of the rhetoric we heard last week. He came to Pittsburgh touting nothing but promises and announcements of future jobs, and this comes not two weeks after he cut incentives that created real jobs in our area. While he was announcing all those planned future investments, my mind was fixated on one question: What’s going to happen to investments that have already been made in my town and others throughout western Pennsylvania and the Rust Belt?

At best, the outlook is cloudy. Experts say that Trump’s gutting of clean-energy incentives will lead to job losses throughout the sector, but I’m still hoping that these predictions, though well-informed, don’t come true in our area. We’ve waited too long for good times to return, and we don’t want to see our economic comeback cut short because of politics.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/07/8711038_web1_GTR-summitDUNLAP011.JPG,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:00.381232

Given the legal and moral authority of the Court, the quality and scope of its reasoning and the scale of participation by States and international organizations in the proceedings, this opinion is sure to inform international litigation, U.N. Conference of Party negotiations (in the context of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement), and domestic procedures going forward. This article analyzes some of the key points among those the Court covered in its 140-page opinion.

Context of the Proceedings

This opinion stems from mobilization that began as a student-led initiative, supported by Vanuatu and a core group of States. Based on their proposals, the U.N. General Assembly issued a request to the ICJ to clarify States’ climate-related obligations under several overlapping areas of international law, including the U.N. Charter, international human rights law, the international climate treaties, the law of the sea, and customary international law (Question A). It also asked the Court to clarify the issue of reparations for significant climate and environmental harm inflicted in breach of these obligations (Question B).

On July 23, at a public hearing held in the Hague, ICJ President Judge Yuji Iwasawa announced the Court’s opinion, which was subsequently published online along with the separate opinions and declarations of several judges. Notably, although several judges indicated that they would have favored further-reaching findings (for instance on debt relief or intersectionality), and additional clarity on the human right to a healthy environment, the Court adopted its opinion unanimously, making it the fifth of the ICJ’s total 29 total advisory opinions issued in the last eighty years to be adopted with the votes of all judges in favor.

What Was at Stake?

During the course of their written and oral submissions, the States involved in the proceedings made a wide range of arguments about the intensity and nature of their international obligations around climate change. While many States – led by Vanuatu and other climate-vulnerable small island states – argued for robust recognition of State obligations in the face of climate change, others sought to minimize their international obligations. For example, the United States and Kuwait argued that the content of States’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) cannot be reviewed against any substantive international standards. The U.S. also objected to the idea of differentiated obligations for developed and developing States. China, Russia and others argued that the climate treaties (the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, and the Kyoto Protocol) are a specialized regime, or lex specialis, superseding other obligations. As concerns customary law, the Nordic Countries and others argued that a global problem like climate change was beyond the reach of customary rules against transboundary environmental harm.

These and other key issues were addressed in the advisory opinion. The stakes were high: if the Court had applied a restrictive interpretation of the international climate regime, and found that States’ obligations do not go beyond those that they have voluntarily opted into under that regime, this would have deeply set back climate justice movements and undermined recent developments in addressing the human rights impacts of climate change or the implications for marine pollution made by other courts. Instead, the ICJ’s opinion built on these judicial findings to establish that States have an overlapping set of obligations to cooperate and to combat, adapt to, and provide reparation for climate change.

Establishing the Obligations of States (Question A)

The ICJ’s analysis began by addressing Question A, concerning the international legal obligations of States. In particular, the ICJ (1) rejected the lex specialis argument that climate obligations stem solely from the international climate regime; (2) confirmed the binding nature of key obligations in the international climate treaties; (3) confirmed the applicability of obligations under customary international law; (4) built on International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) findings regarding climate change; and (5) held that fundamental human rights treaties are applicable to the context of climate change.

(1) Rejecting the Lex Specialis Argument

The first key point of the ICJ’s reasoning, and a cornerstone of the opinion, was the rejection of the lex specialis argument. Different iterations of this argument were made by States, all converging around the idea that States’ international climate obligations are regulated solely by the international climate regime (e.g. the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement), as the more specific legal framework. This approach would mean excluding further-reaching obligations under other treaties or customary international law from reaching climate issues. The Court clearly and emphatically rejected this argument, finding that the lex specialis rule applies only where there is an inconsistency between regimes, or a clear intention to displace more general rules with narrower, more specific ones. Neither condition was satisfied here, meaning that the climate treaties do not represent the sum of all climate obligations: they apply alongside and in addition to human rights law, environmental law, and customary law.

(2) Acknowledging Binding Obligations Under the International Climate Regime

Turning next to the international climate regime, the Court’s opinion established the relevant obligations and general principles set forth by that regime (i.e. common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC), the precautionary principle, sustainable development, equity and intergenerational equity). It clarified that the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement create binding obligations regarding mitigation, adaptation, and cooperation. It also clarified the Paris Agreement’s temperature limit, which is set out in Art. 2(1)(a) of the treaty. That provision aims at limiting global warming to “well below 2°C” while “pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.” The Court held that the 1.5°C threshold has now become the parties’ agreed primary temperature goal, superseding the 2°C threshold (para. 224).

This threshold, the Court further held, informs States’ mitigation obligations. Some parties to the proceedings had argued that the content of States’ NDCs is discretionary, meaning that it cannot be subjected to substantive evaluation. After examining the Paris Agreement’s requirements that NDCs be progressive and reflect each State’s “highest possible ambition,” however, the Court held that States’ discretion is limited. All States’ NDCs, when taken together, must make it possible to achieve the 1.5°C temperature limit set out by the Paris Agreement (para. 249). States must also act with due diligence in taking measures to achieve their NDCs.

(3) Applying a Stringent Customary Standard of Due Diligence

Turning to customary international law, the ICJ established that the obligation to prevent significant transboundary environmental harm (the already established and accepted customary rule of “no harm”) applies to climate change, concurrently with the climate treaties. Some States had argued that this rule applies only to localized cross-border harm between neighboring States, and not a global problem like climate change. However, the Court found that the climate system is an integral part of the environment, and must be protected for present and future generations. As a result, the Court opined, States are under a stringent standard of due diligence to prevent significant harm to the climate system, including by taking science-informed precautionary measures and conducting risk assessments and environmental impact assessments. The measures required vary depending on a State’s capabilities: the principle of CBDR-RC tailors obligations to States’ resources and levels of development and ensures an equitable response to climate change.

The Court also noted that States have a customary duty to cooperate for the protection of the environment (para. 301). It also expressly emphasized that customary obligations “are the same for all States and exist independently regardless of whether a State is a party to the climate change treaties” (para. 315). This means that States who denounce the Paris Agreement, such as the United States, do not enter a legal vacuum, but continue to be bound under international law by customary obligations to prevent climate change-related harm and cooperate with other States.

(4) Confirming (and Going Beyond) the ITLOS Advisory Opinion

Along with considering the relevant obligations under various environmental treaties (the Ozone Layer Convention, its Montreal Protocol, the Biodiversity Convention, and the Desertification Convention), the Court engaged with the obligations entailed by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In doing so, it affirmed the 2024 ITLOS advisory opinion on climate change, recognizing that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions constitute marine pollution and trigger State obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment.

Going beyond the ITLOS opinion (and with gratitude to Pranav Ganesan for highlighting this), the Court also engaged with the loss of land and territorial sea due to sea-level rise. In doing so, it resolved long-standing questions within international law about what happens when rising sea levels impact a State’s maritime or land borders. The Court held that States will not lose the maritime zones belonging to their territory if sea levels rise, and that even the complete loss of land territory through sea level rise does not necessarily mean that a State ceases to exist. This feeds into discussions about the possibility of virtual States, but also relates to climate-induced displacement and the migration-related obligations of States.

(5) Applying International Human Rights Law

In addition to climate treaties, customary law, and environmental treaties, the Court applied international human rights law. It held that the core U.N. human rights treaties apply in this context, given that a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a precondition for the enjoyment of human rights. The Court recognized that the adverse effects of climate change may significantly impair the effective enjoyment of the human rights to health, an adequate standard of living, access to food, water and housing, privacy, and the rights of women, children, and Indigenous peoples. It also engaged with the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, recognizing that such a right emerges from the interdependence of human rights and the environment, and that it is “inherent in the enjoyment of other human rights” (para. 393).

Reparation for Breaching Climate-Related Obligations (Question B)

The ICJ made landmark findings regarding reparations, including on (1) causation and shared responsibility; (2) fossil fuel exploitation and the regulation of private actors; and (3) the status of certain climate obligations as obligations erga omnes partes.

(1) Causation and Shared Responsibility

Turning to reparation, the Court declared that customary international rules about responsibility for wrongful acts apply in the context of climate change. On this basis, the Court made several important findings, establishing that the plurality of both responsible and injured States makes reparation more difficult, but certainly not impossible. What is required is the presence of an internationally wrongful act attributable to a State, and the Court solidified the meaning of these requirements in more detail.

Both as concerns attribution of responsibility and proof of causation, several States made “drop in the bucket” arguments aimed at avoiding responsibility by pointing to the contributions of other States. Rejecting these arguments, the Court found that the customary rules on State responsibility can address situations concerning a plurality of injured or responsible States (para. 430). In determining whether a breach of climate obligations was causally linked to damage suffered by other States, the Court set out a two-part test that examines (1) whether a given impact can be attributed to climate change, based on climate science, and (2) whether damage caused by climate change can be attributed to a particular State or group of States in the concrete case (para. 437).

(2) Responsibility for Fossil Fuels and Regulation of Private Actors

In determining what kinds of breaches of international obligations (wrongful acts) incur State responsibility, the Court engaged with two contentious topics: fossil fuel exploitation and the behavior of private actors. In both regards, the Court recognized the possibility of State responsibility. On fossil fuels, it held that if States fail to protect the climate system from GHG emissions — including by continuing fossil fuel production and consumption, or by granting fossil fuel exploration licenses or subsidies — they may be committing an internationally wrongful act. The Court also held that States may incur international responsibility where they fail to take regulatory or legislative measures to limit GHG emissions by private actors in their jurisdictions.

(3) Climate Obligations as Obligations Erga Omnes Partes

Lastly, and importantly, the Court recognized that obligations under climate treaties and the no-harm rule under customary international law are obligations erga omnes partes, meaning that all States parties have a legal interest in the protection of the treaties’ main mitigation obligations. This issue was hotly debated during the proceedings. In its opinion, the Court found that any State has a legal interest in avoiding climate change, and can accordingly invoke the responsibility of other States for violating their legal obligations pertaining to climate (para. 440). This opens the door for proceedings by any State, including non-injured States, seeking cessation of the wrongful act, guarantees of non-repetition, and reparation in the interest of injured States (para. 443).

Conclusion

The reasoning of the ICJ’s inaugural climate opinion is sure to attract extensive analysis and further activity over the course of the coming months, including discussion of the questions left open – such as, for example, the legal status of the right to a healthy environment, or the implications for international investment law or the UNFCCC loss and damage framework. However, already at this early stage, the opinion can be expected to have far-reaching implications for how States approach climate change on the international and domestic stage. The opinion opens the door to litigation between States in international fora, including the ICJ and the ITLOS, and climate-vulnerable States can be expected to rely on the opinion to shift power dynamics within the upcoming COP30 meeting in Brazil.

With this unanimous opinion, the ICJ has taken a clear stand in favor of a coherent and equitable international legal response to climate change. In doing so, it has clarified that States’ climate action does not exist in an international legal vacuum, but rather that States must take proactive, cooperative, science-informed measures to avoid, adapt to and make reparation for global warming. This does not hinge solely on whether they ratify relevant climate treaties, such as the Paris Agreement, but also stems from separate but complementary obligations under customary international law, human rights law, environmental law, and the law of the sea.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2225768969.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 15:06:27.789546

About Kaliber Motors: Kaliber Motors is a technology-first EV company delivering intelligent mobility solutions for the commercial sector.","IRVINE, CA, UNITED STATES, July 25, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Kaliber Motors announces its latest proprietary breakthrough in energy architecture for electric vehicles with the patenting of the Inteli-Charge Modular Hybrid Battery System. Engineered to accelerate fleet uptime and reduce vehicle charging downtime, Inteli-Charge combines high-C-rate lithium iron phosphate (LFP) modules with standard-capacity modules, all governed by an AI-enhanced predictive Battery Management System (BMS). Unlike conventional EV packs limited by uniform charge rates, Inteli-Charge decouples energy replenishment from full-pack cycling, enabling tactical, high-speed charge top-ups mid-route without added system cost. This hybrid solution delivers partial charge recovery in under 10 minutes without compromising long-term battery health or cost-efficiency across fleet operations. Launching with the Kaliber Panther, the company’s last-mile, AI-integrated walk-in delivery platform, Inteli-Charge translates rapid mid-route ultra-fast charging into real-world uptime and a competitive operational edge.

“Vehicle uptime is the new battleground in fleet efficiency,” said Steven Braido, CEO of Kaliber Motors. “Inteli-Charge rewrites the playbook, not by increasing pack size or chasing peak charge speeds, but by sequencing and managing energy availability intelligently in both charge and discharge cycles. Our architecture gives operators the tactical edge they’ve been waiting for.”

Kaliber’s battery system uses a dual-class configuration of LFP cells, combining high-C-rate modules for ultra-fast top-offs with standard-capacity units designed for full-cycle recovery during idle periods. Kaliber’s proprietary Battery Management System (BMS) coordinates energy flow in real time, leveraging vehicle telemetry and AI-driven predictive logic to match power delivery to route demands and terrain.

While many manufacturers chase costly solid-state technologies or all–high-C-rate battery architectures, Kaliber delivers fast-charge performance without either trade-off. Solid-state systems often exceed $300 to $500 per kilowatt-hour and remain commercially immature, while full high-C-rate packs introduce unnecessary thermal strain and escalating cost challenges. Inteli-Charge sidesteps both extremes by leveraging mass-produced, stable LFP chemistry to balance charge velocity, durability, and system cost, delivering modules as low as $90 to $120/kWh and supporting large-fleet electrification without inflating system-level costs.

Beyond charging speed, Inteli-Charge introduces intelligent thermal management, hot-swappable module architecture for streamlined servicing, and cloud-connected diagnostics for fleet-wide optimization. Its fallback logic ensures uninterrupted energy on demanding routes, activating high-C modules precisely when needed and conserving peak power for surges and gradients. This multi-layered strategy translates directly to reduced ownership costs and extended battery lifespan across high-throughput commercial deployments.

Kaliber Motors continues to expand its intellectual property portfolio in support of autonomy-ready and AI-driven logistics platforms. The Inteli-Charge patent marks another milestone in Kaliber’s mission to deliver real-world, next-gen EV infrastructure that is modular, intelligent, and built for scale.

Similar stories have played out across the country as data centers become more and more ubiquitous, particularly in the Southeast.
Data centers are also delaying the retirement of fossil fuel power plants nationwide, with at least 17 fossil fuel generators originally scheduled for closure now delaying retirement.
The gas bonanza is especially concerning because the projected demand from data centers could be significantly overblown.
Regulated utilities like Dominion are guaranteed a healthy rate of return for building power plants and can pass the cost of building the power plants on to customers through rate increases.","Abbe Ramanan is a project director at Clean Energy Group.

In 2020, the Virginia Assembly passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a law that required the state’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, to generate all its electricity from renewable resources by 2045. However, Dominion has found a useful loophole to get around the law’s requirements — data centers.

Viriginia hosts the largest data center market in the world, and is home to at least 150 hyperscale data centers, with more being proposed. In its recent integrated resource plan, Dominion cited projected energy demand from these data centers as a key reason to delay retiring existing power plants, including the Clover Power Station, a coal-powered peaker plant in Halifax County, a disproportionately low-income region.

In addition to delaying peaker retirements, Dominion has proposed building new gas-powered generation, including a 1-GW peaker plant in Chesterfield, a community that already shoulders an undue environmental burden from existing natural gas- and coal-fired generation.

Similar stories have played out across the country as data centers become more and more ubiquitous, particularly in the Southeast. Utilities in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have proposed building 20,000 MW of new gas power plants by 2040. Data centers driving the projected load growth are being used to justify this buildout. In Virginia, Georgia and South Carolina, data centers are responsible for at least 65% of projected load growth.

Data centers are also delaying the retirement of fossil fuel power plants nationwide, with at least 17 fossil fuel generators originally scheduled for closure now delaying retirement. This new gas buildout, as well as the delayed retirement of fossil fuel generators, overwhelmingly harms Black and brown communities, who face higher energy and environmental burdens.

The gas bonanza is especially concerning because the projected demand from data centers could be significantly overblown. Many prospective customers will submit speculative interconnection requests, sometimes across multiple states, inflating demand numbers and making accurate projections difficult.

A study published last year by Lawerence Berkley National Lab highlighted these discrepancies across future demand projections. The report’s low-end predictions estimate data centers will represent 6.7% of all U.S. energy use by 2028, while the high-end estimate is 12% — a difference of 255 terawatt-hours of energy, equivalent to the energy consumption of over 24 million households.

Despite the known issue of site speculation, utilities have an incentive to use exaggerated demand claims to justify building new infrastructure, such as Dominion’s massive Chesterfield peaker plant.

Regulated utilities like Dominion are guaranteed a healthy rate of return for building power plants and can pass the cost of building the power plants on to customers through rate increases. In many cases, ratepayers are also footing the bill for the necessary transmission upgrades to service these large load customers. West Virginia ratepayers, for example, will end up paying more than $440 million for two transmission lines destined for data centers in northern Virginia.

Keeping aging peaker plants online, which provide some of the most expensive energy on the grid (not to mention the most polluting), will also be borne by ratepayers. Utility bills in several states are expected to increase by $40 to $50 a month due to data center-driven grid investments.

Utilities in some states have begun exploring ways to mitigate these costs. As a way to buffer ratepayers from risk, Dominion proposed a new rate class for high energy users such as data centers. The rate class requires a 14-year contract commitment to pay for requested power, even if the customer ends up using less than requested.

Ohio utility American Electric Power enacted a similar tariff, requiring large-scale data centers to pay for up to 85% of their projected energy demand each month, as well as requiring data centers to provide proof they are financially viable and able to meet those requirements. Possibly in a bid to cut down on speculative interconnection requests, customers will also have to pay an exit fee if the project is canceled.

States have also begun exploring ways to mitigate the harms of data centers, including incentivizing renewable energy procurement. Legislators in California have proposed bills that would give data center operators a tax cut if they draw at least 70% of their energy from renewable sources and require operators to publicly share their energy usage.

In North Carolina, regulators approved a green tariff proposal by utility Duke Energy which provides a pathway for data center customers to accelerate solar energy developments to meet their projected demand. The proposal was controversial, as Duke is legally required to cut its carbon emissions by 95% by 2050, prompting some to question whether the tariff would simply allow data centers to subsidize renewable energy development that would have occurred anyway.

These types of regulatory measures are hindered by the nature of data centers themselves, which require 24/7 power and have little appetite for reducing demand during peak periods. Large tech companies with existing decarbonization pledges have turned to procuring their own carbon-free power to address this.

Microsoft, for example, signed a power purchase agreement last year to restart the nuclear facility at Three Mile Island, a move which prompted backlash from residents. Data center pursuit of nuclear power also prompts larger concerns about the impact on the grid. Nuclear plants delivered almost half of the carbon-free power produced in the U.S. in 2023. As more and more nuclear capacity is bought up by tech companies, there is a risk that that energy will be replaced by dirtier forms of generation.

Like it or not, the data center boom is here to stay, but so is climate change. Load growth is not an excuse to reverse climate progress and renew dependence on fossil fuel energy. Regulators need to hold utilities to a higher standard when it comes to projecting demand from data centers and lend more credence to the impact of demand response, distributed energy resources and energy efficiency in helping to manage load growth.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FK1-jylwqxnGai6XnOX-VKgr3RhM7YnUWUWiaUebEg0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTQ2ODk1MTcyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-25 12:09:08.914316

Among other things, OBBBA fully repeals many credits, accelerates the phase-outs to other credits, and adds provisions to disallow credits for taxpayers with certain foreign ownership or influence.

The following credits and deductions were repealed by OBBBA:

Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W – Clean vehicle credits for personal or commercial use will be terminated for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025.

30C – The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit for property like charging stations will be terminated for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

25C and 25D – Home energy efficiency credits, including residential solar property, will be terminated for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

179D – The Energy-Efficient Commercial Building Tax Deduction will be terminated for projects starting construction after June 30, 2026.

While the above credits and deductions are being terminated, the future repeal dates may allow a taxpayer to still take advantage of them before they are no longer available.

OBBBA made significant changes to two of the most popular IRA credits: the §45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) and the §48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (ITC), especially for solar and wind energy projects. The following are some of the changes made to the PTC and ITC for solar and wind property:

Facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, must be placed in service at the latest December 31, 2030, to claim the credit based on the current four-year continuity of construction safe harbor requirement.

For facilities that begin construction more than 12 months from the date of enactment of OBBBA, e., after July 4, 2026, taxpayers must place the property in service by December 31, 2027, to claim the credit.

Rules were included to address involvement of certain foreign entities. This generally includes limitations on where components of the facility are sourced. Ownership structures, contracts, and debt agreements may also affect the ability for an entity to take a credit.

The above changes do not apply to the 45 and 48 versions of the PTC and ITC.

Below is a list of other relevant changes to IRA credits from OBBBA (not all inclusive):

Other PTC/ITC projects besides solar and wind, g., battery storage, geothermal heat pumps, etc., must begin construction by 2034 to claim the full credit, which will phase out completely by 2036.

The ability to transfer or sell IRA credits was unchanged in OBBBA, except for prohibiting the transfer of credits to a prohibited foreign entity.

Even though there were significant changes by OBBBA to IRA-related clean energy credits, there are still significant opportunities to invest in clean energy projects that could qualify for IRA credits with proper planning. Speak to your trusted tax advisor about any clean energy project related plans you may have, and consider the following tips:

Consider accelerating plans for any clean energy vehicle purchases before September 30, 2025, or charging station installations before June 30, 2026.

Consider accelerating plans for solar and wind projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026, if project completion is expected to be completed after December 31, 2027.

If a PTC/ITC project cannot begin construction by the end of 2025 to avoid the prohibited foreign entity rules, consider sourcing the equipment/materials from a U.S. manufacturer to try to qualify to claim the additional 10% domestic content bonus credit.

With the acceleration of credit deadlines, consider working with your trusted tax advisor to understand the beginning of construction rules to help make sure a clean energy project meets the stated deadline.",https://www.forvismazars.us/getmedia/f9a5c4ee-544f-45fa-8e7f-ae6a28d54e82/1032683612-landscape-large.jpg?width=1920&height=1080&ext=.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:04.580857

The Bottom Line Section 45Z is an actionable tax credit with strong bipartisan backing and a favorable runway through 2029.","The Section 45Z clean fuel production tax credit (PTC) under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was created to incentivize the production of low-carbon transportation fuels in the U.S. With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law on July 4, the program’s framework has shifted to align with this administration’s priorities and begun to show signs of stabilization. It now offers a longer timeline, more favorable parameters for crop-based fuels, and greater clarity, though further guidance is still forthcoming.

The tax credit, originally set to expire in 2027, has been extended through 2029. The new law also eliminates indirect land-use change (ILUC) penalties from carbon scoring, which is good news for corn-ethanol, soy-based biodiesel, and other crop-based fuels. For biofuel producers, this means more credit value, more time to claim it, and an open path forward.

Uncertainty Has Faded, and Action is Now Required

While final Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance is still pending, the foundation of the program is well defined. Clean fuel producers should no longer be waiting; they can now move forward with critical planning and preparation. The structure of the tax credit is based on carbon intensity (CI) scoring through the 45ZCF-GREET model, third-party validation, and tax credit transferability. The emerging market signals are clear, where credit value will be closely tied to lifecycle emissions data, audit-ready documentation, and proactive engagement with qualified validators, brokers, and advisors.

Facilities that update their CI modeling, verification planning, and documentation preparation now will be in a much stronger position to monetize early 2025 production and secure value. This includes establishing a defensible life-cycle analysis (LCA), aligning internal compliance requirements, and vetting how prevailing wage or apprenticeship requirements may affect credit eligibility. Delaying action could mean missing early monetization opportunities and losing a competitive edge in the low-carbon fuel market. The time for action is now.

Tips to Prepare and Execute

Execution starts with building a clear, facility-specific tax credit roadmap. Producers should analyze how their current operations score under the required CI modeling and identify technical and operational upgrades being considered to achieve lower CI scores and, hence, higher credit value. Proactive modeling, real-time CI monitoring, and third-party CI reviews are important steps to gaining assurance. Investments in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), renewable electricity, heat recovery, and energy efficiency can all improve CI scores and increase Section 45Z value.

Equally important is systematizing compliance documentation. IRS rules will require proof, not assumptions. That means aligning your finance, operations, and compliance teams now to collect verifiable data, track labor requirements tied to prevailing wage rules, and prepare supporting documentation for LCA filings and potential credit transfers. This process starts with an understanding of the required documents, which can be done through engagement with verification bodies and tax preparers. Don’t underestimate obtaining training for key team members responsible for compliance, or consider hiring an advisory firm for support when in-house expertise is not available.

Monetizing the Section 45Z Credit: Be Ready to Transact

The Section 45Z credit is transferable, meaning it can be sold to buyers with tax liability, unlocking immediate cash flow. But in this emerging market, buyer confidence is key. That confidence comes from well-documented carbon scores, verified models, and clean audit trails that demonstrate compliance with IRS expectations. Buyers will prioritize credits backed by rigorous third-party validation, clear LCA submissions, and accurate documentation of CI reductions. Facilities that can present a complete, auditable compliance package will be first in line for competitive offers and smoother transactions. Just like in renewable energy markets, the ability to execute with precision and transparency will directly affect pricing, speed of transfer, and demand from credit purchasers. Building that level of readiness now will position producers to monetize quickly and at maximum value.

Now is the time to engage LCA experts, brokers, tax advisors, and insurance partners. The most competitive buyers will look for facilities that are “execution ready” with clear documentation, validated modeling, and third-party signoff already in place. Facilities that are prepared will be first in line for the highest offers and fastest monetization timelines.

Think Beyond Section 45Z: Stackable Opportunities

Section 45Z is a powerful incentive on its own, but its impact grows when combined with other programs. Biofuel producers engaged in CCS, for instance, will be eligible for either Sections 45Z or 45Q. Determining which tax credit is most valuable depends on an individual producer’s CI reduction roadmap. A lower CI score boosts credit value under Section 45Z, and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (CA-LCFS) or Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulation (CFR) programs concurrently. Stacking incentives isn’t just possible, it’s a smart strategy. Facilities should assess where credits overlap and ensure they’re maximizing value across federal, state, and export programs.

Policy Engagement and Internal Readiness

As Section 45Z rules are deployed, producers should remain engaged in policy discussions and advocacy. Participation in technical working groups, trade associations, and regional initiatives helps ensure that your facility’s perspective is represented. Staying connected to the rulemaking process not only gives early visibility into program requirements but also creates opportunities to influence guidance in ways that support your business model.

Internally, now is the time to build your Section 45Z execution team. Whether it’s in-house or supported by external experts, success will require cross-functional coordination between engineering, finance, compliance, and legal stakeholders. Clear ownership of documentation, modeling, and tax strategy across departments will be essential to streamline credit generation, validation, and monetization once the program goes live. Adding staff to support carbon-reduction initiatives or teaming with the right advisory partner may be options worth evaluating.

The Bottom Line

Section 45Z is an actionable tax credit with strong bipartisan backing and a favorable runway through 2029. The incentives are meaningful, the framework is coming into focus, and the execution path is much clearer. Clean fuel producers who prepare now by modeling their CI, validating documentation, and aligning stakeholders will be positioned to claim the credit without delay, monetize it efficiently, and outpace the competition.

The opportunity is real. The direction is clear. It’s time to execute. Let’s go!

Despite substantial investment in wind, solar, storage, hydro, and bioenergy projects, concerns are mounting over the industry’s ability to attract and retain enough qualified personnel to meet its growth targets. The clean energy sector is experiencing rapid expansion, particularly in areas such as solar photovoltaic, wind power, and electric vehicles. However, this growth is creating skills shortages, as employers struggle to find qualified workers for key roles.

According to the Clean Energy Council (CEC), there were 97 renewable energy projects either under construction or slated to begin soon at the end of 2024. The CEC estimates that an additional 40,000 workers will be needed by 2030 to support the ongoing transition to renewables. These jobs aren’t limited to direct employment in renewable energy projects but extend to related industries such as manufacturing, transport, and hospitality, particularly in regional areas.

In response to these concerns, the CEC has launched a new clean energy job-ready program. The Clean Energy Council is the peak industry body for clean energy in Australia, representing hundreds of leading businesses operating in solar, wind, hydro, bioenergy, energy storage, and emerging technologies. It works to accelerate the transformation of Australia’s energy system to one that is smarter and cleaner. The program aims to address the manpower shortage by standardising skillsets, training, and career pathways. It also introduces a digital skills passport to attract more tradies, apprentices, and job-seekers to the clean energy sector.

Based on 12 months of consultation with the industry, the program will primarily focus on Victoria and Queensland, making it easier for job seekers to acquire the necessary skills to work on large-scale wind, solar, and storage projects. It will also help employers mobilise a safe, competent, and qualified trade workforce.

More than one-third of shareholders (35 percent) – including the New York City Comptroller, Legal & General’s asset management arm and Schroders – voted in favour of a climate-focused proposal at Macquarie. Filed by Market Forces and Australian Ethical, the resolution called on the Australian financial institution to disclose its exposure to fossil fuel companies, as well as its progress on, and approach to, assessing the firms and projects in its portfolios for alignment with the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Amanda Richman, ethical stewardship lead at Australian Ethical, said: “A smooth and orderly transition toward net zero is in Macquarie’s long-term interest, but without better transparency from the company it’s not clear to shareholders where they stand.”

Only 10 percent of companies identified all 10 topical European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as material in the first wave of reporting under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), according to analysis by EFRAG. The EU standards body has launched an ESRS “state of play” portal to track key insights based on the first disclosures under CSRD.

The database provides access to results based on more than 600 analysed ESRS statements issued this year, collected between January and April. Disclosures on climate change, workforce and business conduct were the most common among first wave companies. More than 50 percent of companies disclosed a climate transition plan, though approaches and formats “varied” EFRAG said. The length of sustainability statements also varied, ranging from 70 to more than 200 pages, on average, with financial institutions producing longer reports on average. There were “limited disclosures” on biodiversity and carbon pricing, and human rights incidents were “rarely reported”, despite other social data being disclosed. The first reports show that, while many companies have taken “significant steps”, consistent and comparable reporting is “still evolving”, EFRAG said. The standards body is in the process of revising the ESRS, following a mandate from the European Commission to do so as part of its broader simplification standards.

The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has developed “near-final” examples to show how companies can improve reporting of uncertainties in their financial statements using climate-related disclosures. The early publication is intended to support “timely and informed” application, the IASB said. The guidance has been developed in response to stakeholder feedback about insufficient information about uncertainties, particularly climate-related ones, and apparent inconsistencies in the information a company provides. The IASB worked with the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to ensure the examples work well with its sustainability-related disclosures requirements.

A European Central Bank (ECB) survey has seen EU banks report “an easing impact on credit standards and terms and conditions for green firms and firms in transition, and a tightening impact for high-emitting firms over the past 12 months”. Banks also noted a net increase in demand for loans to green firms and companies undergoing a green transition, while uncertainty over future climate regulation was perceived as an obstacle. An overall similar impact is expected over the next 12 months. The findings are based on a survey carried out this month.

Schroders Wealth Management, Triodos Bank UK, Environment Bank and Finance Earth are among the organisations that have raised concerns about potential changes to the UK’s Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) market. Under the Environment Act, since 2024 developers have had to deliver a 10 percent biodiversity net gain in comparison to the pre-existing baseline of the site that is to be developed. The institutions wrote to the UK government in response to a recent consultation that included proposals to weaken requirements for minor and medium-sized developments. “The proposed relaxation of the BNG requirements, at just the moment that the sector has got itself geared up and ready to implement them, creates significant uncertainty in a nascent market that depends on long-term commitments and private investment,” they said.

Slovenia’s sustainability-linked bond issuance could trigger a resurgence in issuance from interested corporates and other European sovereigns after a dip in recent years, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Tesla has previously indicated that new affordable vehicles would be introduced in the first half of 2025. Although that timeline has passed, the company said the first unit of the simplified Model Y was produced in June 2025. It is expected to go on sale in the fourth quarter of this year.

Rather than investing heavily in and introducing an all-new vehicle, Tesla is repurposing its existing Model Y platform. The affordable version will feature a reduced set of features and lower-cost materials, including the removal of the rear entertainment screen and other interior simplifications such as cloth seats instead of vegan leather, for example. Production will take place on the same lines currently used for the standard Model 3 and Model Y, which have seen lower utilization thanks to weakening demand.

Development of two previously planned affordable EVs, known internally as NV91 and NV92, was cancelled earlier this year. Those models were intended to be built on Tesla’s next-generation unboxed platform, which is now being reserved exclusively for the company’s autonomous vehicle project, the Cybercab.

Musk stated that the primary goal of the affordable Model Y is to expand Tesla’s addressable market by offering a more accessible product. It seems unlikely that a “cheap” Model Y will realistically reach a large enough group of new EV adoptees. There a real possibility that this would have been the case even with a new model…

That may be up to an Ulster County judge, who on Friday will hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by four environmental and climate justice groups over the state’s failure to act on one of the core mandates of the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.

The lawsuit comes after Governor Kathy Hochul in January slammed the brakes on what was expected to be her signature policy to implement the law: cap and invest.

The program would charge polluters for their carbon emissions and put the proceeds toward the clean energy transition. It was designed to meet one of the climate law’s key requirements, namely that the state issue regulations to achieve steep emissions cuts over the next several decades.

Those rules were supposed to be in place by 2024, a deadline the state blew past. The Hochul administration was finally gearing up to unveil the rules at the start of this year — but instead reversed course over concerns that the carbon pricing program would drive up everyday costs for New Yorkers.

Hochul promised at the time that she was just pressing pause. “We have to get this right,” she told reporters at the time. “Because I believe that other states will be looking at us as a model as well.”

As the year has gone on, though, Hochul’s administration has backed further away from the policy. A draft of the new state energy plan, released Wednesday, mentions it only in passing, as an option the state should “continue to evaluate.”

The administration’s court filings have been similarly non-committal. The state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) wrote in May that cap and invest “remains an option,” and that the agency is making “continued good faith efforts” to issue rules required by the climate law. But it did not propose a meaningful alternative to the cap and invest program, instead highlighting more minor regulations it has adopted to green certain sectors.

Those rules do not add up to anywhere near meeting the kinds of emissions cuts demanded by the climate law, which requires an initial 40 percent reduction by 2030. The state now expects it won’t hit that target until at least 2036, according to the draft energy plan.

Rachel Spector, an attorney at the environmental law group Earthjustice, is representing the four groups suing the state: Citizen Action of New York, PUSH Buffalo, Sierra Club, and WE ACT for Environmental Justice. She said the DEC’s claims in court so far have been “pretty outrageous.”

The climate law “is very clear that the DEC is in charge of issuing regulations that ensure we meet the targets,” she said. “And nowhere does DEC claim that they have done that.”

A DEC spokesperson said the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

In its May filing, the agency argued that the lawsuit is baseless because the department has in fact issued regulations furthering the climate law’s goals. As evidence, it listed several sets of rules it has issued to reduce emissions, including recent ones targeting “superpolluting” refrigerants that together account for about 6 percent of the state’s total emissions.

The most important action DEC cited, however, has since been overturned by President Donald Trump: the Advanced Clean Cars and Trucks rules requiring all new cars and most new trucks sold in the state to be electric (or otherwise zero-emitting) by 2035.

Those mandates, which the DEC said would be “instrumental” in meeting climate law targets, matched ones adopted by California under a longstanding policy that allowed the state to enact stricter pollution rules than the federal government.

In late May, Congress repealed the decades-old waiver that allowed California to set its own pollution standards — and, in turn, the bar that blue-leaning states including New York have followed. Trump signed the legislation in June, scrapping the framework that New York and 16 of its peers were counting on to drive down one of their largest sources of emissions.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said that the car and truck rules were “at or near the top” of what New York had on the books to meet its climate targets, and that there aren’t any actions the state could readily take that would have the same impact.

California, New York, and nine other states immediately sued the Trump administration last month in an effort to restore their pollution rules, but Gerrard called it a “challenging case.”

“It was a violation of Senate procedure to do this,” he said, referring to Congress defying the nonpartisan “parliamentarian” who advises the Senate on procedural questions. “The courts may be reluctant to second-guess the inner workings of the Senate.”

Even if a judge salvages the rules, New York will be hard pressed to meet them. The requirements start with mandating 35 percent of sales in 2026 be electric cars. As of 2023, the figure in New York stood at just6 percent, according to the think tank International Council on Clean Transportation, and sales have not dramatically ramped up since.

The state also appears to have abandoned a longstanding target to put 850,000 electric vehicles on the road by this year; the number currently stands just above 180,000, according to official statistics. (The governor’s office has not publicized the target since early 2023.)

Cap and invest was supposed to change the game, by giving New Yorkers a financial incentive to choose less polluting options.

Without it, even in the rosiest scenario, New York will miss its legally binding emissions targets by tens of millions of metric tons, according to an amicus brief filed in the New York climate law case in early June by the Environmental Defense Fund and two other environmental groups.

The climate law tasks DEC with making rules to “ensure” those limits are met. (DEC asked the judge for a chance to respond to EDF’s arguments, but has not done so.)

The agency is moving ahead with regulations spelling out how companies should report their greenhouse gas emissions. The rules were meant to be a building block of cap and invest, but have for now been carved out. Climate activists dominated public hearings about the rules in June; at the New York City hearing, at least 50 activists rallied outside and packed the small room the agency had booked for the occasion.

Hardly any of them addressed the details of the reporting rules. Instead, one after the other called for Hochul to bring back cap and invest.

The state’s defense in court may rest less on the “strides” it says it has made in meeting the climate law than on more procedural grounds. It argues that the plaintiffs are seeking to force it to move ahead specifically with cap and invest, which the climate law doesn’t require.

The plaintiffs replied that they’re not trying to advance a particular set of regulations, but rather any that would meet the law’s requirements. (In practice, Gerrard said, it’s hard to see what that could be other than cap and invest.)

Moreover, the DEC has argued that, even if it isn’t following the law, the judge should not take the “extraordinary” step of compelling it to. The agency argues that a strong move from the court could compromise energy affordability, and that courts have restrained themselves in the past to avoid “unnecessary hardship” and “disorder” or “confusion in public affairs.”

“They’re trying to scare the judge away from issuing an order here,” said Spector, the Earthjustice attorney. “But they have it backwards. Issuing regulations would not be disrupting the status quo — it’s in line with what everyone expected, what the state has been planning for five years.”

“Really, what is out of line with the status quo is the state’s decision earlier this year to not do anything,” she added.

The DEC’s argument is in keeping with Hochul’s recent backpedaling from New York’s climate law.

“I’ve had to take a close look and realize that we cannot accomplish what those objectives were back … before I became governor, in a time frame that’s going to not hurt ratepayers,” she said in early July. “So we’re slowing things down. I want to make sure people know that.”

The DEC also appears to be fast-tracking a pipeline project that would bring more gas into New York City and Long Island, after previously denying the project permits and repeatedly arguing in recent years that expanding fossil fuel infrastructure would violate the climate law.

Eric Walker, the energy justice senior policy manager at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, said the DEC’s appeal to the judge for lenience marked an “encroachment on the separation of powers.”

“The administrative agency is asking for a free pass to essentially bypass the mandate of the people to the legislature and the administration,” he said. “This is really scary territory that we’re in.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47661/Bnb0_kV83phnqsXJ584WvHKsmMnfwMGRULbG7We1SDY/w%3A820/h%3A546/rt%3Afill/g%3Afp%3A0.5%3A0.5/q%3A90/el%3A1/ahr0chm6ly9zmy51cy1lyxn0ltiuyw1hem9uyxdzlmnvbs9uexnmb2n1cy9jbgvhbi1jyxitcnvszxmucg5n1753436239.png?h=4bc2b340&itok=QwcWPjsA,N,,2025-07-25 13:08:21.304331

The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer remains a top global player in clean energy and EV manufacturing. However, shifting political winds and market dynamics could hurt its profits—especially its revenue from carbon credits, a long-time earnings booster. The EV giant’s credit sales this quarter drops to more than 50%.

With stiffer competition, changing demand for EVs, and the threat of U.S. climate policy rollbacks, Tesla’s path forward is less predictable than in past quarters. Let’s see how the company performs this quarter and what lies ahead.

Q2 2025 Earnings: Deliveries, Revenue, and Margins All Down

In its latest Q2 2025 report, Tesla posted revenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% drop from the same quarter last year. Net income came in at $1.17 billion, 16% down due to pricing pressure and weaker delivery numbers. Earnings per share (EPS) landed at $0.40, missing analyst expectations of $0.43.

Tesla delivered 384,122 vehicles during the quarter, down from 466,140 in Q2 2024, a decline of nearly 14% year-over-year. Much of the dip came from reduced demand in North America and ongoing price competition in China.

Moreover, Tesla’s energy generation and storage segment, which continues to grow in the past quarters, also fell. This segmet is led by strong sales of its Megapack and Powerwall units. These energy products generated more than $2.8 billion, down 7% year-over-year—an increasingly important line as vehicle profits tighten.

CEO Elon Musk noted in the earnings call that Tesla is pushing ahead with its Robotaxi launch, and reiterated plans for a more affordable EV model in 2026. He acknowledged that while macro and political factors remain uncertain, Tesla remains committed to innovation and global market expansion.

Competition Erodes Tesla’s Global Lead

Tesla’s long-standing EV dominance is being tested. In Q2 2025, Tesla delivered just under 385,000 vehicles globally. Meanwhile, China’s BYD sold over 606,000 battery electric vehicles, widening its lead and showing how quickly the competitive landscape is shifting.

Tesla’s market share in the U.S. has dropped from 75% in 2022 to about 43% in 2025. In Europe, Tesla now holds just 1.6% of the EV market.

Chinese automakers like Xiaomi, Nio, and Xpeng continue to grow quickly, offering lower-priced EVs with strong features. As affordability becomes more important to buyers, Tesla’s premium pricing may limit its growth. This is especially true if U.S. subsidies are scaled back or eliminated.

Unless Tesla launches a budget-friendly model soon, analysts believe it may lose more ground. Combined with falling credit revenue, this puts real pressure on its profit margins.

Tesla’s Carbon Credit Revenue Faces Political Risk

One of Tesla’s most profitable business lines has been the sale of regulatory credits to other automakers that fail to meet emissions targets. These carbon credits have nearly zero production costs and have historically delivered high-margin income.

In 2023, Tesla earned $1.79 billion from regulatory credits. That surged to $2.76 billion in 2024, accounting for almost two-thirds of Tesla’s profit in some quarters.

Notably, Q2 2025 carbon credits revenue fell by over 50% to 439 million, from 890 million in the same period last year. And the company’s quarterly credit sales show a decreasing trend since Q2 2024, as seen below.

Still, a major risk is emerging. The proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBA) from Republican lawmakers aims to undo several of President Biden’s climate programs. It will eliminate EV tax credits, reverse EPA emissions standards, and weaken the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). All of this could reduce the need for automakers to buy carbon credits—shrinking Tesla’s most lucrative income stream.

Estimates suggest Tesla’s credit revenue could fall to $595 million or less by 2026, and disappear completely by 2027. This would cut deeply into its margins and future earnings. Despite Elon Musk’s occasional support for deregulation, these changes would be a major setback for Tesla’s business model.

Understanding the Carbon Credit System

Tesla benefits from emissions rules that reward automakers for producing zero-emission vehicles. Since it sells only EVs, Tesla accumulates more credits than it needs. It then sells the extras to competitors like Stellantis, GM, and Toyota, who still sell many gas-powered cars.

This has been an easy revenue stream. But if OBBA or similar legislation weakens clean air rules or emissions targets, the demand for these credits will shrink. That would leave Tesla more dependent on EV sales and energy storage—both of which face their own competitive and pricing challenges.

The Political Climate Adds More Uncertainty

Trump’s OBBA law reflects a broader effort by Republicans to reverse Biden’s climate agenda. With this new policy, many climate-focused programs will be rolled back. This includes EV subsidies, clean energy tax credits, and stricter emissions standards.

Tesla could face a drop in EV demand, especially in the U.S., if those incentives vanish. Ironically, Elon Musk has voiced support for deregulation, but the fallout from such policies could significantly hurt Tesla’s bottom line. Investors are concerned that political shifts could make Tesla’s future earnings far more volatile.

Tesla’s Stock and Strategic Outlook

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) has seen big swings this year. After climbing above $300 per share earlier in 2025, it fell to around $250 in July as delivery numbers declined and political risks grew.

Investors are watching key developments going forward:

Will Tesla launch an affordable EV model to regain market share?

Can its energy storage business grow fast enough to offset falling vehicle margins?

How will regulatory changes affect its carbon credit income?

Upcoming launches like the RoboTaxi platform and Optimus AI robot are exciting but may take time to affect the bottom line. In the near term, Wall Street wants to see stable margins, smart cost controls, and consistent vehicle output.

Driving Forward: Can Tesla Adapt?

Tesla is still a powerful brand with loyal customers and strong technology. But its financial strength depends not only on vehicle sales, but also on favorable policies. Carbon credits and government incentives have played a big role in Tesla’s success.

With political uncertainty rising and competitors growing stronger, Tesla has to adapt fast. The company’s energy business and AI-driven platforms offer new growth paths, but execution and timing will be key.

As Trump’s OBBA bill turned into law, Tesla’s stock could remain volatile. But if the company navigates these challenges and continues to innovate, it may yet hold onto its leadership role in the clean energy transition.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2487869271.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 11:00:53.205250

The federal EV tax rebate offers purchasers up to $7,500 off the prices of vehicles that qualify.","Here’s what you’ll learn reading this story.

EV interest in the United States is at its lowest point since 2019.

A recent AAA survey revealed that the top motivators against buying EVs included high purchase prices, range anxiety, and a lack of public charging stations—among others.

Many automakers, including Toyota, see plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles as the best interim solution.

Remember when just about every automaker was committed to electrifying its entire range of vehicles by 2030? We do too. However, a recent showed that EV interest in the United States is at its lowest point since 2019—the data showed that only 16 percent of Americans reported being “likely” or “very likely” to purchase an EV as their next car. Many automakers are pushing back their electrification targets, as electric vehicles clearly aren’t resonating with consumers as expected. But why?

High Purchase Price and High Depreciation

EVs have always been more expensive than gas-powered vehicles. And for good reason—it’s new technology. We’ve seen this already, with vehicles like Volkswagen’s all-electric ID. Buzz that starts at $59,995 MSRP. And if that’s not bad enough, Electrek recently reported on a VW dealership that was caught setting a $35,000 markup on the ID. Buzz—despite calls from corporate to knock it off.

We’ve also seen countless times that EVs don’t hold their value in the used market. One ID. Buzz flipper (someone who buys a vehicle new and immediately tries to sell) lost $11,000 on a vehicle that had just 398 miles on it. And a quick look at resale sites like Bring a Trailer and Cars & Bids shows that this aligns with a general pattern of EVs tanking in value.

Unruly For Long Road Trips

While the infrastructure for EV charging is improving—I recently embarked on a nine-hour drive, during which I passed plenty of chargers—that isn’t the only issue faced by EV drivers. The bigger shortcoming, had I been in an EV myself, would’ve been the dwell time at the charger.

For context, I stopped around five times during that nine-hour drive, bringing the total journey length to roughly 10 hours. However, if we were to load in the same route we took into Tesla’s admittedly convenient online route planner tool (see above), the online calculator—assuming we were in a 363-mile-capable Tesla Model 3 Long Range—estimated that we would need to charge for a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes, which would bring the minimum time of the journey to just under 11 hours (excluding any additional stops).

Now, obviously, these massive road trips are a very small percentage of what these vehicles will do throughout their lifetime. But the numbers don’t lie.

Potential Elimination of Tax Credits/Rebates

Twelve percent of those who participated in AAA’s survey cited the potential elimination of EV tax credits and rebates as a deterrent to buying an electric vehicle. And while that’s not a huge number of people, it’s an understandable position. The federal EV tax rebate offers purchasers up to $7,500 off the prices of vehicles that qualify. That’s a monumental incentive to get consumers to buy into the all-electric lifestyle.

For context, let’s look at Volkswagen’s ID. Buzz, which does not qualify for the federal tax rebate, as it’s assembled outside of North America. Assuming it became eligible for the maximum available $7,500, the vehicle’s starting price would drop from $59,995 MSRP down to $52,495. We’re pleased to report that VW is looking to circumvent this red tape by offering lease bonuses of the same $7,500 amount.

What Does The Future Look Like?

Many automakers like Toyota are prioritizing hybrids for U.S. markets. It’s all well and good to have aspirations for a greener future, but these manufacturers still need to meet their customers’ demands—and for now, that means developing plug-in hybrids.

There’s also a chance that we could see a renaissance of extended-range electric vehicles in the coming years—vehicles that use electricity to drive the wheels, while employing a small internal-combustion engine as a generator to “extend” the range. We’ve seen automakers like Scout Motors and even Ford bring EREVs back to significant success.

Toyota believes electrification isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution, and we tend to agree. Combing through AAA’s study, we found that the percentage of U.S. drivers who believe most cars will be electric within the next decade declined from 44 percent in 2022 to 23 percent this year.

It’s unclear what technology will become standardized in the coming years. The only certainty, unfortunately, is that many automakers are pushing back their electrification targets for U.S. markets.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/electric-car-charging-at-the-electric-station-on-royalty-free-image-1753209792.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.146xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-07-25 11:00:56.518288

That may be changing soon, however. On this week's second-quarter Tesla earnings call, CEO Elon Musk finally gave us a hint of what to expect. ""It's just a Model Y,"" he said. Let that sink in.

Or could it be more than that? On this week's Plugged-In Podcast, my co-host Tim Levin and I discuss what could lift Tesla's fortunes after a not-so-great first half marked by slowing sales and a real downturn in how the brand is perceived.

Ultimately, the big story of this year so far is probably ""Tesla down, General Motors up."" The General's many brands seem to be picking up current, former and prospective Tesla owners across the board, and drawing in a lot of EV newcomers as well. Chevrolet is now America's no. 2 EV brand behind Tesla, and the Cadillac Lyriq and Optiq in particular are big hits for GM's luxury division.

In fact, we'd go so far as to say that EVs are the best thing Cadillac has done since its cars had tailfins. Iconic as it is, the luxury carmaker has had a rough couple of decades, with much of its market share getting eaten by BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus and the rest. But now, it does look like Cadillac is on the path to becoming the sort of all-electric luxury brand that other automakers are now waffling on.

I say good on Cadillac for pulling that off, but we'll see how all of GM's brands do when the EV tax credits expire on Sept. 30.

The recently enacted “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates many tax incentives designed to bring down the costs of cleaner ways to power your life, such as rooftop solar and electric vehicles.

But there’s still time to take advantage of the federal tax incentives that help make it financially possible for many households to go green.

Here’s what you need to know about clean energy tax credits before they’re gone.

Rooftop solar

Rooftop solar has become increasingly popular in recent years as an energy option that’s better for the planet(link is external) – and often less expensive than other electricity sources.(link is external)

California has been a leader on rooftop solar, with roughly 2 million households using it. More than 60% of those users are low- or middle-income. Along with over 300,000 renters, they’ve seen reduced monthly utility bills, thanks to the clean energy source.

Currently, consumers who install rooftop solar panels can have 30% of their installation costs reimbursed through the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit(link is external). The credit also applies to solar water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, fuel cells and battery storage technology.

But under the new law, that credit for customer-owned clean energy systems will disappear after December 31. Residents hoping to use it will either have to have paid for their system by then or already have it fully installed – the law isn’t clear(link is external).

The safest bet is to try to finish installation before the year ends. This is often defined as getting “permission to operate” from your local utility, the final step in the process.

Residential solar systems take about a week to install, according to the Solar Power Authority(link is external). But when you factor in contractor selection, site visits, permitting, utility interconnection procedures and other administrative requirements, the total process can take between one and five months, sometimes even longer.

That means consumers hoping to take advantage of federal tax credits for their solar projects should get started as soon as possible. But even with the tight timeline, seek bids for multiple contractors, check their licenses and read contracts carefully before signing them.

The commercial version of this credit will stick around a little longer. Developers can still get 30% back(link is external) for solar systems that either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or are fully installed by December 31, 2027.

This means homeowners wanting to go solar can still choose a third-party-owned system, also known as a Power Purchase Agreement, which describes a commercial entity’s ownership of the rooftop solar panels and sale to you of the solar energy through a long-term contract.

Electric vehicles

Tax credits for electric vehicles, or EVs, will be the first to go under the law.

These cars are becoming increasingly popular(link is external) as low-carbon alternatives to traditional gas guzzlers, helping to reduce emissions from one of the country’s most carbon-intensive industries. They’re also attractive because they’re more efficient(link is external).

But in the U.S., EVs are sometimes more expensive than their gas-powered counterparts.

The Biden administration implemented a federal tax incentive program(link is external) in 2022 to encourage Americans to drive electric. Anyone buying an EV – with certain limitations – can get $7,500 back on their annual taxes if the car is new, and up to $4,000 back for a used EV. The credit doesn’t apply in all taxpayer situations.

The new law moves up the end date of these incentives, from the end of 2032 to Sept. 30 of this year – just two months away.

Buyers must purchase and take delivery before then if they want to take advantage of the savings federal credits can supply.

Energy efficiency upgrades

Several home efficiency improvements, such as installation of electric heat pumps and replacement of insulation, were subsidized under the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit(link is external).

These changes can reduce the energy demand of your home, in turn lowering the electricity bill. But the credit will end after December 31.

Before then, consumers can claim up to $2,000 on new heat pumps or water heaters that meet or exceed certain standards(link is external). You can get up to another $1,200 back for upgrades to windows, doors or insulation or for conducting a home energy audit.

Some limitations apply. Credits don’t roll over to future years. They also don’t apply to businesses or new homes.

There’s a separate, similar credit(link is external) for builders investing in energy-efficient technology in new homes, but it disappears as of June 30, 2026.

Other federal programs(link is external) that encourage(link is external) home efficiency upgrades will remain in place, unaffected by the new law. Some states(link is external) and local governments have their own programs, too.

As the United States prepares to phase out its electric vehicle (EV) tax credit at the end of the third quarter, Tesla, the leading manufacturer in the EV market, is poised to tackle this challenge with a strategic and innovative approach. During the recent Q2 2025 earnings call, Tesla executives shared insights into their plans to remain competitive and accessible to consumers despite the changing financial landscape.

The EV Tax Credit's Impending Expiration

The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, a significant incentive that has encouraged consumers to transition to electric mobility, is set to expire soon. Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has long advocated for a market devoid of such credits, arguing that the focus should shift from incentives for the oil and gas industry. However, as the expiration looms, Tesla is taking proactive measures to ensure its vehicles remain appealing to buyers.

Q3 Sales Strategies

In light of the upcoming tax credit expiration, Tesla is intensifying its efforts to encourage customers to purchase vehicles before the deadline. The company is rolling out various incentives, making the purchasing process more attractive for potential buyers. From the Cybertruck to the Model 3, Tesla's broad lineup will see promotional pricing aimed at maximizing sales in the third quarter.

Affordable Vehicle Production

During the earnings call, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy revealed that Tesla has initiated production of more affordable models starting in June. This move aims to ensure that the company can offer competitively priced vehicles even after the tax incentives are no longer in place. Moravy stated, ""We started production in June, and we’re ramping quality builds and things around the quarter. Our goal is to maximize production with a higher rate... We’ll be ready with new, more affordable models available for everyone in Q4."" This commitment to affordability signals Tesla's dedication to making EVs available to a broader audience.

The New Affordable Models

While specific details on the new models are still under wraps, previous comments from Tesla executives suggest that these more affordable vehicles will likely be variations of the existing Model Y and Model 3. By leveraging its current lineup while offering lower price points, Tesla can attract cost-conscious consumers without compromising on quality or features.

Market Implications

The expiration of the EV tax credit presents a significant challenge not only for Tesla but also for the entire electric vehicle market. As consumers adjust to the new reality, the importance of affordability will become paramount. Tesla's strategy to enhance its production of lower-cost models could position the company favorably against competitors who may struggle to offer similar price points without federal incentives.

Consumer Sentiment and Future Trends

Consumer sentiment towards electric vehicles remains strong, and Tesla's proactive approach may further solidify its market position. As more consumers become aware of the benefits of EVs—such as lower operating costs and environmental advantages—Tesla's focus on affordability is likely to resonate well within the broader market.

Conclusion

As the deadline for the US EV tax credit approaches, Tesla is not merely waiting for the impact of this change; instead, it is taking decisive actions to ensure its vehicles remain attractive to buyers. By ramping up production of affordable models and implementing strategic sales incentives, Tesla aims to navigate this transition successfully. The company’s ability to adapt to market dynamics will not only affect its own future but may also influence the broader landscape of electric vehicles in the United States.",http://www.tesery.com/cdn/shop/articles/v_8CiXg1HJ1Ea4d8i3qTgufZM9ua6KVOQUhC3zK-DpkFgH4w4p8kk0gkMTN709mEyxFTOlfbzoK1RdAnOwub8fhjrjRlGuGMx_uetLG64Q2Gv9QbZZwsxiXeJo4XBP_D4v2-ETpi8q4b-riTM0JTTaoWfFzwG7GB9oHAqbO4NLI.jpg?v=1753445005,N,,2025-07-25 15:04:52.422379

It may not reach the U.S. and could be a Euro-only model battling in a hotly contested segment.

A U.S. launch seems unlikely given Americans' appetite for larger cars, whether they're electric or not.

Subaru currently sells only one electric vehicle, the Solterra. But as of next year, that car will slot in the middle of a three-EV lineup, larger than the compact Uncharted and tidier than the more family-friendly midsize Trailseeker. If the two new electric arrivals do well, Subaru is considering going even smaller, launching a B-segment EV.

Autocar asked Inoue Masahiko, the global head of electric cars at Subaru, about the prospect of more and smaller Subaru EVs being launched. He said, “It’s something that is up for consideration, because we need to prepare a wider range of BEVs to meet every customer’s expectations.”

Subaru’s European boss, David Dello Stritto, said the company was open to launching a subcompact electric vehicle, especially since the space would soon be inundated with new models. The Renault 5 E-Tech is only the first in a new wave of city EVs that will soon hit Europe, which includes the Volkswagen ID.2, Cupra Raval, MG 2 and even a Dacia Sandero EV.

There are even smaller A-segment EVs coming to Europe, like the 1990s-inspired Renault Twingo EV, its affordable Dacia brother or a tiny new Honda EV. There will definitely be stiff competition in the next few years as all these models come to market, so there’s clearly demand for such electric vehicles on the continent.

Dello Stritto noted that Subaru will wait to see how the compact Uncharted does before it decides whether it’s worth going even smaller with its EVs. “I reckon we need about two years to find out how it's performing. We might have come up with new ideas during that period, so in two years' time we can talk again,” he said.

Given that all electric Subarus announced so far are built on underpinnings shared with Toyota, it’s fair to assume that its B-segment model would follow suit. Toyota is said to be working on an electric Yaris, but it remains a few years away at this point.

When asked about an electric Yaris, Toyota Europe’s Director of Marketing and Product Development, Andrea Carlucci, previously told Autocar that “This is the idea, but now it is not something we talk about.”

The manufacturer is currently focusing on delivering EVs in larger size segments. Carlucci concluded by saying, “The right moment will arrive, but this is not quite now.” When it does arrive, it will likely be called the Yaris, just like the combustion or hybrid model on sale today.

Considering that Subaru decided to call the Trailseeker the E-Outback in Europe signals the manufacturer’s desire to also keep its naming familiar, at least for that market. The B-segment EV could therefore be called the Justy or E-Justy, which is a nameplate that American buyers would also be familiar with.

There are currently no B-segment EVs on sale in the U.S. after the Chevy Bolt EV and EUV duo were discontinued, as was the BMW i3 and tariffs make it uneconomical for Mini to bring the China-built J01 over. A new Bolt EV is on the way, but most automakers don’t seem to think there is a market for petite city EVs, so even if Subaru launched an electric car in that size bracket, it likely wouldn’t make it to the States.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/eoBLEp/s1/2026-subaru-ev-family3.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:45.389707

Conclusion As India advances its clean energy goals, people and regions most affected by this shift should not be ignored.","India is gradually moving towards its ambitious climate goals, including 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070. However, as the transition accelerates, it must go beyond technological or economic shifts to be just and socially equitable. Given that 72% of India’s electricity is still generated from thermal sources, ensuring worker upliftment, community protection, and equity during the transition to clean energy becomes crucial.

The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index (ETI) 2025 ranked India 71 out of 118 countries. The ETI 2025 highlights India’s achievements in energy transition, marked by declining energy intensity, reduced methane emissions, improved regulatory frameworks, and growing investments in renewable energy (RE) and clean fuels.

However, it also highlights persistent challenges in areas such as enhancing grid reliability, extending energy access to remote rural populations, and reducing dependence on imported energy.

Furthermore, the report cautions that India must address some crucial yet often overlooked issues, including labour market shifts, financing constraints, and the need for a socially inclusive transition that safeguards the livelihoods of communities dependent on fossil fuel economies.

In this article, we discuss key policy changes that India must adopt to ensure a just transition to clean energy.

Five Indian states, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, account for over 70% of coal production and employment. Jharkhand became the first Indian state to establish a Just Transition Task Force in November 2022, covering coal transition, livelihood reskilling, energy diversification, green finance, and institutional design.

Its vision document outlines decade-wise roadmaps for transitioning across 13 coal-dependent districts. Chhattisgarh rolled out community energy initiatives (solar electrification in Bastar’s tribal villages) and piloted hydrogen trucking for cleaner mining operations at the district level. While these efforts are commendable, they are still limited to a few states. Thus, it is crucial to anchor state just transition plans in state energy policies and mandate the submission of ‘just transition roadmaps’ to ensure binding commitments and alignment with central energy goals.

2. Early reskilling and workforce planning

A district-level workforce mapping in coal regions, including formal, informal, and dependent populations, should be conducted to ensure that the workforce in the coal sector is not affected by the transition. The targeted reskilling for jobs in solar, electric vehicles (EVs), energy efficiency, and green hydrogen should be initiated at least 2–3 years before the projected mine or plant decommissioning, using the Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ)–aligned curriculum.

However, not all coal-belt regions will offer the required green jobs to replace the coal workforce. Therefore, policies must support alternative livelihood options that are rooted in local contexts.

The government should also target deployment of future projects under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), as well as scale up agri-photovoltaics in the fossil-fuel-intensive districts of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. This can help in creating new livelihood avenues for both skilled and semi-skilled rural youth.

Further, the solarisation initiative in the agriculture sector should be linked to skilling and local manufacturing. As per a 2023 study, the implementation of the solarisation initiative could generate over 1 million jobs in installation, sales, and maintenance across rural India. The government should create district-level skilling programmes linked to solar installation, pump repair, and energy entrepreneurship.

Ultimately, reskilling is insufficient if jobs remain informal, precarious, or unsafe. Policies must mandate job quality standards that focus on aspects such as social security and occupational safety. These safeguards should be embedded into agreements negotiated at the time of plant/mine closure.

3. Enact legal safeguards for fossil fuel workers

Although India has more than 2 million workers directly or indirectly employed in the coal sector, it lacks statutory safeguards for workers who are displaced from employment due to the energy transition. There is a need to introduce an act to ensure pension portability and provide retraining grants, wage insurance, and priority in green job placement programmes.

For instance, in Canada, the Sustainable Jobs Act (formerly the Just Transition Act) mandates the creation of a Sustainable Jobs Partnership Council, which comprises representatives from labour, industry, and environmental sectors. It prioritises training, income support, and early planning for fossil fuel workers, ensuring that labour unions have a seat at the table.

Similarly, South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP) recognises coal miners and energy workers as central stakeholders. The government has committed to establishing labour transition plans alongside infrastructure decommissioning as legal and institutional safeguards for workers.

4. Localise RE manufacturing hubs in coal-dependent regions

Transition policies should place an additional focus on coal-dependent regions, such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. These areas face triple risks of job losses, state revenue shortfalls, and stalled economic activity.

The central government must design region-specific just transition packages that go beyond only compensation. These should include plans for economic diversification, job creation, and infrastructure development.

With most solar module and battery manufacturing currently concentrated in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, priority should be given to setting up such manufacturing units in high-transition regions. This not only replaces lost employment but also builds future-ready ecosystems in the same regions.

5. Enable women and marginalised workers in energy transitions

For the transition to be just, it must be gender neutral. However, studies show that women hold less than 11% of India’s RE jobs. Skilling programmes under Skill India and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) should include gender quotas and training in distributed RE, EV maintenance, and green construction, targeting rural women, marginalised workers, and informal sector labourers.

6. Ensure fair and inclusive land use for the energy transition

Land plays a crucial role in India’s clean energy transition, yet it often receives little attention in policy discussions. Large-scale RE projects and the closure of coal mines both require significant land use changes, which can lead to displacement, loss of livelihoods, and conflict, especially in tribal and forest areas.

A just transition must therefore ensure fair land practices, including community consent, compensation, and recognition of informal land rights. Repurposing degraded coal mine land for solar parks or community projects can support both energy and local development. To avoid land-related conflicts, India needs an integrated land use framework that balances clean energy expansion with social equity, ecological restoration, and food security.

7. Redirect coal cess revenue towards transition funds

The Clean Energy Cess (popularly called the coal cess) was introduced by the Government of India in 2010 under the Finance Act to tax coal production and imports, with the intention of financing clean energy and environmental projects.

Since 2010, India has collected over INR 1.25 lakh crore under the coal cess (INR 400/tonne). According to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report, only INR 29,645 crore was transferred to the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF), of which INR 15,911 crore, or ~12% of the total, was disbursed for clean energy projects. Thus, a portion of this fund can be reinstated to support worker compensation, skill development, and community initiatives in coal districts.

8. Embed just transition metrics in environment, social and governance (ESG) and finance norms

While green finance in India is growing, with USD 46 billion in green bonds issued as of 2024, ESG disclosures and reporting often miss just transition indicators (e.g., employment shifts and local economic benefits). Regulators should mandate Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting to include metrics for a just transition.

Furthermore, transition lending should be prioritised for affected micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and their workers.

9. Create an Authority at the National Level

Transition responsibility is currently fragmented across ministries—coal, labour, environment, and power. A national-level authority, with legal mandate, coordination powers, and representation from all regions, can integrate labour reskilling, environmental remediation, and regional development. South Africa’s Presidential Climate Commission and Germany’s Coal Commission provide institutional blueprints.

Conclusion

As India advances its clean energy goals, people and regions most affected by this shift should not be ignored. With millions of workers and entire communities depending on fossil fuels for their livelihoods, simply replacing coal with renewables without addressing their needs would deepen inequality. A fair transition means planning early, investing in reskilling, supporting local economies, ensuring job security, and making space for women and marginalised groups in the clean energy workforce. With the right policies and a people-first approach, India can lead the green future that is also just and inclusive.",https://en-media.thebetterindia.com/uploads/2025/07/featured-img-5_11zon-1753410318.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 13:07:29.275883

Zeldin met with Secretary of the Environment and National Resources of Mexico Alicia Bárcena Ibarra at the Council of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation to sign the memorandum of understanding which requires both nations to expedite stormwater and sewage infrastructure projects on both sides of the border.

The U.S. withheld some funds from projects until Mexico fulfilled its obligations, but the agreement signed Thursday agreed to release EPA Border Water Infrastructure Program funding to complete the rehabilitation of Pump Station 1 and the Tijuana River collection pipes. In exchange, Mexico agreed to fund and begin construction on two projects this year which, when completed, will divert 10 million gallons a day from running into the river and the Pacific Ocean.

""The Trump Administration is proud to deliver this massive environmental and national security win for Americans in the San Diego area who have been living with this disgusting raw sewage flowing into their communities for far too long,"" Zeldin said.

The EPA administrator visited San Diego in April to receive an update on the trans-border sewage problem and see it in person.

""I made a commitment to the residents that I would spearhead an effort to construct an all-encompassing plan to finally bring the sewage crisis to an end,"" he said. ""Since my visit, the Mexican and United States' governments have been working collaboratively to urgently finalize a permanent, 100% solution to this longstanding issue.""

Other stipulations in the agreement include Mexico paying the remaining $93 million of ""Minute 328"" funds — another agreement signed in 2022 laying out multiple infrastructure projects — reducing the timeline for said projects and adding additional ones as Tijuana's population continues to grow.

While Zeldin presented the agreement as a partisan-led one coming from the White House itself, politicians of all stripes have been making moves on the issue in recent months.

Earlier this year, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, visited Imperial Beach to see the crisis up close.

""For too long, communities along both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border have suffered the consequences of untreated sewage and toxic waste flowing into the Tijuana River,"" he said. ""What I observed during my visit to Imperial Beach in May was unacceptable. This public health crisis, with growing economic and environmental impacts, would never be tolerated in Malibu or Mar-a- Lago and it shouldn't be tolerated here.""

Earlier this month, Democratic leaders in both houses of Congress introduced legislation to help combat the ongoing Tijuana River sewage pollution by appointing the Environmental Protection Agency as the lead agency on the crisis.

Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, both D-California, and Booker, along with Rep. Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, introduced the Border Water Quality Restoration and Protection Act of 2025.

Yet, Lucid stock is up 45% this month and has the benefit of a massive financial backer. Is Lucid a stock to buy?

One reason for the stock's surge is the company's deals announced this month.

On Tuesday, the company said all owners of its Air model will gain access to the North American Tesla (TSLA) Supercharger network starting July 31. Using a $220 adapter and the Lucid app, the Air can travel up to 200 miles for every hour of charging, Lucid said.

The Air is the longest-range electric vehicle, Emad Dlala, the company's senior vice president of power train, said in the announcement.

The company also introduced its 2026 lineup Tuesday, which includes a 6% increase in range for the Lucid Air Touring to 431 miles. The rest of the Air lineup maintains a max range of 512 miles of EPA-estimated range.

Wednesday, Lucid said it is partnering with suppliers of nickel, manganese, graphite and other minerals to accelerate the development of domestic critical minerals for the auto industry. Automakers have faced shortages of key minerals.

On July 17, Uber Technologies (UBER) announced a ""multi-hundred-million dollar investments"" in Lucid and self-driving tech firm Nuro to develop a new robotaxi service.

Uber plans a fleet of at least 20,000 Lucid electric vehicles equipped with Nuro's self-driving system over the next six years. The companies expect to launch the services in an unnamed major U.S. city late next year. Uber is reportedly investing $300 million in Lucid as part of the deal.

Lucid Stock: The Saudi Angle

Lucid lists Ayar Third Investment Co. alternatively as ""the controlling stock holder of the company"" and as the ""majority stockholder."" Ayar is an affiliate of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. The fund, through Ayar, is reported to have pumped more than $6.4 billion into Lucid since 2019. The PIF owns upward of 60% of Lucid, according to Saudi financial news site Argaam.

Lucid launched Saudi Arabia's first auto manufacturing facility near Jeddah in 2023. The factory has initial capacity for 5,000 cars per year, with an eventual target for 155,000. The Saudi government under its Vision 2030 road map is aiming for EVBs to account for 30% of its total auto sales, about 500,000 vehicles, within five years.

The government has pledged to buy 50,000 Lucid vehicles, with an option for 50,000 more. But competition is rising. Tesla opened its first showroom in the country in April, and a homegrown Saudi EV brand, CEER, plans its first production in 2026.

Tax Credits And Lucid Stock

The Big Beautiful Bill that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress in early July eliminated several Biden-era tax credits and policies aimed at supporting EV adoption. That included tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases, which are sunsetting at the end of September.

The final bill dropped a $250 annual registration fee for any EV vehicle and a $100 annual fee for hybrids. The fees were meant to make sure EV owners, who pay no gasoline tax, pay their share of federal road maintenance.

Lucid is unprofitable and is expected to continue posting losses this year and next. The company also has negative operating and free cash flow, per FactSet. The automaker gets much of its funding from private equity investors.

Analysts estimate a second-quarter loss of 22 cents a share vs. a year-ago loss of 34 cents. But sales are estimated to surge 37.5% to $275.7 million year over year, according to FactSet. The three-year sales growth rate is 69%, according to IBD Stock Checkup.

Second-quarter results are set for Aug. 5 after the market close.

A dozen Wall Street analysts have hold ratings on Lucid. Two have sell ratings and one has a buy recommendation. Lucid stock has surpassed analysts' average price target of 2.60.

Lucid Stock Ratings, Models, Prices

The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 47 out of 99, mainly due to its lack of profits. It has a 21-day average true range (ATR) of 8.8%. The average true range is a metric available on IBD's MarketSurge that gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks with a high ATR tend to make large price moves that can trigger sell rules. Stocks with lower ATRs tend to make more incremental moves.

With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq now in a power trend, investors can buy stocks with ATRs up to 8%, though they should be wary of being too concentrated in high-octane names.

Lucid is based in the Silicon Valley city of Newark, Calif., and assembles its vehicles at a factory in Casa Grande, Ariz.

Like rivals such as Tesla (TSLA) and Rivian (RIVN), Lucid's products are pricey. The company's website Wednesday showed a promotional price for the Air Pure model starting at $69,900, Touring from $78,900 and Grand Touring from $110,900 in the Los Angeles area.

The Gravity Grand Touring SUV starts at $94,900. For a top-of-the-line Air Sapphire, be ready to shell out about $249,000.

In the second quarter, Lucid produced 3,863 vehicles and delivered 3,309. That's an 83% jump in output from the year-ago period and a 38% increase in deliveries. Still, that's a small piece of the pie compared with Tesla's production of 410,244 vehicles in Q2 and 384,122 deliveries.

Is Lucid Stock A Buy?

Shares of Lucid Group peaked at 64.86 several months after the EV maker started trading on the Nasdaq in September 2020. The stock collapsed in the 2022 bear market and continued lower in 2023 and for most of 2024. Shares finally found a footing last November around the 2 price level.

Lucid stock has held that level all year, and is forming a base with a 3.64 buy point. The July 17 gap-up offered an alternative entry that makes the stock actionable now. Shares have rallied more than 45% so far this month — a move enhanced by the stock's low share price.

IBD recommends investors avoid stocks under $10 per share, because they tend to be thinly traded and have light institutional sponsorship. However, Lucid stock has a market capitalization of nearly $9.5 billion and a daily dollar volume of nearly $500 million. That is well above the IBD's recommended floor of $25 million.

This month, the company filed with the SEC for a reverse stock split of 1-for-10.

More than 300 mutual funds own shares, although that's less than half the 800-plus that owned the stock at the end of 2023, according to MarketSurge. Vanguard funds are among the largest owners, holding more than 8% of Lucid stock.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/07/data-center-e1753438072135.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 10:00:03.913211

Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”

Holtec has been working to reopen the plant along Lake Michigan in Covert Township after it closed in May 2022 using small modular reactors. Last year, the federal government announced the approval of a $1.5 billion loan to back the effort.

Holtec says Palisades is on track to open by the end of the year. On Thursday, it said “extensive readiness work (is) underway – including rigorous testing, inspections, and maintenance – to ensure a safe and reliable return to service under ongoing independent federal oversight.”

The company says when the plant is back online, it will make enough power for more than 800,000 households and improve the reliability of the grid.

Opponents to the restart argue the plant poses a threat to the environment, saying a nuclear disaster at the site would be catastrophic to the region and the Great Lakes.

“The zombie reactor restart scheme is unneeded, insanely expensive for the public, and extremely high risk for health, safety, security, and the environment,” Kevin Kamps of opponent group Beyond Nuclear said in a Thursday statement. “NRC is enabling Holtec to play radioactive Russian roulette on the Lake Michigan shoreline. It is a grand nuclear experiment, and those of us downwind, downstream, up the food chain, and down the generations are the potential guinea pigs.”",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2024/09/palisades-7.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 15:05:33.368056

The long-term offtaker hydrogen supply agreement is an industry-first in the Consumer Products sector in the UK, and is signed with partners Carlton Power and HYRO

Green hydrogen will reduce Kimberly-Clark's natural gas consumption by 50% at its UK manufacturing sites in Kent and Cumbria from 2027

LONDON, July 25, 2025 /CSRwire/ - Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, manufacturer of leading household name brands including Andrex® and Kleenex®, becomes the first major consumer products company in the UK to make a significant commitment to green hydrogen, signalling its commitment to a more sustainable future.

The company announces today that together with its energy partners, Carlton Power and HYRO (a joint venture between Octopus Energy Generation and RES), it is investing over £125 million into the emerging energy solution at its two plants in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria and Northfleet, Kent. Combined, the two sites produce nearly one billion Andrex toilet rolls and over 150 million boxes of Kleenex tissues every year. Through the investment, Kimberly-Clark expects to see a 50% reduction versus its 2024 consumption of natural gas across its UK production lines from 2027.

The two long-term offtaker hydrogen supply agreements signed with energy partners Carlton Power, and HYRO– will mean a green hydrogen facility is installed next to Kimberly-Clark’s Barrow plant, while a separate facility will be built on Kimberly-Clark’s Northfleet plant.

These two green hydrogen projects are being supported with funding from the UK government after being selected for the Government’s Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) and Net Zero Hydrogen Fund (NZHF) – a global first (also known as Hydrogen Allocation Round One – HAR1). Carlton Power’s Barrow Green Hydrogen project secured local planning consent in June 2023. HYRO’s innovative project at the Northfleet paper mill received planning permission, after the local council granted consent for the scheme in August 2024.

The Barrow hydrogen project will supply 100GWh of hydrogen per annum while the Northfleet project will supply 47GWh per annum. Collectively the displacement of natural gas with hydrogen will reduce carbon emissions by 28,500 tonnes per annum, equivalent to removing approximately 20,000 petrol cars off the road every year*.

These projects will further decarbonise the production of toilet and facial tissues by directly replacing fossil-fuel natural gas used for steam generation. Green hydrogen – created through the electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable sources, like wind and solar – allows a versatile energy source to be generated and stored without emitting polluting gases during combustion or production.

Dan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland said: “This is a significant investment into a green hydrogen solution, and alongside other investments that support our ambition to move our UK manufacturing operations to 100% renewable energy by 2030.

“Now is the right time for us to tap into hydrogen’s significant potential, improving energy supply and our decarbonisation needs. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale. This initiative builds on the investments and progress we’ve already made with innovative technologies for our business, our consumers and our customers.”

Minister for Industry, Sarah Jones, said: “This government is rolling out hydrogen out at scale for the first time, with ten of the first projects now shovel-ready to start powering businesses with clean, homegrown energy from Teesside to Devon.

“Hydrogen will help us cut industrial emissions and support Britain’s industrial renewal by creating thousands of jobs in our industrial heartlands as part of the Plan for Change.”

Keith Clarke, Founder and Chief Executive of Carlton Power, said: “Kimberly-Clark’s commitment to using green hydrogen in its operations is a significant move and shows great ambition and leadership. Our development of the Barrow scheme has been forged through strong partnerships with Kimberly-Clark, our financial partner Schroders Greencoat and with DESNZ as well as with local agencies and stakeholders. Our Barrow Green Hydrogen facility will be the first in a series of projects that we will bring into commercial operation over the next 2-4 years to support UK industry make the transition to using green hydrogen and away from fossil fuels.”

Alex Brierley, co-head of Octopus Energy Generation’s fund management team said: “This is an exciting milestone for HYRO and for green hydrogen in the UK’s industrial sector. HYRO’s project with Kimberly-Clark at their Northfleet paper mill has progressed well, with government funding contracts in place and planning permission approved too. Green hydrogen will play a significant role in decarbonising hard-to-electrify industries – and Kimberly-Clark has been a pioneer in this space. This scheme will help produce household products using renewables and flush away fossil fuels for good.”

Lucy Whitford, RES’ Managing Director, UK & I, said: “Green hydrogen, created using British low carbon energy, will revolutionise how we power industry, helping the UK to build a globally competitive, zero carbon economy in the process. We are proud of the success of HYRO's Northfleet project and this latest backing for the plans by Kimberly-Clark shows how we can make green hydrogen a reality.”

The initiatives are expected to enable Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland to achieve a total reduction of its operational greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% in 2027 (vs 2015 baseline). These improvements will also help Kimberly-Clark meet its sustainability ambitions to achieve a 50% reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions globally, from a 2015 base year by 2030.

It represents another major milestone in Kimberly-Clark’s ambitious drive towards low carbon energy in the UK, following its announcement in September 2023 of a power purchase agreement supporting the opening of a new £75 million onshore wind farm in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Managed by Octopus Energy Generation on behalf of Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust (ORIT), RES also provides the necessary asset management services for the wind farm which has been supplying green power to Kimberly-Clark’s operations since it was commissioned.

U.S. companies rely on Mexico and Canada to help build cars and supply parts, particularly after Trump renegotiated a North American trade deal lowering duties between the countries.
“I won’t do that deal with cars” for other countries, Trump said when announcing the terms of negotiation on May 8.
“If 15 percent is applied to autos and auto parts, Japan did not get what it was aiming for,” said former Japanese Vice Minister Tatsuya Terazawa.","“American Automakers still need to review the details of the U.S.-Japan agreement, but any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no U.S. content than it does North American-built vehicles with high U.S. content is a bad deal for the U.S. industry and U.S. auto workers,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the American companies Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Wednesday morning, credited the decision to lower Japan’s auto tariff rate to its offer of new investments, which he doubted other countries could replicate. But one auto industry lobbyist said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been floating similar deals to the EU and South Korea, both of whom have large and influential auto sectors. And four EU diplomats confirmed that the 27-country bloc is in talks with the U.S. about a deal that would set a 15 percent baseline tariff, including on cars, mirroring the Japan accord. They were all granted anonymity to share details of the sensitive discussions.

The auto industry lobbyist called the agreement with Japan “another abandonment of U.S. autos.”

Though the White House has argued the tariffs will help the U.S. build more cars at home, domestic automakers have also taken a hit from the duties, due to the integrated nature of North American auto supply chains. U.S. companies rely on Mexico and Canada to help build cars and supply parts, particularly after Trump renegotiated a North American trade deal lowering duties between the countries. To ease some of the pain, the White House has offered a complicated rebate scheme for portions of certain North American-made cars’ sales value over the next two years, but automakers are still struggling.

One of the country’s “Big Three” auto giants, General Motors, reported on Tuesday a $1 billion drop in second-quarter profits in part due to the tariffs, and warned in an earnings call that losses in the next quarter will be even higher. Stellantis, which owns Chrysler and Jeep, announced earlier this week it expects to lose $2.7 billion in the first half of 2025,.

And Elon Musk’s Tesla on Wednesday posted another quarter of meager profitability and revenue, in part due to the tariffs. Tesla said its profitability decreased for the quarter because of lower regulatory credit revenue, a decline in vehicle deliveries and a lower cost per vehicle due to “mix and lower raw materials partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption and an increase in tariffs.”

Those losses will be tougher to swallow if other major trading partners succeed in negotiating better tariff rates for their own automakers. Reuters reported Wednesday that stocks in Japanese car companies Toyota and Honda soared on the news of the deal, but so did shares of South Korean and European carmakers, as hopes rise that their leaders could strike similar deals.

Trump’s auto tariffs have been a sticking point in trade negotiations with the EU for months, with Germany vocally pushing the 27-member bloc to make major concessions to Trump in hopes of winning a reprieve for its large auto manufacturing sector.

“The costs for our companies are already in the billions — and the sum is growing every day,” said Hildegard Müller, president of VDA, the German automobile association, which represents companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes. “The damage to the previously functioning supply chains is enormous and must not be allowed to increase any further.”

German auto companies are reporting double-digit declines in exports to the U.S. in April and May, and they aren’t the only ones. Volvo, the Swedish car company, has had to pause sales of some of its cars in the U.S.

South Korean car companies Hyundai and Kia will announce their second quarter financial results later this week and both companies are projecting significant losses from the tariffs, as well. Auto exports from South Korea to the U.S. have exploded over the past 20 years, from $8.7 billion in 2005 to $37.3 billion in 2024, according to data collected by the Census Bureau.

As with Japan and the EU, the duties have been a focal point of trade talks with the Trump administration, which has grown frustrated by the lack of progress. Trump sent a letter to new South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung on July 7 threatening a 25 percent tariff on all its exports to the U.S. — a sign of dissatisfaction with the state of the talks. (He sent a nearly identical letter to Japan’s prime minister the same day.)

After imposing the auto tariffs this spring, the administration assured American automakers that they would not become a bargaining chip in other trade negotiations, a person familiar with discussions between the administration and Detroit’s “Big Three” auto companies, granted anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks, told POLITICO at the time. The president sought to cast the U.K. deal, which reduced duties on auto and auto parts to 10 percent for the first 100,000 cars entering the U.S., as an exception.

“I won’t do that deal with cars” for other countries, Trump said when announcing the terms of negotiation on May 8. The British auto brand Rolls-Royce is “a very special car and it’s a very limited number, too. It’s not one of the monster car companies that makes millions of cars,” he noted, although some British brands like Land Rover compete with American SUVs.

A White House official, granted anonymity to discuss the trade talks, struck a similar note on Wednesday, downplaying the prospect that Trump will agree to lower the car tariffs for any more countries. “It’s a negotiation,” the person said, pointing to the $550 billion investment Japanese businesses pledged as a sign that the country had made an unparalleled offer.

In Japan, embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba celebrated the agreement, saying it was focused on “prioritizing investment over tariffs.”

But others were less enthusiastic about the outcome, given the double-digit tariff rate still hitting Japanese goods.

“If 15 percent is applied to autos and auto parts, Japan did not get what it was aiming for,” said former Japanese Vice Minister Tatsuya Terazawa.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd0%2Fa6%2Fbc3dbd7043dda65a14764e8b27d3%2Ftrump-us-japan-23956.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 11:01:26.268709

Tesla, the country’s leading electric vehicle maker, is ready to meet this challenge with a rather simple but clever counter.

Tesla executives outlined this strategy in the recently held Q2 2025 earnings call.

End of the US EV tax credit

While Elon Musk has always maintained that he prefers a market with no EV tax credit, he also emphasized that he supports the rollback of any incentives given to the oil and gas industry. The Trump administration has not done this so far, instead focusing on the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of the third quarter.

Tesla has been going all-in on encouraging customers to purchase their vehicles in Q3 to take advantage of lower prices. The company has also implemented a series of incentives across all its offerings, from the Cybertruck to the Model 3. This, however, is not all, as the company seems to be preparing a longer-term solution to the expiration of the EV tax credit.

Affordable variants

During the Q2 2025 earnings call, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moray stated that Tesla really did start the production of more affordable models in June. Quality builds of these vehicles are being ramped this quarter, with the goal of optimizing production over the remaining months of the year. If Tesla is successful, these models will be available for everyone in Q4.

“We started production in June, and we’re ramping quality builds and things around the quarter. And given that we started in North America and our goal is to maximize production with a higher rate. So starting Q3, we’re going to keep pushing hard on our current models to avoid complexity… We’ll be ready with new, more affordable models available for everyone in Q4.,” Moravy stated.

These comments suggest that Tesla should be able to offer vehicles that are competitively priced even after the EV tax credit has been phased out. Interestingly enough, previous comments from Tesla executives have mentioned that these more affordable models would resemble the company’s current lineup. This suggests that the more affordable models may indeed be variations of the Model Y and Model 3, but offered at a lower price.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed the company’s plans for its next expansion of the Robotaxi in terms of both the geofence in Austin and the platform overall, as it looks to move to new areas outside of Texas.

Tesla launched the Robotaxi platform last month on June 22, and has since expanded both the pool of users and the area that the driverless Model Y vehicles can travel within.

The first expansion of the geofence caught the attention of nearly everyone and became a huge headline as Tesla picked a very interesting shape for the new geofence, resembling male reproductive parts.

The next expansion will likely absolve this shape. Musk revealed last night that the new geofence will be “well in excess of what competitors are doing,” and it could happen “hopefully in a week or two.”

Musk’s full quote regarding the expansion of the geofence and the timing was:

“As some may have noted, we have already expanded our service area in Austin. It’s bigger and longer, and it’s going to get even bigger and longer. We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two.”

The expansion will not stop there, either. As Tesla has operated the Robotaxi platform in Austin for the past month, it has been working with regulators in other areas, like California, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida, to get the driverless ride-hailing system activated in more U.S. states.

Tesla confirmed that they are in talks with each of these states regarding the potential expansion of Robotaxi.

Musk added:

“As we get the approvals and prove out safety, we will be launching the autonomous ride-hailing across most of the country. I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year.”

We know that Tesla and Musk have been prone to aggressive and sometimes outlandish timelines regarding self-driving technology specifically. Regulatory approvals could happen by the end of the year in several areas, and working on these large metros is the best way to reach half of the U.S. population.

Tesla said its expansion of the geofence in Austin is conservative and controlled due to its obsession with safety, even admitting at one point during the Earnings Call that they are being “paranoid.” Expanding the geofence is necessary, but Tesla realizes any significant mistake by Robotaxi could take it back to square one.

Tesla has warned customers about its incentive strategy for qualifying electric vehicles, as the days of both the $7,500 EV tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs are coming to a close.

Both tax credits, which impact some of the vehicles in the Tesla lineup, are set to be eliminated at the end of Q3. The phase out of these consumer credits was always in the plans of the Trump Administration, but now we’re in the final quarter of their existence.

As a result, EV companies are scrambling to see how they can reduce costs or make their vehicles more affordable for customers. The $7,500 will price many consumers out of many EVs on the market, and Tesla is not immune to that.

However, Tesla has made a significant push into Q3 deliveries, rolling out numerous incentives to customers, including 0% APR on select purchases, lease deals, free upgrades on certain inventory units, and more.

The extensive list of incentives on Tesla vehicles in the quarter will not get any longer, either. During last night’s Tesla Earnings Call for the second quarter of 2025, company executives stated that their intention for these incentives was to encourage customers to place orders early in the quarter.

Tesla will only be able to apply the $7,500 credit with deliveries that occur before the end of September. Even if an order is placed before then, delivery must be completed by September 31 to receive the tax credit.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja confirmed that the incentives for the quarter are already out and encouraged customers to place an order sooner rather than later:

“Given the abrupt change, we have a limited supply of vehicles in the US this quarter. As we are already within lead times to order parts for cars, we have rolled out all our planned incentives already and will start pairing them back as we start to sell. If you are in the US and looking to buy a car, let’s roll now as we may not be able to guarantee delivery for orders placed in the later part of August and beyond.”

The loss of the incentives will impact every EV maker in the United States. Tesla has a plan moving forward, and it said last night that its affordable models would be rolled out in Q4, as introducing these cars any earlier could have detrimental effects on Model 3 and Model Y sales.

The 2025 Tesla Model Y was one of two midsize luxury SUVs to receive the Top Safety Pick+ award from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

To qualify for the IIHS’s Top Safety Pick+ or even the lower-tier Top Safety Pick label, vehicles need good ratings in the small overlap front and side crash tests, an acceptable or good rating in the pedestrian front crash prevention evaluation, and acceptable or good ratings for headlights across all trim levels.

The difference between the two labels is that an “Acceptable” rating in the moderate overlap front test will get a car the Top Safety Pick rating, but a “Good” rating in this category will win the elusive Top Safety Pick+ category.

The 2025 Model Y, codenamed “Juniper” internally by Tesla, was released in the United States earlier this year and received the top rating across each of the categories, automatically qualifying it for the Top Safety Pick+ label:

Other vehicles in Tesla’s lineup have extraordinary marks in crash testing according to other agencies, like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), but there are reasons those cars are not on the IIHS lists.

In 2024, we reported that the IIHS had evaluated some Tesla vehicles for the necessary tests to achieve these marks. Joe Young of the agency told us that the Model 3, for example, was not featured on either the Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick+ lists because the vehicle had several missing tests.

Here’s why the Tesla Model 3 wasn’t an IIHS Top Safety Pick+, and why it could be soon

This is not to say those other Tesla vehicles would not perform well. The Cybertruck performed better than any pickup has ever in NHTSA crash testing assessments.

The Model Y is Tesla’s most popular vehicle and was the best-selling car in the world over the past two years. Tesla’s intense focus on safety continues to show that this priority goes into every decision the company makes regarding design and engineering. This focus has continued to pay dividends as some real-world crashes save the lives of those inside the cars.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tesla-model-y-china-1-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 09:59:36.154202

According to the company’s earnings report, it achieved profitability for the first time in six quarters, excluding financial benefits from the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, sales revenue declined by 9.7 percent, amounting to 5.6 trillion won.

This decline was primarily due to decreased purchases from automakers outside of North America, resulting from increased policy volatility, particularly concerning US tariffs.

“As North America and Europe both focus on expanding their domestic battery supply chains and domestic production, preference for battery companies capable of local supply and stable operations — such as LG Energy Solution — is expected to increase significantly,” said Kim Chang-sil, chief financial officer of LG Energy Solution, during a conference call earlier in the day.

Highlighting its first-mover initiative in establishing the first ESS battery production site in North America, Kim noted that the company looks to offset the slowdown in EV battery sales with ESS products. This focus is on the fast-growing North American power grid market, with an emphasis on artificial intelligence data centers.

In May, LG Energy Solution began mass production of LFP-based long pouch cells for ESS at its Michigan facility in the US. It has secured orders exceeding 50 gigawatt-hours from global energy firms, with joint ventures with global carmakers prioritizing a portion of their capacity for ESS supply. Aiming to reach 17 gigawatt-hours capacity by the end of this year, the battery-maker will expand to 30 gigawatt-hours by 2026 by converting EV production lines to ESS lines.

Addressing the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bills Act by the Trump administration earlier this month, LG Energy Solution believes that the North American EV market may experience a temporary demand slowdown. However, the new “prohibited foreign entity” regulations, which restrict energy companies influenced by Chinese firms from receiving tax credits when investing in the US, could partly benefit the company.

“The new PFE procurement requirements are more relaxed than the foreign entity of concern requirements under the IRA, offering an opportunity to optimize our US supply chain,” said Lee Yeon-hee, head of the business strategy division at LG Energy Solution.

“A certain percentage can be sourced from PFEs, and as PFE restrictions are limited to direct material costs, we can leverage more cost-effective supply chains for some materials.”

LG Energy Solution also plans to accelerate the launch of battery cells for rapidly emerging low-cost EVs.

To target the expanding European market for mid- to low-priced EVs, the company is preparing to mass-produce high-voltage mid-nickel and lithium iron phosphate cells at its Poland plant. Notably, LFP products are set to boost cost-competitiveness by incorporating advanced manufacturing methods, including a solvent-free dry electrode process and fast-charging technologies.

For the North American market, LG Energy Solution is collaborating with General Motors to develop lithium manganese-rich prismatic cells for their next-generation EVs in 2028. These products offer similar costs to LFP while delivering over 30 percent higher energy density. Upon reaching mass production, the LMR batteries are being reviewed for the phase 2 joint venture in Tennessee. The existing nickel, manganese and cobalt batteries will be exclusively manufactured in the phase 1 joint venture in Ohio.

‘So damn dangerous’ The Texas Hill Country is especially vulnerable to extreme flooding due to the Balcones Escarpment.
“Which is, buy people out of the floodplain.” Climate change is not on the agenda this special session, but it permeates every aspect of the July 4 storm discussion.
They may not say the words “climate change,” but it is inherent in every aspect of the discussion.","Climate change isn’t mentioned in Gov. Greg Abbott’s special session agenda, and yet it can be found throughout.

As Republican lawmakers consider responses to the July 4 flooding in the Hill Country that killed at least 135 people, they are unlikely to give voice to climate change, except perhaps with disdain or disbelief.

Yet when they discuss extreme weather, flooding infrastructure, alert systems, emergency communications, relief funding, and disaster preparedness and recovery, they will inherently be discussing climate change.

While climate change did not cause the Hill Country flooding this month, without a doubt it intensified the storm. Scientists are clear that warmer air leads to bigger rainstorms and higher chances of deadly flooding.

Take a region such as the Hill Country, whose unique geographic features have contributed to its nickname Flash Flood Alley, add warmer air, which holds more moisture, and you have a concoction to fuel thunderous storms that strike with deadly force.

To ignore scientific research on this point, to set aside climate models, is to fail to prepare for future storms, and then express shock and awe when they hit. Just as no public official should have expressed surprise — but many did — by the July 4 flooding given the known history of disaster along the Guadalupe River, no public official should express surprise about future dangerous flooding given the known modeling for climate change and extreme weather.

But this is Texas, where the oil and gas industry is supreme, and climate change denial is ingrained and pervasive.

Here is the central issue as the Texas Legislature deliberates: Republican lawmakers, so loath to utter the words “climate change,” nonetheless must enact policies and fund infrastructure that not only respond to the July 4 flooding but anticipate future disasters, whether or not they wish to name the danger.

If lawmakers fund an alert system but allow people to rebuild and develop in flood zones — to return to river life as it was — with little consideration for the confluence of climate change and extreme weather, they will deliver only the veneer of a meaningful response. They will be treating July 4 as an outlier, rather than a dire warning for a region with a history of deadly flooding that is also warming.

‘So damn dangerous’

The Texas Hill Country is especially vulnerable to extreme flooding due to the Balcones Escarpment. Running some 450 miles from Del Rio along the Rio Grande to the Dallas area, the Balcones Escarpment, which encompasses San Antonio and Austin, marks the end of the Great Plains and the beginning of the Edwards Plateau.

Its craggy and beautiful limestone hills can rise as high as 2,000 feet, sloping away from the fault line toward the Gulf of Mexico.

“Because this region falls loosely within the transition zone between the humid eastern section of the United States and the arid West, the climate can toggle between deluge and drought, an oscillation fueled in part by whether an El Niño or La Niña system prevails,” Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at Pomona College, wrote in his book “West Side Rising,” which focuses on the 200-year history of floods and flood control in San Antonio and Flash Flood Alley.

Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico also fuels flooding as it moves north and deeper into Texas, rising and falling with hills until the sky explodes.

“This cycle is called convection,” Miller said in an interview. “The more you have convection — almost like a circle: up, down, up, down, up, down — you create the context over the Edwards Plateau for these thunderous storms.”

When intense rain falls in the Hill Country — as much as 15 inches of rain fell in Kerr County in mere hours — it hits limestone and the rivers begin to rush.

When that rainfall interrupts an extended drought — also amplified by climate change — the flooding is even worse. The hardened, sunbaked earth absorbs precious little water, sending most of the deluge downhill.

“Water can cut through limestone, as it has done (for millennia), which is why the Hill Country is so stunningly beautiful and those rivers are so damn dangerous,” Miller said. “Because it creates these narrow channels coming through the escarpment.”

This serves as a baseline for flooding conditions.

It may be tempting to look at the Hill Country’s geography, cite its extensive history of flooding and conclude that this is simply the tragic way things are. The region has always flooded and always will. But climate change is in addition to these environmental factors. Think, “Yes, and” not “No, but.”

“Climate change, by adding water to the atmosphere, it’s loading the dice in favor of getting these really heavy (rain) events,” said Andrew Dessler, an atmospheric sciences professor with Texas A&M University and director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather. “This is actually one of the oldest predictions in climate science. It was made long before it was observed. Climate models were predicting this.”

This isn’t academic. An initial analysis by the research group ClimaMeter found meteorological conditions before the Hill Country flooding were warmer and 7% wetter than in the past.

Just as there is no shortage of after-action reports and news stories responding to past floods, there is no shortage of climate reports warning of more extreme rain.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment, published in 2023, warns: “Drought risk has been increasing in the Southwest over the past century, … while at the same time rainfall has become more extreme in recent decades.”

The 2024 update to the report, “Extreme weather in Texas, 1900-2036,” by state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, notes extreme rain in Texas is expected to increase by 20% in 2036, compared with 1950-1999.

Calling a storm a 100-year event means that in any year, there is a 1% chance that a storm of such intensity will occur.

“If extreme rainfall amounts increase by just 20%, the 100-year rainfall event threshold is exceeded twice as often,” the report says.

So, when public officials describe the July 4 storm as a once-in-a-lifetime event, that’s wishful thinking in a warming world.

“I think they need to rebuild with the idea that this is going to happen more frequently in the future, because we’re very sure it will happen more frequently in the future,” Dessler said. “And you know, obviously, that’s a problem when you live in a state where the governor literally won’t say the words ‘climate change.’ ”

State of denial

While the catastrophe in the Texas Hill Country requires a unified response from local, state and federal leaders — the devastation stretches for miles — it occurred as all three layers of government are unified in their hostility and skepticism toward climate science.

The federal website that hosted the National Climate Assessment has gone dark. During the Texas Legislature’s recent regular session, state lawmakers championed legislation that would have hamstrung renewable energy, even though solar, wind and battery storage have proved crucial in maintaining Texas’ electric grid. And in Kerr County, climate skepticism abounds.

“Do I believe climate change was involved (in the July 4 storm)? Definitely,” former Kerrville Mayor Bill Blackburn, who served from 2018 through 2022, told us. “But that is very much a point of debate in this county. And it will continue to be.”

While we have no answers about how to break through with climate skeptics, the July 4 storm shows the devastating cost of denying climate reality. This brings us to the flood maps.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps are woefully out-of-date — Kerr County’s flood map was last updated in 2011 — and thousands of properties in Kerr County still fall in the flood zone. Beyond this, the firm First Street, which models climate data, has found that when heavy rainfall and climate risk are factored together, 4,592 properties in Kerr County are in a high-risk flood zone.

Yet the vast majority of properties in Kerr County and Texas lack flood insurance.

If the state is serious about protecting Texans from future floods, it must be serious about not only incentivizing flood insurance but also ensuring structures aren’t built in dangerous places. It’s horrifying that federal regulators removed buildings at Camp Mystic — where 27 children and counselors died, as well as the camp’s owner — from the 100-year flood map. That should never have happened. But it did.

The miles of destruction along the Guadalupe River provide a grim rebuttal to FEMA’s flood maps. For years, FEMA has been working to update those maps, using more current data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showing the likelihood of heavier rain events.

But local governments don’t have to wait. They can draw on that rainfall data now to identify flood-prone areas where development must be limited for safety reasons.

Meanwhile, another way for the state and Kerr County to get people out of harm’s way is to buy high-risk properties in flood zones.

Again, we can turn to history for precedent. Over two decades, Austin bought and cleared more than 800 homes in the flood-prone Onion Creek area, using local dollars and FEMA aid — vital support from an agency that President Donald Trump has mused about dismantling.

And after deadly flooding in 1998 — 31 deaths across South-Central Texas — San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak directed the city to buy hundreds of properties in the floodplain.

“Had we continued to live there, we would have been flooded more than once since 1998,” said Denise Doyle, who praised the city for purchasing her home along Beitel Creek on San Antonio’s Northeast Side.

After the June 12 deadly waters that swept vehicles into Beitel Creek, we visited with Doyle at the site of her former home. Just from seeing the debris in trees, it was clear the recent flood would have overwhelmed her home. It was also clear the home’s demolition and subsequent flood control projects protected neighboring properties that are still standing.

“The 1998 flood, which was so devastating, actually produced one of the best policy decisions ever,” Miller, the expert on Flash Flood Alley, told us. “Which is, buy people out of the floodplain.”

Climate change is not on the agenda this special session, but it permeates every aspect of the July 4 storm discussion. When officials openly grieve the lives lost, or reflect on the properties washed away or the countless trees uprooted, they are giving voice to the consequences of extreme weather in a warming world. They may not say the words “climate change,” but it is inherent in every aspect of the discussion.

Should officials continue to deny this reality, they are choosing to invite future calamity. No one should be surprised when the next storm hits.

There isn’t an “off the shelf solution” for compliance with the 2024 EPA regulations, she added — rather, the technology needs to be engineered and constructed.
Advocates for environmental and public health say the exemptions are examples of the administration putting profit over human and environmental health.
But environmental advocates aren’t convinced the burdens of monitoring and regulating air pollution can just dissipate with a presidential proclamation.","Last week the Trump administration eased pollution regulations for dozens of industrial sites across the country that spew toxic emissions — two of which operate inside Indiana.

Across a series of four proclamations, the White House gave the roughly 90 facilities — chemical manufacturers, sterilization facilities, power plants — an additional two years to meet hazardous air pollution rules set by the EPA under the Biden administration.

The new proclamations will allow certain facilities to keep operating under the EPA’s old regulations until roughly 2028 and 2029, although individual deadlines vary.

In Indiana, a chemical manufacturing plant in Mount Vernon, SABIC Innovative Plastics, and a medical equipment sterilization facility in Ellettsville, operated by Cook Medical, both received extensions.

Some Hoosiers are concerned the move deprioritizes human health.

The government claims ""that meeting compliance is too burdensome/expensive to the business but not meeting the compliance levels can be very burdensome to the health of nearby communities,"" Gabriel Filippelli, a biochemist and urban health researcher at Indiana University, wrote to IndyStar in an email.

""These standards have been developed for solid, scientific reasons, and this feels like rolling back protections for people to enhance profits for companies.""

Environmental advocates say pollution standards exist for a reason

The Clean Air Act allows pollution compliance extensions if the technology needed to meet standards isn’t available and if the exemptions are in the national security interest of the United States.

The White House is arguing both points.

“SABIC appreciates the Trump administration’s decision to grant regulatory relief,” Jennifer Schumann, a spokeswoman for the Mount Vernon plant, wrote in a statement to IndyStar. There isn’t an “off the shelf solution” for compliance with the 2024 EPA regulations, she added — rather, the technology needs to be engineered and constructed.

The American Chemistry Council, which represents manufacturers like SABIC, maintained the cost of meeting pollution regulations could exceed $50 billion, per a partially filled records request that the IndyStar obtained from the EPA.

Advocates for environmental and public health say the exemptions are examples of the administration putting profit over human and environmental health.

An EPA assessment for the plants in Mount Vernon and Ellettsville places both facilities on the high end of riskiness to human health, after considering the amount of chemicals released onsite, the degree of toxicity and the size of the exposed population.

“There were regulations put in place by experts based on what is good for human health,” said Heather Navarro, the director of the Midwest Climate Collaborative, a climate change response network which includes Indiana University and the City of Indianapolis. “Now we’re saying that what’s more important is profit. And I think that's hugely problematic, and that should concern every American.”

It isn’t yet clear if or how the administration will address the potential public health impacts of two-year exemptions. And while it's hard to gauge exactly how two additional years of non-compliance will impact communities downwind of pollutants, the exemption ""equals two years of potentially profound impacts on community health,"" according to Filippelli.

One proclamation targeted exemptions at 39 medical equipment manufacturing facilities, which often use the gas ethylene oxide to sterilize their products.

Ethylene oxide is highly effective, but it’s also a carcinogen that can leak out of vents during the sterilization and aeration process, according to the EPA.

In a 2024 report, the EPA wrote many medical sterilization facilities in the United States are located near residences, schools and communities with environmental justice concerns. They determined the use of ethylene oxide at several of the plants pose “high lifetime cancer risks to surrounding communities.”

“It’s a really useful compound in manufacturing everything from sterilizations to manufacturing things like antifreeze and polyester,” said Shannon Anderson, the directory of advocacy at Earth Charter Indiana. “But it’s also incredibly dangerous to human health. It’s a carcinogen. It’s responsible for all kinds of respiratory inflammation and chronic inflammation and it can damage your nervous system. And in certain quantities, it can be fatal.”

The Cook Medical plant treats tens of thousands of pounds of ethylene oxide every year, but the facility’s emissions and discharges of the toxic chemical have dropped drastically since 2019, according to EPA data. In 2023, the EPA reported 11 pounds of ethylene oxide at Cook Medical in Ellettsville were disposed of or released.

Cook Medical declined to comment on why they applied for an exemption.

A separate proclamation directed two-year exemptions at chemical manufacturers and refineries, like the SABIC plastic plant in Mount Vernon. The SABIC plant develops thermoplastics, and in 2023, it released several million pounds of chemicals on and offsite, according to the EPA.

Schumann, SABIC's spokeswoman, told IndyStar in a statement the emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants impose “substantial and costly additional burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” and the company will continue to uphold the “highest standards” in their environmental stewardship.

But environmental advocates aren’t convinced the burdens of monitoring and regulating air pollution can just dissipate with a presidential proclamation.

“This is simply shifting that burden to the public with increased healthcare costs, with increased damage to the local environments, and ultimately with their lives,” said Anderson. “The burden doesn't go away. It simply shifts.”","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/17/PIND/83698981007-170525-chemical-ct-002.JPG?crop=7483,4209,x0,y448&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-25 09:01:34.321303

“We had hard numbers that we needed to get, and we had to balance cuts in areas that are hard, and I think that we did a good job focusing on the priorities of so many when it comes to public lands and EPA,” Senate Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said in an interview.

Even though each chamber is bucking the White House in its own way, the Senate’s bipartisan approach is a major challenge to the White House and is upsetting some conservatives.

Like other Senate fiscal 2026 bills, the Interior-Environment title takes the administration to task, urging it to spend appropriated funds in accordance with direction from Capitol Hill.

“The committee is disappointed with the utter lack of regard for complying with Congressional intent on spending funds as appropriated,” the bill report reads.

Here are four takeaways from the bill:

EPA science shutdown blocked

Senate appropriators are displeased with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and his staff as they rally to rework the agency.

“The Committee is frustrated with how EPA has decided to not have a working relationship with the Committee and to disregard Congressional directives related to staffing and funding,” the bill report said.

Consequently, the panel created a new account, called the Office of the Administrator, and provided it almost $107.9 million, which would fund the administrator’s team as well as the agency’s chief financial office. That is far below the $183.8 million being spent on those operations in fiscal 2025.

The Senate committee said it created the new account out of EPA’s Environmental Programs and Management account to ensure “transparency in funding.”

“Targeted increases” in funding could be forthcoming for those offices if they can “demonstrate that it takes its relationship with the Committee seriously.”

EPA is directed to “expeditiously brief” the panel on its proposed reorganization involving several program offices, which was announced last week. Senators also took aim at the agency’s plans to eliminate its Office of Research and Development.

“The Committee is appalled that the Agency has announced the imminent closure of ORD,” said the bill report, which would result in “the immeasurable risk to our health and environment” by undercutting EPA’s capacity to clean up dangerous chemicals and respond to disasters.

The report notes the agency didn’t include its plan for the science office in its budget request, nor submit it to the committee as required by reprogramming guidance.

Consequently, EPA is ordered “to immediately halt … the closure, reduction, reorganization, or other similar such changes” to ORD and its scientific workforce.

Further, the bill text states the agency “shall maintain staffing levels” at the research office at its fiscal 2021 capacity, including at its scientific centers and all 10 regional laboratories.

“I’d like to think that we don’t actually need provisions requiring that there be enough staff to carry out essential activities,” said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), the subcommittee’s ranking member, at Thursday’s markup. “But at this moment in the national conversation, I think these sorts of provisions are important in this bill.”

Environmental justice given lifeline

EPA is already moving forward with shutting down another office, which was created in 2022 to aid marginalized communities saddled with longstanding pollution.

The agency is scheduled to lay off 271 employees who worked on environmental justice or “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives by Thursday next week.

Zeldin has also pushed to cancel environmental justice grants, which were funded with billions of dollars during the Biden administration.

But Senate appropriators have offered a lifeline to that work at the agency. Included in the bill text is language saying funds for EPA enforcement “may be used for environmental justice implementation and training grants, and associated program support costs.”

The bill report says $40 million will be used for environmental justice activities at the agency, according to committee aides. That is far below the roughly $100 million in enacted spending levels but could keep the program afloat during the Trump administration.

The House Republicans’ spending bill would zero out funding for environmental justice at EPA. On his first day back in office, Trump also signed an executive order demanding agencies terminate their environmental justice offices and positions along with DEI programs.

Interior riders

Murkowski took her pound of flesh in the bill, including riders to accomplish long-sought goals for Alaska and force the Trump administration to roll back a key prerogative.

The Senate bill would force the Interior Department to restore the name “Denali” to the nation’s highest peak, located in Alaska. The Trump administration reverted the mountain’s name via executive order to “Mount McKinley,” despite local support for the Denali moniker that was codified during the Obama administration.

The bill would require all federal references to the mountain to be returned to Denali within 60 days — an affront to the White House’s effort to rename federal lands, waters and structures.

Also included in the committee report is a note that the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 requires the Interior secretary to permit access for the Ambler mining road.

The project was blocked by the Biden administration, citing Indigenous subsistence concerns. That decision prompted an uproar from the Alaska delegation.

The bill also includes a bipartisan rider that would bar the transfer of any national park unit, trail or river from National Park Service control.

The rider is a firm rebuke of the Trump administration’s budget request, which proposed transferring smaller parcels away from NPS control and management.

EV chargers, pipeline safety

The Transportation-HUD bill would increase spending 3 percent relative to the currently enacted level. The bill would provide about $10 billion more than the House version.

Senate appropriators packed the bill report with language supporting Republican and Democratic priorities — from electric vehicle charging infrastructure to pipeline safety programs and streamlined environmental reviews.

The legislation requires the Department of Transportation to issue new draft guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program within 30 days of enactment, and final guidance within 120 days.

That program, created by the 2021 infrastructure law to build out a coast-to-coast network of EV charging stations, has become a favorite target of the Trump administration and some Republicans. DOT froze the program’s grants earlier this year and rescinded program guidance.

The committee directed the Federal Aviation Administration to provide at least $50 million for zero-emission and low-emission projects at airports and to “actively engage” in identifying potential energy efficiency, energy resilience and renewable energy projects.

Funding for pipeline safety and hazardous materials safety programs would stay roughly flat. Appropriators directed at least $5 million toward the creation of a center for expertise for liquefied natural gas safety.

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration would be required to consider initiating a rulemaking to minimize leaks and ensure safety around hydrogen infrastructure.

Appropriators noted continuing efforts to improve rail safety following the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and directed PHMSA to take certain actions recommended by the federal investigators in response to the derailment.

The housing section of the bill would maintain funding for lead control and mitigation, and it would encourage a study on ways to better support renters following natural disasters.

One provision would direct HUD to work with other agencies to “improve processes for environmental reviews” with the goal of streamlining permits for new housing.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1b/e9/abcdbb434e069c90925cddfa7bbd/congress-budget-59260.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 12:07:30.269840

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: Doug Burgum was on Capitol Hill this week encouraging Republicans to keep focusing on slashing Biden-era clean energy programs. And it made me wonder, I haven’t heard anything out of the dominance council that’s meaningful.

Costa Samaras: I mean, I think a good question to ask Secretary Burgum is, which wind turbine hurt you, bro? Why are they so mad at wind turbines?

Katherine Hamilton: 40% of the generation in North Dakota is wind. What happened?

Stephen Lacey: Don’t you feel bad for the guy, though? I mean people know him as Secretary of the Interior. He’s Chair of this National Energy Dominance Council, but now he has this third role, which is America’s most overqualified clean energy permit reviewer.

Katherine Hamilton: He’s gone from Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which is the only national park in North Dakota to Teddy Roosevelt Island, which is very, very small.

Stephen Lacey: Trump has such a unique way of humiliating people.

Costa Samaras: I just can’t imagine getting that many emails to approve stuff. Just at some point it’s just like, “All right, fine. Just deal with it.”

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, the great recalibration, just as power demand is exploding a new law, the One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to slash clean energy deployment by up to 60% over the next decade. At the same time, the Department of Energy is warning of massive blackout risk, lamenting the growing gap between demand and timelines for developing new resources. But brand new restrictions imposed by the Trump White House will make it harder to build the very resources that could close the gap. The result, a strange kind of cognitive dissonance, Washington is saying go faster and slow down at the same time, creating a high stakes bottleneck for developers, utilities, and large energy buyers, we will map out the contradictions, the possible impacts, and some alternative solutions.

I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the executive Editor at Latitude Media. Welcome to the show. Katherine Hamilton is with me. She’s the co-founder and Chair of 38 North Solutions. How are you?

Katherine Hamilton: I’m great. I’m back to sitting on my floor today just for the day.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar Shah is away this week and in his place is Costa Samaras. Costa is director of the Carnegie Mellon Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, and he’s a former Chief Advisor for Clean Energy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Costa, welcome back.

Costa Samaras: So great to be back with you. I hope to not embarrass myself further this time like I did last time.

Stephen Lacey: There’s a reason why you’re the fastest repeat guest we’ve ever had in the history of this podcast.

Costa Samaras: I think it’s because I answered your email immediately, probably.

The One Big Beautiful Bill and clean energy’s recalibration

Stephen Lacey: So after two years of tailwinds from the Inflation Reduction Act, developers are now facing a pretty different landscape. The One Big Beautiful Bill the OBBB is dialing back tax incentives, imposing hard construction deadlines, and bringing in strict new sourcing rules on foreign equipment sourcing. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy is out with a new report on reliability, which blames renewables for increasing outage risks and is seen as a smoke screen to help keep aging fossil plants alive. And I first want to just start with framing, actually. I’m thinking about this moment as this great recalibration, shorthand for the policy shifts that we’ve seen unfold in recent months and weeks, and also the new demand drivers that are impacting renewables and battery deployment. How would each of you think about this moment with these two competing forces, Katherine?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I was trying to think of some phrases that come to mind other than, “Ah.” One is, “Back to fundamentals. Don’t take anything for granted. Survival of the fittest,” which sounds a little cynical. But then also true value. So really having to dig into what is the actual value that all of our technologies are giving to the grid and to the customers because that is going to really matter as we move forward.

Costa Samaras: And I think it’s a best of times, worst of times moment, lots of headwinds artificially placed in front of clean energy, but lots of opportunities for the clean energy technology progress that we’ve seen to continue to accelerate in the market. I think about this moment as a Etch-a-Sketch moment, and if you remember Etch-a-Sketch, it was this little box that you drew on with these knobs and then you would shake it and then all your picture would go away. And the reason I think about an Etch-a-Sketch right now is one of my VC friends who works in climate tech, he’d said we’ve left the world of rational politics and entered a world of irrational partisan desires. And so all of the old rules, the ways that we thought that politics worked, the way that we thought that incentives worked, the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill seemed to shake that all and really cause us to think about the world in a different way.

Stephen Lacey: We have two Etch-a-Sketches here and I like to sit down and make some really beautiful designs and then my daughter just grabs it from me and shakes it up. So I like that analogy, but it feels like right now the Etch-a-Sketch has been shaken up, but there’s still some residue on the screen. We can still see the picture. And so that’s why I’m thinking about it as this recalibration, right? There are certainly hard stops for incentives for wind, solar, electric vehicles, but for many of the long-term decarbonization solutions, tax credits continue. There’s tax credit transferability. This is not a wholesale change to incentives. So let’s actually talk about how much that picture is shaken up to bring this analogy to its logical conclusion. Katherine, when you look at the impact of OBBB, what are folks saying about the impact and where are the incentive changes going to have the greatest impact?

Katherine Hamilton: There’ve been a bunch of different analyses and I’ll just cite some of them. So on investment deployment and generation, the Rhodium Group says that there will be a decrease in clean energy capacity additions of 57 to 62% by 2025. The Princeton Repeat Project says there’ll be a decreased cumulative clean energy and fuels capital investment of half a trillion between 2025 and 2035. And they say also at Princeton that there will be reduced clean energy generation by 820 terawatt hours by 2035. Electric vehicle share looks like it could go down by 5%. That’s a Wood-Max study. And then Rhodium also says between 20 and 34% fewer EVs as a portion of the light duty vehicle mix. And then a big number is going to be household energy costs, both Rhodium and Princeton project between $80 and $300 increases a year. Energy Innovation says like $170 a year by 2035.

That is hitting people in the pocketbooks. And then greenhouse gas emissions, of course, between eight, 9% depending on whether you follow C2ES or Rhodium Group, looks like they could go up. And then one of the other big impacts will be jobs. So three quarters of a million jobs lost by 2030 says Energy Innovation and 1.7 million by 2035 says C2ES. So these are all projections. We’ll have to see what actually happens, but that’s kind of what we’re watching as we start scaling down on some of the credits that we had in place with the Inflation Reduction Act, let’s see where it goes. Maybe we can create a new Etch-a-Sketch ourselves and create a new story, but right now that’s what the analysts say the impacts could be.

Stephen Lacey: So we’re certainly not going to see a collapse of wind and solar development, but I think I heard Jesse Jenkins describe that over the next decade or so, we’ll be taking out a nuclear fleets worth of new capacity. So it is a big deal. We will be stripping a lot of much-needed capacity out of the picture. Costa, what are you focused on at the Scott Institute? Are there any particular impacts that you’re keeping your eyes on as a result of the OBBB changes?

Costa Samaras: Because the internet has ruined my brain, the thing that immediately jumped to me when I looked at the final text of the bill was the meme where the guy is riding the bike and then he takes a stick and puts it through the front spokes and flips over and is hurt on the ground. And the U.S. clean energy economy is us on the bike and the One Big Beautiful Bill is the stick. It’s a artificial slamming on the brakes of some of the most important technological progress, and jobs, and opportunities for the U.S. economy and all the numbers that Katherine just went through, I was trying to think through how I would internalize that.

And the word that kept coming back to me is “half” and so we’re getting half. And so we’re going to cut the amount of new clean power capacity by half over the next decade. We’re going to slow investment in clean energy by half a trillion dollars. And Jesse Jenkins and Princeton in the Repeat Project showed that we’re going to add about half a gigaton per year of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. And again, all back to for what? What is the theory of the case here that we’re artificially damaging the environment, raising people’s costs, and slowing down an exciting and important new industry in the United States? For what?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I mean I think the “For what?” is a simple answer and it is retribution, but we’ll talk a little bit more about the case that they are making through that DOE reliability report. I think that is one of the ways that they are making the argument for ending these subsidies, but I don’t think there’s much more to it other than retribution and sort of vindictive policymaking. Let’s talk about the differences in policy. So we talked a little bit about our reactions of the bill when it passed, and I don’t think we did… Katherine, you did a pretty helpful breakdown of what’s in it, but can we talk about the difference in incentives today compared with the IRA and compared with pre-IRA? Because ultimately, we ended up in a better place than we were before the IRA with some nuances. So I think it would be helpful to walk through where we were before the IRA and where we are now compared to those changes that we saw through the Biden term.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, there were a lot of credits that were not even on the table before the IRA. We really just had solar and wind. I had been working forever to try to get an energy storage tax credit since 2009, and finally we got it in the Inflation Reduction Act. We got credits for any number of technologies. We also got bonuses for building in energy communities in low-income communities. There were just so many ways in which this bill brought in new technologies into the mix and really supercharged them. So this was like, “All right, we’re all going to be going. We’re all going to be investing including in manufacturing.” So there was a manufacturing credit that had never been in place. There were new credits for homes, for homeowners, for cars, you name it, the IRA put it in there and it was really an all-of-the-above clean energy strategy and there were some things that didn’t make it into the bill, like transmission didn’t make it into the bill.

I was very disappointed in that. Distributed energy, there was not a portfolio standard for clean energy. That was something I was really interested in working on. But in essence, it really got everybody going, investors, banks, developers in one direction. And then it started being implemented. We didn’t have that much time to implement it before the new administration came in, however, and really decided we’re going to do the opposite of what President Biden did. Anything President Biden did is now bad and we’re going to do the exact opposite of that. And so started tearing those down.

Well, in the end what happened was not completely a teardown. So you still have credits for geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, a pace. You still have the manufacturing tax credit in place. It’s the solar and wind credits that are going to be stopped earlier. They still have a bit of a glide path rather than just going over a cliff. The new piece that is going to be interesting to see how it pans out is this Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC), because those rules are going to potentially hang up people in their supply chains, in their ownership structures. And I think just causing a lot of uncertainty right now. But generally we are still in a way better situation than we were before the Inflation reduction Act.

Costa Samaras: As an optimist, I’m with Katherine on this, that the baseline in this administration that we were going to lose everything and we didn’t lose everything. There’s some very important things that are still law today. The challenge is the Foreign Entity of Concern and the other kind of red tape that is going to artificially challenge projects that are out of favor. I think that is a much more dangerous provision going forward than what was taken out is the ability for an administration to disfavor certain parts of certain technologies because they don’t like them in a way that hinders clean energy growth in the country.

Stephen Lacey: Why are these Foreign Entity of Concern rules so much more strict compared to what was enacted under the Biden administration? They were used as a very precise tool and now they are much wider in scope, and I don’t think we quite know how the rules are going to play out, but how damaging could they be and which supply chains will they be most difficult for?

Katherine Hamilton: This is interesting because actually the FEOC rules were on 30D, which was the car credit, and they actually weren’t super clear. I think there was still a lot of question as to where exactly the buck stopped on ownership and parts. And I think that some suppliers to the OEMs, the car companies were a little confused as to who was in charge, who actually had to make sure that they were in compliance. I think that’s the crucial thing. So interestingly now the car, if you buy an electric car and you’re not going to get the credit after September, but you’re also not going to have to comply with any of these FEOC rules that companies don’t have to comply with those anymore because they don’t exist. But for these other credits, what they’re going to need to do is set guidance that is very clear that details exactly what pieces of equipment you have to track and who has to be in compliance.

That’s going to be a big issue is where does the buck stop? Because people right now are trying to figure out, developers are trying to figure out, “Where are my supply chains? Where do they come from?” The ownership structure is a little bit, I think, clearer in that, but the guidance is going to be really important. And one piece that I think about, and Costa you may think about this as well, is that during the Inflation Reduction Act implementation, the Department of Energy staff worked very, very closely with Treasury to develop rules because DOE had the technical expertise. So we spent a lot of time talking to DOE and to the program managers there about here’s how things could work so that industry could actually do what it needs to do based on the credits.

We have so many fewer staff at DOE now, so I’m not exactly sure who over there is going to be in charge of making sure that these are written in a way that technologically they can work so that logistically they can work. So you have much reduced staff at Treasury and at Department of Energy. So I’m hopeful that they will get done quickly, but it doesn’t bode well given the cuts that they’ve already had to capacity there.

Costa Samaras: In Washington, delay is also no. And I think what the industry is concerned about right now with these Foreign Entity of Concern rules is exactly what Katherine was saying is that the uncertainty is high. There may not be a resolution to any uncertainty which may just stop projects right away. And it also provides another veto point outside of legislation that either the administration can have at Treasury or in other agencies that can say, “The way that we’re interpreting this is this way and your project that used these types of components is now ineligible for the tax credits.” And that just creates a environment of disinvestment. And maybe that’s by design, probably that’s by design, but it also gives way more control to Treasury and executive agencies to interpret and layer on red tape to stop different types of investments in clean energy in the country.

Katherine Hamilton: Interestingly, because they don’t take effect until next year, the next two quarters are going to be a boom.

Costa Samaras: Totally.

Katherine Hamilton: People are trying to close deals right away as quickly as they can.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, they’re going to close deals and they’re going to hoard a bunch of equipment too under Safe Harbor rules, so you’ll see a lot of activity in the lead up to getting hopefully some clarity on these rules. What is the best case implementation scenario for these FEOC rules? If they were used as a legitimate policy tool and implemented well, I think we all agree we want to see more clean energy supply chains built here in America and there’s a place for these kinds of rules. What is the best case scenario for implementation?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think you want something really clear, something that may not be easy but will be not impossible to comply with, and then a pathway to being able to change over time and to be able to source. And they do have, because there is percentage differences over time for compliance. There is a pathway to having more investment, bringing more equipment in from the U.S. but that also assumes that we’re going to have manufacturing growing in the U.S. that will provide all of the equipment that everybody needs.

Costa Samaras: The spirit of this is one, to encourage domestic manufacturing, but two, to counter any security concerns from covered foreign entities, namely China, that may exist in certain parts of the supply chain. But nuts and bolts or nails or other products that are commodities are not going to be a giant security concern for different types of clean energy projects. And what these rules as written do is give the executive agencies in the U.S. government another veto point to create uncertainty and red tape for clean energy investment.

Stephen Lacey: So what are the other areas of uncertainty? I guess the first would be commenced construction. The White House has said they’re going to be very strict with the rules that allow you to engage in a little bit of construction activity and then qualify for the tax credits when you finish the project down the road. What are they going to put in place? What are they suggesting they’re going to put in place?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, we don’t know exactly. I think they could do this one pretty quickly because it’s clear right now what commenced construction means. There are rules in place. So like Safe Harbor, just as you said, 5% is the Safe Harbor number now, but there is precedent in previous tax code for 10%, so they could raise it to 10%. That would be something that would be not completely unreasonable. Of course it increases the need to hustle to get all this done, but I think that’s something they could look forward to. Also, we would hope that these would be prospective not retroactive so that this would just be looking ahead, which is typically what Treasury does. Then the other piece is the physical test. So they could have to make sure that construction is continuing, they could have more audits in the field. That will be interesting because there are so fewer auditors for the IRS now in the field.

So I’m not sure how they’re going to manage that, but there are different ways that they could do it to try to, as Costa says, create more red tape. The good news from where I sit is that the folks that are assigned in Treasury to writing these are not dogmatic. They are people who’ve worked on the Hill, who’ve written legislation who I think are not going to be predisposed to change statute in the regulation. So even though they may increase and make more strict what commenced construction means, I don’t think that they’re predisposed to make it worse in a way that is outside of the statute.

Costa Samaras: In the before times, the commenced construction determination was pretty easy to understand. You started building something, you’ve paid a portion of the initial project cost and you were able to deliver it within a certain time period. Now again, nothing can be taken for granted that industry and finance look at the opportunity at each of these veto points inside of the administration to say, “How likely are we going to pass this red tape gate in order to get the tax cuts that currently exist in the law to make our project in the money?” And there will be a non-zero amount of projects that look at that risk and think about the timelines, and think about the supply chain, and think about the Foreign Entity of Concern, and think about the permitting and say, “I don’t know if we’re going to make it.” And they’ll just put their money elsewhere. And that’s to our detriment as a country.

Stephen Lacey: And on the permitting side, we alluded to the new directive that requires any solar and wind projects being developed on federal lands to go straight to Secretary Burgum for review. How do we expect that to play out?

Katherine Hamilton: I mean, it’s already so hard to do. It’s already so hard to build on federal lands. I mean the potential that NREL finds is something like 12.5%. You could build on public lands of solar and wind and there’s only 4% there now. And I work with a lot of geothermal companies that are trying to do work and you have folks in these remote locations. I think solar and wind have enjoyed a little bit more of a focus area because they had at Interior, some processes set up in place for them. But in a lot of situations you’ve got somebody who’s got a fishing permit, a snowmobile permit, a geothermal power plant permit, which ones are they going to approve? I mean there’s just the entire capacity at Department of Interior for approval for public lands is already really difficult to get through. So I’m not sure how they’re going to… I think this could potentially slow them down. I think it’s just a huge resource that goes to waste if you’re not able to develop on public lands in an efficient way.

Costa Samaras: The public lands are ours. They belong to us. We’ve invested in their care as a country and it’s important that we steward those investments and protect the environment, and protect communities, and protect cultural resources, all the things that make public lands great. What worries me is now the permitting environment is only going to get worse for clean energy and it’s not going to be able to protect the environment in a way that we want it to. And the government right now is not picking winners, which is bad enough. They’re picking losers. And so how do we, as the clean energy community, come to the table and say, “These are the outcomes we want. We want clean energy, we want a protected environment. We want clean water, clean air, and we want a lot of opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

And I think it’s important that we don’t let the permitting reform conversation get kicked down the road because permitting reform is happening right now. This is happening without us. I mean they have reformed permitting in a way that makes it harder to do clean energy. We need to make it easier to do clean energy while protecting the environment and building transmission and building storage. I worry that we, in the climate community, have approached permitting reform in a way that lets us throw up our hands and say there’s nothing that we can do. And that’s not true. We really have to approach the way that we build things in this country to align with the outcomes that we want in the timeline that we have.

Stephen Lacey: What do you mean? Are we just not exercising the right levers of power? Are we not making the right demands? What do you mean by that exactly?

Costa Samaras: There is very appropriate concern that if we make it easier to build energy, that we’re only going to get dirty energy and that we’re going to have broader environmental challenges than we have right now. And I believe there’s always going to be trade-offs in energy development, but I believe that the current status quo is untenable. It’s unaligned with reaching net-zero emissions. We won’t build enough clean energy, and enough transmission, and enough storage to reach our energy goals. Notwithstanding the current policy environment, I’m talking about over the next 25 years. Without a radically re-imagined approach on how we build fast, clean, cheap, and with communities. And there’s trade-offs in that space and the status quo now, which is we’re going to put up roadblocks to stop as much things as possible are not going to align with our climate outcomes. And there’s a lot of good ideas out there about how to move forward. There’s very big nervousness, especially in rural communities and tribal communities, appropriate nervousness. We have to come together and find a way to build fast, clean, and cheap.

Stephen Lacey: So Katherine, 38 North puts out this biweekly analysis called the Policy Pulse, and in your latest edition you touched on how the Bill is now going to work its way through agencies for implementation. We touched on a few of the ways that that implementation is going to start to happen. What are some other big unknowns as the law gets absorbed by government?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think we have to see how much the public is able to participate. I think people are already starting to talk to the Treasury and IRS folks, talking to the agencies, looking of course at their supply chains to see where everything comes from and trying to, of course, safe harbor as fast as they can. So the way we see it is people need to be engaged. Don’t give up right now. This is not the right time to do it. I think showing that the way to get things done quickly and cost-effectively for the taxpayer is going to be important. I do think it’s going to be tricky because solar and wind are seen as not the chosen technologies right now. I think it is harder for a solar company to make a case than it would be, say, for an investor.

So an investor could go into Treasury and say, “Hey, I have all this money I’m trying to invest. I think these are really good technologies. They’re good for the taxpayer, they’re good for the bottom line, they’re good for customers, they’re good for everybody. Here’s how we need to have it work so that I can invest more in this country.” So I feel like sometimes having that voice is really important. So we are working, of course with all of the companies that we work with to try to influence the process or even just help make the process more smoothly for companies. I think different voices have a different level of excellence.

DOE’s reliability report: manufacturing a crisis?

Stephen Lacey: So, just as developers are recalibrating to new tax rules, some supply chain restrictions, permitting bottlenecks, the federal government just dropped another curveball. This DOE report warning of a 100-fold increase in blackout risk thanks to renewables, according to the DOE. It’s a headline that seems tailor-made for cable news, but under the hood, when you take a look at the assumptions, the report freezes storage growth, it underplays transmission, it assumes a grid that’s way less flexible than what many utilities in the industry are building toward. And it lands at the same time that the administration is cutting off NOAA’s ability to assess climate risk, removing key scientists and delaying tools that help agencies and utilities plan for the very disruptions that we’re trying to avoid. So Katherine, to you, the report warns of this 100-fold increase in blackout risk. What are the assumptions the report is making and how do they exaggerate the risks of clean energy?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, so one thing, just by way of background, the president issued two executive orders that led to this. One was on day one of his administration declaring the national energy emergency and then this executive order in April on strengthening reliability and security of the grid. And what that executive order told DOE to do was come up with a uniform methodology to measure risk and understand resource adequacy. So that’s what they tried to do, doesn’t mean they did it quite in the right way. There was a little bit talk about not using a scalpel. This was much more of a sledgehammer approach. So they assumed that there would be 104 gigawatts of plant retirements by 2030, 210 gigawatts of new generation, only 22 gigawatts of which would be what they call firm reliable dispatchable generation. Another thing was loss of load hours. So outages, they said that we would go from eight hours a year to 818 hours a year and that we would need 100 gigawatts of new peak capacity by 2030, 50 gigawatts of which would be attributable to new data centers.

So there were kind of three big pieces. One is that they really overstated the blackout risk. That was just huge numbers. Part of that is because they did it from a national level and all of these things are done at very local and regional levels. These things don’t occur the same everywhere. The other thing was they of course vastly undervalued the contributions of renewables to reliability. And we’ve talked about this before where Urquhart says they’re way better off on energy, reliability and resilience as a result of solar and batteries. And then finally they say, because of these two big pieces, that leads us to the conclusion that we need more fossil fuels. So they’ve overestimated the risk, underestimated the benefit, and then put their thumb on the scale of the solution.

Stephen Lacey: Costa, you’re incredibly good at analogizing stuff like this or applying some internet meme to it. How would you describe this report?

Costa Samaras: We will have to come back to me on what… I’m memeless at the moment. I guess the top line is if I were in the White House or DOE and the staff brought me this report and said, “We’re going to have a bunch of blackouts and because of the growth of data center load and because of retirements,” what would a rational policy executive do at that moment? It would be, “We better go build a bunch of batteries and solar and [inaudible 00:34:51] right away.”

Katherine Hamilton: We do everything, yes.

Costa Samaras: We should do doing virtual power plants. It would be press conference like Emergency Reconducting of the Tennessee Valley Authority right now, right? I mean if that was really the case, then the actions that they’re taking at the end of the report, which is, “Oh, and by the way, we should keep some coal online,” that’s not going to cut it. And so, I think that all of this, there’s a very capable and competent staff that contributed to this report at the labs and at headquarters, and the retirement of legacy fossil assets and the bottleneck to get new clean generation online is a challenge.

The solution is not going to be keep old dirty power plants online forever. The solution is to unlock the dominant source of new generation in the country, which has been clean energy, and do that in all the places that you’re worried about. Into the assumptions part, I want to actually say that they weren’t aggressive enough in one area. And they said, “We looked at these historical weather days and tried to model how the grid is going to react when the different temperature and other weather conditions happen.” And that is not the weather that we have now or will have over the 50 years of the assets in the electricity grid. Climate change because of, as we know, human-caused emissions has affected how hot it is, how intense the rainfalls are, like how intense the storms are. All these directly affect the electricity grid.

And actually recently, representative Leger Fernández in Congress introduced a Weather Safe Energy Act that asked DOE to say, “Hey, you all should come up with a high resolution weather platform to say how should our electricity system plan for extreme weather in the future.” So they’re using old weather information to try to prop up old power plants in a new, digitalized environment. All that is to say if blackout risk is 800 hours a year, there is a much bigger both political, economic and national security problem than the solutions to this report are saying that we should do.

Stephen Lacey: And to your first point, what is so interesting to me when we look at the top line figures is just how differently these administrations are interpreting some of the same basic facts. So the Department of Energy during the Biden administration put out a report showing we need 200 gigawatts of new capacity through 2030. And the Biden DOE said, “Well, we have the resources to meet much of that in a cheaper flexible way. We could build 80 to 160 gigawatts of virtual power plants and here’s how we could do it.” And the Trump DOE is like, “This is just going to be an extreme blackout risk. The only thing that can save us is more fossil generation,” and it sweeps this entire category out of the picture. And so, it’s just remarkable how differently you can interpret these basic facts.

Costa Samaras: Well, and gas turbines right now have a backlog, although that may be easing a little bit, but it’s not clear to me that the solutions of build a whole bunch of new gas and even oil, I’m not sure why they even threw that in there. We don’t even use oil in the continental United States to make electricity much anymore, that those aren’t going to solve the reliability crisis in the way that flexibility, efficiency, clean energy and storage can make an immediate contribution.

The other thing if I want to add to this is there is a need for clean firm power. We need to have clean firm power in the country. We won’t have clean firm power at the levels that we need if we don’t have a functional, robust and funded Department of Energy, Loan Programs Office, Clean Energy Demonstrations Office and other opportunities inside the Federal Government to go and deploy a whole bunch of new nuclear power and geothermal, and recapitalizing hydrodams. There’s opportunities to increase the amount of clean firm power that we have in the country. And they’re saying we need this on one hand and they’re taking away all the tools on the other hand.

Katherine Hamilton: So if you remember back in the previous Trump administration, there was a report done on resilience that Alison Silverstein was brought in to do the sort of technical review on and she-

Stephen Lacey: It’s the piles of coal report?

Katherine Hamilton: Yes, it was the piles of coal report. But here are the things that were right that she highlighted, which is first of all, base load generation is an operational mode, not a type of power plant that no natural gas, low natural gas costs and low electric demand growth are principal causes of retirements. So that was at that point there was low demand growth, but many of these power plants were used as generation, but their capacity factors had been completely shot and they no longer served as this operational mode of base load. And so, they were really talking about using characteristics, metrics, benefit and compensation to be essential to make sure our system is resilient. I mean, planning is crucial. The issue is that this administration’s mode is, “This is the answer I want so you have to create the report to match what I want. And what I want is more coal.” That’s really what they want.

Stephen Lacey: Well, to that point, how does a report like this start to influence the market? Does it give planners, regulators, utilities, cover?

Costa Samaras: I mean there’s some truth to a big PDF like this that we call a waiving document. And what it is a regulator can say and wave that PDF in the air, “DOE said we need more coal.” And then the Public Service Commission or the PUC or others would say, “I guess they said it, I mean it’s a PDF, what do you want us to do? It’s a PDF.” I mean, so there is a danger that the recommendations from this report rather than the highlighting of the need for increased reliability and resilience are going to be the takeaway.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think the mitigating factor Costa is going to be that rates are going up and keeping these coal plants running is not going to help.

Costa Samaras: We are on the precipice of an electricity cost crisis in the country. And a lot of that hasn’t been from generation. It’s been because of the disinvestment over many years of transmission and distribution. And I think that the administration thinks that they’re going to be able to blame it on renewables. And I don’t think that that’s going to work because it’s going to be very clear that in places where we’re ramping up fossil fuels, in places that we haven’t invested in transmission distribution, that rates are going to continue to have pressure on. This One Big Beautiful Bill act is a make-your-electricity-costs-go-up act. And I just think that there a lot of folks are misreading the two to six year politics of what One Big Beautiful Bill does and that is raise electricity prices.

The Grid New Deal: building infrastructure for the AI era

Stephen Lacey: So we’ve been talking about the limits that Washington is putting into place, but what would it actually look like to unleash new supply? And Costa, you’ve been out talking about this concept called the Grid New Deal, and now that you’re here, I want to unpack it for us. So the Grid New Deal is this large scale federal initiative that would match grid infrastructure investment with the scale of electrification and digitalization. What are the core elements of this vision?

Costa Samaras: We like to think about the electricity sector as the century’s highways. All the ways that we’re going to be building and creating new growth, new wealth, new opportunities in the century in the United States is going to have an electricity component to it. And whether that’s manufacturing, or if it’s services, or if it’s other opportunities for new businesses, electricity is the core component, but yet we’re still treating electricity and the electricity infrastructure as this side, unpaid attention to infrastructure that is almost entirely privatized, that doesn’t have long run vision for recapitalization and reinvestment. And that puts a lot of the work and a lot of the cost of reinvestment on the rate payers. It’d be like charging tolls to build the original Eisenhower highway system before we built it in a way that would always stop us from getting to what we want. So what is the Grid New Deal?

It’s new energy supply, new transmission, new distribution, new demand management, all that can lower prices, increase resilience and lower emissions. Now that sounds at the high level, what does that mean? But those are the objectives, right? I mean the objectives is bring new clean energy supply on quickly, reinvest in the bottlenecks that are causing costs to go up in transmission. We just live with this. It’s like, “Oh, I guess we just can’t do it. So everybody’s going to pay higher prices.” Well, those higher prices hurt working families. They hurt new businesses, they hurt schools, they hurt municipalities. And it’s like we shouldn’t have to live with dirty energy and high prices just because we’ve thrown up our hands and said we can’t do this. I think there needs to be a new imagination of what our infrastructure should do for us. And if it’s not going to come from the federal government, then we should be experimenting in the states.

And this could be unlocking new clean energy supply and transmission with public private partnerships. It could be finding new ways for communities to have lower cost and benefit by hosting infrastructure in their communities and not repeating the same mistakes of the past when we were building at the highway system of just rolling over everybody and causing a big challenges in equity in frontline communities. Those are the principles that which we, as a country, could start to ascribe to and then fill in and leverage investment to make those things a reality. We want cold beer and hot showers. We want cheap electricity and we want no pollution. That’s not unachievable. We should have that.

Stephen Lacey: Well, I want to peel back the layers on how it would work, but first let’s just talk about the demand piece and the urgency for an idea like this. And Katherine, I want to turn to the data center piece specifically because it’s such a huge part of new load growth. So in your latest policy polls, you kind of outline a lot of the timing urgency around this new demand. Why is it creating this mismatch between current policy and what’s going to come online?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, it’s super interesting because there’s a little bit of we don’t exactly know how fast everything is going to come on. Because you don’t know if maybe AI can temper the load growth. So there are a lot of X factors in there, but certainly EIA is up to estimating an 8% overall electricity demand increase by 2030, 20% by 2035. And part of the issue on timing is that NEMA, which is the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, they think there would be a 10%, so like say eight to 10% by 2030. They’re saying that 90% of this projected data center demand growth would be in the next decade.

Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwartzman says over the next five years there’s going to be a trillion dollars of U.S. capital investment and data centers. What does that mean? That means, so data centers take about seven years from the initial steps of building to when they’re operating, and the reconstruction activities, all they have to do, siting, trying to figure out where their power is coming from takes the first two thirds. So there’s a misalignment between that timeline and when you could build what you need to power those centers.

If you look at legacy, and we’ve talked about this before because in Virginia a lot of those data centers, and there are some that are being built very near me, they’re trying to just draw from the grid, from what’s already out there. But what does that mean? That puts upward pressure on prices for everybody. So that’s not dedicated generation or resources for those centers, they’re just drawing from what the grid needs. But that means the prices could go up for everybody else.

But then if you look at do we want to build nuclear? Do we want to build or geothermal, or do we want to make sure we build a new gas plant? All those take time, they’re going to take longer than it takes to build a data center. So what do we do in the meantime? And I think that’s what people are trying to get their heads around. It’s like what is the infrastructure? And I love Costa that you put this in terms of infrastructure, because that’s what we need and we want infrastructure that serves the load we need in a way that doesn’t put upward prices on everybody else, but that also doesn’t leave us with a bunch of stranded assets at the end if the demand doesn’t actually happen.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. And Costa, one more question about the load piece. You’ve said that the AI boom is a stress test of the grid. What do you mean by that? What’s ahead and why is this moment just an indicator of the stress to come?

Costa Samaras: Well, where Katherine’s at in Virginia, data centers are already upwards of 25% of electricity demand, in any other countries that’s not the case. In many other parts of the country, that’s not the case. But how we handle the rapid growth of AI and data center electricity demand is going to basically tell society how we’re going to handle the rest of electrification of cars, and homes, and businesses and factories. And we wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review that said, “AI’s energy impact is still small, but how we handle it is huge.” Because if we get this wrong… I think what Katherine said, it’s like if we just go build a bunch of fossil plants, and we load up rate payers with infrastructure costs, and we impose new emissions on communities, and we suck up a bunch of water, if we do this wrong, the public will be justifiably skeptical and angry about electrification, period.

And if we don’t get electrification of cars, homes, businesses, and factories, we don’t deal with climate change. We’ll never meet our emissions objectives and we’ll never get to net-zero. And so that what we’ve been basically saying is not just that we have to get it right, we have to be at the table right now demanding how we handle load growth in the United States in a way that is affordable, reliable, clean, and equitable. And I think that those conversations are now starting to be had, but I think it’s on balance. I think we can come back to this in a year or two, but I think it’s a good thing that Mark Zuckerberg knows what the interconnection cue is.

I think it’s good that these companies are seeing energy as a core input to their business and they also have climate targets, and that they’re thinking through about how to do both private investment and how the government can do public investment to help grow electrification grid large in the country. Now, that’s not a blank check to just go do pollution and go suck up water resources. That’s why we have to get it right. And then that’s why there’re clean energy tariffs, sorry, clean transition tariffs, and flexibility, and virtual power plants, and reinvestment, all of these ideas that come from the clean energy nerd community apply to how we build out and think about AI energy demand.

Stephen Lacey: So let’s make this more concrete. Going back to the Grid New Deal, this was an idea that you established, was it in 2024?

Costa Samaras: Yeah.

Stephen Lacey: You’ve been talking about it for about a year. Specifically what agencies are you talking about leveraging? And then how are you drawing in this Smart AI Fast Lanes concept? So walk us through it in a more concrete way.

Costa Samaras: So the overall Grid New Deal is how I was thinking about Department of Energy, FERC, Department of Transportation, Department of Interior, EPA, Commerce, DOT, DOD, all the federal agencies that both rely on electricity for their mission, but also help enable the country to achieve our national aspirations through electricity, need to be thinking about electricity system as a national innovation imperative that we are investing in growing, modernizing, and getting to zero emissions. The Smart AI Fast Lanes piece is a policy that I published this year that was saying, “In the absence of new giant federal legislation, what could we do to help manage the growth of AI as well as achieve our objectives in trying to get it clean?” And where I landed was, and this is kind of the wonky part of this conversation, so I’m going to make it hopefully a little bit wonk light. Where I landed is who can do stuff right now?

The private sector, nonprofits, philanthropy, and some parts of the government can actually get some stuff done. And the Department of Energy has a foundation, the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation. It was established in the Chips and Science Act and lots of other agencies have had foundations for a long time. And so the Fish and Wildlife Foundation and others, they will help do conservation areas around defense installations or they will help grow supply chains in times of national emergencies by pushing in private and philanthropic resources.

And so what I was saying is, “Hey, why doesn’t DOE’s foundation be this conduit to help push in private and philanthropic resources in communities that need new investment for clean energy, for transmission, for distribution, for data centers?” And so this Smart AI Fast Lanes concept is projects could opt in almost like a connect and manage. The way that ERCOT does, things in Texas is projects could opt in, they could potentially pay fees, but the private sector and the philanthropic sector could say, “If you do these projects these ways that achieve objectives for the community, we will plus up the investment. Come to us with an opportunity to build a bunch of clean energy and we’ll double it. Come to us if you need transmission and distribution infrastructure for your data center and we will add in the transmission and distribution infrastructure that this community needs so that prices don’t rise.

And then really it’s like who is doing data center flexibility like Tyler Norris has proposed in his Duke paper? Why aren’t we pushing in Jigar’s famed virtual power plants at every place that we’re doing data centers? And so what this Smart AI Fast Lanes framework can do is use the private sector and philanthropy in this moment of policy uncertainty to get the outcomes that the companies say that they want, the communities deserve, and that kind of parts positions our electricity system for the type of clean growth and equitable growth that if we don’t have, we won’t deal with climate change.

Stephen Lacey: Does this feel like an idea that could get pulled off in this current political environment?

Costa Samaras: I mean, I wrote Smart AI Fast Lanes for this moment right now, which is policy uncertainty, potentially actively hostile against clean energy from the federal government and not as much resources from the public side as there were in the past. And so I think that this is something that could be bipartisan, that could be good for communities and is actually achievable. The thing that we talk about in policy a lot is efficiency, but we need a whole bunch of different things to line up for policy to be good. We need things to be efficient, we need things to be effective, we need things to be equitable. But the last one is also very important is it has to be doable, what’s called administrable.

And that’s why when we come back to the FEOC stuff and some of the permitting stuff, making a process that is easy for agencies and states to adopt quickly and not have a bunch of red tape behind it is a fast track to getting the outcomes that we want. If we’re thinking about those as policy objectives, efficiency, equity, effectiveness and administrability, those are the platonic ideal of a policy design and something where we could push in private and philanthropic money to communities right now that are trying to cope with this rise in electricity demand. Seems like it could be a doable win-win

Katherine Hamilton: Costa, it’s really interesting because this Foundation for Energy, Security and Innovation, from when it was being developed as the foundation adjacent to DOE was the same time I was helping to craft the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was the National Green Bank. And it seems like this could have been very, very complimentary where you have some tools that aren’t… The LPO can do senior debt, but that’s it, or a loan guarantee, but the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and all these state green bank entities can do a lot of other things and crowd in private sector investment. And it seems like it could sit very well. And I still think that the state green banks could do this, sit really well next to and help feed off of each other this DOE structure or the DOE adjacent foundation. Is there any risk that the foundation will go away because of the administration change or is it completely separate?

Costa Samaras: So the foundation exists, they’ve received an initial appropriation, but they are ramping up and they don’t need a federal appropriation to operate, but they do need partnership with the administration to help unlock things and do things that a traditional foundation can’t do. One of the things that I put in this Smart AI Fast Lanes piece was prizes. A lot of times prizes are seen as a punt to actual doing real work, but in this case I think it’s like, “Hey, show up with a data center that doesn’t use any water or uses rapidly higher, efficiently on a workload basis and either DOE or the philanthropic community will award innovation prizes, will give you money.” I mean, those are the types of things where we have unstructured… We have a structured policy goal is make data center and AI use less harmful to the environment and to communities, but we don’t really have a great idea of the specific cases that we want to pursue.

A prize is a very good vehicle for that. It’s like go do something good and the public or philanthropy or the private sector will plus up your investment and give you that incentive to do that. Right now we’re just like we don’t want to look back on this 90% of data center developments going to happen in the next X years and say, “Wow, we really messed that up. Oh, we should have done this.” We’ve been doing that with transportation infrastructure for 70 years and saying we shouldn’t have done this like this. We have agency right now to not do that with both data centers first and then electrification coming right behind it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://www.ktalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/data-center-e1753438072135.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 08:02:50.429956

In an update to the hydrogen market, the government has confirmed that 10 projects from the first phase of its flagship hydrogen programme – Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1) – can begin construction, supporting the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower.

Over 700 skilled jobs will be created in Britain’s industrial heartlands, as the first commercial-scale HAR1 projects signed long-term contracts to fuel heavy industry with clean, homegrown energy.

This means spades can now enter the ground across the country, marking a major boost to the UK’s hydrogen industry and creating highly skilled jobs in industrial cities and regions such as South Wales, Bradford (North West), North Scotland, and Teesside (North East).

HAR1 projects accelerating a low-carbon transition

The HAR1 projects will support British industry in transitioning away from fossil fuels towards domestically produced low-carbon hydrogen, thereby reducing emissions from heavy industries such as steel, glass, and heavy transport.

The HyMarnham project in Newark, Nottinghamshire, has already started construction. The project is transforming the old High Marnham coal-fired power station into a clean energy hub by using hydrogen to decarbonise waste disposal operations.

The Cromarty Hydrogen Project in Northeast Scotland is another of the 10 projects. The project’s 3 5MW electrolysers – which use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – will power local industrial users, including distilleries.

Opportunities for economic growth

The HAR1 projects are expected to create over 700 jobs, including roles for apprentices, graduates, pipefitters and engineers.

They are also expected to attract over £400m of private capital investment, which has been committed between 2024 and 2026, driving economic growth and British innovation through the Plan for Change.

The update comes as Andrex and Kleenex producer Kimberly-Clark announces that it will be the first major consumer goods company in the UK to make a significant commitment to green hydrogen.

Kimberly-Clark, together with energy partners HYRO, Carlton Power, and Schroders Greencoat, will invest a combined £125m in HAR1 projects at two plants in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria and Northfleet, Kent.

“This government is rolling out hydrogen at scale for the first time, with 10 of the first projects now shovel-ready to start powering businesses with clean, homegrown energy from Teesside to Devon,” stated Minister for Industry Sarah Jones.

“Hydrogen will help us cut industrial emissions and support Britain’s industrial renewal by creating thousands of jobs in our industrial heartlands.”

Hydrogen as part of Britain’s industrial renewal

Today’s announcement follows the Spending Review, which saw an extra £500m confirmed for the first-ever hydrogen transport and storage network as part of Britain’s industrial renewal, connecting hydrogen producers with vital end users, including power stations and industry for the first time.

The government has also announced that it will consult on transmission-level hydrogen blending – assessing the economic and technical feasibility of blending hydrogen into the networks that form the backbone of Britain’s gas system, before it is safely transported into homes and businesses.

Hydrogen transmission blending has the potential to reduce costs for hydrogen production projects and the broader energy system. The consultation will also gather evidence to assess whether hydrogen blending could lower consumers’ energy bills.

Lucy Whitford, Managing Director of RES UK&I, explained: “Green hydrogen, created using British low carbon energy, will revolutionise how we power industry, helping the UK to build a globally competitive, zero carbon economy in the process.”",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2550221409.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 08:00:58.882475

Fresh off wins for the fossil fuel sector in the Republican megalaw, the Trump administration is now pushing hard in the talks for countries to buy U.S. fossil fuels, most notably natural gas that’s liquefied for easy export over long distances.

New gas purchase commitments from foreign trade partners are helping to avert a wave of U.S. tariffs set to take effect Aug. 1. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in recent days that the final sprint on trade talks will be “for the record books,” adding that countries will be hit with tariffs in August if deals aren’t reached.

“LNG is playing a significant role in the bilateral trade talks,” Mark Menezes, president of the U.S. Energy Association trade group and a former Department of Energy official in Trump’s first term, said in an interview. “It’s certainly a way to address the trade imbalance and also the potential tariffs.”

As of last week, 14 binding deals and seven tentative ones have been signed this year for U.S. LNG, said Talon Custer, an energy equity analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

This week, President Donald Trump announced new trade deals with Japan and Indonesia, and deals with Malaysia and the European Union appear close. While Trump is touting the deals as major breakthroughs for U.S. industry, they are not the traditional, all-encompassing free trade agreements that typically take months or years to negotiate and enact into law with congressional approval.

Still, on Tuesday, Trump said the United States had reached a trade agreement with Japan that will include a “major expansion of U.S. energy exports.”

He said the United States and Japan are likely forming a “joint venture” in Alaska around LNG, telling Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “set that up.” Trump has been talking about the potential venture for months.

The White House also announced a deal with Indonesia that advances trade in crude oil, gasoline and liquid petroleum gas, a product category that includes propane. A White House spokesperson did not respond for comment on more details of the pact, but the American Petroleum Institute celebrated it.

It’s too soon to tell if the deal will reverse long-standing U.S. trade imbalances. The U.S. trade deficit in May was roughly $72 billion, down from deficit spikes earlier in the year but up from April 2024.

But the trade deals and new business ventures are central to the Trump administration’s all-out push to boost fossil fuels — and cut federal support for renewables.

The Republican budget law directs more oil and gas lease sales on public lands and slashes royalty payments. It also gives oil and gas producers new tax perks — and delays for a decade a fee on methane emissions.

Those wins for the oil and gas sector passed alongside massive cuts to wind and solar tax credits and grants.

The U.S. is flush with natural gas and is adding infrastructure to ship more. The Department of Energy says the U.S. is on track to triple LNG export capacity by 2030.

The White House says it’s prioritizing LNG.

“President Trump is leveraging every tool of government to boost natural gas production and LNG exports,” Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told POLITICO’s E&E News. “This stands as a major priority and success for President Trump, as we’ve already witnessed significant demand and interest from our trading partners for more American LNG.”

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to requests for comment.

Loose commitments for Alaskan LNG

A handful of buyers in Asia have shown interest in Alaska LNG, which includes a proposed 807-mile natural gas pipeline and an LNG export terminal.

The owners of the proposed Alaska LNG project, led by the Glenfarne Group, in March signed a nonbinding deal with Taiwan’s state-owned oil and gas company for the firm to buy gas from the project.

In June, Burgum, Wright and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin traveled to Alaska, where they pushed for greater energy development and held meetings with foreign ministers to advance projects like Alaska LNG. They also appeared with Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) at the Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Pan Men-an, the secretary-general to the president of Taiwan, who spoke at the conference through an interpreter, said the Taiwanese government is “ready to expand its procurement of natural gas, agricultural goods and industrial products from the United States.”

“Alaska stands at the center of this endeavor,” he added.

Later in June, Thai national oil company PTT reached an agreement of its own with Glenfarne. Then, this month, Reuters reported that GAIL Ltd. — India’s leading natural gas company — is in preliminary talks to buy LNG from the Alaska LNG project.

Glenfarne declined to confirm those reports.

“Glenfarne does not comment on or confirm individual commercial negotiations, but Alaska LNG’s growing commercial momentum reflects the project’s competitive economic and geostrategic advantages,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

Robert Fee, vice president of policy, government and public affairs at Cheniere Energy, said last month that the Trump administration “correctly recognizes the role of U.S. LNG in a way that previous administrations have not.”

“They also see it as a way through the tariff and the trade negotiations as a way to correct the trade imbalance with other countries,” Fee said, speaking on a panel at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Forum.

But he noted companies don’t rush into contracts because of political pressure. Many Asian countries are reliant on imported fossil fuels.

“U.S. oil and natural gas imports are easy for those countries that rely on imports for sources of energy and like to do business with the U.S,” said Menezes with the U.S. Energy Association. “It’s something they need. It’s something they’re willing to talk about. It’s something they need to buy on the global markets anyway.”

In Asia, Japan in particular is in the “driver’s seat” when it comes to procuring LNG, said Sam Reynolds, research lead for LNG at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

“Japan has a number of reasons to buy more U.S. LNG,” Reynolds said. “Not only to alleviate the threat of tariffs, but also because Japan wants to shift its supply to more flexible supplies of LNG.”

The drive to lock down buyers for U.S. LNG comes as Chinese imports of the fuel have dried up. China did not import any U.S. LNG for the first four months of 2025, according to a June report from DOE. Instead, China has resold contracted volumes since the imposition of tariffs.

“Unless Chinese tariffs are rescinded or Asian buyers start offering a significant premium to their European counterparts, reselling to Europe will remain more profitable,” Rystad Energy analysts said in an analysis published this month.

European demand

The European Union is staring down a 30 percent tariff set to take effect Aug. 1, and a deal still remains elusive.

Henning Gloystein, practice head of energy, climate and resources at the Eurasia Group, said countries like Germany and Italy are likely supportive of more U.S. LNG imports to avert tariffs.

“It’s all dependent on tariffs,” he said. “If Trump sticks to 30 percent [tariffs], then the last thing Europeans or Germans will do is buy any American LNG. No chance.”

U.S. LNG exports to Europe dropped nearly one-fifth in 2024, compared to a year earlier when the continent was reeling from the gas supply disruption triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But the E.U. is proposing a ban on Russian gas by the end of 2027, potentially paving the way for more U.S. exports. Gloystein said the Russian gas cut-off offers an “entry point” for U.S. LNG.

Also complicating the picture: Europeans could impose rules to restrict LNG that exceeds a certain methane content, a move that could upend bilateral talks with the U.S., according to experts.

“This issue is going to be a conflict between the U.S. and EU,” said Brenda Shaffer, an author and researcher at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. “The EU will probably have to agree to exempt U.S. LNG from its specific methane content requirements.”

The Italian firm Eni, meanwhile, announced an agreement this month with U.S. LNG producer Venture Global to buy 2 million metric tons of LNG annually for 20 years. Venture Global said the deal is Eni’s first ever long-term agreement with a U.S. LNG producer. German-owned Securing Energy for Europe, or SEFE, also signed a deal with Venture Global, expanding how much LNG the company would buy from the CP2 LNG terminal in Louisiana.

Gloystein said the EU will be a prime target for U.S. LNG over the next decade.

“Europe between now and 2035 will be very important for American LNG sellers because it’s a natural fit,” he said, pointing to the easy transit from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe. “As long as NATO doesn’t totally fall to pieces, even with Trump, the Europeans are willing to hold their noses and say ‘We’ll take that gas.’”

Still, potential LNG concessions may only go so far for the Trump administration.

Reed Blakemore, director of research and programs at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, said the trade talks are likely to focus on “old-school trade balances” focused on manufactured and agricultural goods.

“Whether or not LNG plays a fulcrum role in the execution of those trade deals, I’m a little bit circumspect about,” he said. “However, it’s certainly in the ‘nice to have’ category, as far as offering an olive branch to the administration.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/af/0d/dfc9b06746b8a54760c7f7e31861/trump-86997.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 07:02:55.360276

In neighboring Oklahoma, the Biden administration had in November approved hazard mitigation funding for wildfires and straight-line winds.
President Trump issued a disaster declaration on the last day of the weeklong emergency — but denied hazard mitigation funding.
Experts say cutting off hazard mitigation funds after floods marks a major shift in federal priorities.
That return is even greater for flood mitigation, where the CBO found every dollar spent yields $5 to $8 in avoided damages.","The Trump administration appears to be drastically reducing the federal funds it offers to help states head off future natural disasters, a decision that could come under fire as the White House faces scrutiny over its response to Texas’s deadly flooding.

The administration has responded to criticism of its handling of the Texas floods with claims that it is “remaking” the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to better help states.

But after the deadly Independence Day floods, the administration declined to provide Texas with access to a tranche of FEMA funds aimed at heading off the next disaster — money intended to pay for things such as warning systems, tornado shelters and anti-flood measures.

A review of federal documents by The Hill shows that the administration denied such “hazard mitigation” funds to states after 16 out of 18 flood disasters during the Trump presidency, with both of the approvals coming before mid-March.

In May, children in a Missouri elementary school sheltered from a tornado that shattered windows and ripped gutters off the building inside a safe room purchased with hazard mitigation money issued after the deadly 2011 Joplin tornado.

Though the Trump administration approved Missouri’s disaster declaration, it refused the hazard mitigation funds the state requested to buy generators and more outdoor warning sirens, state officials told The Hill. Missouri is appealing that decision.

In neighboring Oklahoma, the Biden administration had in November approved hazard mitigation funding for wildfires and straight-line winds.

But even as those funds went out, more wildfires, driven by straight-line winds, were raging across the Sooner State. President Trump issued a disaster declaration on the last day of the weeklong emergency — but denied hazard mitigation funding.

It was the first time in at least 15 years that Oklahoma wasn’t approved for requested hazard mitigation, according to state emergency management officials.

This pivot — which breaks longstanding federal precedent — comes amid steep Trump cuts to FEMA, which he has also talked about eliminating entirely, as well as cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the federal forecasting and research apparatus.

Veterans of these agencies told The Hill there has been appetite for reform and arguments made for shifting more responsibility to the states.

“But this is like, ‘You need an appendectomy? Well, let’s get the garden shears,’” said Candace Valenzuela, former HUD director for the region that includes Texas.

Experts say cutting off hazard mitigation funds after floods marks a major shift in federal priorities.

FEMA has traditionally given states 15 to 20 percent of the disaster response budget to help prevent future catastrophes — spending the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found pays for itself by at least $2 saved for every $1 invested.

That return is even greater for flood mitigation, where the CBO found every dollar spent yields $5 to $8 in avoided damages.

And that benefit is growing. Over the past decade, floods have cost the U.S. an average of $46 billion a year — or $135 annually per American — a figure expected to rise to as much as $60 billion by midcentury as the atmosphere warms and holds more moisture.

A wetter atmosphere, in turn, means more extreme rainfall such as the deluge that hit Central Texas earlier this month.

Former meteorologist and National Weather Service (NWS) union legislative director John Sokich said he’s seen more such downpours “in the last 10 years than I saw in my 35 years before that.”

Those worsening events make proactive spending even more effective, said Chad Berginnis, head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM).

“If you have more and more extreme events in the area you’ve mitigated, your benefits come faster,” Berginnis said.

The administration has also frozen a major flood mitigation program and clawed back funds from flood control projects nationwide that were already underway.

Last week, a coalition of 20 blue and purple states sued the federal government over the clawback of funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which began under the first Trump administration.

Money pulled from BRIC included funds that would have paid for an Oklahoma flood warning system, a North Texas flood control dam and $1 billion in flood control projects across the Chesapeake Bay.

“The impact of the shutdown has been devastating,” the states wrote in their suit. “Communities across the country are being forced to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects,” many of which had cost millions and had taken years to plan and permit.

“In the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters,” the suit added.

The states also argued the pullback was illegal since Congress made forward-looking mitigation one of FEMA’s core responsibilities in 1997.

The administration did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the shift in FEMA strategy.

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said the administration is “leading a historic, first-of-its-kind approach to disaster funding.”

That approach, she said, means “providing upfront recovery support — moving money faster than ever and jump starting recovery,” while pivoting away from “bloated, D.C.-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force” that shifts responsibility to the states.

But emergency managers say the administration is cutting off vital resources that states and municipalities need to avoid financial ruin from worsening disasters.

“Mitigation is a lifeline,” Berginnis said. “It’s a way out of a really bad cycle of disaster, damage, repair, damage that a lot of folks of modest means really can’t escape.”

As a state emergency manager in Ohio, he said he saw FEMA hazard mitigation funding change lives by allowing the state to buy out flood-prone properties.

By contrast, FEMA’s “individual assistance” programs, which the administration continues to offer, only cover structural repairs, often for homes likely to flood again.

“When I presented a check to buy out his property, the owner said, ‘This is the only chance for me and my family to get our lives back to normal,’” Berginnis recalled.

In addition to dramatically cutting back funds to help states and municipalities prepare for the next flood, the administration also quietly changed FEMA standards to make it easier to build in floodplains.

One thing amplifying flood danger in the United States is that the nation’s builders, insurers and emergency managers often don’t even know how bad the flood risk is because it has never been assessed for most of the country’s creeks and streams.

The deadly July 4 flooding that swept away more than two dozen children and counselors from Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, for example, came when Cypress Creek burst its banks. That risk was obscured, Berginnis noted, because like two-thirds of similar waterways around the country, its floodways have never been mapped.

ASFPM has estimated that a complete re-mapping project would cost about $3 billion to $12 billion — just 3 to 25 percent the annual cost of flood repair, which they say that mapping would reduce. Once that project was done, they estimated, keeping it up to date would cost $100 million to $500 million per year, or between 0.2 and 1 percent of current annual spending on flood damages.

This is not money that the current administration seems eager to spend, however. Instead, it is moving away from spending on forecasting or research — including into how to best warn communities when deadly threats are coming their way.

DOGE cuts have disrupted a NWS reorganization meant to centralize operations so field offices could spend more time helping local emergency managers interpret often-ambiguous forecasts, agency veterans said.

That program had aimed to address the challenge that emergencies like the one in Kerr County are low-likelihood but high-impact, which can breed complacency until it’s too late.

Rather than pivot, NWS is “trying to keep its head above water,” said Alan Gerard, a former NOAA warnings expert who took a buyout this year. He warned that other cuts threaten research to understand the novel weather patterns of a hotter planet — research that could one day give communities like Kerr County six hours’ warning before fast-moving storms.

“That stuff is still years away — both from the physical science aspect, and the social science of helping people understand it,” he said. If the Trump cuts go through, he said, “that would all stop.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/TexasFloodSearch_071025_APPhotoGeraldHerbert.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 12:08:56.940120

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state.","After a proposed provision in the recent Republican tax break and spending cut law that would have opened up millions of acres of federal lands for sale was axed, Colorado climate leaders and public lands advocates still didn’t have much to celebrate.

That’s because the massive federal policy bill‘s surviving provisions governing oil and gas leasing on federal lands are “an egregious step back for the environment,” according to Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

The law makes it easier to lease federal lands in several Western states for oil and gas extraction. It also limits the ways by which this land can be regulated and lowers the royalty rate that oil and gas companies must pay the government, among other related provisions.

“This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it’s hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure,” Hornbein said. “It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.”

The law, achieved through the reconciliation process in Congress and signed July 4 by President Donald Trump, who calls it the “big, beautiful bill,” mandates that the secretary of the Interior Department make federal lands available for oil and gas leasing on, at minimum, a quarterly basis in nine states, including Colorado. The available lands are governed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.

Those agencies handle swaths of public lands that are typically multiuse. On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest. The lands are also often used for commercial purposes, including by tourism and recreation companies, and for resource extraction. The state is home to 24 million acres of federal land.

By prioritizing oil and gas leasing above other uses for certain lands, the law “hurts everybody but the extractive industries,” said Colorado Springs resident and outdoorsman David Lien.

Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.

“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said. “To use a hunting term, I’d say the reconciliation bill passed by Congress has gutted public lands, in respect to extractive industries.”

The Bureau of Land Management declined an interview request for this article.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a statement on Tuesday. “This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The Department is proud to implement President Trump’s agenda and get the federal government back to working for the American people.”

Limited regulation

Federal lands used for oil and gas leasing are regulated by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management through a variety of means, including resource management plans, which are long-term land-use blueprints.

Prior to the signing of the GOP reconciliation bill, these plans served as a starting point for regulation, not a finish line. But the law has made it so the government “may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval included in the resource management plans” for oil and gas leases, according to a Bureau of Land Management statement.

Allison Henderson, the southern Rockies director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this provision poses a “significant risk” to the environment, water supplies and vulnerable species of animals that live on public lands, because resource management plans “do not provide kind of the nitty-gritty, site-specific types of mitigation measures that are necessary.”

Resource management plans are typically updated every 10 to 20 years, and a single plan can often cover a wide region spanning hundreds of thousands of acres. Henderson said this makes the plans not adaptive or area-specific enough to be adequate as the exclusive means for environmental regulation of oil and gas leases on federal lands.

“The RMPs are doing these broad, kind of general covers of big picture stuff,” Henderson said. “So this provision really seems to be like it’s trying to prevent anything more protective from going forward, which means that a lot will fall through the cracks.”

Lower royalty rate

Beyond its anticipated adverse effects on the climate, the law also decreases the revenue that states and the federal government bring in from leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction.

When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government. The GOP law sets the royalty rate for new onshore oil and gas leases at 12.5%, which is below market rate and significantly lower than the Biden-era royalty rate of 16.67%. This change means the government is expected to earn billions of dollars less in royalties over the next decade.

Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state. In 2024, oil and gas lease royalties for onshore federal land in Colorado totaled $131 million, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior natural resource revenue database.

“In addition to being a significant attack on public lands, this is also going to be causing us to lose billions of dollars in royalties, and then who knows what the ultimate billion dollars of cost it’ll be as a result of the climate emissions that are going to end up happening because of these leases,” Henderson said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/060923_oilgas_garfieldco_019-1024x6831753437769.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=2qI93yOP,N,,2025-07-25 08:01:09.913797

Low-Energy Fridays: Why is coal power struggling in the United States?

Coal power drives a lot of political discussion, and notably, the Trump administration and Congress seem focused on cutting regulations and increasing subsidies to the coal industry. Ignoring the policy merits and demerits of those ideas, a more fundamental question is: Why is coal declining in the United States?

From the perspective of many politicians, if not for the “war on coal”—in which they argue Democrats are using government power to cudgel the coal industry—it would still be the country’s dominant power source. But good policy analysts should not be taken in by political rhetoric. A more grounded empirical approach to the question reveals a big disconnect between the politics and the markets.

Coal used to be the primary source of electric power generation in the United States, producing just over 2,000 terawatt hours at its peak in 2007. From 2001 to 2008, coal provided roughly half of all electricity in the nation. Its share of power generation began to fall rapidly starting in 2009.

The coal industry and politicians explain this by claiming President Barack Obama’s “war on coal” and its punishing regulations made coal uncompetitive compared to politically favored industry. But if that were true, why didn’t coal rebound after Obama left office, or after those regulations were defeated in court? The problem with the political argument is that if coal really were a cheap but profitable source of energy impeded only by regulations, then we would expect to see investors risking capital on a potential future payday by investing in it—but that’s not happening. Nobody is building new coal plants in the United States. So, what else could explain coal’s decline?

Looking at other factors in the electric power sector, it’s clear that coal’s decline aligns with the increased utilization of other fuels—most notably, natural gas. While coal’s share of electricity generation decreased from 54 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2024, natural gas’ share increased from 18 percent to 43 percent over the same period. In other words, coal lost 39 percent of the market while natural gas picked up 25 percent. Additionally, wind and solar picked up 17 percent of the market while nuclear and hydropower together lost about 4 percent. In other words, coal shrank—and most of that market was replaced by natural gas, along with renewables.

While someone might point to renewable energy subsidies as a major contributor to coal’s woes, the comparison with natural gas is more revealing. Natural gas has not benefited from the same sort of subsidy treatment in the market as renewable energy, and as a thermal resource, it’s a more direct substitute for coal than renewables. It’s no accident that the increase in natural gas generation coincides with falling natural gas prices (thanks to directional drilling). Since 2008, natural gas prices have fallen by about 69 percent. Meanwhile, coal hasn’t gotten any cheaper—in fact, it’s increased in cost by 16 percent since 2008. Add in the fact that the thermal efficiency of natural gas power plants is also improving, and we get a clear explanation for why investors are shifting away from coal.

Stripping away the politics, the data tells an economics tale as old as time: the story of creative destruction. This is the idea that incumbent products give way to newer ones that are cheaper or better. We’re all familiar with this concept in our everyday lives—we see cars on the road instead of horses, and we use computer keyboards instead of typewriters. Creative destruction is a resisted economic force because a visible industry in decline is impacted while a hypothetical future economic benefit is harder for policymakers to see. But letting the market do its thing always leads to creative destruction, and it is through this process that we grow economically. Quite simply, this is how we improve productivity, grow the economy, and improve quality of life.

So, is there a war on coal? I don’t want to dismiss the impact of regulations out of hand; increased regulatory costs do burden industry and the economy as a whole. Some of Obama’s regulations on the coal industry were particularly egregious examples of illegal government overreach, notably the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. But the simple observation that customers prefer coal’s competitors over coal itself is a more reasonable explanation than the idea that profit-motivated investors are somehow missing big opportunities in coal.

I won’t get too deep in the weeds on some of the recent coal-related policy changes, such as the reconciliation bill’s cutting of royalty rates or its new eligibility for subsidy under the Defense Production Act. But an empirical approach shows that coal’s decline is a result of natural market forces that replace older, less efficient ways of doing things with newer, better ones. This means that attempts to use government interventions to prop up coal power under a misguided notion of leveling the playing field will distort markets and weaken growth.

Just as last week’s Low-Energy Fridays explained that subsidies for mature technologies like wind and solar are economically damaging, so too are subsidies for coal power.

⁠
The Details: The 2009 determination that climate change and greenhouse gases pose a danger to the public is the foundation for myriad environmental regulations under the Clean Air Act , including regulations on vehicle tailpipe emissions, coal- and gas-fired power plants, and methane released by the oil and gas industry.⁠
⁠
Key Quotes: ""By overhauling massive rules on the endangerment finding, we are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion and ushering in America's Golden Age.""” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.⁠
⁠
How the Media Covered It: NPR (Lean Left bias) included the context that this potential repeal “comes in the wake of the hottest year humans have ever recorded on Earth, climate-fueled wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes in Los Angeles and hotter ocean temperatures that made Hurricane Helene stronger.” The Hill (Center) added that this move comes “despite a consensus from the scientific community that human activity, especially its use of fossil fuels, is heating up the planet.” Blaze Media (Right) included comments from critics, such as climate change groups, as well as perspectives from Trump administration officials who support the proposal. Blaze Media quoted Energy Secretary Christ Wright saying, “The 2009 endangerment finding has had an enormously negative impact on the lives of the American people.”⁠

The Lanzador, Lamborghini's electric 2+2, was recently delayed to 2029.

It's one of many brands postponing electrification plans amid slower demand.

Add Lamborghini to the list of car companies that are postponing electric vehicles due to slower-than-expected demand.

Well, add it to the list again. Last year, Lambo said its first electric model, the Lanzador, would arrive in 2029, one year later than initially planned. And this week, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann told the Australian outlet CarExpert that the EV may actually wind up being a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) instead.

Amid the ""flattening"" acceptance curve of EVs worldwide, Winkelmann said the company is still deciding whether its next model will be a full EV or a PHEV.

“We have to decide whether we go one way or the other very soon,"" the CEO told CarExpert.

The move underscores the rockier moment for EVs that automakers are grappling with right now—and the specific challenge of being a supercar company in an electrifying market.

The Lanzador, unveiled in concept form in 2023, is a 2+2 vehicle intended to be the tip of the spear for Lamborghini's electrification efforts. Lamborghini had also planned for the replacement for the Urus SUV to be an EV. But now that SUV will be a plug-in hybrid, Winkelmann said earlier this month.

While it's still pushing to hybridize its lineup, Lamborghini has made it clear that it's trying to hang on to gasoline engines as long as possible—because that's what people expect from its supercars.

The company is holding out hope that synthetic fuels could allow its loud, visceral engines to live on. And Winkelmann has said it's primarily emissions regulations around the world that are pushing it to invest in electric models. Notably, its initial electrification plans, which are now up in the air, focused on larger vehicles—not two-seat supercars.

During this rougher patch for EV growth, several companies have rejiggered their electrification plans. Ford canceled an upcoming three-row EV, Nissan nixed a pair of electric sedans and Honda reportedly eliminated some electric SUVs from its roadmap.

The company is partnering with Carlton Power and HYRO – the latter being a joint venture between Octopus Energy Generation and RES – to invest over £125 million (US$168.9 million) into green hydrogen infrastructure at Kimberly-Clark’s UK manufacturing sites in Kent and Cumbria.

The use of green hydrogen, generated via electrolysis using renewable energy sources, will replace natural gas used for steam generation at the sites. The initiative is a key component in Kimberly-Clark’s strategy to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions by over 80% in the UK by 2027 versus a 2015 baseline.

Combined, the Northfleet and Barrow-in-Furness sites currently produce nearly one billion Andrex toilet rolls and over 150 million boxes of Kleenex tissues a year, with the new investment expected to enable a 50% reduction versus Kimberly-Clark’s 2024 natural gas consumption across its UK production lines from 2027.

The two long-term offtaker hydrogen supply agreements will result in a green hydrogen facility being installed next to the Barrow plant, while a separate facility will be built on the Northfleet plant.

Dan Howell, Vice President and Managing Director at Kimberly-Clark UK & Ireland, said:

“Now is the right time for us to tap into [green] hydrogen’s significant potential, improving energy supply and our decarbonisation needs. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale.”

Kimberly-Clark has estimated that the Barrow project will deliver 100 GWh of green hydrogen annually, while the Northfleet facility will supply 47 GWh. Combined, the projects are projected to reduce carbon emissions by 28,500 tonnes per year.

Both projects were selected under the UK Government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round One (HAR1), receiving support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model and Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. Planning approval has been secured for each facility, with Barrow receiving consent in June 2023 and Northfleet in August 2024.

Sarah Jones, UK Minister for Industry, said:

“This government is rolling out hydrogen out at scale for the first time, with ten of the first projects now shovel-ready to start powering businesses with clean, homegrown energy from Teesside to Devon. Hydrogen will help us cut industrial emissions and support Britain’s industrial renewal by creating thousands of jobs in our industrial heartlands as part of the Plan for Change.”

This milestone builds on Kimberly-Clark’s broader sustainability efforts, including a 2023 power purchase agreement tied to a £75 million onshore wind farm in Scotland. The company remains committed to halving its global Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and continues to expand its renewable energy portfolio across Europe and Africa.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kimberly-Clarck-Andrex.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 09:00:33.228150

In response to recent policy changes and market demands, the company to focus on ESS business in North America and optimizing its product, technology portfolios

SEOUL, South Korea, July 24, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220) today announced its second-quarter earnings for 2025, posting a quarterly operating profit even without North American production incentive, mainly through product mix improvements and continued efforts to improve cost efficiency.

The company posted consolidated revenue of KRW 5.6 trillion, an 11.2 percent decrease quarter-on-quarter. The operating profit was KRW 492.2 billion, marking a 31.4 percent increase quarter-on-quarter, with operating profit margin of 8.8 percent. The operating profit includes North American production incentive, which is estimated at KRW 490.8 billion.

""In the second quarter, we secured stable EV battery sales and also started production at our new ESS battery facility in North America,"" said Chang Sil Lee, CFO of LG Energy Solution. ""However, constrained customer purchase sentiment, coupled with the reflection of metal price decline to our average selling price (ASP) affected our quarterly revenue.""

Lee added, ""At the same time, we saw improvements in our product mix thanks to increased production in North America, along with enhanced cost efficiency and favorable material cost ratio, all of which contributed to the quarterly operating profit even when excluding North American production incentive.""

At the earnings conference, LG Energy Solution outlined its market outlook and strategic action plans for the second-half of the year. Following tariff and policy changes in the U.S., Europe, the U.K. and the associated cost pressure on major automakers, the company anticipates a short-term slowdown in EV demand. At the same time, it expects advancements in autonomous driving technology to drive mid-to long-term growth momentum.

The company projects increased demand in the energy storage system (ESS) market, capitalizing on new business opportunities from both existing and new renewable energy plants and AI data centers. It also predicts that the IRA Investment Tax Credit (ITC) will present more opportunities by incentivizing a shift in the supply chain toward non-Chinese battery suppliers.

In terms of market competition, the company expects recent policy changes to strengthen barriers against Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE) entering the U.S. battery market, thereby reinforcing the advantage for battery companies that have already secured local production capabilities and stable operational competencies.

Taking these transitions into account, LG Energy Solution now aims to build on its second-quarter accomplishments and maintain its growth momentum. In the second quarter, the company focused on establishing local ESS battery production, which recently came to fruition with the start of production at its first North American ESS battery manufacturing hub in Michigan. By proactively adjusting its capacity expansion plans, the company now aims to expand its annual production capacity for ESS batteries to 17GWh by the end of this year.

In terms of operation, LG Energy Solution will first maximize the utilization of its existing production capacity by focusing on ESS batteries and new form factors and chemistries. Also, it will reduce fixed costs by adjusting and scaling down investment plans while securing competitiveness in the supply chain and sourcing.

In terms of its business portfolio, the company will continue to expand its ESS business in North America and secure over 30GWh of annual production capacity in the region by the end of 2026. In Europe, it will start mass producing mid- to low-end batteries such as high-voltage mid-nickel and LFP batteries at its Poland facility in the second-half of the year.

In terms of technological advancement, LG Energy Solution plans to enhance its mid- to low-end product portfolio with EV/ESS LFP batteries and EV LMR (lithium manganese-rich) batteries, while also advancing product competitiveness—including energy density—through innovative technologies. The company will also launch EV batteries with the charging speed of less than 10 minutes by 2028. For dry electrodes, a key driver for cost innovation, the company will evaluate the production feasibility within this year and establish sample production system at its facility in Ochang, Korea.

Why is AI energy demand concerning?
Data centers bunch up in certain areas, creating hotspots that overload local grids.
When power companies add new equipment, they often stick those costs on your monthly bill.","The rise of artificial intelligence could double the demand for electricity by 2030, according to EnergySage.

What's happening?

Computer data centers that run AI systems , such as ChatGPT are expected to increase their power consumption by 130% before the end of this decade. These facilities have already increased their electricity consumption by 12% each year since 2015.

Power companies are planning to build new plants that use natural gas, solar energy, and wind energy. However, the reconciliation bill now moving through the Senate could eliminate the clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits incentivize these companies to opt for these forms of clean energy.

""The need for clean energy extends far beyond data centers,"" says Daniel Bresette, president of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

""Even without taking into account climate or environmental concerns, which are significant and urgent, the U.S. energy sector has been on a clean-cleaner-cleanest trajectory powered by the cost-competitiveness of renewable energy.""

Why is AI energy demand concerning?

This power surge could hit your wallet if new policies slow down renewable energy progress, as training AI requires huge amounts of computing power. By 2030, our country may consume more electricity for data processing than for producing all our aluminum, steel, and cement products combined.

Data centers bunch up in certain areas, creating hotspots that overload local grids. When power companies add new equipment, they often stick those costs on your monthly bill.

Solar power helps keep these costs down. Without renewable energy growth, your electric bills could rise sharply.

Installing an induction stove is an effective way to reduce your home's energy use while avoiding the dangers associated with gas stoves. Thanks to the existing Inflation Reduction Act, you can get up to $840 off an induction range. These stoves cook faster and cost less to run than your current stove.

If you rent or can't afford a kitchen renovation, plug-in countertop induction burners may not qualify for a rebate, but they are a great option in the vein of a hot plate and start at just $50.

What's being done about AI energy demand?

Many tech companies are buying renewable energy through special contracts. Some are building data centers right next to solar farms.

You can help, too. If you're concerned about how local or pending AI development might impact your electricity expenses, get in touch with your representatives.

Taking advantage of available incentives soon could save you hundreds, as President Trump has said he wants to eliminate these subsidies to reduce federal spending.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

53 percent of disabled drivers report at least some difficulty with rapid (up to 50kW) chargers, compared to 10 percent of other drivers.
“The UK’s EV rollout is a major success story” said Vicky Edmonds, Chief Executive of EVA England.
Heavy charging cables make public EV charging difficult or impossible for many.
“From our own research, we know that heavy charging cables are one of the key barriers to accessible public charging, and this new report from EVA England highlights how significant an issue this is.","The report, based on a national survey of EV drivers in 2025, shows that more than half (51 percent) of drivers with disabilities find heavier ultra-rapid EV charging cables hard or extremely hard to use. Even at slower charging speeds, significant numbers of disabled drivers report difficulties that limit their ability to travel independently.

Key findings from the report include:

Over half of disabled drivers struggle with ultra-rapid (defined here as up to 350kW) charger cables, compared to just 21 percent of other drivers.

53 percent of disabled drivers report at least some difficulty with rapid (up to 50kW) chargers, compared to 10 percent of other drivers.

Even at slower speeds, around 28 percent of disabled drivers experience difficulties using fast chargers of up to 22 kW.

“The UK’s EV rollout is a major success story” said Vicky Edmonds, Chief Executive of EVA England. “But for over a million drivers with disabilities, it risks becoming one of exclusion. Heavy charging cables make public EV charging difficult or impossible for many. If we don’t prioritise accessibility now, we’re locking millions of people out of electric driving for years, possibly even decades. That is why this report is so important – it will feed into important work with Government and industry to ensure accessibility standards truly reflect everyday drivers’ needs. But we can do more. A few targeted changes to the Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently making its way through Parliament, for instance, could provide the additional guarantees drivers with disabilities urgently need. I would urge Parliamentarians to take this unique opportunity to act now. This Report, more broadly, is a vital reminder that accessibility isn’t optional, it’s essential.”

The Planning and Infrastructure Bill, currently at Committee Stage in the House of Lords, is proposing changes to speed up new chargepoint installations by granting installers access to a much simpler and cost-effective permit system to carry out essential street works - similar to major telecoms and energy providers.

A coalition of EV-focused organisations including EVA England and the Motability Foundation are proposing a small amendment to the Bill that would provide Government with the necessary powers to enforce accessibility requirements in the future if needed. This amendment was tabled in the House of Commons by Sir Jeremy Wright MP, but not accepted by the Government at that stage.

Despite rapid progress in EV infrastructure - with over 80,000 public charge points now available across the UK - just 2.3 percent are currently considered accessible to disabled users. By 2035, around 1.35 million disabled people are expected to rely on public charging.

Survey participants described physical strain, risk of falling, and needing to ask strangers for help when using charging cables.

“Several times I’ve almost overbalanced with weight of the cable” said one respondent. “I needed to ask for help a few weeks ago at a services.”

“My wife is disabled and could currently not manage any rapid or ultra-rapid cables at all” added another.

The current accessibility concerns are widespread, and 2022 saw the publication of the PAS 1899 standard – the Government-backed EV chargepoint accessibility guidelines providing a minimum standard for compliance with common accessibility requirements.

However, compliance with PAS 1899 is voluntary, and few chargepoints are currently considered fully compliant. The Government is working with EV sector stakeholders, including EVA England, to review and update the standard and publish new guidance to make sure that all drivers, regardless of their ability, can use public charging infrastructure. Today’s Cable Weight Survey Report will feed into that process.

“There is a serious risk of disabled people being left behind in the rollout of public EV chargepoints, an issue which we have been raising at the Motability Foundation for a number of years” added Nigel Fletcher, Chief Executive of the Motability Foundation. “From our own research, we know that heavy charging cables are one of the key barriers to accessible public charging, and this new report from EVA England highlights how significant an issue this is. The findings will feed into the review of the PAS 1899 standard that we are currently working on alongside the Government.”

The United States District Court of the Northern District of New York ruled that New York has the power to enact the All-Electric Building Act, which mandates significant changes to New York’s building codes. By December 31, 2025, the codes must require that most new buildings in New York that are seven stories or shorter be built to use zero-emission electric heat and appliances. With a few exemptions, beginning on January 1, 2029, all new buildings will be subject to be fossil-fuel combustion-free as well.

This March, similarly, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed legal challenges to New York City’s 2021 Local Law 154. The NYC law places pollution emission limits in new construction and requires the use of zero-emission appliances, leading the way to all-electric buildings.

In 2023, the All-Electric Building Act (AEBA), adopted as part of the Fiscal Year 2024 New York State Budget marking investments in energy affordability, sustainable buildings, and clean energy development. In New York State, buildings account for more than 30% of state greenhouse gas emissions. The AEBA adoption made New York the first-in-the-nation to advance comprehensive legislation for constructing modern zero-emission new homes and buildings with targets to reduce consumer rising energy costs, create healthier living and working environments, and add thousands of local clean energy and energy efficiency jobs. Following the landmark adoption of the AEBA, gas corporations and others with business interests in fossil fuels filed a challenge aiming to thwart the will of the NYS Legislature and restrict New York s ability to meet its climate goals by cutting fossil fuel emissions.

This decision follows another recent victory in California where a federal judge upheld Southern California’s landmark rule to advance zero-emissions boilers. Last year, a coalition of industry groups claimed the rule was preempted by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), seeking to extend a previous Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that preempted a City of Berkeley building electrification ordinance to emissions standards. Fortunately, the district court judge provided clarity that the Berkeley decision was narrow in scope, and that EPCA applies to building codes that concern energy use — not emissions standards.

“As an Intervenor Defendant of New York’s All-Electric Building Act (AEBA), the New York Geothermal Energy Organization (NY-GEO) is pleased with the Court’s decision to uphold the legal validity of the AEBA. We anticipate that New Yorkers will soon experience the comfort, safety, and energy savings that come with fossil-free new homes as the AEBA goes into effect. We extend our sincere gratitude to Earthjustice for their important work as counsel for both NY-GEO and PUSH Buffalo in this case,” said Christine Hoffer, Executive Director, NY-GEO.

“The fossil fuel industry was sent a powerful message by the court in this case — the health, well-being, affordability, and prosperity of our communities matters more than the industry’s profits and the hollowness of its fear mongering. The AEBA remains a powerful victory in the fight for our lives. We look forward to working with partners and stakeholders to ensure it’s implemented in the most equitable ways possible,” said Dawn Wells-Clyburn, Executive Director of PUSH Buffalo.

“The court saw right through the gas industry’s efforts to force New Yorkers to use its unhealthy and unsustainable products. This decision shows once again that cities and states have the power to protect their residents from air pollution and to take meaningful action against climate change,” said Meagan Burton, Senior Attorney at Earthjustice.

Earthjustice intervened in the 2024 case representing the New York Geothermal Energy Organization (NY-GEO) and People United for Sustainable Housing (PUSH) Buffalo, arguing alongside the New York Attorney General Leticia James who filed initially.

With examples from the NYS, NYC, and California cases, it’s clear that fossil fuel interests are willing to ignore consumer energy bill affordability and public health progress to continue pushing for their own major profits. These laws remain valid and can now move forward.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-07-25 07:00:52.807527

Clean energy dominates fossil projects like it would almost undoubtedly advantage clean energy over fossil.","For a long time in climate politics, the question has been: What path do we need to be on to avert absolute catastrophe? And are we on it — or do we have any chance of being on it? The big win here, in the past couple of years in America, was the Inflation Reduction Act. $370 billion — the largest renewable energy investment ever — to build the infrastructure of decarbonization. To build solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and so much more. Was it as much as climate advocates hoped? No. Was it more than we’ve ever done before? Yeah, by a lot. And now it has been gutted in the “big, beautiful bill.” I don’t want windmills destroying our place. I don’t want these solar things, where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain that are ugly as hell. So what path are we on now? And what does climate politics need to learn from this loss? Are we just courting catastrophe? Or do we actually still have a shot? To try and help me answer these questions, I wanted to have on two people who were involved not just in the Inflation Reduction Act, not just in the lobbying effort against the “big beautiful bill,” but who are doing really important work on both the modeling and the politics side to try to figure out where the climate movement goes from here. Jesse Jenkins is a professor at Princeton. He leads the ZERO lab on campus. And with his teams, he has been one of the leading climate modelers trying to figure out how much these policies will actually do. Jane Flegal is the executive director of Blue Horizons Foundation, and she was a member of the Biden administration’s climate policy team. As always, my email: ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, welcome to the show. Thanks Good to be back. Thanks for having us. So, Jane, you worked on the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments incentives as part of the Biden administration. So I think the place to begin is: What were the most important parts of that bill from your perspective? So as far as climate is concerned, I think there are two broad buckets of interventions that the Inflation Reduction Act made. One was the tax policy of that bill. There was a technology neutral clean electricity tax credit, both for production and investment in clean energy technologies that was extended basically into perpetuity until, well, for a long time. But what was unique about that was historically, we had had these fits and starts of very short term tax credit incentives for solar and wind that kept expiring and then coming back up for renewal. And we’d have a legislative fight of should they be extended or not. Which is that kind of uncertainty is not an environment in which private capital can make smart decisions about investing in energy technologies. So the IRA, really rationalized the clean energy tax credit scheme by making it technology neutral. So it’s not just solar and wind, it’s any zero emissions technology from solar to wind to geothermal to nuclear could qualify. There was also tax subsidies for purchase of electric vehicles, which accounted for very significant chunk of emissions reductions for advanced manufacturing. So building factories in the United States, states to build the component parts that make up these clean energy technologies. So a series of subsidies essentially for investment and production in clean energy technologies. That was thing one. And thing two was a series of grant programs which are in some ways the charismatic, charismatic megafauna of the bill because it’s like, discrete grants going to discrete projects all across the country, not vague tax interventions that are unleashing it could be an example of this charismatic, charismatic megafauna. There are. There was a grant program called the greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund at EPA that funded really incredible install solar panels on the roof of a school in a disadvantaged community, which is like a great thing to do for lots of reasons. But if you compare the emissions impact of even the sum total of all of those grant projects to what we anticipate the emissions impact of subsidizing solar power for the private sector to deploy at scale, it’s basically it’s not even close. The tax subsidies do way more to bend the curve on emissions reductions. So, Jesse, you did a ton of modeling on the Inflation Reduction Act. So what were the targets we were trying to hit and where were we. In terms of whether we were on pace to hit them prior to the B.B.B.? Yeah, I mean, the basic target we’re trying to hit is to get our greenhouse gas emissions to the point where whatever we’re emitting is being canceled out by some kind of removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or other greenhouse gases. That’s the net zero target. President Biden set that target as 2050 to get to net zero, and then set an interim target of cutting emissions to half of our peak levels by 2030. Our estimates were that from the repeat project, which I run, were that the Inflation Reduction Act, the infrastructure law that passed under the Biden administration and then the set of regulatory policies that they also implemented collectively would have gotten us about half of the way. So it was kind of two steps forward. Now we’re taking a big step back. But we should have been taking four steps forward if we were on track for those kinds of targets. So I want to slow this down. So we were so the Inflation Reduction Act on paper would have gotten us halfway to Joe Biden’s goal, the Inflation Reduction Act and the other set of bills, the kind of full total of policies Biden would have gotten us halfway to Biden’s goal. So then we were actually implementing this. What matters is not the words on the page, but are you actually building solar panels. Are you building wind turbines? How is deployment implementation going. You’ve been tracking this. So for solar it’s been going solar and batteries have been smashing new records each year since the IRA passed. And so that’s going as intended. Wind power is continuing to struggle to get back even to record levels that it reached in circa 2020, when we built about gigawatts a year of wind. That’s enough for, I don’t about 10 million households, I guess, per year. We are only building about six or gigawatts a year now, so like half of that level, we have been making pretty good progress on electric vehicle adoption. And there we have seen a pretty substantial degree of market transformation. When the IRA passed, it was basically just Tesla. That was it. Now we have a pretty competitive broad set of entries, dozens of different vehicles on the market. Some of those have now reached a point where they’re at least profitable on paper. Like GM. That’s a key threshold to get to. And I think just the societal penetration of EVs is at a much higher level. Now we’re probably everybody knows somebody that has an electric vehicle or has seen them driving around. And I think there’s a long term indelible impact of that degree of penetration. So those are going relatively close to on track basically with what we were modeling. I think EVs are a little bit slower than intended, partly because Tesla has become a bit controversial. And it’s not selling as many as they intended. What happened there. Yeah and then wind has been falling behind while solar kind of picks up a bit of that Slack. All right. So that’s where we were prior ish to the election. Yeah Donald Trump wins the election. In great news for climate. He becomes very close with Elon Musk who runs an electric vehicle company. So green shoots there. You get the big beautiful bill. What does that do to that set of programs. What is gone. What is left and what new problems have emerged. So And Jesse, you should jump in here because he’s in the weeds probably more than anyone I know. But the most significant damage in that bill for clean energy was to solar and wind, specifically, where they were the Republicans. The Republicans were quite punitive, actually, really shortened the timeline for solar and wind. Anyone who’s tried to build a large scale piece of energy infrastructure will tell you the work and time to get even to commence construction takes years. I mean, it’s a very long process. So that’s what it means is that tax incentive is no longer sending a long term signal to the market that there will be incentives for them to build. Instead, we have this mad rush. So we’ve just decided to as best we can, wreck the solar and wind industries going forward. I mean, they even tried to go beyond that with the initial Senate draft, adding a new tax on wind and solar. Excise tax a tax on not just ending the Tax Cuts that basically lowered the cost of wind and solar by somewhere between 30 percent and percent. So we’ve just raised taxes percent on wind and solar, our biggest forms of New electricity generation. They actually proposed an excise tax on top of that to further penalize wind and solar beyond 2027. That bit was at least removed at the last minute, but you can see there was a very strong and concerted effort from a kind of ideological contingent of the Republican Party that ran into a bit of a more pragmatic contingent of the party that was like, hey, wait a minute. We electricity demand is growing rapidly. These technologies are contributing to our supply. They’re keeping energy costs low. They’re driving investment in our districts. We don’t want to cut this off immediately. Over 20 house members, half a dozen senators standing up to defend tax credits implemented in a partisan, Democrat only budget bill, vocally and repeatedly, multiple letters of the president telling them not to do that. And so I do think there are factions at play here. And unfortunately the ideological contingent won out there. What is Jane. The ideological contingent. I know you were involved in the mobilization around defeating the added tax on wind and solar. What was even the argument for taxing wind and solar specifically. Yeah We will cut taxes on corporations, but specifically fossil fuel subsidies. But specifically, if you want to build wind turbines or lay down solar panels, you face a new tax. The people arguing for that, how did they even how did they try to justify it. O.K let me I think one thing that I have learned throughout this process is that climate politics is inseparable from all of our other politics. So going back to the election, I think part of what happened here was we passed the IRA on a purely Democratic. It was a Democrat only bill. So we live in a world now that you’re quite familiar with where when that happens you there is a tendency to turn up the polarization on whatever is in whatever is in the demo. Bill, right on with the other side of the aisle. So I do think this bill was framed as Biden’s signature climate achievement. It’s not in some way surprising that the Republicans wanted to tear it down. Just wind and solar became culture war, political culture war issues. I think to some degree electric vehicles as well, which also have their tax credits. The tax cuts for EVs and September 30 of this year as well, which is even shorter than the initial proposal. So as the debate went on, that got shorter and shorter. So the tax credits for wind, solar, and EVs are gone. It’s gone. What’s left. Lots of stuff actually. President Trump, who has a lot of authority in that party, called for full repeal of the Green New Scam. That is not what happened. So I just I do think that’s an important thing, because I’ve devoted my entire life to climate. That would have been an unthinkable outcome to me even four years ago, if you had told me Dems pass a Dem only climate bill. Trump tells everyone to repeal the full thing and a significant chunk survives. So we mentioned that they tried to rationalize the clean energy tax incentive program by allowing. Any zero emissions technology to qualify. Basically, any technology that can claim that it is 0 emissions still can get this production or investment tax credit for clean energy. And through the long term, through the end of 20, commencing construction through the end of 2033, they can get the full credit. And then it steps down over a couple more years. So basically Republicans just endorsed a decade long tax credit for carbon free electricity, just not wind and solar. Just because I think this will be confusing to people. Oh, you can’t get it if wind and solar cannot get it. Not everything, but wind and solar. Any nuclear plant, any advanced geothermal plant. If fission or fusion works, that will qualify. So I’ve generally found this to be a puzzling part of Republican energy policy, which is I can almost understand as a matter of culture war, we are for fossil fuel energy and against renewables, clean energy. But there seems to be a particular loathing of wind and solar, but at the same time somewhat of an embrace, at least an openness to nuclear, which I kind of get because a lot of environmentalists don’t like it. So maybe the Republicans do like it. But then more technology forward, less mature technologies, advanced geothermal, green hydrogen, et cetera fusion, those have maintained a kind of neutrality in the political war here. Is that basically accurate. I think that’s basically true. And I think the reasons for it. So the culture war stuff is one. I think it is worth noting that part of the reason there was a larger target on solar and wind is because they are mature. They are pretty mature technologies that are being widely deployed because it makes economic sense. So those tax credits look expensive. As a matter of fiscal scoring. Whereas tax credits for more innovative technologies tend to not look expensive because no one thinks they’re going to get built in the next 10 years. Well, also then to steel man, the Republican position here it goes something. There’s a version of it that goes something like this. Wind and solar are more mature technologies. They are, by virtually any measure, now competitive with other forms of energy. EVs are fairly mature technology. If we wanted cheaper electric vehicles, we don’t need a tax credit. We could just open our borders to Chinese electric vehicles. Republicans are certainly keen on doing, which they don’t want to do. But the argument is basically we do not need to subsidize these technologies. Why is that wrong or is that wrong. I think it is wrong and Jesse can jump into. But I there are having abundant electrons that we can use to fuel economic growth and meet rising demand for energy in the United States, which is happening for the first time in decades, is a public good. We subsidize all kinds of energy development because we know that a robust and large and abundant energy system is good for economic growth. It underpins the entire economy. And it’s good for our national security. So there even if you didn’t care about climate change, given that solar in particular solar and batteries are the most rapid way and in many cases, the most cost effective way to meet growing demand, there’s absolutely a public argument for subsidizing this stuff, even if it’s relatively mature. In the same way, we subsidize all kinds of things that are relatively mature because they’re good for society. Then, of course, an argument is most Republicans will not deny that climate change is a problem. I mean, some do, but many Republicans now will acknowledge climate change is a problem. They’ll just argue for a different kind of solution set than Democrats. If you believe climate change is a problem, then you’re subsidizing not just the public good of abundant energy that’s affordable, but also the climate benefit. What is the solution set. I try to be fair to Republicans on this show, but I have not heard many Republicans arguing for something that would qualify me as a solution set for climate change. So when you say that, what are you thinking. I mean, I think insufficiently ambitious for sure. But the IIJA, the bipartisan infrastructure law actually contained a fair amount of investments in clean energy technologies that Republicans supported. So clean hydrogen hubs, direct air capture spending, spending on storage, a fair amount of carbon capture a fair amount of technology investment on the more kind of innovation oriented view, where it gets much harder is on anything that is very seriously about deploying mature, clean energy technologies at scale or regulatory mandates that would achieve that aim and/or restrict fossil fuels. Yeah I mean, I think there’s a challenge here, which is that what we see from the Republican Party is they tend to support the technologies that are less mature. And you can argue that that’s a rational technology policy strategy. There’s a case to be supporting innovative technologies as they mature and come down in cost. And I’ve supported that case for years. But there’s also I worry that the reason they’re doing that is because they’re not a direct threat to incumbent energy industries. So what is driving down consumption of gasoline is the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles. What is driving down the consumption of natural gas in the United States is the growth of wind and solar in the power sector. And so when they become large competitive threats, then you have different factions within the Republican Party standing up to defend the oil and gas industry, channeling the advice from donors and politically connected folks in those industries to try to attack their competitors. You have an ideological culture war element of this that well, if liberals like these technologies, we have to hate them. And in this case, unfortunately, I think Donald Trump is much more strongly aligned with the culture war piece of it and probably a lot more susceptible to input from the fossil fuel aligned donors and members, and that won out over the more pragmatic bloc. So one thing that was part of the whole political theory of the Inflation Reduction Act was we were going to pull in all this investment in factories and clean energy, and that was both going to generate economic activity, but was going to generate jobs. And it did seem some of that investment was coming forward. So what did we achieve on that. And then what do we think will happen to those factories. People were planning to those people who were getting hired. Yeah, it’s a great question. I mean, there has been more than $100 billion worth of investment in clean energy related supply chains and factories in the Uc as a result of the IRA. Much of that has already started to get built, and the EV investment has been huge, with the US out investing, China and all other countries in 2024. Like this was working on the supply chain underscoring. Yeah in the global competitiveness context we were mounting a competitive defense. And now that’s being undermined by these policies like the 45X tax credit. The tax credit for manufacturing it was sustained was sustained. Which tells you something about it’s broadly popular. That’s true. But to Jessie’s point, the demand pull for the thing, the widgets we are manufacturing got totally taken away. The demand pull being the subsidies for subsidies for EVs. So like actually Rhodium Group found that US demand for EVs by 2030, when most of the manufacturing is online, will be less than half of what it was before this Republican bill because of the termination of the EV tax credits and the rollback of the clean vehicle regulations. If demand totally craters for the products these factories are now being incentivized to produce, we don’t need them anymore. It’s entirely plausible that we have now. And I do think part of the reason for fivex the manufacturing tax credits stuck around was because people saw it as very discreetly tied to a tax credit, and they wanted to save that tax credit for those factories. But industrial strategy is not just about the supply side. It’s about the other stuff. This is a place where what happened in the last couple of months just feels so strange to me. So Elon Musk becomes so close to Trump that he seems like the co-president in the early weeks and months of the administration, when liberal protesters want to target the right wing coalition’s great vulnerability. They begin protesting outside Tesla distributors. Donald Trump does like a Tesla infomercial on the lawn of the White House. They still keep all of the policy wrecking the EV credits. And now, of course, whether it’s because of that or not, I’m skeptical. That’s why Musk broke with Trump. But now, obviously, Musk is on the outs and saying he’ll start an America party. But they almost seem like this moment where if there could have been one good thing out of the Elon Musk Donald Trump alliance, it would have been Trump’s softening a bit on electric vehicles. Musk selling electric vehicles to Republicans. But instead, it’s like the Republican antipathy to electric vehicles was much stronger than the Trump Musk alliance. And that’s the thing that held. It also was true that Elon was not, that Musk was not advocating for retaining the EV. Yes that’s why I don’t believe that’s what shattered their relationship. Musk seemed perfectly willing to light Tesla on fire. Whatever else you want to say about Elon Musk’s politics, Tesla was America’s most capable national champion in electric vehicles. It was a world leading, world beating company, the only globally competitive company. But now it has destroyed its reputation among the people who buy its cars here and in Europe. So when you think about what’s going to happen to the most capable American manufacturer of electric vehicles versus the Chinese think these manufacturers, it’s like it doesn’t have support from Trump. It has lost support among liberals here and again in Europe. And it’s getting crushed by competition in China. I mean, it’s getting crushed in China. And the Chinese cars are good. Yeah Yeah they’re right. They’re so good. We can’t let them in here because we’re terrified that it would just take over our market functionally, instantly. If we let them in here, they would be the cheapest electric cars on the market. That’s right. Yeah, by a good margin. And so we’ve just ended this whole Elon Musk Donald Trump saga with the American a much weaker position. Yeah, I mean, one of the central industries we were trying to compete with China in. Exactly I mean, I like for all the talk about how tough Trump is on China, Biden had left our EV system in a much stronger position, and Trump and Musk collaborated to destroy it. Absolutely I mean, beyond how depressing the big step backwards is on the climate side. And this is the other I think, big lasting legacy of this bill. I mean, there’s all kinds of other anti-china provisions that they threw into all the other tax credits we haven’t talked about. Now have to basically demonstrate that there’s no Chinese content in your supply chain to get any of the remaining tax credits that persisted. But you can’t compete globally by just throwing up walls to Chinese influence or Chinese competition. You have to actually have a domestic competitiveness strategy. And there isn’t one right now. We’ve talked about the ways in which this bill gutted when solar electric vehicles. What did the bill do and what have been other Trump administration moves to actually accelerate the construction of fossil fuel infrastructure to try to help coal, right. Is there anything on the other side of that ledger. There’s a real wackadoodle coal thing in the GOP bill. GOP law, which is there is now a production tax credit for metallurgical coal, which is really nonsensical on just about every front. Not least because if you’re concerned about China and/or the domestic steel industry. Metallurgical coal is by and large exported, much of which is exported to China. You want to see what metallurgical coal is. It’s coal that’s used mostly for industrial processes, for power generation, largely steel production. So we are now subsidizing American metallurgical coal to be shipped to China. So they can make cheap and dirty steel, which they dump on global markets. That undercuts American steel producers. I mean, this is by no means the worst thing in this one big, terrible bill. But it is still it is just a glaring example of how backwards the policy is and how much of a corporate giveaway it is in the last 48 hours. It’s a tiny subsidy. It’s 2.5 percent and it’s only in place for a few years. So it is absolutely not going to affect any investment decisions to expand US metallurgical coal production. It’s just a straight giveaway to whoever owns those coal mines. And so we’re subsidizing coal production while raising taxes on clean energy production. It’s hard to swallow that for sure. You said earlier that the IRA and the other, the associated legislation, got us to percent of the interim net zero target. Just beautiful language here. What does the model say now. So our estimates that are under the current Biden era policies, we’re on track to get to about 40 to 43 percent below peak emissions levels. Now we’re probably going to be on the order of 20 percent to 24 percent below by 2030, and maybe closing in on 28 percent by 2035. So cut about half. So cut about half of the progress that we’ve made. That’s actually helpful. And can I actually say one thing here without repeating talking points that sometimes climate deniers and delayers use, it is absolutely important that the US reduces its emissions very rapidly. It’s a moral imperative. It’s important for demonstrating to the world that a developed economy can decarbonize without major sacrifice. That is important, that leadership is important, and the US is going to be like 13 percent of emissions. All of the emissions are going to come from non OECD economies that are developing. So one way to think about the US’s role in addressing climate is to actually take a step back and think, it’s not just about us decreasing decreasing our emissions as rapidly as possible. That is an important piece of it. But the investments in the innovative technologies that are going to represent 40 percent of the global emissions reductions, we now have a policy framework in the US for those more innovative technologies where we have an opportunity to actually lead in innovating, building and deploying those things. And importantly, diffusing them internationally. So like I get a little I get a little about the modeling anyway. I mean, I love Jesse and it’s important, but sure you do. I get a little. It’s also a model over here. Yeah like O.K. Enough but but I do think but I do think and I’ve been thinking a lot about in debates about Democratic politics and strategy, there’s been a lot of conversation about impulses of the coalition toward maximalism. And climate has this thing where it has been framed as a physical, scientific problem, where there are hard limits. If we do not fully solve the problem and get to net zero emissions or get there by some deadline, get there by some deadline, or in the next 10 years, if we don’t keep to 1 and 1/2 degrees, the planet’s going to fall off a cliff. That is a scientifically incorrect. It is true that there are uncertainties in the climate system, but every degree of warming every fraction of a degree of warming that we don’t, that we don’t cause matters. It matters a lot for the risks of climate change. And so I get a little I kind think that there’s a way in which we framed this such that it encourages that kind of impulse among the Democratic Party to say it’s all or nothing. Progress is not worth considering because we have to solve this problem completely in the next five years or the planet is doomed. That is just not true. And that also contributes, I think, to a mindset that we’ve just suffered this big political loss. It’s a truly substantive step backwards. Some people interpret that, well, now we’re done. Like we’ve lost. It’s over like there’s nothing we can do. We’re going to run out of time. And that’s not how it works. Well, let me try to get at how I understood the targets, because you’re of course right that every degree matters. There is no on/off switch for climate risk. But the way that this has been talked about almost universally within the climate movement, what I understood, Biden’s net zero targets to me, and what I understood all of your modeling to mean, is that the scientific community, however you want to define that, has looked at all of its models, looked at all of its research, and described zones that are of really frightening levels of climate risk. No, that’s actually not what the science says. And it’s a huge so great to talk about this because if that’s a communication failure, it sounds to me a little bit like I can’t tell the difference here between every degree matters. And we have been scaring you all unscientifically for decades in order to get you to move faster. But now that we’re moving slower, don’t worry too much. We were just to be clear, I wasn’t scaring people with that kind of rhetoric. So the science is very clear. Get there as fast as possible. We’re already seeing dangerous climate change around us today. So the idea that there’s some safe zone and some dangerous zone and there’s a threshold between the two is just not scientifically true. And the IPCC has never said that there’s no consensus in the scientific documents that frame it that way. What they’ve said is that every degree involves increasing risk. And that’s true. And so we have a sense of urgency. We want to make as much progress as possible, as rapidly as possible. But that’s what the science says. And as possible. Part That’s what politics and technology and society have to determine. And there’s No science that says what that is, right. That’s all US trying to hash this out and muddle through as best we can. Well, there is social science. Well, I see this is the war of. Well, give me the social science perspective, Jane. Well, I mean, I think the way that I’ve been thinking about this lately, because all of what Jesse said is right. And one of the reasons that I remain very anxious about climate risk is because there is a lot of uncertainty in the climate system. There are things we don’t yet understand the world. While it is true that our emissions trajectories seem to be improving relative to what they thought we would be, and I can say more about that in a minute. How the climate will respond to those emissions and importantly, what the potential for positive, which are actually negative feedback loops in the climate system might be, or tipping points, which is another set of concerns. There is a lot of uncertainty about those things. And it’s scary. And we don’t know. But the point is that we don’t know where they are, where they are. So I’ve been thinking about it as a race between feedback loops, kind of. It’s like a race. It’s a race of like the negative feedback, the positive but bad feedback loops in the climate system and the feedback loops that we’ve been trying to cultivate politically, where you’re driving down the cost of technologies, deploying more technologies, building political will. And that’s the problem. I think that’s it in a nutshell. When you said a minute ago, I want to make sure we don’t forget this, that we are seeing somewhat better outcomes than we might have feared Yes At the levels of warming that we’re currently experiencing. Just expand. What does that mean. I most people haven’t heard that. Yeah what I actually mean is not that the impacts are better than we thought, it’s that our emissions themselves are not as high as we predicted them to be. That’s largely because we’ve seen such rapid cost declines in these technologies and wide scale deployment of these technologies. The world is decarbonizing faster than we thought that it would but the climate is not responding in the ways that we predicted that it would. When you say the climate’s not responding, you’re referring to the fact that things have been extraordinarily hot. Yeah things are warming much more rapidly. And this is where you got to get Zeke on the show. But there’s lots of his father, who’s an excellent climate modeler. So we’re trying to figure out what’s causing that more that more rapid warming climate response. But the thing that we can definitely control is bending the bending the emissions trajectory down, which we’ve been more successful at than we thought we would be. All right. So there’s another then dimension of how the world is changing. That seems important here. So Jesse and I used to talk a lot about the basic theory of decarbonization was we’re going to electrify everything we can possibly electrify. That’s going to mean we need a lot more electricity. We’re going to hopefully generate that electricity using clean sources, and then we’re going to lay down a bunch of transmission lines to get that electricity where it’s going to need to go. When people modeled how much electricity we would need they were thinking about the trends as they existed in 2015 and 2018 and 2020, but now AI has become this absolutely massive consumer of electricity. So how has that changed the amount of electricity we are projecting that we will need in the next 5, 10 years. So our latest estimate is when we account for the reduced electrification due to the end of these tax cuts for heat pumps and for EVs and other things due to the Republican tax bill and the addition of data centers and AI to our forecasts, we’re expecting electricity demand to grow at a sustained rate of about 2 percent per year over the next decade. That’s enough to increase it by about 25 percent through 2035 from current levels. That’s a lot of additional electricity. So that’s more than our entire nuclear fleet, additional generation know that’s all demand growth, of which AI is probably about a quarter of that. And so it’s big it’s an added trend. And it’s increasing the power sector when it comes to decarbonization, which is twofold. It’s to both meet all of that demand growth with clean electricity sources, so we don’t dig a deeper hole while simultaneously reducing our reliance on fossil fuels for power generation. We’re still going to do that, but not as much as we thought. In fact, our estimates are that we’re going to lose about a nuclear fleet’s worth of clean generation. That would have been added. If we’d sustained tax cuts for wind and solar through 2035. That goes away. However, we’re still going to see wind and solar meet most of that demand growth, probably all of it on net. It’s just that we’re not going to eat as deeply into our existing coal fleet. So in a nutshell, be more expensive than it would have been if we had retained the credits in the IRA, where we were basically taxing our cheapest and most widely deployed energy supply. The one other thing about the demand, though, that’s worth noting, that’s different about the broader economy wide in electrification demand is the I demand is going to happen fast like that. That is like that’s like near-term demand consumption of a city scale in one spot, as opposed to EVs, which are diffused over wide areas. It’s a particular challenge for the grid, particularly the transmission and distribution. Grids need to be people who are big nerds on energy. Not as big as you, but big who tell me that they are worried now about the grid being able to hold up, that they’re worried in the next 5, 10 years about outages, about blackouts, about different kinds of grid failures, because we’re adding so much of such a different kind of electricity demand. Like, how do you think about that interaction between the grid we have and the energy we’re about to need. And I think that’s certainly a risk. I mean, we’re going to see demand growing rapidly. If we can’t grow supply rapidly enough, then the risk is twofold. One, energy prices are going to go up because supply is not keeping pace with demand, and the risk of outages goes up because we might have the normal demands met. But if things go out of sample, we get an extreme heat wave or an extreme cold event or something like that happens. We have far less Slack in the system to absorb that if we haven’t added enough new supply. What we’ve basically what the Republicans have basically done is ensure that we’re going to deploy less new electricity, that the new electricity we deploy is more expensive. And that because of that, we rely more on existing coal and gas plants that weren’t otherwise used. So we’re going to be paying more for new clean electricity and paying more to use dirty old power plants and raising the risk that we’re not able to keep up with demand growth. All because we can’t we’ve raised taxes on the most important sources of New electricity. You gestured at this a minute ago, but we’ve been talking a lot about the effect of all this on decarbonization. What about the effect on the energy bills people pay. Yeah I mean, this is really quite brutal. I don’t know if I have the numbers on the top of my head, but there have been a bunch of analyses that electricity, large electricity buyers and others have done. Independent analysts of the impact on electricity rates associated with repeal of the IRA. And they are significant and they vary across the country. But in some cases I think it’s on the order of like 15 percent on average, a 15 percent increase in retail bills. But of course, that can be 2 percent in some states and 30 percent in other states. Some of the states quite substantial 30. I mean, it’s really quite bad. And we’re in a moment, as where affordability and cost of living is quite top of mind for those in the present, but also for everybody. The other thing that’s going to happen, though, is we’re because we’re deploying less electric vehicles, we’re going to consume more gasoline and nationally and diesel, and that’s going to drive up prices at the pump too. The estimates are that could be on the order of a 5 percent increase in gasoline prices. So another way to think about it is that Republicans just voted for a 5 percent gas tax rate by slowing the deployment of EVs, right. And so none of this stuff makes good economic sense, even if you don’t care about climate, especially if you care about the affordability challenge. And so I do think it’s going to exacerbate something Jane and I have talked about a lot the next wave of energy politics, I think, is going to be centered around affordability and the rising stress of meeting energy bills. Our estimates are from the repeat project, that energy bills will go up by about $280 per household per year in 2035, again with a lot of variation across households. That’s like a 13 percent increase in how much we pay for energy, both utility bills and gasoline and heating. How do you think, Jane, about the politics of affordability here on the Democratic or climate concerned side. Because there’s always been a tension. On the one hand, you want to care about affordability. You want energy to be affordable for people who need it. And on the other, if you are trying to phase out a bunch of fossil fuel infrastructure, that’s not just a relentless race to the cheapest energy possible. You are making energy on the margin more expensive by trying to phase all this out and move us on to renewables. Yeah I mean, the politics of those things are bad and brutal, and we should be very honest with ourselves about this. I mean, one of the lessons going into the IRA, and I think coming out of it is that there is a mythology that there are a silent block of climate voters that represent the majority of the American public who are willing to sacrifice in the name of climate. And while I may wish that to be true, it is obviously not true. We have run the experiment many times now. I think, Ezra, if you look at for solar, wind and batteries, my view is that the most important thing we can do going forward, if we take affordability seriously and we take climate seriously, is remove all of the non-market barriers to deploying this stuff as rapidly as possible everywhere. And that’s going to be tough for the environmental. What are those non-market barriers. There are very significant challenges around to planning and transmission planning and siting. We just don’t really do it well. We don’t really do it anywhere. There are huge issues with permitting that you will be not unfamiliar with, both at the federal level and frankly, a of state and local. Yeah, a ton of state and local. I mean, you have renewable energy projects, fighting at County commissions everywhere across the US and often losing. And you have localities and counties just banning the building of clean energy projects. So here is a frustration I had with the Biden administration. I would talk to people in it. You were in it. We didn’t have this conversation that much, but I had it with your colleagues and they knew all these problems. The only permitting reform they ever backed was this half hearted backing of Joe Manchin’s sidecar deals. That was not their ideal permitting reform, and was, of course, somewhat poisoned in the eyes of progressives because it was what Joe Manchin wanted and it would clear out way for this pipeline. And so on. But they never and frankly, Democrats in Congress really didn’t propose. This is what we think the ideal permitting system to accelerate clean energy deployment would look like. What would it look like. Like what. What if you were writing that bill Jane, what would you write in it. Well, I think one thing to say is that, again, Texas is quite a good example of where this has gone, has gone reasonably, reasonably well. So just looking at Texas, if we’re to take a couple of lessons here. One thing is that Texas, unlike many other markets in the United States, has done very proactive transmission planning. So they had these what was it, the Krebs clean, renewable energy renewable energy zones. And they did it, by the way, under George W Bush and Perry. So like so that’s that we should be doing that at across the country, which is basically saying like we know where the renewable potential is. We don’t need to wait for a developer to come and say, hey, I’d like to connect to the grid, just build the big highway out there and let people connect on ramps. And that’s what they did. And it worked very well. So basically they created the transmission infrastructure before they built the energy. Exactly Yeah. There’s also, I think, easier interconnection processes, which is getting more attention. Now there are more than 1000gw of clean energy projects. I mean, maybe they’re not all real, but they’re waiting to be connected and cannot get connected. And I think we haven’t even really done the work to fully diagnose the problem. But a part of it is just automating the application process. O.K, let’s slow this down. Every energy wonk talks about this endlessly. I don’t think it makes any sense when a normal person hears it. When we are talking about the problems in these interconnection queues, what are we talking about. We’re saying basically, if you want to connect to the power grid, because the physics of the power grid is complicated and it’s all connected, and we don’t want the grid to ever fail, they have to basically run a study to make sure that under any conditions that you’re connected to the grid, you’re not going to cause a problem, you’re not going to cause something to blow out and some cascading failure. And right now, those studies are meticulously done by individual, highly skilled power engineers who were in short supply. And they can take years more than the average times more than three years, which is just insane. Could ChatGPT do ChatGPT. Could not. But a chat agent could run all the simulations, and then a smart single power engineer could assess them at the end of the day, right. Like, we can make these limited skilled positions superpowered with AI. And in fact, that’s exactly what’s happening now because this has become such an issue just recently. I do think there’s a lot of politics of why this hasn’t been solved, because basically the incumbents in the industry like having high barriers to entry to New competitors. But as demand has started to grow rapidly as capacity, prices, prices, to bring on new electricity spiked in one of the biggest power markets in the country, and that’s driving now 20 percent rate hikes in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland. It’s become very politically salient. You’ve got Governor Shapiro in Pennsylvania suing the grid operator to be like, hey, do a better job. And you’ve got large data centers being like, hey, we’d like to connect in three months, not in three years. All of a sudden, now that they’ve got this pressure, the grid operator is like, Oh, actually, we could do this in three months, so we could be doing this much faster. We should be. And I don’t, frankly think we should. We should stand for anything longer than a few months to complete that process. So that’s one thing. Also, just like straight up permitting issues, they just have much laxer kind of friendly to industry regulations on permitting new energy projects in Texas. And that helps that certainly helps. They also have and this is like well beyond the bounds of my expertise. But the structure of their particular electricity market tends to be much friendlier to New entrants. And building a new generation, highly competitive and easy to get into the market basically. So like but but but I think what’s frustrating to me, candidly is like we have ample evidence now these are many of these are mature technologies that we both say as the climate movement. These are the cheapest, cheapest and easiest things to build. And then when it comes to getting serious about why it’s not happening, why it’s not happening at the rate it needs to happen, it does raise some difficult questions for our own coalition around balancing conservation objectives and community engagement processes with our decarbonization goals. And for that reason, I think there’s just been a lot of hesitancy around leaning in on this stuff. And if we’re being honest, any deal that happens federally on this stuff is probably going to have to apply not just preferentially to clean energy technologies. It will probably be like a truly all of the above permitting regime. But the thing is, if you look at currently all energy projects in the US that have completed environmental impact statements under Nepa, for instance, over the last decade. Clean energy dominates fossil projects like it would almost undoubtedly advantage clean energy over fossil. Yeah, just in the power sector, 95 percent of the new capacity we’re adding to the grid right now and over the next couple of years is wind, solar, and batteries. 95 percent just making it easier to build period will structurally advantage building clean energy, because that’s most of what we want to build. The climate change is an emergency and we have to solve it in seven years. And you think the primary way to do that is to block all fossil infrastructure. Why would you take that deal. Yeah, this is why I think the misunderstanding of the climate problem and the science of the problem has been really problematic for this kind of agenda. So I want to slow down what you just said there, that you’re saying that the climate movement trained itself on the idea that the thing we have to do is keep the dirty energy in the ground and stop all new fossil infrastructure from being built, because that would dig us our deeper hole and lock in these assets. And so proposals that would create that would make it much, much easier to build energy of all kinds, even though it would disproportionately lead to clean energy being built, runs afoul of that intuition that there was. I always saw this in the fight over the mansion, the various mansion bills. There was much more activation around this one big natural gas pipeline than there was excitement over the much bigger and total emissions impact, changes to transmission line permitting and siting and and authorities. Yeah, but I want to hold here on the Biden administration for a minute. What you just said a minute ago is probably right that any almost certainly if I said it is any big deal would have had to have been in all of the above deal because you would have needed Republican votes just given the structure of Congress. But that’s often true at the end of a process. There could have been a proposal on this is what we would like it to look like. This is what we think progressive or liberal or Democratic permitting reform would look like. And Yes, now we need to get into the negotiations. And there’s going to be horse trading and concessions. How come I never saw that. I think there were very smart people working very much behind the scenes, but I think there was a real fear. I think, frankly, probably a misguided fear, although I understand why people had it, that sticking your neck out on this publicly in any way, as a self-proclaimed climate champion, you would be tormented basically if you did this. And you might lose funding. And if you’re an environmental organization, you might be viewed as an enemy of environmental justice. And that’s brutal. Like that’s a deeply unfun position to be in. And we haven’t yet. I think it’s a reflection of the fact that we have not yet successfully built an environmental or a climate movement that creates the permission, structure or incentive to really lean in on this stuff. I mean, you’ve written about this, Ezra. I mean, the environmental movement that is that provided most of the horsepower to date for climate politics and climate policy was built to stop bad stuff, not to build good stuff. And there’s been a recognition of that for years. I mean, Bill McKibben, who is a big proponent of the maximalist approach in many ways to climate politics, also recognizes that the only way we solve the problem is to build lots of stuff. And he’s trying to figure out how to activate people around coming to County commissions and fighting for wind farms or solar farms now. But this is a big shift for that kind of political coalition. And it’s going to require, cleaning the slate and starting from scratch in many ways to build institutions and processes that are fit for purpose. And that’s going to remove some of the key tools that environmental groups have been and are still using to stop the bad stuff. And that’s just a really difficult coalitional politics to navigate. So I think you’re right to finger. This is the area where the Biden administration fell short in proposing something. Even to date, congressional Democrats have not proposed a comprehensive, pro abundance, energy permitting reform proposal that could be used to anchor a further discussion with Republicans going forward, and I think they should. Let me grab two other pieces of that. So one which has come up a few times here is the planning capacity. I think oftentimes people hear these arguments for pro energy, abundance permitting, and all they hear is a deregulatory dimension of it. It is always in all of my reporting on this. There need to be more bodies and capacity. There’s the question of various kinds of environmental reviews, which both have which both raise the question of, do we need such intensive environmental reviews on things that we to be clean energy, but also raises a question of, do we have the people needed to create and then respond to all the environmental reviews ping ponging back and forth from the states and the government and so on. How about that dimension of it. What would it look like to add state capacity to the planning functions and implementation functions that allow these things to get built. I mean, to be fair, the IRA did include actually $1 billion of enhanced funding for all of the agencies involved in Nepa review. Did that survive. Well, it was spent under the Obama years, so ideally, that would be like an ongoing appropriation. But that’s just one piece of this broader mess. I mean, my view of this is that we should be thinking about creating a one stop shop process for all federal approvals required for these pieces of key national infrastructure. And that process should have a finite length, and it should not necessarily be a thumbs up decision every time. But as long as it’s a clear short decision and it is appropriately staffed to do that job, well, then industry can go in and make the best case for the project and get an answer pretty quickly. And if the answer is no, they can pivot to the next project. And so it’s not that we need to make it really basically disregard all environmental impact. It’s that we need to make these processes streamlined, centralized and fast so you can get a thumbs up or thumbs down decision that can’t be dragged out in court for 50 years or 30. What Like the Department of Commerce creates a strategic Infrastructure Agency. Sure I mean, we didn’t electrify the country to begin with by just tweaking existing regulatory institutions. We created a whole new agencies, created publicly owned utilities. We created rural electrification loan programs, we have to be that creative if we want to be building at scale a new set of infrastructure across the country the Department of Defense today announced a quite muscular industrial policy intervention to basically take equity, meaningful equity stakes in a domestic critical minerals company to produce rare earths for electric motors and defense applications. Like there’s a version of this agenda on permitting, on planning and industrial policy that is actually not deregulatory. That is really about a much more muscular and centralized state. I think I mean, look, I worked in the White House. I think I used to be of the view like Oh, hire more people to more state capacity to do a better job on the if you do not have the political permission structure, you could just have a lot of people block it like it doesn’t. It actually doesn’t matter. So that actually is the core of the problem. I mean, look yeah, look what they did for the chips. Act like trying to build these semiconductor fabs is they recognize that they weren’t going to get their permits done on time to actually get built. They were just like, we’re just going to reorient this stuff and try to do it very fast and wave a whole bunch of things. Yeah, they try to get things done. They exempted it from the National Environmental Policy Act. Exactly so like if we think it’s important as a national priority to build more energy infrastructure, to have cheap, affordable, clean electricity, to power economic growth, to power the industries of the future, we’re not going to get there with the status quo. So it’s 2025. There’s going to be a midterm election next year. It is very likely, or at least very plausible, that Democrats win the House. It is less likely, but not totally implausible, that they win the Senate, though that would be quite hard. Yeah, rough math, but in a world where Democrats have a lever of power. And so that they are now, if the administration wants appropriations speaker Hakeem Jeffries has to sign off on it before we even talk about next time Democrats wield unified power. What should be on their agenda for 2027? O.K, I have I’m spending a lot of time thinking about this right now. And I think as a general matter, kind of even leaving the electoral stuff aside, if we just took a step back and said, what are the most important things to do in the next few years. Because there’s ways to make progress on all of them. In most political contexts, you’re just not going to get exactly what you want thing one is remove non-market barriers to wide scale deployment of the commercial clean EnergyTech. I think the permitting bill needs to be a huge priority of the climate movement maybe thing one. And that’s possible because you could actually get a fair amount of that’s the thing we’ve always thought could be a bipartisan. There would be things liberals don’t like in it. But you can imagine a divided government doing totally major permitting only actually, in a way like I. But I think the intra coalitional politics within the Democratic Party on this are potentially going to be tough and the climate movement needs to figure out where they want to land on this, because if you actually care about deploying clean energy rapidly and at scale, we have to do this. There just is no question. So that’s thing one thing two, in my view, is the deployment led innovation agenda. So roughly half probably less of global emissions reductions that we’re going to see are going to come from not renewables and electric vehicles, all the other stuff that’s not yet at commercial scale. The Uc is remarkably good at inventing new technologies and demonstrating them. And we’re trying to get better at deploying them too. So in those categories. So that’s things like technologies in the power sector that generate electricity, that are not solar and wind advanced nuclear power or geothermal or carbon capture or whatever. I think there’s an innovation agenda on that could garner bipartisan support. The third pillar, I think, is how do we get serious about diffusing all of these technologies from OECD to non-oecd economies. And even there, I mean, look what’s happening with development funding. A lot of that is energy for economic development, clean energy for economic development. So what’s happening to development funding as a matter of US politics is deeply disturbing for many reasons. And this is one of them. But I do think there may be some opportunity on trade to better. Well, we’ll see to better integrate climate into our trade policy. And I think the US is going to be more muscular in its kind of approach to economic statecraft as it relates to energy and supply chains, whether that’s countering the rise of China in other countries or whatever. But you’ll see that third pillar is not what people typically think of when they think of international climate action where they think of is like, rejoin the Paris Accord and more multilateralism at the UNFCCC on climate targets. What I’m proposing is something that I think could happen, even in a world where it’s not run entirely by Democrats. I mean, I think a long term tax credit, an investment tax credit on the order of 10 percent for all new carbon free electricity. Beyond the ones that are less mature and get the higher level currently would make sense from a public policy perspective. I mean, there is a public good value to having more and cheaper energy. There’s a public good value for that energy being cleaner. And if we’re not going to subsidize it and we’re not going to penalize the dirty stuff, it’s not going to be provided at the scale that we want. But that’s a much smaller and much less expensive subsidy than the one that was implemented under the IRA. I don’t think we’re going to get back to that regime, where we’re basically covering half of the cost of a wind or solar farm out for the next decade. One of the areas that I’m most concerned about beyond climate of the impacts of this bill, is that it has basically upended the electric vehicle and battery competitiveness strategy that was implemented over the last several years, in a pretty thoughtful way to try to counter the rise of China, which is just utterly dominating global markets right now for electric vehicles. We were just at the point where we were starting to see major investment in the US battery supply chain and electric vehicle deployment. We were seeing new models, a more competitive market, and our automakers investing in a real strategy to be competitive in that space. And if you look globally at the future of the auto industry, it’s all electric and autonomous. And if you want to do autonomous vehicles, you also need them to be electric. For the most part, they have to have a large enough batteries and onboard power infrastructure to run all the computers and sensors that you need to run an autonomous vehicle, and China is all in on that stuff. Its entire market is devoted to that now. And the US, if it doesn’t find a way to compete in that space, will find itself with an automotive industry that is basically shut off from all other global markets, and that is only supplying a shrinking share of even our own domestic market, where internal combustion engine vehicle sales peaked long ago and are only declining. And we just blew that all up. Our whole industrial strategy there was just basically destroyed by this bill. Something has to replace that. And I do think there is bipartisan interest in having a competitive auto industry and in having the ability to produce batteries. I mean, just look this executive order around rare earths. Like just from a defense. Only interest like the future of warfighting will involve batteries everywhere as well. The times ran this piece recently comparing energy and energy related exports of China and the US. And it was really striking. I mean, you look the US exports $117 billion in crude oil, China 844 million. We export $42 billion in natural gas. China 3 billion. So it’s like you look at the energy of the past and we’re way ahead. But then China exports $40 billion in solar panels and modules. We export $69 million worth of it. They export $65 billion worth of lithium ion batteries. We export $3 billion. Their EV exports are way ahead of ours right now. I mean, China’s been absolutely going all out to try to win these industries. Part of the IRA was trying to win some part of them back. And even if you don’t care at all about the clean energy implications, it’s pretty clear these are growing industries. Yeah, I mean, I look at China and I look at the emergence of what is like the first global electro state versus Petro states, we’re basically doubling down now as a Petro state with the Republican strategy. We should be clear, way behind right. It’s not that we’re like losing our edge. We are already way behind in these industries. And the IRA and the infrastructure law were pretty concerted efforts to try to get back to a point where we could compete. And if those are gone, something else has to be there. Or we’re basically just giving up. We’re unilaterally disarming and saying what, China. Go for it. The entire world auto market is yours. You had signaled that maybe in the list of innovative technologies we are still funding, there is something that could become a big deal when you look at those more nascent technologies, green hydrogen, I mean, people are very excited about advanced geothermal a couple of years ago. I can’t quite tell if that is sustained at the same level. I love it. Hot rocks. Hot rocks. Yeah what looks most promising there. If you were. If you were really placing bets. What should we really be throwing ourselves behind. I mean, I do think that advanced geothermal is the most promising thing right now, and it’s not surprising that the United States as a Petro state, that drilling is extremely good at drilling wells and has drilled millions of them. What makes advanced geothermal advanced. So there’s two different flavors of it, but the one that’s advancing most rapidly is basically using directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques that were developed originally to extract shale gas and oil. The spillover effect of public innovation, it’s also publicly driven innovation, were are now being applied in a very different geology to create very different reservoirs. So totally different engineering design, but the same kind of core techniques to basically create a bunch of fractures in the ground that you can circulate water through and extract the heat from the Earth. The other strategy is a closed loop geothermal technology. And I should disclose I’m on an advisory board of a company that does this called ever technologies. And they basically just drill lots of out and back loops. And both of those technologies allow us to basically build geothermal anywhere we can drill into hot rock, as opposed to needing a kind of natural hot springs type formation of fissures that naturally circulate water. Whereas this could these technologies could allow geothermal to be built at terawatt scale globally. So we could be building hundreds of gigawatts nuclear fleets worth of advanced geothermal in the long term. And the US has by far the best competitive position in that area because of the strength of our oil and gas industry. So this could be one where we do have a competitive edge, but it’d be nice if we had a longer list than that. I mean, advanced nuclear, I don’t buy it. I mean, this is one of the ones where, Yes, maybe talk that out because I think people are interested to know is advanced nuclear something I should believe in. Give me the case for advanced. No it is, but whether the US can compete. Yeah I mean, I see it absolutely. I think Jesse and I are totally agree that advanced nuclear is worth investing in both Fusion and fission. What makes it advanced. Much smaller. Really much smaller. More compartmentalized and contained. Slightly different designs. Mechanisms to self cool. So that you’re not dealing with the large scale cooling infrastructure that you need at generation three plants. Some of them use different coolant loops and things like that, both inherently safe. And I think more importantly, since the nuclear fleet is already incredibly safe, are hopefully cheaper to build. And that’s the key one, which is why the smaller can you get economies of scale by manufacturing. But so your skepticism was not that the technology is real. Your skepticism was that we would be good at it. Exactly and so like the first designs will be approved in the next couple of years. The first one just was, but there will be a few more coming. It just takes years to build these things. So the first demonstration reactors, the first of a kind, will come online in 2029 or 30 or 31 or 32. Meanwhile, China is already building them. They have small modular reactors that they’re building. They have gas cooled high temperature reactors that they’re already building the Koreans are out there selling large scale reactors and building them in the UAE on time and on budget. The Chinese are offering that now to competitors around the world, too. And so while it is an area where we have a lot of engineering know how and a lot of technical capability in the United States and a good investment environment to support innovative firms, we are starting we’re starting a decade behind. That’s my problem. We’re starting, well, 5, 10 years behind our competitors in South Korea and China. And so I hope we can compete there. But it’s by no means a slam dunk. So two things that I think are more relevant as we go up the risk ladder of climate change. One is that various forms of carbon capture and removal or direct air capture, which I know you’ve been involved in, become more salient. So most of the technologies we’re talking about are ways of generating energy without creating any emissions. But if we can begin to suck emissions out of the atmosphere and do something with them, maybe we can begin to reverse the damage you’ve already done or about to do. I know you’ve been engaged in efforts to create a market for that. Why don’t we start with that one. What do you think of direct air capture. How plausible is it. At what scale. Like in a situation where we’re in really bad shape, where the risk is turning out to be worse than we had hoped. How much does that. How much could we actually pump into that or pump out through that. Yeah, I mean, I think there are a lot of open questions here and we need to work to figure it out as quickly as possible. My view on this has always been we need to know if it is. The models are assuming that it exists at large scale to solve for the climate problem. So we have an obligation to do the instrumental work to figure out if that’s possible to begin with. And we’re starting to do that, which I think is very good. The challenge with removing CO2 from the ambient air and putting it somewhere permanently, is that it’s hard to do like thermodynamically it can be difficult to do. And the bigger problem is what I’ve been spending, had spent time working on, which is the market development problem, which is who will pay for cleaning up this invisible trash that no one seems to actually care about. That is like that is the big. I think that is the bigger challenge than the technology or the economics. It’s largely just like who pays. I mean, it is a pure. And so what was going on, the thing you worked on, just be clear about it was stripe, which is a digital payments processing company, basically created a side project to create some market for people to try to demonstrate they could do this and stripe would pay them. When you talk about things that government should be doing, that really felt to me like one where the government should be putting money behind a very risky technology in order to try to create a market, in order to try to create the innovative loop that would make this viable. And it was and it has I mean, it has. So the Bipartisan infrastructure law had several billion dollars to demonstrate direct air capture facilities. There is a tax credit that we got enhanced in the Inflation Reduction Act, which remains in The New bill, extended that would give you $180 per ton of CO2 that you pull from the ambient air and store permanently. So there are some policy infrastructures that is nowhere near the scale of investment that you need to make these things real. So that’s first of all. I mean, I think there are one of the things we’re discovering is that there are carbon permanent carbon removal pathways. So there’s direct air capture, but there are other pathways that had not really been top of mind for folks a few years ago, things like enhanced rock weathering, where you’re grinding up a bunch of basalt rocks and putting them in, increasing their surface area and exposing them to moisture so that they more rapidly do what they would do anyway, which is draw CO2 down and store it permanently. Jane loves rocks, I love rocks, I love rocks, but so. But the point with some of these technologies is that there are non-climate co-benefits. There are agricultural, you can have productivity and yield increases as a consequence of doing this on fields where you’re better managing the pH of soil so the land is more productive. So I tend to be more optimistic because I really believe that for now, we need to be very candid with ourselves, which is painful for those of us who are concerned about the climate crisis. That society’s willingness to pay for pure climate action is very low. It is certainly not high enough to do large scale carbon removal at the cost today, at scale. So our view, I think that’s somewhat shared here, is that the role of technology in politics and economics here, this goes to my feedback versus feedback analogy or metaphor. Is that our role our job is to get the cost of these technologies down as much as possible, such that the marginal unit of political will, for the sake of pure climate benefit required to do this stuff, is as low as humanly possible. So the role of these technologies and our impact now should be to keep them alive or give birth to them in many cases and get them to a level where we understand the risks, we understand the benefits, and ideally, we’ve reduced the cost by some degree. So that if we get to a point where we decide, O.K, we really need these. Then there are real option and not an option in a model or a made up, option on a piece of paper. Well then how does that affect the set of technologies we call geoengineering? And for all sorts of very good reasons, people, I think, worry about trying to manipulate the climate with our slightly better than monkey brains. But if we’ve screwed it up, we might try to unscrew it up if things get particularly bad. Totally how do you think about the funding and exploration of geoengineering as a kind of a hedge. Yeah my view on this and I did a dissertation on solar geoengineering, which is the set of ideas. We’re talking about here. I think, for me, the right way to think about the potential value of solar geoengineering for managing climate risk is that we don’t have that many tools to manage climate, to manage increased temperatures that are fast acting, and solar geoengineering masking some of the incoming warming in the way that you could is one of very few tools that could work really fast if we were in a dire situation. So to me, at a pure level of scientific, is this worthy of scientific inquiry. For me, the answer is Yes. Now, technologies aren’t just inherently good or bad. They need to be governed and steered in ways. And my concern about solar geoengineering research and deployment is that we have such low trust in institutions right now that the ability to do science in these riskier in these domains, in a way that’s like truly aligned with global societal benefit is just difficult to imagine. On the other hand, we’re spending a lot of money and time and a lot of other technologies that I’m quite concerned about the global impact of them and that we don’t subject them to the same level of scrutiny. So to be fair to my colleagues, I will say yeah, let’s create a godlike artificial intelligence that we explicitly intend to use to replace human beings in the work that gives them both wages and dignity. But yeah, and have no plans and have no plan. And just like whatever. Like people seem like they can make a lot of money at it. Go forth. But this. How dare we even think about it. Having worked on geoengineering for a long time, it is very frustrating, because I’ve been in countless social, scientific, academic meetings where we all opine and opine, should we or shouldn’t we. Should we even do the research. Who should do the research. And at the same time that we were doing that, this is happening and no one cares. It’s like it actually is. And then once it happens, it’s almost unwatchable. We’re just going to build all the data centers and hope for the best. Totally because and I think because I see that there is potential promise in solar geoengineering for reducing suffering. I’m very worried about research on this topic and agenda setting on this topic and the cultural politics of this topic being overtaken by a Silicon Valley essentially I don’t think that is good for the long term politics or substance of solar geoengineering. And so I am concerned about cultivating even less trust in this set of potential technologies based on who seems to be excited about them and who isn’t. Let me end on this. So imagine some world Democrats take back power in 2028. They do win the Senate. They do win the presidency. They’re going to be facing after this bill, a very different fiscal position than the Biden administration was facing. So the idea that it will be easy to spend hundreds of billions of dollars may or may not be true. By then, it will be hard to raise. It’s always hard to raise taxes, and the tax code is going to be pretty broken after this. I mean, just it’s so shot full of holes that I’ve at least come to the view that full on tax reform might be something we need to consider in a way we haven’t in a very long time. And when taxes can work in a lot of different ways. But one way you can use them is you can raise money by taxing things you don’t like carbon taxes, which used to be a thing we talked about all the time in the climate space have fallen out of favor. They’re considered too politically hard. They’ve not been all that politically stable. On the other hand, nothing else is working out exactly perfectly either. In a world where you are in a very, very difficult fiscal position. But our carbon tax is something that we should be putting back on the table. Is that an idea that in 2029, it’s time will have finally come. Yeah let me say that what I think we need to be doing at that point is figuring out a way that we can continue to drive accelerated deployment of mature technologies and solutions to decarbonize the economy. Maybe it’s a much smaller tax credit. Maybe it’s a regulatory policy that doesn’t have a direct fiscal impact, but its impact on household expenditures is small enough that it doesn’t have political blowback or it’s indirect enough. I mean, it’s look, the Highway Trust Fund has been bankrupt, and we have not been able to raise the gas tax even at the rate of inflation. And so the idea that we’re going to have a substantive carbon price even because it’s fiscally necessary, I just don’t think is very plausible. But a $10 a ton one, which would make a difference in the power sector at making coal less competitive and making renewables more so would only raise the price of gasoline by less than 10 centimeters a gallon in a world where EVs are a competitive option. Maybe that’s politically possible, but I think we need to be very clear. It’s not going to be $100 per ton carbon price that is going to transform the energy economy. It’s going to be the thing. It is one of several options that we can use, I think, for that last mile pull of mature technologies into the market at a pace that reflects their public good nature of being clean and helping decarbonize. The other thing I will say about carbon pricing is that it does run into your broader point about the politics of regulation and the constraints on increasing energy prices and the politics of affordability. Yeah, exactly. Tax their energy. So do you want to advise the Democratic Party to take that position in the name of climate. I mean, that’s a hard sell. It would have to be in the context of a tax reform that did other things people really liked. This is the thing I want to think about in the coming months or years. But what would it look like if we actually tried to rethink the tax code in a pretty fundamental way, such that I don’t think if you step forward and your pitch is, hey, I have a carbon tax. Your life is what it is now, plus a carbon tax. That’s not going to work. No, but if you said this tax code is completely broken. It is taxing the wrong things. We are taxing too much work from the wrong people. We are letting too many things we want less of proliferate. We have made it too easy to be a hedge fund manager, right. You can imagine something that is part of a much bigger pitch. And as part of that pitch, there’s a modest tax on pollution. Yeah which is what we’re talking about here. And so, no, I would not say that the centerpiece of a Democratic administration that cares about this should be a carbon tax. But I would say that I think we are going to be in a world in the next Democratic administration where the fiscal position is much worse and the tax code is completely broken. And I think it would be a mistake for the entire debate to be can you reverse some of Donald Trump’s tax cuts. Yeah, I agree. I think you have to begin to rethink this and then ask yourself, what is a set of principles at the core of that rethinking that make both actual substantive sense, policy sense and make political sense. It doesn’t mean every component of that will be hugely popular. Nobody likes paying taxes on anything, but would they prefer there’s a little bit more tax on pollution as opposed to more taxes on them working. There are things you could think. The problem I have with this is that it’s so hard to proactively predict the way this will play out politically, and you will see so much polling that supports what you’re saying, as we have seen for ever on climate, everyone’s like, oh, the polls show everyone likes support. And then we run the experiment where there’s state ballot initiatives or whatever, even for modest carbon prices, and they fail. But I don’t disagree with you, and I’m happy to run whatever experiments that we want to run. I just say that on the evidence from the world’s experiments with carbon pricing, is that it generally works best when it is not carbon pricing for the sake of carbon pricing, but carbon pricing that is raising revenue, that’s providing public goods that people want. We got to pay for schools, we got to pay for roads, we got to pay for all this stuff. And so how are we going to raise that money. Well, one of the ways we’re going to do it is through congestion pricing in New York City. Now it’s working quite well. So I do think in the context of we need revenue raisers to make a fairer, more progressive tax code, it shouldn’t be off the table. But I do think we have to be very clear about the politics of affordability will also be quite high at that point. I think that is a good place to end. So our final question, what are three books you’d recommend to the audience. And Jane, as we started with you, we’ll start Jesse with you. He’s going to say “Abundance.” Classic. No, as I have just finished reading “Abundance.” The next one on my list is Marc Dunkelman’s “Why Nothing Works,” which I think is probably a great place for folks who have read your book to pick up next. I’m excited to pick it up. I haven’t read it yet, but it’s on my nightstand. The next one. I would say, is “Energy: A Human History” by Richard Rhodes. A historian that I think rightfully puts energy at the center of the human story. How we make and use energy is central to how we structure society. And I guess maybe in that note, I read a lot of science fiction and fantasy to take a break from all this heavy stuff. And so one that I’ll call out is Kim Stanley Robinson’s Mars trilogy. I think it’s a great example of a story of how humanity might muddle through the next couple hundred years that I think grapples with how changing technology co-evolves with society in really interesting ways. And I’ve always found it that futurism helps open my mind to maybe this could go in a different way than we think. We don’t know what the future’s going to look like. We don’t know what options are going to emerge to give us a new tool in our toolkit. We definitely don’t know how that’s going to have ramifications for society, whether that’s AI or something else. And so Robinson’s work, I think is a really great way to just engage in speculative history of the future. Well, I’m way less nerdy than Jesse. So my first recommendation my first recommendation is Norman Rush’s “Mating,” which is just — I just read that. Did you love it? I loved the first two-thirds of it. In my view, that novel is sublime and beautiful and funny and an exploration of love and anthropology and science and justice. And I love that book. The social scientist recommended the social science love story. That’s exactly right. That’s exactly right. The second one is “Frontiers of Illusion” by Daniel Sarewitz, who is just a brilliant thinker around science and technology policy — and science and society. And it just does a really great job laying out both the myths, the myths that we believe about science and how it operates and how we need to be. We need to seriously, take a look at those myths in order to enhance the relationship of science to social outcomes that we want to achieve. And then the last one is Donald MacKenzie’s “An Engine, Not a Camera,” which is also kind of a social studies of science book, but it’s a really brilliant analysis of the role of economic models and theory of finance, not as descriptive representations of empirical reality, but as actual drivers of how those markets operate themselves a book of models. These modelers need to understand their power, and it’s just a great book. And I think about it all the time in the context of the role of models in climate and environmental policy. Jane Flegal, Jesse Jenkins, thank you very much. Thank you.

In the US, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" has accelerated the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for tax credits, potentially eroding the economic viability of many hydrogen projects, particularly in Louisiana. European energy giants such as Shell and Equinor have also scrapped plans to build low-carbon hydrogen plants due to lack of demand.

The green hydrogen sector, once hailed as a promising solution for low-carbon energy, is now grappling with a significant downturn. Several projects worldwide have collapsed due to weak demand and escalating production costs. In the United States, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) has accelerated the deadline for projects to qualify for tax credits, potentially eroding the economic viability of many hydrogen projects, especially in Louisiana [1].

Louisiana, home to some of the largest hydrogen projects in the U.S., is particularly affected. The state's 46 hydrogen and ammonia-related projects were initially eligible for Section 45V tax credits. However, the accelerated deadline to December 31, 2027, has raised concerns about the financial feasibility of these projects [1].

The global pullback in green hydrogen investments is not confined to the U.S. European energy giants such as Shell and Equinor have also abandoned plans to build low-carbon hydrogen plants due to lack of demand. Shell cited insufficient market demand for blue hydrogen in Norway, while Equinor followed suit with similar plans [1].

The Australian market has also been hard hit. Woodside Energy and Trafigura, among others, have shelved green hydrogen projects due to time and cost pressures. The Queensland state government pulled the plug on a massive green hydrogen plant project, valued at A$12.5 billion, citing market uncertainties [1].

The mounting cancellations suggest a sector still searching for viable economics, not just policy certainty. While OBBBA’s accelerated tax credit deadline has raised the stakes for U.S. developers, the global pullback points to deeper market fractures: low offtake demand, high capital costs, and insufficient infrastructure [1].

Louisiana, however, remains optimistic. The passage of OBBBA and the preservation of the Section 45V hydrogen production tax credit are seen as significant milestones for American energy. With the credit intact, the U.S. is sending a strong, bipartisan message about its commitment to competing in the global hydrogen economy [2].

Despite these challenges, the green hydrogen sector is not without potential. As a clean, versatile fuel, hydrogen could play a crucial role in decarbonizing various sectors. However, the sector needs to address market demand, production costs, and infrastructure challenges to regain its footing.

Offshore energy production strengthens our economy, protects our coast and provides the energy security every American family depends on.","The Gulf of America is one of the most strategic energy assets the United States has. Its vast reserves of oil and natural gas power our homes, fuel our economy and support Louisiana’s coastal communities. For more than 80 years, offshore energy production in the Gulf has been essential to our shared prosperity as Americans.

That is why the recent biological opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service is so concerning. Forced to redo the original opinion by court order and rushed to meet an artificial deadline due to Biden administration scheduling promises, the NMFS recently issued a 677-page opinion that includes a so-called ""jeopardy finding,"" which has been seized on by misguided environmental activists to suggest that the oil and gas industry presents a risk to the Rice's whale.

These opinions are important because the NMFS's biological opinion is an important document that can require actions by industry to reduce that risk. Maintaining an up-to-date, informed biological opinion is key to safely supporting the energy sector in the Gulf.

Unfortunately, the new opinion fails to reflect the real data we know about offshore operations and marine life in the Gulf. In fact, there is no proven evidence that any oil and gas vessel has ever struck a Rice’s whale.

Rather than relying on decades of records of oil and gas operations in the Gulf with no evidence of interaction between the industry and the Rice’s whale, NMFS utilizes speculation through predictive modeling to conclude industry activity could be allegedly harming Rice’s whales. It would be inaccurate and irresponsible for this claim to be considered as fact.

If left uncorrected, the flawed biological opinion may disrupt critical permitting processes and delay or block responsible energy development, severely restricting exploration and production in the Gulf. The consequences will be felt far beyond Louisiana.

Energy production in the Gulf accounts for roughly 97% of all U.S. offshore oil and gas output. These resources are not just a regional asset. They are a national strength.

Offshore development meets energy demand with some of the lowest-emission barrels produced anywhere in the world. The carbon intensity of oil from the Gulf is 46% lower than the global average outside of the United States and Canada. That means Americans get affordable and reliable energy with fewer emissions.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management found that stopping offshore leasing would not reduce demand for oil and gas and would result in an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by shifting production to places with weaker environmental protections.

Offshore energy projects in the United States are subject to some of the most rigorous environmental standards in the world. These reviews are designed to ensure safety, minimize environmental impact and protect sensitive habitats.

The new biological opinion ignores the energy industry’s decades of experience operating responsibly and innovating continuously to improve safety and sustainability. Its conclusions about the endangered Rice’s whale are not based on the best available science.

According to the National Ocean Industries Association, the decision is driven by speculation and worst-case scenarios instead of fact-based data. The result is a regulatory document that threatens to slow or block responsible activity in the Gulf based on fear rather than facts.

That slowdown would hit Louisiana especially hard. Our state’s oil and gas industry supports more than 306,000 jobs, making up 15% of the state’s total employment. It generates more than $25.5 billion in wages and contributes over $77.7 billion to our economy.

But this is about more than economics. When we allow flawed regulations to block development, we make America more dependent on foreign powers. That means giving leverage to nations like Russia, Venezuela and the members of OPEC, countries that do not share our values or our environmental standards.

President Donald Trump has made it clear that his energy agenda is about unleashing American energy, not holding it back. The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association supports the administration’s effort. We believe the United States should lead the world in energy production and environmental stewardship.

The Gulf of America is too important to be sidelined by misguided policy. Offshore energy production strengthens our economy, protects our coast and provides the energy security every American family depends on. Let’s defend it. Let’s grow it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

Energy Dome’s novel CO2 Battery can store excess clean energy and then dispatch it back to the grid for 8-24 hours, bridging the gap between when renewable energy is generated and when it is needed.

Why scale is crucial LDES, which Energy Dome is leading with its CO2 Battery, has the potential to commercialize much faster than some of the other advanced clean energy technologies in our portfolio.","Electricity powers modern life. And we’re accelerating a wide range of technologies, from enhanced geothermal to advanced nuclear to even fusion technologies, that can enable a future where on-demand electricity needs are met with clean energy, every hour of every day.

Today, we’re adding another technology to our portfolio: long duration energy storage (LDES). Through a new long-term partnership with Energy Dome, we plan to support multiple commercial projects globally to deploy their LDES technology.

Energy Dome’s novel CO2 Battery can store excess clean energy and then dispatch it back to the grid for 8-24 hours, bridging the gap between when renewable energy is generated and when it is needed. With this commercial partnership, as well as an investment in the company, we believe these projects can unlock new clean energy for grids where we operate before 2030, helping meet near-term electricity system needs and moving us closer to our 24/7 carbon-free energy goal.

By bringing this first-of-a-kind LDES technology to market faster, we aim to rapidly bring its potential to communities everywhere — making reliable, affordable electricity available around the clock and supporting the resilience of grids as they integrate growing amounts of renewable energy sources.

Why it’s important

Lithium-ion batteries, which typically store and dispatch power for 4 hours or less, have been critical for adding electricity capacity to grids and managing short-term fluctuations in renewable generation — when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. Google’s support for these shorter-duration batteries has helped the grids we rely on, from Belgium to Nevada, meet peak electricity demand and reduce the need to ramp up fossil fuel power plants.

But what if we could store and dispatch clean energy for more than a few hours, or even a full day? Studies by the Electric Power Research Institute show that LDES technologies can cost-effectively integrate a growing volume of renewables onto power systems and contribute to more flexible, reliable grids. The LDES Council estimates that deploying up to 8 terawatts (TW) of LDES by 2040 could result in $540 billion in annual savings globally, thanks in part to their ability to optimize grids.

How the technology works

Energy Dome’s novel approach to energy storage uses carbon dioxide (CO₂) held in a unique dome-shaped battery. When there's an abundance of renewable energy on the grid, the system uses that power to compress CO₂ gas into a liquid. When the grid needs more clean power, the liquid CO₂ expands back into a hot gas under pressure, creating a powerful force – much like steam escaping a pressure cooker – which spins a turbine. This spinning turbine generates carbon-free energy that can flow directly back into the grid for durations ranging from 8 to 24 hours.

Energy Dome has already demonstrated product-market fit by signing multiple contracts for commercial-scale projects in Italy, the US, and India. The technology has already proven successful, having injected electrons into the Italian grid for more than three years, thanks to their commercial demo facility, and now with their full-scale 20MW-200Wh commercial plant.

Why scale is crucial

LDES, which Energy Dome is leading with its CO2 Battery, has the potential to commercialize much faster than some of the other advanced clean energy technologies in our portfolio. This means we can use it in the near term to help the electricity system grow more flexibly and reliably, alongside other tools we’re developing, such as data center demand response.

By supporting multiple commercial deployments of Energy Dome’s technology globally, and making an investment in the company, we aim to bring this technology to scale faster and at lower costs. Beyond our long-term collaboration with Energy Dome, we plan to support a growing range of LDES technologies under development through both commercial agreements that can catalyze wider market adoption of more mature technologies, like Energy Dome’s, as well as earlier-stage investments.

To remove barriers to the deployment and commercialization of LDES and other advanced carbon-free energy technologies, we’re also advocating for clean energy policies, ensuring that energy markets fully value firm, flexible carbon-free technologies, and advancing policy measures that enable infrastructure essential for grid decarbonization and energy security.

We're excited to take this first step with Energy Dome to unlock the full potential of LDES. Our partnership will strengthen grid resilience while enabling us to power our technologies, grow our economies and keep the lights on in our homes with 24/7 clean energy.",https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Energy_SS.width-1300.png,N,,2025-07-25 10:00:31.696761

As part of this year’s program, APCSC will feature prominently with two speakers participating in the main stage agenda, engaging directly with U.S. and international stakeholders on the DRC’s evolving investment climate and energy opportunities.

In addition, the agency will host a dedicated DRC Roundtable on August 7 – an invite-only session for a select group of qualified investors, with applications open for those seeking to participate. The roundtable will provide a high-level platform to unpack emerging opportunities across power generation, grid infrastructure and mining-linked energy supply chains, while offering direct access to senior decision-makers shaping the country’s economic future.

APCSC enters USAEF 2025 on the back of a transformative year marked by strong action and an increasingly proactive approach to investor engagement. In April 2025, the agency signed a protocol with the Governor of Haut-Uélé Province, signaling its intention to support private investment into the region’s vast reserves of diamonds, copper, coltan and cassiterite. By coordinating infrastructure development alongside resource extraction, APCSC is laying the groundwork for an integrated value chain that connects local economies to national and cross-border energy markets.

The agency also played a central role in finalizing the renegotiation of the landmark Sino-Congolese infrastructure agreement in 2024, raising the total investment package from $3.2 billion to $7 billion and affirming the DRC’s 40% stake in key assets such as the Busanga hydroelectric dam. The agency’s leadership has maintained a strong emphasis on oversight and delivery, conducting on-site missions at the SICOMINES mining complex and Busanga power facility to ensure compliance with the renegotiated terms and to elevate standards of performance and accountability.

These moves reflect a broader shift in the DRC’s investment strategy – one rooted in transparency, institutional clarity and the strategic alignment of infrastructure with energy and resource development goals. Also in 2024, APCSC signed a historic agreement with SOCOF, the national fibre operator, to integrate fibre optic deployment into all relevant infrastructure corridors developed under the Sino-Congolese framework. The project aims to establish the digital backbone necessary to support smart energy systems, data connectivity and industrial growth, particularly in remote or resource-rich regions.

At USAEF 2025, APCSC’s participation reflects an open invitation to U.S. and global investors, partners and developers to take part in a new chapter of African energy advancement. With power generation at the center of the DRC’s ambitions – from hydro to solar, grid-scale to off-grid – the agency’s work offers a model for African nations seeking to pair natural resource wealth with long-term energy security and development impact. The DRC Roundtable will offer a rare opportunity to engage directly with the architects of this strategy, assess real-time project pipelines and form part of a collaborative, future-facing vision for investment.

Operating expenses also experienced a slight decrease of 1% to $2.95bn.

Income from operations plummeted by 42% to $923m, mainly affected by lower regulatory credit revenue, increased operating expenses due to AI and research and development (R&D) projects, and vehicle delivery decline.

Tesla has noted in the update letter that its lithium refining and cathode production plants are set to start production in 2025, aiming to onshore the production of critical battery materials in the US.

The company is also preparing to start domestic production of its first LFP cells for energy storage products later in 2025.

Tesla emphasises a “capex-efficient” approach to growing vehicle volumes, utilising current production capacity before expanding.

The anticipated launch of new vehicles in 2025, including “a more affordable model” in the first half of the year, remains on schedule.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick.
Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations.
The finding gave the agency more power to enforce environmental regulations.
This report was updated to include comments from David Cresson with the Louisiana Chemical Association.","GEISMAR - A recent proclamation from President Donald Trump will allow 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.

A week ago, Trump issued what the White House labeled “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” His action creates a two-year exemption to regulations the Environmental Protection Agency published in May, called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants – or the HON rule for short.

“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”

The Louisiana facilities now exempt from the HON Rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar plant

Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II plant, Plaquemine

Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge

Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville

Westlake Vinyl, Westlake

BASF Corp., Geismar

Rubicon, Geismar

Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles

TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville

Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace

Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles

DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Anne Rolfes, director of the environmental group Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick. If anything, it didn’t go far enough,” Rolfes said. “Our congressional delegation should be up in arms about the White House rollback, but instead they are doing as they have always done: serving the needs of the chemical industry instead of the health and safety of the people. It continues to be up to us – to ordinary people in Louisiana – to protect ourselves from this industry.”

David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said the organization’s members strive for regulations that provide environmental protection and regulatory certainty for industry. He sees president’s proclamation as a step toward that objective.

“The current regulations do not provide for a realistic timeline to make the changes needed to meet the standards set by the HON Rule,” Cresson said. “There are simply not enough contractors or equipment currently available to facilitate this nationwide manufacturing effort, and while our members are making strides to meet these requirements, time is needed for facilities to implement solutions safely and effectively without jeopardizing public safety.”

Many of the facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have a history of environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers arguably having the highest profile.

In February 2023, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging its neoprene operations “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare” for the cancer risks its chloroprene emissions pose.

The Biden administration demanded Denka reduce emissions of chloroprene and ethylene oxide, another carcinogen, at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days to bring down its toxic emission levels, compared with two years for facilities in other parts of the country.

Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.

Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed.

In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations. The EPA has identified five census tracts in the LaPlace area as having the highest exposure to chloroprene in the nation — all attributed to the Denka plant.

Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.

A July 2023 explosion at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine produced a fire that burned for nearly two days before being brought under control. The same facility saw a string of emergencies dating back to 2019. The unit involved in the explosion two years ago was involved in four previous unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, according to state records. The toxic compound is highly flammable and can cause kidney damage from prolonged exposure.

In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and forced nearby schools to place students under lockdown until a dark cloud of smoke over the Lake Charles area cleared. Federal records show the plant has an extensive history of spills, accidents and injured workers.

Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals for an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that resulted in a fire that burned 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to make synthetic materials and jet fuel.

Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, has argued the agency is authorized – but not mandated – to enforce the Clean Air Act, based on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Zeldin also wants to walk back the Endangerment Finding, a 2009 EPA declaration that greenhouse gases and certain pollutants pose a public health risk. The finding gave the agency more power to enforce environmental regulations.

Insiders are divided. - Grist.org,Rebecca Egan McCarthy,,,,,https://grist.org/energy/interior-department-rules-wind-solar/,"The department’s new guidelines for wind and solar developers now require all federal approvals for clean energy projects to undergo “elevated review” by Interior Secretary Doug Bergum, who was appointed by President Trump in January.
Experts who spoke to Grist say that this could create an unmanageable slowdown for developers and allow the administration to quietly kill wind and solar projects on public land.
Since only 4 percent of existing renewable energy projects are on public land, clean industry insiders who have interpreted the new policy narrowly are not yet panicking.
The Interior Department maintains a website called Information for Planning and Consultation, or IPaC, which developers often use to plan large-scale projects.
“The level of review here is so ridiculous.” Others say that, while the outlook for wind and solar has become much dimmer, the new Interior rules aren’t necessarily a kill shot.","The massive budget bill that President Trump signed into law earlier this month took aim at a robust system of tax credits that have aided the explosion of U.S. wind and solar energy in recent years. While the move was primarily intended to help enable the law’s extension of tax breaks for high-earning Americans, some Republicans felt the law did not go far enough in discouraging the growth of wind and solar power. Those holdouts, however, voted for the bill after saying they’d received assurances from President Trump that he’d use his executive authority to further stymie the energy sources.

“We believe we’re going to get 90-plus percent of all future projects terminated,” U.S. Representative Chip Roy of Texas told Politico after the bill passed. “And we talked to lawyers in the administration.”

Last week, Trump’s Department of the Interior announced what appeared to be a fulfillment of the president’s promise to his party’s right wing. The department’s new guidelines for wind and solar developers now require all federal approvals for clean energy projects to undergo “elevated review” by Interior Secretary Doug Bergum, who was appointed by President Trump in January.

The new guidelines include a granular outline of steps that will now require personal approval from Bergum’s office, rather than being delegated to department bureaucrats as had previously been customary. Experts who spoke to Grist say that this could create an unmanageable slowdown for developers and allow the administration to quietly kill wind and solar projects on public land. Some are even worried that the effect of the updated regulations will spill over into private projects, which sometimes have to consult with the Interior Department when their work bleeds into federal lands or a habitat for endangered species.

Since only 4 percent of existing renewable energy projects are on public land, clean industry insiders who have interpreted the new policy narrowly are not yet panicking. But those with a broader interpretation of the text — or those who suspect that the administration will take a broad interpretation — wonder if the new rules will amount to a de facto gag order on the industry. For now, only time will tell just how many of their fears come to pass.

Much of the memo’s power to wreak havoc for renewables depends on how strictly it’s enforced. The Interior Department maintains a website called Information for Planning and Consultation, or IPaC, which developers often use to plan large-scale projects. You type in the name of a locale, draw a border around the general area of your proposed project, and IPaC will tell you what kind of federal permitting you might need to move forward. (For example, it would flag if there are any protected wetlands or endangered species that would be affected by your development.) As of last week, the website now displays a pop-up warning users that “solar and wind projects are currently not eligible to utilize the Information for Planning and Consultation website.” This kind of opacity could make it especially hard for developers to plan for an endless bureaucratic battle with Interior.

“It’s one thing to take away our [tax] credits, but it’s another to basically just put impediments so projects can’t get built,” a source who works for a renewables developer told E&E News. (He was granted anonymity due to his ongoing professional engagement with the federal government.) “The level of review here is so ridiculous.”

Others say that, while the outlook for wind and solar has become much dimmer, the new Interior rules aren’t necessarily a kill shot. “I was personally very worried when I saw it come out,” said Jason Kaminsky, CEO of kWh Analytics, a solar risk management firm. “But after doing more reading, it does seem like it affects, hopefully, a minority of assets.”

An internal report from the investment bank and research firm Roth Capital Partners, which was obtained by Grist, estimated that only 5 percent of projects on private land — specifically, those that require an easement or need to cross public land to connect a transmission line to the main electrical grid — would be affected by the new regulations.

“If [projects are on] a private piece of land, that’s a totally different story that would not be impacted by this,” said Doug Vine, director of energy analysis at the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. “There’s plenty of projects that are going to go ahead.”

Others warn that it will be hard to know anything for certain until the dust clears and the permitting process begins to play out. “Just how broad and wide-scoped the activities listed in the memo were, points towards an attempt to quash [private] projects, not just the ones on federal land,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at the clean energy think tank Energy Innovations, noting that developers often end up consulting the Interior Department on issues like wildlife protection.

Regardless of the scope of the memo, any move with the potential to slow the deployment of renewables is almost certainly bad news for American energy, since most other sources of new electricity simply aren’t being built: 93 percent of new energy that came online in 2024 was renewable. But upon taking office, President Trump warned that the United States was reliant on a “precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply” and immediately set about revoking previously approved federal funding from green energy projects, trying to cancel offshore wind leases, and rescinding clean energy tax credits that had been expanded by his predecessor. How this will lead the nation toward the current administration’s promise of “energy dominance” is unclear.

“You don’t have enough [electricity] supply to meet new demand,” said O’Brien. “Instead of new capacity coming online — cheap renewables — you have existing gas plants running longer, and so gas demand goes up and prices go up, both for power plants and for household consumers. … All signs point toward this being a bad, bad scenario.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Desert-Sunlight-Solar-Farm.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-07-25 04:58:40.375083

The CDK Global study also found that EV owners increasingly tap into the service departments’ mobile vans and pick-up services.
Last year, 19% of EV owners who needed a service visit opted for mobile service, up from 14% in 2023.
The study revealed that it takes more time to get an EV fixed than a gas car, with Tesla owners saying they had to wait 23% more time to get their cars back from the service compared to a gas car.
What’s more, 85% of EV owners said they had to go to the dealer in the first year of ownership for some kind of repair or maintenance.","Keeping an EV in tip-top condition is cheaper than a gas car.

Owners say they had to pay less than they thought initially.

However, an EV needs more time in the service department.

We’ve known for a long time that electric cars are cheaper to run than comparable combustion vehicles. Thanks to lower maintenance costs and fewer things to go wrong, an EV can save owners thousands of dollars every year–as long as it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg to charge it, that is.

Now, though, thanks to new data from CDK Global, we can see just how much cheaper it is to repair an EV compared to a gas-burning car. The company’s recent “EV Ownership Study” polled consumers between December 2024 and January 2025, according to Automotive News, and found that EV owners mistakenly believe that it would be more expensive to run a battery-powered car than one that burns fuel.

Tesla Service

After a few service visits, the mentality shifts, though, with 53% of non-Tesla EV owners saying it costs less to service their car compared to a gasoline vehicle, while 41% of Tesla owners felt the same.

The CDK Global study also found that EV owners increasingly tap into the service departments’ mobile vans and pick-up services. Last year, 19% of EV owners who needed a service visit opted for mobile service, up from 14% in 2023. Meanwhile, 9% of owners had their cars picked up by the dealership in 2024, up from 6% a year before. As a result, the number of people who took their cars to the dealership went down from 86% in 2023 to 83% last year.

This is good news, but it’s not perfect. The study revealed that it takes more time to get an EV fixed than a gas car, with Tesla owners saying they had to wait 23% more time to get their cars back from the service compared to a gas car. It’s worse for non-Tesla owners, who reported they had to wait 34% more to get their EVs back.

“We know dealers are prepared for EV service, but our most recent findings show EV owners are waiting longer to have their cars serviced and it’s taking multiple visits to have their issue resolved,” said David Thomas, director of content marketing and automotive industry analyst at CDK. “The fact that these numbers are getting worse is not a good sign, as more non-Tesla EVs are on the road than ever before.”

How long did it take from when an EV was dropped off for service to the completion of servicing?

Source: CDK Global EV Ownership Study

In 2023, 40% of EVs that had to go in for a fix could be picked up by the customer on the same day, but that number has gone down to just 28% in 2024. Meanwhile, the number of EVs that were fixed and could be picked up the following day went up from 21% to 29%.

What’s more, 85% of EV owners said they had to go to the dealer in the first year of ownership for some kind of repair or maintenance. The good news here is that just 13% of owners said they had to pay for their service, while 16% said their service appointment was for a recall.

With more and more non-Tesla EVs hitting the streets as sales continue to rise, it will be a challenge for traditional automakers to step up to the challenge of servicing the EVs they sell. In Tesla’s case, it has its own service departments that only deal with Tesla EVs.

Between 2020 and 2024, the number of public EV charging ports available to U.S. drivers doubled, reaching nearly 200,000 by the end of last year, according to International Energy Agency data. Northeast states have the highest charger density by far, with Massachusetts at the top of the list.

It’s solid growth, though significantly slower than other regions that have embraced EVs more wholeheartedly. In Europe and China, both of which are adopting EVs much faster than the U.S., public chargers roughly quadrupled over the same period.

Even though an estimated 80% of charging happens at home in the U.S., concerns about a lack of public charging infrastructure have dogged EV adoption for years. American drivers consistently cite the issue, or its close cousins, like a fear that EVs are no good for road trips, as among the top reasons they are unlikely to get an electric car.

That’s why widely available public EV charging ports are so important to the transition to electric vehicles — a shift that needs to happen for the U.S. to clean up transportation, its biggest source of carbon emissions.

If the number of public plugs continues to grow at the rate observed in recent years, the industry would have over half a million public charging ports available by 2030, enough to meet a goal set by the Biden administration years ago.

That might be a big ​“if” under President Donald Trump.

Since taking office in January, Trump has tried to freeze billions of dollars’ worth of federal funding for public EV charging authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. A judge ruled last month that the administration must turn the spigot back on. The program was already sluggish to begin with, having funded the installation of just a couple hundred charging ports over the last four years, and the Trump turmoil has only thrown more sand in its gears.

Then there’s the possibility that EV sales slow down in the U.S. after Sept. 30, when Trump’s megabill eliminates federal tax credits for consumers. Fewer EVs hitting the road could undermine the economic case for companies to build new charging stations.

Still, it’s true that chargers are becoming a more familiar sight for drivers — especially those in the Northeast. As time goes on, that familiarity should help erode the stubborn perception that EVs are unworkable, and help push more and more people to embrace electric, emissions-free driving.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=2e255505741cbbe3991a1e2fc42238fc,N,,2025-07-25 04:58:18.917466

Trump’s monolithic One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has far-reaching consequences; the country’s energy mix is one of them.

And with its passing on July 4, it shook up the investment landscape, casting a fog of uncertainty onto what had been a prosperous playground for renewables and energy investors under Biden’s carefully constructed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Or at least, that’s certainly the case for global investors considering their stakes in the US.

Gutted investment prospects

“What we’ve seen from the investors and customers that we’ve talked to is that the international players who have development portfolios across the globe are asking the question right now of: ‘Should we be decreasing the amount of money that we put in the US and moving it to other regions?’”

So said Chris Seiple, Wood Mackenzie senior research vice president, Power & Renewables, during a webinar on the policy’s market impact.

And it only makes sense, right?

For certain clean tech sectors in the US, Trump’s policy is going to gut investment prospects.

Tax credits set up by Biden’s IRA now have different expiry dates depending on the technology in question.

Take the EV sector, for example, which is going to take a particularly intense blow.

According to reportage by Paul Gerke, content director of Factor This, the bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for buyers of new EVs, and up to $4,000 for buyers of used EVs.

EV tax credits are set to go away on September 30.

E-mobility, particularly the EV battery segment, in the US has seen significant growth strides over recent years, and so the cut is likely going to scar.

According to research from Rho Motion, just over half of EVs sold in the US this year have been eligible for the tax credit, meaning there is an expected rise in EV sales before the elimination of the tax credit, which will be followed by a sharp decline in demand.

Additionally, according to Tom Moerenhout, professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, the cuts to tax credits could also reduce demand for critical minerals and batteries, in turn making financing for such projects more difficult.

Europe, of course, saw its EV battery supply chain investors flock to the US for the incentives under the IRA; so, how will they react now that the tables have turned?

Most likely, they will look to China instead, but perhaps there is hope on European shores for renewed prospects in the sector.

Why data centres are powering up investor interest

Unattractive prospects for renewables

For technologies like clean energy storage, the sentence is a bit more lenient, with battery energy storage (BESS) tech credits extended through to 2033.

But for renewables projects, namely solar and wind, the story is less optimistic.

Credits will be terminated for such projects that are ‘placed in service’ after 2027, unless they begin construction within a year after OBBBA’s enactment, according to a breakdown by market intelligence platform CTVC.

In terms of investor sentiment, Seiple said, the underlying fundamentals indicate that the market for investors in this area is going to change significantly.

“[We] have a situation where the cost of fossil generation is much higher in Europe and Asia than in the US and the cost of renewables is lower … than it is here. If you’re sitting in Europe or Asia, there’s not a lot of dependable gas suppliers, so for security of supply reasons [there] is another reason to choose renewables over choosing natural gas generation.

“The underlying fundamentals are more attractive,” added Seiple, who described how players with global development portfolios are now considering where to move their money.

Seiple cited Engie as one such company that has publicly spoken about considering that choice, “and I think some others are leaning in that direction at this point.

“I just returned from a three-week trip to Asia [for a] meeting with Korean and Japanese investors, and I get the sense a lot of them are just waiting to see how all of this uncertainty plays out before they make decisions about where their investment dollars are going to flow to.”

Certainty and competitiveness

In some ways, actually, Trump’s OBBBA creates certainty for investors. The policy has been ruled into law and indeed, the country’s energy agenda is set.

Now, as the situation unfolds, what will be key is to see where investors look for new prospects.

Could this be Europe, where renewable prices are significantly cheaper than the land of ‘drill, baby, drill’?

So said EDP and EDPR chief executive officer Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, on social media platform Linkedin: “In the US, the signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law brings an end to a period of significant regulatory uncertainty for renewables.

“…at EDP we see Europe’s competitiveness and the energy transition, not on parallel tracks, but one and the same. Clean energy is the backbone of a safe, resilient, and productive economy. This positioning is grounded.

“From clean energy and industrial decarbonisation to capital markets and strategic alliances, the message I heard in Brussels is clear: Europe has the political will. What it needs now is unity, scale and speed.”

What do you think? Does Europe have the political will? Or will Asia, which has been the key competition globally for years without signs of slowing down, be the place to take the dollars?

Reach out and let me know so that I can feature your thoughts in the Power Playbook.

Cheers,

4 MW installation will offset 30% carbon generation across five Eaton facilities and accelerate progress toward company’s sustainability goals.

Intelligent power management company Eaton is adding a new clean energy project to drive carbon reduction at its operations in Wisconsin, advancing its commitment to achieve net zero operations by 2050. The joint project with We Energies, a subsidiary of WEC Energy Group, and Eaton will help strengthen energy security, deliver cost-effective power to the grid, and reduce Eaton’s carbon footprint at five locations in Wisconsin, where the company conducts research and makes electrical infrastructure for utility, data center, large commercial and industrial applications.

Once energized in early 2026, the 4-megawatt solar project located adjacent to Eaton’s Thomas A. Edison Technical Center is expected to meet 30% of the annual carbon reduction goals at five Eaton sites in Franksville, South Milwaukee, Menomonee Falls and two Waukesha facilities. Combined with previous energy efficiency upgrades, the initiative will support a 58% reduction in Eaton’s greenhouse gas emissions across the state since 2018.

“At Eaton, we’re tackling the energy transition from all angles — including right here in Wisconsin, where we produce the technologies essential to modernize the grid and support a cleaner, more resilient energy future,” said Guillaume Laur, senior vice president and general manager of Power Delivery and Regulation, Electrical Sector at Eaton. “Around the world, we’re leveraging the global megatrends of electrification and digitalization to unlock greater operational and environmental value from energy systems. This project marks another important milestone on our journey and there is much more to come.”

Under the agreement, We Energies will build, own and operate the system on Eaton’s behalf.

On July 4, 2025, the legislation commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA or H.R. 1) became law. Much of the initial commentary on the OBBBA's energy provisions has focused on the rollback or modification of various tax credits for US consumers (e.g., Sections 25C (energy efficient home improvement credit), 25D (residential clean energy credit), 25E (used clean vehicle credit), and 45L (new energy efficient home credit)). However, H.R. 1 also has far-reaching implications for foreign investors and manufacturers and investments in industrial-scale energy storage projects, including battery energy storage systems (BESS) and related components and technologies.

Our focus here is on H.R. 1's extension and expansion of pre-existing foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions for each of the tax credits most likely be relevant to large-scale energy storage projects under Sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X of the Internal Revenue Code. These restrictions introduce significant new risk, compliance, and due diligence obligations for affected entities and generally mark an escalation in the restrictions applicable to investors from the People's Republic of China (PRC), a covered nation under the regulations.

Key takeaways include the following:

H.R. 1 significantly rolls back or repeals many of the clean energy tax credits and incentives introduced with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, but energy storage projects are generally not as severely impacted as wind and solar, as energy storage projects beginning construction before 2033 remain eligible for key credits.

However, H.R. 1's sweeping new restrictions on ""Prohibited Foreign Entities"" are specifically designed to restrict investment by PRC investors and reliance upon PRC manufacturers. It is not immediately clear how significant an impact these new restrictions will have on the development of energy storage capacity in the United States.

The prohibition on ""material assistance"" by Prohibited Foreign Entities for most projects that begin construction after 2025 imposes complex due diligence requirements on taxpayers to determine the ""material assistance cost ratio"" for qualified facilities, energy storage technologies, or eligible components—essentially, the share of a project's direct costs that are attributable to inputs from Prohibited Foreign Entities.

The prohibition on ownership by Prohibited Foreign Entities will require taxpayers to seek more expansive disclosure of the ownership structure of foreign suppliers, including the entities that hold the debt of such suppliers. Relatedly, the prohibition on ""effective control"" by Prohibited Foreign Entities will require taxpayers to reevaluate and potentially revise their contractual and licensing arrangements with key foreign suppliers from the PRC and elsewhere to assess whether such suppliers possess any of the wide range of rights that may be deemed to constitute ""effective control"" under the statute. Notably, a taxpayer'sentry into or modification of a licensing agreement with a ""Specified Foreign Entity"" after July 4, 2025 will be considered as providing that Specified Foreign Entity with ""effective control"" within the meaning of H.R. 1.

As discussed below, further guidance from the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected. However, as a general matter, the broader disclosure and labelling of entities as ""Prohibited Foreign Entities"" required under H.R. 1 could have broader implications for companies, as the statute effectively creates a new category of PRC-linked entities that may draw greater US government scrutiny outside of the tax context.

New restrictions on ""Prohibited Foreign Entities"" under H.R. 1

H.R. 1 expands the FEOC restrictions by introducing the new concept of ""Prohibited Foreign Entities"" (PFEs), which includes any ""Specified Foreign Entity"" (SFE) or ""Foreign-Influenced Entity"" (FIE). As a general matter:

Status as either a SFE or FIE—or receipt of ""material assistance"" from a SFE or a FIE—disqualifies a taxpayer from eligibility for key tax credits such as those under Sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X.

However, FIE status is derivative of a connection to a SFE and is therefore generally more complex to determine, as it turns on issues such as indirect control or debt thresholds.

In brief, although the tax-related penalties for SFE or FIE are substantially similar, companies will face the burden of properly classifying relevant entities and updating such determinations for each taxable year in which a credit is claimed.

A. Specified Foreign Entities

The term SFE is defined more broadly than FEOC. It includes any of the following entities:

The government of, or any entity organized in, or with a principal place of business in, a covered country (i.e., the PRC, Russia, Iran, North Korea), or any person who is a citizen or national of those countries (excluding US citizens, nationals, and residents), or any entity owned, directly or indirectly, 50% or more by such persons. Any PRC company or 50-50 joint venture with a PRC company is therefore an SFE.

Entities or persons included on US national security or sanctions lists, i.e., entities that have been specifically designated by US authorities, such as:

The SDN List;

The FTO List;

The Chinese military companies list (CMC List) of companies designated pursuant to Section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021; and

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List (UFLPA Entity List) maintained by US Customs and Border Protection.

Seven Chinese battery manufacturers and their successors, which are expressly named in Section 154(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (Public Law 118–31) (available here);

Entities identified by the Attorney General as having been convicted of offenses under certain national security statutes;

Any entity ""controlled"" by the government, agency, instrumentality, citizen or national, or entity organized under the laws of the PRC, Russia, Iran, or North Korea (excluding certain publicly traded entities).

The term ""control"" refers to ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50 percent of the stock of a corporation; or ownership of more than 50 percent of the profits interests or capital interests in a partnership; or for any other corporate structure, ownership of more than 50 percent of the beneficial interests in the entity. As a practical matter, entities with a more complex structure may face a more onerous compliance burden, since companies must identify direct and indirect owners, including through holding companies, trusts, and beneficial ownership. Since PFE status is generally determined at the end of the taxable year, companies must in principle make an annual determination regarding PFE status.

B. Foreign-Influenced Entities

In addition to SFEs, H.R. 1 imposes restrictions related to FIEs (other than certain publicly traded entities). An entity may be deemed a FIE using one of two tests.

Under the first test, a FIE is any entity for which any of the following were true, in the relevant taxable year:

An SFE had direct authority to appoint a covered officer of the entity (e.g., a member of the Board or executive level officer);

An SFE owned at least 25% of the entity;

One or more SFEs owned in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more specified foreign entities.

Under the second test, an entity will be deemed to be a FIE if, in the previous taxable year, it made a payment to a SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entities the SFE (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over any of the following:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer);

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer) for the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or for the production of an eligible component that is not an applicable critical mineral.

The second test does not state whether an entity deemed to be a FIE for a given taxable year is only deemed to be a FIE with respect to the single project implicated by the above test, or whether the entity will be deemed a FIE for all credits claimed by that entity in connection with unrelated projects. Since FIE status can be triggered by a single payment, the broader interpretation that FIE status, once obtained, is not project- or contract-specific and instead applies to all credits, could have significant implications for affected companies.

H.R. 1 defines ""effective control"" differently (i) before guidance has been issued; (ii) after guidance has been issued; and (iii) in the context of licensing arrangements. Before guidance has been issued, ""effective control"" means the ""unrestricted contractual right"" of a counterparty to do any of the following:

determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty; or

on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity.

OBBBA provides that guidance will be issued no later than December 31, 2026 as necessary to carry out the purposes of this provision, including anti-avoidance rules.

Finally, in the context of a licensing agreement for intellectual property in connection with a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component, the term ""effective control"" refers to any of the following:

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity;

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

The foregoing does not apply with respect to a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property.

Impact of ""Prohibited Foreign Entities"" restrictions on energy storage projects post-H.R. 1

For each of the below categories of credit (among others), H.R. 1 imposes two substantial new restrictions: (i) the ""material assistance"" restrictions; and (ii) the ownership restrictions. In addition, Section 48E credits are subject to a 10-year recapture or clawback penalty.

The ""material assistance"" restrictions apply to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025, while the ownership restrictions apply to credits claimed for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 for SFEs and beginning after July 4, 2027 for FIEs.

A. Tax credits relevant for energy storage projects

Among others, the following three tax credits are especially relevant to energy storage projects. All are impacted by the Prohibited Foreign Entities restrictions introduced in H.R. 1:

Section 45Y. The Clean Electricity Production Credit under Section 45Y (the PTC), 26 U.S.C. § 45Y, permits a taxpayer to obtain a tax credit based upon the quantity of clean electricity generated and sold by ""qualified facility"" that is placed in service after December 31, 2024. The credit is awarded per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of clean electricity produced.

Section 48E. The Clean Energy Investment Tax Credit under Section 48E (the ITC), 26 U.S.C. § 48E, permits a taxpayer to obtain a tax credit for a ""qualified facility"" or ""qualified energy storage technology"" that is placed in service after December 31, 2024. Section 48E's ITC, when combined with bonus credits or ""adders"" for domestic content and location, has been a key driver of growth in the battery storage sector in the United States.H.R. 1 increases the level of required domestic content needed to qualify for this adder which could also have an impact on purchases from foreign entities.

Section 45X. The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X (the AMPC), 26 U.S.C. § 45X, permits a taxpayer to obtain a tax credit for ""eligible components""; it is a per-unit incentive for US manufacturers of components for clean energy projects such as batteries, battery cells, modules, and critical minerals, which is aimed at fostering the development of domestic sources and supply chains. The credit is structured as a dollar amount per component, per watt, or as a percent of cost, depending upon the specific item.

B. Material assistance restrictions under H.R. 1

The above credits are not available if a PFE provided ""material assistance"" in the construction of the relevant facility or component. While the ""material assistance"" rules do not apply to Section 45Y or 48E credits for projects that begin construction before December 31, 2025, the Section 45X credit will be unavailable if the eligible components were produced with ""material assistance"" from a PFE in any taxable year after July 4, 2025.

The ""material assistance"" provisions are triggered when the ""material assistance cost ratio"" falls below the given threshold percentage. The concept of the ""cost ratio"" is designed to establish a floor for the percentage of a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component that is not attributable to ""material assistance"" from a PFE. These non-PFE floors are increased each year, with the goal of decreasing the percentage of PFE-derived content over time. For example, the threshold percentage for qualified facilities under Sections 45Y and 48E for facilities the construction of which begins in 2026 is 40%. This means that just under 60% of the qualified facility can be attributable to material assistance from a PFE.

In practice, applying the ""material assistance cost ratio"" involves two essential steps:

First, the taxpayer must calculate the percentage of the ""total direct costs"" that are not attributable to items mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs.

For qualified facilities and energy storage technologies, the cost ratio is defined by reference to the total direct costs to the taxpayer of all ""manufactured products"" (including components) that are incorporated into a qualified facility or energy storage technology (Costs) and that portion of the Costs that represent products mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE (PFE Costs). The formula is as follows:

For eligible components by reference to the total direct material costs that are paid or incurred (within the meaning of section 461 and any regulations issued under section 263A) by the taxpayer for production of such eligible component (Component Costs) and that portion of the eligible components that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE (PFE Component Costs). The formula is as follows:

Second, the percentage obtained in step 1 (the Non-PFE Percentage) must be compared against the schedules provided in H.R. 1 (the Threshold Percentage). If the Non-PFE Percentage is lower than the applicable Threshold Percentage, the taxpayer cannot claim the credit. The Threshold Percentages for qualified facilities, energy storage technologies, and battery components are summarized below:

*The years refers to the ""beginning of construction,"" which is well-established in IRS guidance. However, on July 7, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order 14315 (""Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources"") that, among other things, instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue new and revised guidance as he deems appropriate ""to ensure that policies concerning the 'beginning of construction' are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

*The years refer to the year in which the eligible component is sold.

H.R. 1 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue ""safe harbor tables"" or other guidance no later than December 31, 2026 that will identify the total direct costs of any manufactured product or eligible component attributable to a PFE and provide all rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE.. Prior to the issuance of the safe harbor tables:

The taxpayer may use the tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 to establish the percentage of total direct costs for any manufactured product or eligible component;

Rely on certification provided by the supplier of the manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or sub-component regarding (i) the total direct costs or total direct material costs not attributable to a PFE; or (ii) that such product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

Notwithstanding the above, if the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a PFE, the taxpayer ""shall treat all direct costs with respect to such manufactured product, or all direct material costs with respect to such eligible component, as attributable to a [PFE]""; and if the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the certification is inaccurate, the taxpayer may not rely upon it.

The statute of limitations is extended to 6 years, and increased penalties apply with respect to material assistance issues. This includes penalties on suppliers for providing non-complying certifications.

C. Ownership restrictions under H.R. 1

In addition to the material assistance restrictions, H.R. 1 effectively precludes SFEs or FIEs from (i) owning or having ""effective control"" over a qualified facility under Section 45Y; (ii) owning or having ""effective control"" over a qualified facility or energy storage technology under Section 48E; and (iii) owning or having ""effective control"" over any eligible component.

As a practical matter, this means:

Certain foreign investors (including from the PRC) are effectively precluded from owning or controlling investments that rely upon the referenced tax credits;

The ""effective control"" provisions mean that, even where a PRC investor has no equity interest in the project, contractual rights that permit the PRC investor to exercise any of the functions listed above with respect to a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or eligible component may implicate or render the project as a whole ineligible for the relevant tax credits.

D. Recapture / clawback penalties under Section 48E

Finally, H.R. 1 imposes a strict recapture or clawback rule on taxpayers that claim the ITC for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 under Section 48E but are found to violate the PFE-related restrictions on payments to SFEs.

Specifically, if, during the 10-year period after a project for which a taxpayer has claimed the ITC is placed in service, the taxpayer makes an ""applicable payment"" to a SFE, the taxpayer must repay all of the ITC benefit that it has received for that project. Applicable payments include direct or indirect payments or contractual arrangements made to a SFE that could confer ""effective control"" upon that entity.

The Department of Energy budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration are leading national labs like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to each consider laying off up to 1,000 employees, according to recent reports.

The group Friends of PNNL, which includes several former PNNL employees, said July 13 in the Tri-City Herald that the lab is considering laying off around 1,100 employees, and Politico reported Wednesday that NREL could let more than 1,000 people go.

DOE’s congressional budget justification for 2026 suggests dropping NREL’s total budget from $686 million to $299 million, and dropping PNNL’s from $829 million to $548 million.

Dive Insight:

DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich noted that “most of the national labs are operated by third-party contractors” and have discretion with personnel decisions, so the department can’t “confirm anonymously leaked ‘estimations’ of layoffs made by third-party contractors.”

“As Secretary Wright has said repeatedly, the Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” Dietderich said.

For nearly all national labs, the Trump administration’s proposed budget would zero out the funding they receive from DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. For NREL, the budget proposes the lab receive $268 million in EERE funding next year, compared with $589 million this year.

NREL is “primarily funded” by EERE, said Heather Lammers, a public and media relations manager at the laboratory.

“We are currently working with DOE to understand the impacts of the FY25 spend plan,” Lammers said, referring to the president’s megabill. “At the same time, the FY26 appropriations process continues to move forward. We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and sustainable energy future.”

Under the proposed budget, PNNL would see its 2025 EERE funding of $141 million zeroed out in 2026.

“We have heard informally that this could mean more than 1,000 people at PNNL could lose their jobs,” Friends of PNNL said in a July 14 statement.

The explanation is that Denmark’s high electricity costs stem primarily from taxes, which comprise 41% of the retail price.","We’ve been posting a lot recently about how renewables lower electricity costs. Last week, Zeke posted about the impact of renewables on U.S. electricity prices. In response to that, several people pointed us to a figure that seems to show something different:

The plot shows a clear correlation between retail cost of electricity and the fraction of renewable energy for many countries around the world.

So does this mean that renewable energy actually raises the price of electricity?

confirmation

First, I wanted to verify the figure, so I downloaded the data for Europe and plotted retail price vs. renewable fraction (the fraction of electricity produced by wind and solar):

This closely resembles Figure 1, confirming that the legitimacy of the correlation in the original plot.

But … the world of science is littered with the corpses of scientific analyses that assumed correlation proves causality. It does not.

a better calculation

Figs. 1 and 2 plot the retail price, which includes many things besides the cost of generating power. It also includes network costs (transmission and distribution) and taxes + fees.

A better analysis would use the cost of generating power in order to isolate the impact of renewables. We can get a better estimate of that by using the wholesale price of electricity:

The plot shows that the correlation between price and renewable fraction has entirely disappeared. To the extent that a relation exists, increasing renewable fraction decreases the wholesale cost of power.

The plot also shows that the cost of generation is generally a small part of the total cost of electricity.

it’s the price of natural gas, stupid

This lack of correlation is expected given how wholesale energy markets price electricity. In countries that utilize wholesale power markets, it is the most expensive generator that sets the wholesale price. This is almost always a natural gas generator.

Thus, the wholesale price of electricity is mainly determined by the price of natural gas. This relationship can be illustrated by plotting Germany’s wholesale electricity prices against natural gas prices over the past decade:

Next time someone says, “Germany installed a lot of wind and solar and it’s electricity prices skyrocketed,” you can let them know that was a consequence of increases in the price of natural gas.

Every country in Europe has a similar regression, as do many other markets, such as ERCOT.

why do we see a correlation between retail price and renewable fraction

Given this, why is there a correlation in Figs. 1 and 2 between cost and renewable fraction? We know it’s not due to the wholesale price, leaving network costs (e.g., transmission) and taxes + fees.

My hypothesis is that the correlation stems from wealthier countries having both higher renewable adoption and higher tax rates on electricity.

Consider Denmark, for example. It plays a key role in the regression in Figs. 1 and 2 by having both very high price and also high renewable fraction, thereby anchoring one end of the regression.

But Fig. 3 shows that its wholesale price of power is the same as everywhere else. The explanation is that Denmark’s high electricity costs stem primarily from taxes, which comprise 41% of the retail price.

Conversely, countries with very low retail prices are typically developing nations or major oil producers, which have few renewable generators and also heavily subsidize electricity costs.

conclusions

tl;dr: Climate misinformers want you to believe that correlation shows causality, but a deeper investigation shows that renewables do not appear to be increasing the cost of energy generation.

This makes sense since electricity costs on today’s grids are mainly set by the price of natural gas. Taxes also can have a big impact on retail prices.

All of the actual evidence we have is that adding renewables reduces the cost of electricity.

notes

Misinformers also want to blame subsidies for this. Claims about subsidies distorting this analysis require quantitative evidence and must include comparable data on fossil fuel subsidies. Show me your analysis.

Zeke’s post last week shows that there is no correlation between renewables and retail price. You might be wondering why the U.S. see the same correlation seen in Europe (Fig. 2). My hypothesis is that U.S. states are homogenous enough in the taxes they charge that the correlation does not appear.

The U.S. energy markets show the same thing:

Some offset programs contain additionality clauses, which nix payment for prior practices farmers use to slash greenhouse gas emissions.
Others contain permanence clauses that pay farmers for greenhouse gas-reducing practices for a certain duration.
Unlike current carbon programs, there’s no contract to sign, nor are farmers who have installed prior greenhouse gas-sapping practices excluded.
“This is an opportunity to pay farmers for practices they have been doing for a while,” he says.","Late in 2022, Mitchell Hora found an obscure spark that could ignite new revenues for farmers tucked inside the massive Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

“It was a light-bulb moment for me,” says Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag. While perusing the IRA, he found Section 45Z, which grants federal tax credits to biofuel manufacturers who make low-carbon fuels.

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. This includes greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane that can fuel climate change.

The fewer emissions used to produce a gallon of biofuel, such as ethanol or biodiesel, the more tax credits — and money — biofuel companies glean. Farmers play a part in reducing these emissions since the answer is literally under their feet. Soil health practices they implement — such as cover crops, reduced tillage and efficient fertilizer use — also can reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions.

Currently, nothing in Section 45Z states that biofuel producers must share the money from tax credits with anyone. Still, Hora thinks they will share it with farmers, grain merchandisers, third-party verifiers and others. He estimates tax credits potentially could be worth more than $100 per acre in sharable value.

“[Section 45 Z] could be absolutely game-changing for my family's farm and other family farms across the country,” he says. “I think it’s going to have a ripple effect that changes global agriculture.”

How so?

Voluntary programs that pay farmers to adopt practices to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases gained momentum in the late 2010s. One type — offset programs — pays farmers for soil health strategies to offset greenhouse gases emitted by companies making their products.

It’s not that simple, though. Some offset programs contain additionality clauses, which nix payment for prior practices farmers use to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

“If a producer switched from conventional tillage to no-till 20 years ago and picked up cover crops a decade ago, they're actually precluded from participating in a lot of these carbon markets,” says Sean McMahon, U.S. sustainability manager for FarmersEdge, a Canadian firm that provides agribusinesses and crop insurers technology services.

Others contain permanence clauses that pay farmers for greenhouse gas-reducing practices for a certain duration. A farmer who converted to greenhouse gas-sequestering no-till would void a contract if they switched to tillage, according to a University of Wisconsin Extension analysis.

“Some of these programs in a voluntary carbon [offset] market have a lot of red tape and hurdles,” Hora says.

That’s not so with potential Section 45Z payments. Unlike current carbon programs, there’s no contract to sign, nor are farmers who have installed prior greenhouse gas-sapping practices excluded.

Instead, potential payments are tied to the carbon footprint of each bushel a farmer grows, Hora says. The lower a farmer’s CI score, the higher the payments.

This appeals to Josh Nelson, who farms near Belmond, Iowa.

“This is an opportunity to pay farmers for practices they have been doing for a while,” he says. “Under [Section] 45Z, you could potentially get a payment for soil health practices that improve your CI score.”

All this ties into hungry global demand for low-carbon fuels, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

“Almost every major market that we see requires low-carbon ethanol,” he says. “The aviation industry wants it. Marine vessel fleets want it. The railroad industry wants locomotives that can generate electricity from low-carbon ethanol instead of diesel fuel.”

Biofuel win

Section 45Z was a winner in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. Provisions include:

an extension of biofuel tax credits through 2029 (Initially, they were set to expire in 2027.)

a mandate that tax credits apply only to North American feedstocks such as corn and soybeans (It excludes foreign feedstocks, such as those used to make Chinese cooking oil.)

tax credit transferability (This allows biofuel producers to sell credits they can't directly use.)

ADDITIONAL REVENUE: Although corn prices are depressed due to a monster crop on the way, carbon intensification scoring under Section 45Z may unlock new revenue opportunities for farmers.

Congress also eliminated a part of the full life-cycle analysis within Section 45Z called indirect land use change (ILUC). This modeling method calculates how potential changes in economic demand for a crop affects global land use, says Karen Boyd, World Energy director of product sustainability. She says it’s important to remember that ILUC is just an economic model based on possible changes in future demand and cannot be directly measured or affected by an individual.

“If you grow soybeans, [45Z-induced production] may create additional demand for soybean oil due to it being utilized to produce fuel,” Boyd says.

ILUC modeling shows how this potential fuel use may impact land use for other soybean uses. It may mean land demand to grow soybeans for food and other purposes could come from areas such as a Brazilian rain forest converted into new farmland, she says.

CI scoring specifics

CI scoring works on a sliding scale for fuel, grain and oilseeds. Average CI scores include:

gasoline: 100

ethanol: 55

corn: 29.1

Biofuels companies could earn a 2-cent-per-CI-point reduction per gallon under the Section 45Z tax credit, Shaw says.

Nixing the ILUC alone will reduce the CI score for a typical Midwestern ethanol plant from 55 to 45, Shaw says. If combined with a 10-cent-per-gallon tax credit, an ethanol plant that annually produces 100 million gallons of ethanol could glean $10 million. Plants could use this money to pay farmers and others, upgrade capacity or make plant improvements.

“With these changes, I think the vast majority of ethanol plants are going to be able to qualify for the tax credits,” Shaw says.

Meanwhile, corn producers can lower their 29.1 CI score through various greenhouse gas-slashing practices. Nelson has lowered his CI score for corn to 5 by:

planting cover crops on a share of his acres

strip-tilling and no-tilling corn

implementing a three-crop rotation including corn, soybeans and small grains (oats/rye)

reducing nitrogen application to approximately 0.6 pounds per bushel for corn

applying hog manure as a nutrient source

improving fertilizer management using soil tests such as one for pre-sidedressed soil nitrate

Unknowns

Still, many unknowns exist, as Section 45Z now goes to the Treasury Department’s Internal Revenue Service to write regulations. The Treasury Department may consult with USDA and the Department of Energy, which were previously involved with Section 45Z provisions. Since it’s a tax issue, however, the Treasury Department has final say.

“Without final Treasury regulations, it’s difficult to predict exactly how farmers will benefit,” Shaw says.

Shaw believes the Treasury Department will create a pathway for farmers to receive individualized CI scores for low-carbon practices. Questions remain about what practices will be included and what model will be used to track these.

“USDA [under the Biden administration] didn’t recognize manure, and that’s one of the biggest [low-carbon] practices you can do,” Shaw says.

Monetization by farmers also remains uncertain. Much depends on how the Treasury Department tracks CI credits, Shaw says. The current draft uses mass balance, which links bushels and low-carbon credits for delivery to a biofuel producer.

“We have said from the beginning that mass balance is a mistake,” Shaw says. “It lumps corn [and other crops] together. Unless you’re selling directly to the plant, it is very limiting.”

The book-and-claim tracking system, which separates bushels and low-carbon credit certification, is better, Shaw says. It would enable farmers to separately sell their environmental attributes from their own CI scores from their grain and oilseed bushels.

CARBON SEQUESTRATION. Deep-rich soils hold the answer for sequestering greenhouse gases.

“If I'm 400 miles away from the nearest ethanol plant but can raise low-carbon corn, I could sell that credit to the ethanol plant,” Shaw says. “Book-and-claim would give every farmer a chance to participate and enlarge the ability to produce low-carbon ethanol.”

Other concerns

Extending the 45Z tax credit from 2027 to 2029 also was a win, Shaw says. Still, it dashed hopes for a 2031 extension. “This credit [through 2029] is not long enough for a plant to finance, build and operationalize major projects,” Shaw says.

Unless the credit is extended past 2029, biofuel plant managers will closely scrutinize and may pass on major investments, he adds.

ILEC also hasn’t gone away completely, Boyd says.

“It’s still part of other CI calculations that fuel producers’ value, such as California's [low-carbon fuel standard] or [Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation],” Boyd says. “Depending on the policy that is used to value the fuel, [ILUC] still is applicable.”

What to do

Hora hopes book-and-claim tracking will prevail. For now, though, he advises farmers, biofuel producers, grain merchandisers, elevators and other supply chain members to ready themselves for linked data and crop under mass balance tracking. This requires knowing the CI scores of the grain and verifying bushels at every point of aggregation.

“Every single step along the chain will undergo an audit,” Hora says.

If you want to know your CI score, Continuum Ag offers CI scoring. Iowa State University also offers a CI score calculator.

Knowing their CI score can help farmers decide which future low-carbon opportunities to pursue, says Eric Gibson, farm input and crop production sustainability analyst for Rabobank.

“You can only improve what you can measure,” he says.

Be careful. “Practices like cover crops are not inexpensive to implement,” says Tim Laatsch, North America director of agronomy for Koch Agronomic Services. “They carry some benefits, but they take time to materialize. They come with a learning curve, and some yield penalty if you aren't managing at a high level.”

Long term, however, Nelson sees the movement toward carbon intensification and low-carbon grains and oilseeds as a lasting trend. “You see Nestle, Unilever and European companies interested in paying farmers for their data to meet their [environmental, social and governance] goals,” he says. “Companies in Asia are also looking at their own ESG models. The idea of climate change or carbon removal is kind of off limits right now politically [in the U.S.], but I don't think it's going away globally.”

POTENTIAL BOOMING MARKET: Corn might be part of a future booming market due to its use in sustainable aviation fuel. However, reaching this market first will require leaping a few hurdles.

So, how much money could farmers reap from Section 45Z tax credits gleaned by biofuel producers?

Payments shared between biofuel plants, farmers, grain merchandisers and others of $100 to $400 per acre have been batted around in recent years. Current legislation is silent about biofuel manufacturers sharing any money they garner from Section 45Z. Still, it’s likely farmers will obtain something, says Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director.

For example, say an ethanol plant lowers its carbon intensification (CI) score by 30 points via processing low-carbon corn and gleans 2 cents per CI point in tax credits. This tallies 60 cents per gallon, or $1.80 per bushel of corn, if the plant uses three bushels to make each gallon of ethanol.

“No one can sit here today and tell you what portion of that $1.80 [per bushel] will find its way back to the farmer,” Shaw says. “But I can say with a basis in history that we’ve never added $1.80 [per bushel] to the value of a commodity like corn where the farmer didn’t get some [additional value].”

Massive SAF market

Still, Shaw believes the most value from Section 45Z tax credits will come from using ethanol in the aviation industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“I think we’re missing the forest by seeing just the trees,” he says.

Over the last 40 years, average U.S. corn production has annually increased 210 million bushels, Shaw says. “That means that in 20 years, we will need a forest to chew up the [additional] 5 billion bushels of corn,” he adds.

Shaw thinks SAF could chew up this increase and more.

The airline currently accounts for 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2050, says Meg Whitty, vice president of corporate affairs and marketing for LanzaJet, a sustainable fuels technology company. It’s estimated that SAF — a share of which comes from corn ethanol — could contribute about 65% of the emission reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2025, according to an analysis by the International Air Transport Association.

Growth potential is excellent, as SAF in 2024 represented only 340 million gallons out of a 100 billion-gallon jet fuel global market, Whitty says.

“The opportunity is massive,” she adds.

Facing hurdles

SAF fared poorly in current 45Z legislation, as Congress clipped its tax credit from a maximum of $1.75 to $1 per gallon.

“This is going to hinder the ability to turn ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel under the current version of 45Z,” says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

“It’s going to be very expensive [for SAF] to break into the sustainable aviation market,” Shaw adds. He says it will take the majority of the 45Z tax credit for SAF producers to document farm practices, increase plant operational efficiencies and replace natural gas — used in SAF manufacturing — with renewable natural gas.

ETHANOL OPPORTUNITY: New opportunities for ethanol produced in plants such as this Lincolnway Energy facility in Nevada, Iowa, could result from new markets. (Iowa Renewable Fuels Association)

However, hope exists. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has moved to amend SAF’s tax treatment. And if long-term projections for aviation industry de-carbonization hold, Shaw says SAF demand for corn ethanol could grow to a point where U.S. corn farmers — who currently grow about 15 billion bushels annually — would have difficulty meeting it.

“When was the last time American famers had a market that wanted everything they could responsibly grow?” Shaw says. “I’m not saying that will happen, but that’s the potential size of this market.”

Politics

Still, biofuel growth is subject to political whims, says Owen Wagner, vice president of grains and an oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. “Fifteen to 20 years ago, when we were talking about grain markets, it would have been fundamentals,” he says. “Now, the growth and relative importance of biofuels requires a totally different way of analyzing markets.

“All this also has a strong political component in that it’s dictated by agricultural policy,” he adds. “We could have a future administration that shifts emphasis back to [vehicle] electrification rather than liquid fuels.”

If so, this could negatively alter the outlook for biofuels. “It all depends on what the energy priorities are coming out of D.C.,” Wagner says.

SOIL-SMART PAYMENTS: These days, farmers can glean more payments for crops such as corn through payments for practices that sequester or slash greenhouse gases.

Ever wish you could be paid for the way you farm?

These days, you certainly can.

Payment for carbon and sequestering or squelching greenhouse gases to produce low-carbon fuels spurred by Section 45Z and accompanying tax credits may soon be reality. They join “offset” and “inset” programs that firms currently offer to farmers.

Offset programs pay farmers using practices such as cover crops that “offset” greenhouse gases that companies produce in manufacturing products. Inset programs occur when a firm works with its own supply chain or that of other companies to reduce a carbon footprint.

The Bayer Carbon Program has both inset and offset customers, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. It pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

“We pay $6 per practice per year dating back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen-reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6-per-acre bonus. Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires.

Inset programs

The Soil and Water Outcomes Fund (SWOF) is an inset program that works with public and private organizations to achieve sustainability goals. It pays farmers who have implemented or expanded conservation to achieve environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, emission reductions and water-quality improvement.

It offers one-year contracts for practices such as:

reduced till and no-till

extended crop rotations

cover crops

Its average annual payout in 2024 was $33 per acre for participating farmers.

VARIETY OF PAYMENTS: Farmers can be paid for a variety of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reduced tillage or cover crops.

Carbon intensification scoring

What direction payments may take from Section 45Z federal tax credits hinges on regulations issued by the Treasury Department. It has not issued such regulations.

“The ethanol [biofuel] company is going to capture a lot of that value, perhaps the majority of it,” says Sean McMahon, head of U.S. sustainability for FarmersEdge. “But there's still substantial value there for farmers. There’s a premium for low-carbon grain, and that value is going to exceed carbon offsets or carbon insets based on the voluntary carbon market today.”

The tax credit’s worth is based on a carbon intensification (CI) score that tracks the biofuel supply chain’s carbon footprint. The more greenhouse gas-cutting practices a farmer adopts, the more he or she could potentially glean in payments from the tax credit passed on by the biofuel producer.

“What I love about CI scoring is it represents a snapshot of a particular crop in a particular field for a specific year,” McMahon says. He says existing carbon programs have more rigor and parameters. Some programs also nix payments to farmers who have installed previous conservation practices, he adds.

It remains to be determined what this payment plan has upon programs such as the Soil and Water Outcomes Fund, says Adam Kiel, SWOF managing director.

“Although some are saying that 45Z is locked in, we still don’t know if in-field climate-smart ag practices are eligible to count toward a fuel producer's score,” he says. “That decision is still with the U.S. Treasury Department.”

Hybrid program

Indigo Ag is already offering 45Z programs through several partnerships using interim guidance provided by USDA, says Chris Malone, vice president for Indigo Ag’s biofuels and market development.

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT: Payments also can be garnered for practices that optimize nitrogen management. (Tom J. Bechman)

“At Indigo Ag, we see 45Z as a complement to other sustainability programs, not a competitor,” he says.

Its FieldFlex program allows farmers to move eligible fields between 45Z and other programs as crop rotations and opportunities change, he says. This allows farmers flexibility to capture the best value from sustainability programs each year, Malone adds. It also allows agribusinesses and farmers the ability to monetize sustainability attributes, even if they can't take advantage of 45Z every year, he says.

Malone adds that Indigo Ag currently offers a guaranteed payment if Treasury does not implement 45Z.

No double dipping

Farmers cannot double dip payments between programs for which they are paid to slash greenhouse gas emissions in the same year, McMahon says.

However, he sees an opportunity for biodiversity payments — such as for improving water quality — to be stacked on top of payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Farm bill components — such as the Regional Conservation Partnership Program — allow for this, McMahon says. So do inset programs such as SWOF and others, which pay farmers for improving water quality.

“You could stack a water-quality credit that pays farmers for reducing nitrate leaching on top of a Section 45Z payment for reducing nitrous oxide emissions,” he says.

Although this market is slower to develop than programs that slash greenhouse gases, interest exists, McMahon adds.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltf6c509b0025215bf/68824a0affb8a0266cb2f817/0721F1-1621A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-25 03:59:04.310290

Reversing the endangerment finding jeopardizes the 2027–2032 tailpipe standards which aim to cut CO₂ from 170 g/mi to 85 g/mi as well as heavy‑duty truck rules, dirty particulate and NOₓ limits, and related Clean Air Act mandates.

According to internal analysis, the original standards would have achieved a 56 percent CO₂ reduction below 2026 levels, eliminating nearly 7 billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2055. Reversing course could not only halt that trajectory but also reduce the national zero‑emission vehicle (ZEV) share target, two‑thirds of new sales by 2032.

How does it compare to rivals?

California and 10 other states filed suit earlier this summer to defend their independent 2035 ZEV mandates; however, only federal findings support nationwide standards.

The reversal follows a broader deregulatory campaign under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, part of 31 rollbacks announced in March to promote “American energy” and revive domestic auto jobs. The auto industry’s trade group welcomes the move, claiming it will preserve consumer choice and reduce compliance burdens that were “ragged edge of achievable.” Conversely, the Electric Vehicle Association called it “unfortunate.”

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

Drivers loyal to internal-combustion models may avoid rising costs tied to EV mandates or charging infrastructure, but will lose federal environmental benefits, such as cleaner air quality, and likely forfeit incentives.

Automakers focused on EVs and clean tech, such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis, must now hedge against regulatory reversal, losing predictability for investments and R&D. Meanwhile, those doubling down on ICEs may favor a rollback.

Public health advocates and climate-conscious consumers are left short-changed: an AP-linked report warns such rollbacks may mean an extra 30,000 premature deaths annually and $275 billion in lost health benefits.

What’s the long-term significance?

If finalized, the repeal could strip federal authority over emissions and fuel‑economy standards, placing the burden squarely on California, a handful of states, or future courts to reinstate safeguards. Legal experts are already preparing lawsuits, citing past Supreme Court rulings (Massachusetts v. EPA) and recent UN declarations that greenhouse gases pose an “existential threat.”

The justification is legal, not scientific: the draft argues the Clean Air Act never required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases broadly, focusing instead on whether the agency has the legal authority, not on climate risk.

Courts may reverse the move, but experts warn that delays alone could inflict irreversible damage, fueling climate disasters while legal battles play out.

According to the company’s earnings report, it achieved profitability for the first time in six quarters, excluding financial benefits from the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). However, sales revenue declined by 9.7 percent, amounting to 5.6 trillion won.

This decline was primarily due to decreased purchases from automakers outside of North America, resulting from increased policy volatility, particularly concerning US tariffs.

“As North America and Europe both focus on expanding their domestic battery supply chains and domestic production, preference for battery companies capable of local supply and stable operations — such as LG Energy Solution — is expected to increase significantly,” said Kim Chang-sil, chief financial officer of LG Energy Solution, during a conference call earlier in the day.

Highlighting its first-mover initiative in establishing the first ESS battery production site in North America, Kim noted that the company looks to offset the slowdown in EV battery sales with ESS products. This focus is on the fast-growing North American power grid market, with an emphasis on artificial intelligence data centers.

In May, LG Energy Solution began mass production of LFP-based long pouch cells for ESS at its Michigan facility in the US. It has secured orders exceeding 50 gigawatt-hours from global energy firms, with joint ventures with global carmakers prioritizing a portion of their capacity for ESS supply. Aiming to reach 17 gigawatt-hours capacity by the end of this year, the battery-maker will expand to 30 gigawatt-hours by 2026 by converting EV production lines to ESS lines.

Addressing the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bills Act by the Trump administration earlier this month, LG Energy Solution believes that the North American EV market may experience a temporary demand slowdown. However, the new “prohibited foreign entity” regulations, which restrict energy companies influenced by Chinese firms from receiving tax credits when investing in the US, could partly benefit the company.

“The new PFE procurement requirements are more relaxed than the foreign entity of concern requirements under the IRA, offering an opportunity to optimize our US supply chain,” said Lee Yeon-hee, head of the business strategy division at LG Energy Solution.

“A certain percentage can be sourced from PFEs, and as PFE restrictions are limited to direct material costs, we can leverage more cost-effective supply chains for some materials.”

LG Energy Solution also plans to accelerate the launch of battery cells for rapidly emerging low-cost EVs.

To target the expanding European market for mid- to low-priced EVs, the company is preparing to mass-produce high-voltage mid-nickel and lithium iron phosphate cells at its Poland plant. Notably, LFP products are set to boost cost-competitiveness by incorporating advanced manufacturing methods, including a solvent-free dry electrode process and fast-charging technologies.

For the North American market, LG Energy Solution is collaborating with General Motors to develop lithium manganese-rich prismatic cells for their next-generation EVs in 2028. These products offer similar costs to LFP while delivering over 30 percent higher energy density. Upon reaching mass production, the LMR batteries are being reviewed for the phase 2 joint venture in Tennessee. The existing nickel, manganese and cobalt batteries will be exclusively manufactured in the phase 1 joint venture in Ohio.

However, at the same time, industry bodies continue to raise concerns over the ability to attract enough skilled workers.

40,000 Workers Needed

According to the Clean Energy Council (CEC), 97 renewable energy projects were under construction across Australia, or due to start soon, at the end of 2024 and estimates suggest that an additional 40,000 workers will be needed by 2030 to support the ongoing transition to renewables.

This growth is not only in direct employment for renewable energy projects, but also includes jobs in related industries such as manufacturing, transport, and hospitality, particularly in regional areas.

The International Energy Agency has suggested that the renewable energy sector is experiencing significant job growth, particularly in clean energy technologies like solar PV, wind, and electric vehicles.

The flipside, however, is that this growth is creating skills shortages, with employers facing difficulties in finding qualified workers for certain roles in these industries..

Job-Ready Program

In a bid to help overcome the manpower concerns, the CEC recently launched a new clean energy job-ready program that features standardised skillsets, training, career pathways and a digital skills passport to support and attract more tradies, apprentices, and job-seekers to the clean energy industry.

Based on 12-months of consultation with the sector, the program will aim to make it easier for job seekers—primarily in Victoria and Queensland—to attain the relevant skills needed to work and seamlessly transition between large-scale wind, solar and storage projects, while helping employers mobilise a safe, competent and qualified trade workforce.

A key economic benefit of renewable energy development arises when Indonesia exports renewable energy technologies, goods, and services.
Indonesia’s renewable energy resources position it as a frontrunner in carbon trading and clean energy exports.","As the impacts of climate change become more evident, and global energy demand continues to rise, the shift toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources has accelerated. In Indonesia, this energy transition has become a critical national priority, given the country’s heavy dependence on fossil fuels and rapidly depleting reserves. To address this challenge, the government has developed a comprehensive regulatory and policy framework designed to promote new and renewable energy (Energi Baru dan Terbarukan – EBT) as both an eco-friendly power source and a catalyst for long-term investment.

Renewable energy is evolving from a backup option to the backbone of Indonesia’s energy security. Through strategic regulations, the state has demonstrated a firm commitment to accelerating clean energy adoption. Beyond reducing carbon emissions, renewable energy is emerging as a strategic economic sector, which is capable of driving investment, creating jobs, and enhancing national competitiveness. However, realizing this vision depends on a strong legal foundation, competitive incentives, and a focused investment strategy.

Legal Framework Governing Indonesia’s Energy Transformation

RIndonesia’s foundational legal instrument for energy development is Law No. 30/2007 on Energy (Energy Law). Article 3 paragraph c of this law stipulates that the goal of energy management is to provide domestic and/or foreign energy sources fo:

Meet domestic energy demand;

Supply raw materials for national industries; and

Boost national foreign exchange reserves.

A key economic benefit of renewable energy development arises when Indonesia exports renewable energy technologies, goods, and services. For instance, growing local industries in solar panels and batteries could position the country as a regional clean energy manufacturing hub.

To reinforce this strategy, the government promotes downstream processing of resources like nickel and coal into higher-value products, such as lithium batteries, biodiesel, and palm oil-based biofuels. These policy moves have already generated over Rp 1,800 trillion in non-tax state revenue in the past decade, and nickel-based steel exports reached USD 34.4 billion in 2023.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in clean energy projects supports Indonesia’s balance of payments. Simultaneously, reducing fossil fuel imports conserves foreign exchange and strengthens national reserves. Thus, renewable energy contributes to national economic resilience via export growth and import substitution.

The country’s strategic direction is further codified in Government Regulation No. 79/2014 on National Energy Policy (PP 79/2014), which mandates a minimum renewable energy share of 23% by 2025 and 31% by 2050.

To expedite energy transition and address tariff obstacles, Presidential Regulation No. 112 of 2022 (Perpres 112/2022) introduces accelerated licensing, fiscal incentives, and competitive pricing for renewable energy projects

Indonesia: A Regional Hub for Green Investment

Indonesia is rapidly emerging as a top destination for green investment in Southeast Asia, thanks to its abundant natural resources, strong policy drive, and forward-looking regulations. At the World Expo 2025 in Osaka, the government confirmed USD 22 billion (Rp 358 trillion) in green industrial zone investments, including large-scale solar projects in Batam, Bintan, and Tanjung Pinang.

A DetikFinance report highlights the country’s promising renewable energy market, fueled by surging domestic demand and rich geothermal and solar resources in regions like Sumatra and Sulawesi.

Projections indicate that clean energy, circular economies, and low-carbon technologies may create millions of jobs and add USD 120 billion to GDP across Southeast Asia. Indonesia’s renewable energy resources position it as a frontrunner in carbon trading and clean energy exports. These initiatives are embedded within the 2024–2045 National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN) as part of a green economic roadmap focused on sustainable institutional reform.

Incentives and Support for Green Investors

The Indonesian government offers an attractive suite of incentives—both fiscal and non-fiscal—to boost investment in renewable energy. Under Perpres PR 112/2022, developers are eligible for streamlined permissions, tax breaks, and access to green financing

Article 22 paragraph 1 and 2 of Perpres 112/2022 specifies fiscal incentives available to businesses developing renewable energy power plants:

Income tax reliefs under relevant tax laws;

Import duty and tax exemptions on renewable energy equipment;

Land and building tax reductions;

Support for geothermal development; and/or

Financing and guarantees via designated state-owned enterprises

These incentives aim to bring renewable production costs closer to fossil alternatives, making renewable power more economically viable and driving private sector engagement. Transparent tariff structures and licensing regimes under Perpres 112/2022 are intended to foster investment from both domestic and international players.

Renewable energy development in Indonesia is not only a moral imperative in the global fight against climate change, it is a strategic investment frontier. With robust legal frameworks, attractive financial incentives, and vast renewable resource bases, Indonesia is poised to become a regional clean energy powerhouse.

Success hinges on collaboration between government, industry, financial institutions, and civil society. Investment in renewable energy promises not just economic returns but also environmental protection and a lasting legacy against future climate risks..***

Vietnam’s strategic ambition is clear. The National Power Development Plan VIII targets over 39 per cent renewable energy in total electricity generation by 2030, and full EV adoption by 2050. These goals not only reflect Vietnam’s strong commitment to sustainability but also reinforce the country’s emerging role as a vital link in the regional and global clean energy value chain.

According to a recent forecast by IMARC Group, Vietnam’s lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1 per cent from 2025 to 2033, driven by soaring demand from the EV and renewable energy sectors. As the sector grows, the importance of building robust supporting ecosystems becomes even more critical.

Among these, logistics stands out as a key pillar to ensure that Vietnam’s lithium battery value chain – from raw materials to finished products – can operate efficiently, safely, and competitively on the global stage.

In China’s Shandong province, cities such as Jinan and Qingdao serve as specialised centres for lithium battery production, supported by over $13.8 billion in investment to establish a fully integrated supply chain from raw materials to final assembly. Government policies and infrastructure promote industrial clustering, enabling Shandong to expand capacity and consolidate operations.

Vietnam’s emerging battery corridor may follow a similar development model, with Haiphong, Hanoi, and Ha Tinh province drawing interest from major manufacturers. By focusing investment, infrastructure, and workforce development in these regions, Vietnam aims to establish a high-efficiency battery manufacturing hub. This emerging concentration of production increases the need for regulation-compliant logistics to handle the transport of lithium batteries safely and effectively.

Transporting lithium batteries presents unique challenges since they are classified as dangerous goods due to chemical properties. Lithium batteries are subject to stringent regulations from international bodies such as the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization. These regulations mandate precise packaging, labelling, documentation, and transport procedures to ensure safety at every stage of the supply chain.

Thus, effective logistics not only safeguard the integrity of these sensitive products but also minimise transit times, mitigate risks of incidents, and enhance overall supply chain reliability.

In this highly regulated environment, having a capable logistics partner can make a critical difference. FedEx, for instance, supports manufacturers across sectors such as clean energy, healthcare, and high-tech by offering end-to-end dangerous goods shipping solutions. Each year, FedEx safely transports millions of shipments containing batteries and battery-powered equipment globally, backed by United Nations-certified packaging solutions, accurate labelling and specialised air transport through FedEx’s global network.

Beyond regulatory compliance, speed and reliability are equally important, particularly for Vietnam’s emerging battery exporters operating in competitive global markets. By leveraging express delivery capabilities and real-time shipment visibility tools, manufacturers can meet demanding delivery schedules and build trust with overseas customers.

Looking ahead, Vietnam’s lithium battery sector offers a significant opportunity to drive long-term economic growth and establish the country as a strategic player in the global clean energy supply chain. With rising international demand, untapped reserves of key minerals, and a supportive policy environment, Vietnam is well-positioned to attract quality investment.

The nation’s renewed focus on private sector development, industrial zone expansion, and infrastructure upgrades directly supports the needs of clean energy and battery manufacturers. To fully capture this momentum, continued investment in logistics, talent, and regulatory streamlining will be essential.

At the same time, Vietnam must sharpen its competitive edge in a region where peer economies are rapidly advancing. Countries like Indonesia and Thailand are scaling battery output and also developing integrated ecosystems across mining, production, and recycling. For Vietnam to lead, it must build beyond capacity, to prioritise supply chain localisation, skilled workforce development, and alignment with global standards.

As global firms deepen their ASEAN presence, Vietnam faces the dual challenge of attracting sustainable investment while ensuring resilience against external shocks and technological dependencies. With the right infrastructure, capabilities, and partnerships, Vietnam is not just ready to compete, it is ready to lead in shaping Southeast Asia’s clean energy future and delivering long-term value to investors and industry alike.",https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2025/072025/25/11/in_social/rise-being-witnessed-in-clean-energy-value-chains-20250725114452.jpg?randTime=1753441231,N,,2025-07-25 07:01:15.106048

In short:

The $11 billion Grain Belt Express project aimed to connect Kansas wind farms with power markets in Illinois and Indiana via 800 miles of new transmission lines.

Opposition from landowners and pressure from Republican officials, including Senator Josh Hawley and President Trump, pushed the Energy Department to revoke the $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee.

Invenergy, the company behind the project, says it will try to move forward with private financing but faces ongoing legal and regulatory challenges.

Key quote:

“This move demonstrates a long-overdue recognition of the voices of rural communities who have consistently and clearly expressed their deep concerns about the project’s impact on their land, livelihoods and private property rights.”

— Garrett Hawkins, president of the Missouri Farm Bureau

Why this matters:

The collapse of federal support for the Grain Belt Express reflects growing political battles over how the U.S. expands its energy grid. Modern transmission lines are critical for moving renewable energy from rural areas where it’s generated to cities where demand is highest. Without new long-distance lines, wind and solar projects can stall, leaving fossil fuel plants running longer. At the same time, opposition from landowners highlights the tension between national climate and energy goals and local property rights. The debate will shape how quickly the U.S. can modernize its grid and whether rural communities bear the costs — or share in the benefits — of the energy transition.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61320912/origin.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 03:59:30.161767

BYD has already commenced delivering imported EVs in the country since March, with sales surpassing internal targets by 30%, although exact numbers were not disclosed.

The market for EVs and plug-in hybrid cars in Pakistan is expected to grow significantly, with Khaliq anticipating a three to fourfold increase by 2025 from around 1,000 units last year.

Khaliq noted that BYD is aiming for a 30-35% market share in this segment.

According to a HUBCO filing, BYD Pakistan reported a profit of around PKR444m ($1.56m) in the March quarter of this year.

The Pakistani market is set to welcome the upcoming launch of BYD’s Shark 6 plug-in hybrid pickup truck.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

By bringing the two turbines on board, Duke Energy will be able to serve those energy needs for residential and commercial customers.
“This could not be any better news for us,” Rowan County Board of Commissioner Chair Greg Edds said.
“It is a signal to us that folks inside Duke Energy are looking at our community.
“It is definitely a positive for Rowan County,” Crider said.","Natural gas-fired combustion turbines with a combined capacity of 850 megawatts slated for site where Buck Steam Station once stood, adjacent to combined-cycle plant

SALISBURY — Foresight is power.

Duke Energy took steps on Thursday to pave the way for two new natural gas combustion turbines (CT) at its Buck site in Rowan County by making a preliminary filing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The Buck site is located just east of Interstate 85 off of Long Ferry Road.

According to a release from Duke Energy, the 850-megawatt (MW) project would be built on company-owned land where Buck’s coal units once stood, adjacent to the 718-MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle plant that came on line in 2011.

Title Spokesperson Bill Norton said that 850 MW is enough to power more than 600,000 homes. That will come in handy as Duke Energy prepares for expected population upticks in the area. According to the Charlotte Regional Alliance, the region’s population is expected to increase by 50 percent to 4.6 million people by 2050.

Additionally, over the next 15 years, Duke Energy customers’ annual electric use in the Carolinas is projected to increase by about 58,000 gigawatt-hours, which is reportedly more than the combined annual electric consumption of Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire and Wyoming. By bringing the two turbines on board, Duke Energy will be able to serve those energy needs for residential and commercial customers. The two Buck CTs will also be the most efficient turbines in the company’s fleet which offers additional advantages to Duke Energy’s ever diversified power grid.

“Because CTs can ramp up much faster than coal, they’re more adept at helping us manage rapid drops in solar output — for example, during the pop-up thunderstorms common on summer afternoons when air conditioning needs are high,” Norton said. “We expect the new CTs to reach full load in about 10-15 minutes. As we continue adding more solar to our system, this flexibility will become even more important.”

Local officials are delighted over what Duke Energy’s plans mean for Rowan County’s prospects.

“This could not be any better news for us,” Rowan County Board of Commissioner Chair Greg Edds said. “It is a signal to us that folks inside Duke Energy are looking at our community. It is a predictor of how they feel our industrial economic growth is going to be moving in the future. It’s very encouraging.”

Rowan Economic Development Council President and CEO Rod Crider said it’s a huge boon for business as well.

“It is definitely a positive for Rowan County,” Crider said. “It is part of our infrastructure package that we can offer companies that are considering relocating or expanding.”

Crider indicated that electrical grid resiliency is an important factor in relocation decisions for potential businesses.

“Having this kind of investment in Rowan County is going to make us more competitive because we will be able to demonstrate that we have sufficient capacity,” Crider said.

For many communities around the country, growth can be restrained because of lacking access to energy. With the new site, Crider is confident it will make Rowan County an even more appealing destination.

Edds agreed.

“There are a few things that a community has to have to keep up with a modern economy,” Edds said. “For us, it is energy and water. We are blessed with the Yadkin River and we are blessed to have Duke Energy right here providing power to our community.”

Nearly 100 years ago, Duke Energy opened a coal-burning plant on the same site. That plant was taken offline in 2013 and demolished in 2018. Its conversion now to a cleaner energy source represents steps taken by the industry to upgrade its system to more sustainable power.

“Duke spent considerable time and resources to clean that up and convert it to a clean source of energy,” Crider said. “That does indicate a movement to cleaner fuels that will be able to provide our energy needs in the future.”

Norton added, “Natural gas is much cleaner than coal — emissions have declined significantly since the retirement of Buck’s coal plant, and the new CTs will use the best available control technologies to further limit air emissions.

“…At the Buck site, sulfur dioxide emissions have declined 99.9 percent, while nitrogen oxides are down 94.1 percent and the rate of carbon dioxide emissions has decreased 58.6 percent.”

The project’s cleaner, more efficient energy does not just mean less environmental impacts. It will help Rowan County residents’ pocketbooks too.

“Building new generation at current plant sites allows us to repurpose existing land and maximize our transmission system, infrastructure and local workforce, which enables more efficient energy modernization and lowers the cost for our customers,” Norton said.

The project also represents a huge tax injection.

“Duke Energy’s power plants serve as the backbone of their communities, contributing to the vitality and economy of these communities and generating millions in property and other taxes,” Norton said. “… Duke Energy is the largest taxpayer in Rowan County — we are committed to reinvesting in our power plant communities, providing local jobs and continued tax base for decades to come.”

Edds also touched on that point.

“They are already our largest taxpayer and this will solidify that for a long time,” Edd said. “Look at the services … It helps fund emergency services and fire protection. Everybody is lifted by this. Even if you are not on this side of town, the revenue that gets generated off this cascades down to help pay for services that a county provides.”

What’s next

Duke Energy must wait at least 120 days from the prefiling to submit a formal application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN). That filing will include more project details and kick off a regulatory review process that includes public input and permitting.

Down the road, the CTs could be converted to carbon-free hydrogen whenever the fuel source becomes commercially, technologically and economically viable.",https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/07/buck-combined-cycle-4212-sky.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 02:57:55.764726

Reversing the endangerment finding jeopardizes the 2027–2032 tailpipe standards which aim to cut CO₂ from 170 g/mi to 85 g/mi as well as heavy‑duty truck rules, dirty particulate and NOₓ limits, and related Clean Air Act mandates.

According to internal analysis, the original standards would have achieved a 56 percent CO₂ reduction below 2026 levels, eliminating nearly 7 billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2055. Reversing course could not only halt that trajectory but also reduce the national zero‑emission vehicle (ZEV) share target, two‑thirds of new sales by 2032.

How does it compare to rivals?

California and 10 other states filed suit earlier this summer to defend their independent 2035 ZEV mandates; however, only federal findings support nationwide standards.

The reversal follows a broader deregulatory campaign under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, part of 31 rollbacks announced in March to promote “American energy” and revive domestic auto jobs. The auto industry’s trade group welcomes the move, claiming it will preserve consumer choice and reduce compliance burdens that were “ragged edge of achievable.” Conversely, the Electric Vehicle Association called it “unfortunate.”

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

Drivers loyal to internal-combustion models may avoid rising costs tied to EV mandates or charging infrastructure, but will lose federal environmental benefits, such as cleaner air quality, and likely forfeit incentives.

Automakers focused on EVs and clean tech, such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis, must now hedge against regulatory reversal, losing predictability for investments and R&D. Meanwhile, those doubling down on ICEs may favor a rollback.

Public health advocates and climate-conscious consumers are left short-changed: an AP-linked report warns such rollbacks may mean an extra 30,000 premature deaths annually and $275 billion in lost health benefits.

What’s the long-term significance?

If finalized, the repeal could strip federal authority over emissions and fuel‑economy standards, placing the burden squarely on California, a handful of states, or future courts to reinstate safeguards. Legal experts are already preparing lawsuits, citing past Supreme Court rulings (Massachusetts v. EPA) and recent UN declarations that greenhouse gases pose an “existential threat.”

The justification is legal, not scientific: the draft argues the Clean Air Act never required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases broadly, focusing instead on whether the agency has the legal authority, not on climate risk.

“I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The post wasn't enough to help Tesla's stock, which fell sharply after the company reported another quarter of lackluster financial results and Musk warned of some potentially “rough quarters” into next year. The stock fell 8.2% and is now down more than 24% so far this year.

Late Wednesday, Tesla said revenue fell 12% and profit dropped 16% in the April-June quarter. Many prospective buyers have been turned off by Musk’s foray into right-wing politics, and the competition has ramped up in key markets such as Europe and China.

Investors have been unnerved by Musk's social media spat with the president because Trump has threatened to retaliate by ending government contracts and breaks for Musk's various businesses, including Tesla.

But Trump struck a starkly different tone Thursday morning.

“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!"" Trump wrote. “The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us.”

After Trump's massive budget bill passed earlier this month, Tesla faces the loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit and stands to make much less money from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. Trump’s tariffs on countries including China and Mexico will also cost Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars, the company said on its earnings call.

Musk has blasted the budget bill on his own social media platform X for adding to U.S. debt at a time when it is already too large. The Tesla CEO has called the budget pushed by the president a “disgusting abomination” and has threatened to form a new political party.

On Wednesday's call, Musk said the electric vehicle maker will face “a few rough quarters” as it moves into a future focused less on selling cars and more on offering people rides in self-driving cars. He also talked up the company's business making humanoid robotics. But he acknowledged those businesses are a ways off from contributing to Tesla’s bottom line.

Tesla began a rollout in June of its paid robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and hopes to introduce the driverless cabs in several other cities soon. Musk told analysts that the service will be available to probably “half of the population of the U.S. by the end of the year — that’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”

“We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the U.S.,” Musk said, adding that Tesla “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead. He added, though, “Once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/11/PDTN/84652958007-ap-25190403362592.jpg?crop=8255,4645,x0,y429&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-25 08:01:29.884797

Environmental Protection Network Commends Senate Appropriators for Bipartisan Cooperation on EPA Budget

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bipartisan spending bill for EPA and other agencies by a 26-2 vote. The bill proposes a 5% reduction in funding for EPA and the state environmental grants that EPA administers. Although the bill’s topline numbers fall short of the funding EPA needs to fully do its job, one thing is clear: this bipartisan Senate bill is a sharp repudiation of the massive 55% cut sought by President Trump.

The Environmental Protection Network, an organization created by former EPA staff who continue to support EPA’s mission of protecting public health and the environment, expresses its appreciation to subcommittee Chair Lisa Murkowski and Ranking Member Jeff Merkley, as well as full committee Chair Susan Collins and Vice Chair Patty Murray, for their admirable work.

“It’s a welcome breath of clean air when Republicans and Democrats work together to reject the extreme EPA budget cuts sought by President Trump,” said Michelle Roos, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Network. “People across the country face toxic threats to the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat. This spending plan sends a clear and bipartisan message to the Trump administration that they have gone too far and must back off their plans to lay off EPA staff and shut down critical parts of the agency such as EPA’s science offices.”

Today, they are taking hold and making car buyers ponder the question: how do they measure up when considering the full cost of ownership?

To begin with, it’s important to look at the issue through more than just the lens of innovation or sustainability. At the heart of it, it’s really about value - how that value holds up over time, and what it ultimately means to individuals and families trying to make smarter, long-term choices.

Upfront vs long-term costs

The conventional way to compare vehicles always started with the price tag. Although that number still matters, it doesn’t tell the whole story. EVs may carry a higher upfront cost in some cases, especially in premium segments, but they often flip the script on running costs.

Electric vehicles are fundamentally simpler machines. They don’t require oil changes, have fewer moving parts, and brake wear is reduced through regenerative systems. Add to that lower fuel bills, fewer service visits and, over time, especially for high-mileage users, the math becomes harder to ignore.

That said, there are a few areas where conventional cars could still give their electric counterparts a run for their money. Refuelling, for one. Pull into any petrol station, spend five minutes filling up, and you're back on the road. Compare this to 30 to 60-minute charging sessions for EVs.

Environmental benefits too aren't clear-cut. That “zero emissions” claim rings hollow when electricity comes from coal plants, and manufacturing those battery packs creates significant environmental impact, critics may point out.

However, when analysed over their full lifetime and with cleaner grids in place, EVs are without doubt far cleaner than petrol and diesel vehicles.

Things to consider when buying EVs

Charging strategy: Charging at home or at the office offers the lowest cost per kilometre. Relying solely on fast public chargers changes the economics.

Battery performance: Most brands offer eight-year battery warranties, but performance still depends on climate, driving patterns, and charging habits.

After-sales ecosystem: Choosing an EV isn’t just about the car. It’s about the brand’s ability to support you with service, spare parts, and software over the long run.

Resale trajectory: Traditional cars have a predictable depreciation path. The EV resale market is still maturing, but momentum is building. Especially for models with strong brand backing and software stability.

EVs front-load more of the cost. Combustion vehicles often incur more over time. The difference lies in how you plan to use your car and how long you intend to own it.

The switch to EVs also marks a shift in expectations. Drivers are beginning to think in longer cycles. Ownership is less about short-term trade-ins and more about consistent performance, lower operating costs, and technology that evolves with use.

That doesn’t make EVs the right choice for everyone, but it does explain why more people are moving in that direction, and why the ownership model itself is being redefined.

From a customer perspective, we’re seeing more first-time EV owners making the switch. Not because of trends, but because they’ve taken the time to re-evaluate what ownership really means. The economics, the long-term value and the shift in cost dynamics are becoming clearer.

When drivers look beyond the sticker price and start factoring in charging, maintenance and long-term efficiency, not to mention doing their bit for the environment, the equation changes. What once felt like a leap now feels like a logical step.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/AYO7I4WGHNGEPAZZITRIB4SEPQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=ececd0318dfeeb537b340926098a9bfa19407e6e27826696326e6a495911bfba&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-07-24 23:59:05.025710

In 2016, the city released a comprehensive report, Climate Ready Boston, assessing its vulnerabilities to coastal and storm flooding and extreme heat.
“We needed an office solely focused on delivering climate resilience infrastructure, because otherwise it won’t get done,” says Brian Swett, the city’s new chief climate officer.
On closer inspection, the ground-floor level of the apartment blocks is about a metre above street level (and three metres above actual sea level).
As everyone in Boston knows, the only real solution is to address the causes of climate change itself – global heating, increased CO2 levels, fossil fuel emissions.","Patrick Devine, a captain for Boston Harbor City Cruises, shows me on his phone the scenes here in September 2024. The water was ankle-deep outside the door to his office on Long Wharf, one of the US city’s oldest piers, obscuring the pavements and walkways, surging into buildings and ruining vehicles in the car parks. “It just gets worse and worse each year,” says Devine, who has worked here, on and off, since 1995. “I’ve gotten used to it, so it’s just knowing your way around it.”

Much of Boston has got used to this. Devine has his own supply of sandbags now, for example. Next door to his office is the Chart House restaurant – when Long Wharf flooded last September, customers merrily sat at outside tables, holding their feet above the waterline, as servers with black bin bags for trousers waded over to bring them their lunches. The restaurant’s floor level is lower than that of the wharf, so the water came up to knee level in some areas. “It’s just part of business,” says one waiter, as he points out how the plug sockets are all at waist height. The place has flooded three times in the year he’s worked here. “We just clean it up, squeeze it out, open the doors, dry it out. It is what it is.”

In Boston they call them “wicked high tides”, also known as king tides – when the moon is at its closest to the Earth and pulling in the same direction as the sun, creating a tide 60 to 120cm (2-4ft) higher than usual. Combined with rising sea levels, fiercer storms and higher precipitation, events like this are making the climate crisis a visible threat in the city. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Boston experienced 19 days of flooding in 2024; it is expected to be similar this year. Unless things change, sea levels here are projected to be 20cm higher than 2000 levels by 2030, 46cm higher by 2050, and a metre or two higher by 2100.

Boston is by no means the only US city at risk, but it is very much on the frontline of a problem America seems determined to ignore. Flash flooding killed more than 130 people in Texas this month, but the Trump administration remains in denial about the climate emergency. It has removed vital data (such as previous national climate assessment reports), funding and personnel from important agencies such as the NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). In January, Trump proposed “getting rid of” Fema altogether; he has axed a quarter of its staff since he became president. Even TV weather presenters are warning that the cuts have reduced their ability to track and predict hurricanes and storms, and they are now “flying blind”. Meanwhile, Fema’s new acting head, David Richardson, reportedly told staff members last month he did not even know the US had a hurricane season.

Boston may be more vulnerable than most cities, but it is also leading the way in preparedness. In 2016, the city released a comprehensive report, Climate Ready Boston, assessing its vulnerabilities to coastal and storm flooding and extreme heat. Last August, city mayor Michelle Wu set up the US’s first dedicated Office of Climate Resilience (OCR). “We needed an office solely focused on delivering climate resilience infrastructure, because otherwise it won’t get done,” says Brian Swett, the city’s new chief climate officer. We meet at a cafe in East Boston, just across the water from Long Wharf, along with OCR director Chris Osgood, and councillor Gabriela Coletta Zapata, who represents this vulnerable district. “I have residents that live right on the waterfront that are soon going to be displaced if we don’t do something,” she says.

Sea levels are rising globally, due to thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and polar ice (caused by global heating as a result of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels), but the east coast of the US experiences higher rises than other areas. As Swett explains: “The Gulf of Maine is the fastest-warming body on Earth, so we tend to have significant expansion of water, plus fairly high variation between low and high tide.” Also, Boston harbour faces north-east, so it bears the brunt of “nor’easters” – the infamously powerful storms that hit New England, which the climate emergency is making ever stronger. In 1768, British soldiers disembarked here to take control of the city (it didn’t work out so well: the Boston Tea Party came five years later). Today, the threat coming down the pier is harder to counter: the sea itself.

At the same time, the city is sinking. Sea levels have risen 25cm over the past century but half of that is from subsidence. What’s now downtown Boston was a small peninsula at the mouth of three rivers, surrounded by tidal wetlands. Since the 18th century, Bostonians have filled in the harbour and the riverbanks, usually by simply dumping soil and waste material to just above the level of high tide. This landfill has compacted over time, so when high tides sweep in or it rains heavily, the water has nowhere to go. Downtown Boston is no stranger to huge puddles.

Hurricane Sandy, in October 2012, was a wake-up call, says Swett. According to reports, it killed 97 people within a 65-mile radius of New York City, destroying thousands of homes and cars, and registering the highest tides ever recorded in Manhattan. Had Sandy hit Boston, it would have been even more catastrophic. “It wasn’t 300 miles of a miss; it was five hours,” Swett says. “If it had been at our high tide, which was five hours earlier, we would have had a 100-year flooding event in Boston.”

There have been more wake-up calls since. In January 2018, a “bomb cyclone” swept snow and seawater far into the slushbound city, bringing ice floes, garbage bins and even cars with it. “There’s pictures of people kayaking in the street,” recalls councillor Zapata. A similar storm hit again three months later.

It isn’t only the old parts of the city that are vulnerable. In 2010, the Seaport district, a $3bn waterfront redevelopment in south Boston covering 20 city blocks, was greenlit under a previous administration, with no consideration for future sea-level rises – despite warnings and protests. Already it floods regularly. Home to corporate headquarters and grand public buildings such as the Institute of Contemporary Art, its developers attempted to brand it the “innovation district” but its critics call it “inundation district”. A 2021 report predicted that all of Seaport’s buildings and 90% of its roads were at risk of becoming inoperable by the mid-21st century as a result of flooding – a cautionary tale for other cities.

Boston’s current climate resilience plan consists of more than 100 projects along the city’s 47-mile coastline between now and 2070. On the broad scale, the strategy is to identify critical points where seawater could flood in and effectively plug them up, but not at the expense of civic life. Zapata says: “The harbour itself is a treasure, and anybody, no matter who you are, where you come from, should have access to that waterfront.” So rather than sea walls, the city is building elevated public parks and promenades, which bring added social benefits.

Boston has also updated its building codes. Standard practice in the US has been to set regulations according to the worst historical flooding; here, they’re working to an assumption of a one-metre sea-level rise some time in the future. “That’s the standard that every new building in that future flood zone has to be prepared for,” says Swett.

We take a walk to see what this looks like in practice. This part of East Boston was redeveloped in 2019, to the new guidelines. Before, it was industrial wasteland – former shipyards. “This is where I learned how to drive a car, because nobody was down here,” says Zapata. At first glance, it looks like any other new neighbourhood, apart from the yellow street signs warning, “ROAD MAY FLOOD” (it did, indeed, flood here last year, Zapata points out). On closer inspection, the ground-floor level of the apartment blocks is about a metre above street level (and three metres above actual sea level). Swett points out solid steel flanges attached to the sides of the entrances to the underground car parking – if a flood is imminent, a barrier can be slotted into them to stop water getting in.

Further along the waterfront is a new section of Piers Park, which opened in 2023. Again, it looks like an ordinary park at first glance, with great views of the Boston skyline across the water, but it is higher than the older park and the streets behind it – effectively a sea wall in disguise. “It doubles as a way to fortify the coastline, but it brings so many families here, celebrating birthdays, christenings,” says Zapata. “It’s awesome.”

Another aspect of Boston’s grand plan is to use nature-based defences where possible, working with local groups such as the Stone Living Lab, a partnership between government agencies, universities and non-profit bodies such as Boston Harbor Now. “We’re doing more what’s often called green infrastructure, instead of grey,” says Joe Christo, co-director of Stone Living Lab.

Christo was working for mayor Michael Bloomberg in New York when Hurricane Sandy struck, so he has experienced coastal devastation first-hand. “It was heartbreaking and sobering, but it was transformative,” he says. “I was seeing entire neighbourhoods shut down, people having to leave their homes and sleep in the school gymnasium … the city was just wildly unprepared.” But they noticed that residential areas behind wetlands were less affected by Sandy. “Those salt marshes created a natural buffer and a natural wave mitigation. They absorbed the energy, unlike the sea walls that were trying to fight against it.” Wetlands bring other benefits, Christo adds, including: “increased carbon sequestration, better quality of life for area residents, more opportunities for biodiversity”.

Have the Trump administration’s cuts derailed Boston’s well-laid plans? Less than feared, it turns out. For one thing, Boston’s funding is coming from city and state budgets, rather than central government. The city has a dedicated $75m reserve for climate resilience projects, Osgood explains, “which helps us leverage the second pool of funding, which is competitive state and federal grants”. There is also private-sector funding, coming from developers and industry.

On the federal level, a key agency is the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which carries out big civil works nationally, including flood protection. Trump’s spending bill has cut $1.4bn from the USACE’s non-defence spending, capriciously targeting blue states more than red ones. But accessing USACE funds is a drawn-out process, taking years and requiring congressional approval, and Boston had already secured some substantial grants in the past few years.

Osgood believes they can make up the rest of the federal shortfall, such as the Fema cuts: “This is a slice of the pie that we thought we had checked off, and now we’ve got to go back and find more money to fill that back in. But that said, from a fundamental standpoint, what we’re seeing out of Washington is confusion around what is the federal government’s role in climate resilience writ large. And if you take the administration at their word of wanting to redefine what Fema is about, that’s a gamechanger.”

Other coastal cities ought to be more concerned. Some are in danger of leaving it too late; some are going in the opposite direction. In Florida, one of the states most vulnerable to sea-level rises, governor Ron DeSantis introduced legislation last July that erased the words “climate change” from the state’s laws, even as Florida has experienced floods, record rainfall and a succession of hurricanes in the past 12 months – with more of the same expected this year. “Here-and-now political expediency is outweighing the reality of the science and the reality on the ground,” says Swett.

If some US politicians are refusing to learn, broader society is at least increasingly aware of the threat. “The cat is out of the bag in Boston,” says Osgood, who says that educating and informing the public is an important part of the plan. “There is not a developer worth their salt that can attract a tenant by ignoring coastal resilience. It just can’t happen, regardless of government policy. Any major tenant who’s going to be occupying a building in the downtown, or in the Seaport, who’s being asked to sign a 10-year lease, is saying, ‘All right: and how are you prepared for Boston’s changing climate?’ It is now a market-driven force.”

If science and reality aren’t enough to get the message through, maybe the economics can. Hurricane Sandy cost nearly $30bn in repairs in New York City. A “once in a hundred years” flood in Boston would inundate more than 2,000 buildings and cause more than $2.3bn of damage, according to the city’s estimates. Money spent up front “has a massively high return on investment,” says Swett. “So these are projects that should be eminently fundable. The question is, how do we get that done in time to provide the protection that people are counting on?”

Rather than running away from the problem, Boston is running towards it, treating it with the urgency it demands. “We have to finish these projects sooner rather than later to solve a problem that is coming at us very quickly,” says Swett. As everyone in Boston knows, the only real solution is to address the causes of climate change itself – global heating, increased CO2 levels, fossil fuel emissions. That is a conversation that still feels a long way off in the US, but like the sea itself, it is surely getting closer all the time.

Amid all that news, we hit a quiet milestone on the Climate desk, publishing five more stories in 50 States, 50 Fixes, our series about state and local environmental solutions. With this batch, we reached our midway point: 25 states down, 25 to go.

As part of the series, we asked readers to tell us about effective environmental fixes underway around the country.

And, wow, did you deliver.

As of midday on Thursday, we had received more than 2,400 submissions, oftentimes with dozens of ideas from every state. Several of your suggestions made it into the series, including the stories from Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There were thousands more that we couldn’t use, but we wanted to share a few reader ideas that really popped.

Local solutions from Times readers

Native plants were especially popular. We received more than 100 submissions from people who planted pollinator-friendly gardens in backyards, church lots, hillsides, medians and once-abandoned lots, creating habitat that supports beneficial insects, bats, birds and other wildlife.

We heard about the success of the green club at the Valley Ranch Association, a large homeowners’ association in Irving, Texas. Such associations often oppose native plantings, but Valley Ranch has earned certification as a National Wildlife Federation Community Wildlife Habitat, with pollinator gardens and parks and a prairie of native wildflower and grass.

Another reader, Kate Galer, wrote to us about the residents of Delmont Avenue in Ardmore, Pa., who worked with a local conservancy to green their street, unpaving driveways, creating rain gardens, removing turf grass and planting perennials, trees and shrubs.

We heard about how your children were making a difference. A reader from Macomb Township, Mich., told us about her high-school daughter who, in 2023, at age 14, began planting trees in their community to help fight climate change and started a grass-roots organization called Plant It Forward.

Another reader, Pat O’Connor, of Athens, Ga., told us about his son Aydan O’Connor’s lawn care company, Dead Silent Lawn Care, which uses all-electric equipment, a far cleaner alternative to two-stroke gas lawn mowers.

Others wrote to tell us about state programs, like Whole Home Repairs, in Pennsylvania, which helps low-income property owners improve energy efficiency, weatherize homes, add rooftop solar panels and make repairs. Or a water quality program in Ohio called H2Ohio that tackles algal blooms, reduces salt runoff from roads and lowers pollution from farms.

We heard about regenerative farming, solar panel installations, food forests, neighborhood compost sites and ecological grazing goats. We learned about a flood plain reconnection and restoration project that transformed a 12-acre former industrial lumber yard in Brattleboro, Vt. We heard about Steelton, Pa., a town named for its industrial past whose schools and school buses are now running on solar power.

Then there was the Socially Responsible Sweatshop of Kent, Ohio, whose members craft tote bags, pillows and other goods out of textiles otherwise bound for the landfill, and then donate the proceeds to anti-hunger groups. Its official mission is to sustain the earth and the hungry. Its motto? “Never underestimate a person with a sewing machine.”

‘A great wide world’

We also received submissions from around the world. One reader in the Netherlands alerted us to Amsterdam’s plan to install flights of steps to help prevent cats and other small animals from drowning in the city’s canals. Victoria Bohm wrote from Calgary, Alberta, where she is involved with Alberta Native Plant Rescue, a group that salvages native plants from grassland and pastures that are slated for construction, and uses the plants for ecological restoration as well as in home and community gardens. “It’s a tremendous win-win,” she wrote.

Many people noted that their efforts often felt small. But the joy, satisfaction and pride people took in doing what they could to help the environment shone through. So did the potentially broader impacts.

“This is a tiny story, and there are many bigger better ones to tell,” Mark Shullenberger, of Indianapolis, wrote as he told us of his own efforts. He said that over the decades, he had planted a dozen trees in his yard and around his house, including on the strip between the sidewalk and the street and in front of neighbors’ homes.

“It’s been a joy watching them grow and prosper,” he said of the trees. He relishes how they provide habitat for birds and squirrels, how robins feast on hawthorn berries in the dead of winter. He believes everyone should plant a tree.

“Even aside from all the measurably good things trees do for the environment, aside from the obvious and the subtle good things they do for us human beings and for the animal and plant worlds,” Mr. Shullenberger wrote, “they are fellow creatures who link us to a great wide world beyond our human understanding.”

Top U.N. court says countries must act on climate change

The International Court of Justice issued a strongly worded opinion yesterday saying that states must protect people from the “urgent and existential threat” of climate change, a major moment for the global environmental movement and for the countries at greatest risk of harm.

It was the first time that the court, which is the United Nations’ highest judicial body, has weighed in on climate change.

The unanimous opinion said that the failure of nations to take action to protect the climate system may constitute “an internationally wrongful act.” — Karen Zraick and Marlise Simons

We probably could have a few rough quarters.
By then, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was “saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.”","US President Donald Trump has said on Thursday that he does not want to “destroy” Elon Musk’s companies, after Tesla‘s CEO warned investors that the company “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead due to US incentives expiring soon.

“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This is not so!”

The US President said he wants “Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!”

“The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us,” Trump added, saying that the country is “setting records every day, and I want to keep it that way!”

Elon Musk has previously argued that all consumer tax credits should be eliminated — not only those for electric vehicles or clean energy, but also the fossil fuel subsidies that currently benefit oil and gas companies.

However, in late May, he raised concerns with Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” since it proposed to eliminate tax credits for EVs and solar energy, while preserving subsidies for fossil fuels.

The Senate approved an adjusted bill that will end the $7,500 EV tax credit on September 30, while energy consumer credits are set to be eliminated by the end of 2025.

“Well, we’re in this weird transition period where we will lose a lot of incentives in the US,” Musk said on Wednesday’s earnings call, following the report of Tesla’s second quarter financial results.

“Does that mean we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah. We probably could have a few rough quarters. I’m not saying that we will, but we could,” the CEO stated.

Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also said on the call that the production ramp-up of the long-anticipated affordable EV model will proceed “slower than initially expected” as the company focuses on delivering as many cars as possible in the US before the EV credits expire.

Taneja added that the company has “started seeing the impact of tariffs” and is doing their best to manage it, despite “an unpredictable environment on the tariff front.”

“The cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive,” the CFO noted, warning that “given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters.”

Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s relationship remains strained since Tesla‘s CEO publicly attacked the President’s new bill, a few days after the end of his term as a Special Government Employee.

Tensions resurfaced earlier this month, when Musk announced he was forming a political party in the US, leading Tesla shares to drop and investors to show concerns over the implication of Musk’s political involvement.

GM revealed the concept from the U.K. studio first, and its high-performance design featured huge gullwing doors. This California Corvette concept from GM’s Advanced Design studios in Pasadena highlights Corvette’s ties to Southern California.

“Our Advanced Design teams are dedicated to shaping the future, driving innovation, and exploring what’s possible,” said Bryan Nesbitt, vice president of global design. “The California Corvette concept is another example of forward-thinking design. We invited multiple GM studios to envision Corvette-inspired hypercars—the first of which was revealed by our UK studio in March. The California team has now delivered a complementary study that honors Corvette’s legendary performance, while infusing it with their own distinctive vision.”

What makes this a California concept? Appropriate for the country’s largest market for convertibles, this Corvette can doff its front-hinged top and convert into an open track car. Opening the top reveals a narrow cockpit formed by the concept’s carbon fiber tub. The driver-focused interior uses a steering yoke rather than a wheel. The Corvette team said that the interior incorporates structural elements, which we assume refers to the high wall separating the driver and passenger acting as a structural member to help stiffen the carbon chassis.

We expect the C9 to debut in a few years with at least one version powered by the sixth-gen Chevy small-block. This concept, however, like the U.K. concept shown before and the Detroit concept that’s yet to come, is designed as an EV. A T-shaped battery would fit with the car’s wide track and narrow cockpit.

China's government regulators, including President Xi Jinping, have expressed a desire to stop China's EV price war.

It is clear that not every Chinese brand will survive.

I’ve been to China four times now, and even in the year and a half I have been back and forth, I’ve watched the country change in the presence of EVs. Yet, while China is now known for high-quality EVs and PHEVs, the domestic market is starting to look less sustainable.

Case in point: the Solana Mall in Beijing. When I went to China for the first time, it was arguably more insightful than the Beijing Auto Show when it came to showing just what brands resonated with the general public. It was full of car brands from China’s premier EV startups, like Zeekr, Ji Yue, Li Auto, Xpeng and more. The vast majority of my static impressions came from me just strolling around the mall and getting my hands on cars that way.

A year later, things look a bit different. A few brands are new. Nio’s reasonably priced Onvo brand has wiggled its way into the mall, as did Changan’s upscale brands Deepal and Avatr.

Yet other brands are doing worse than before. Yuanhang, a little-known luxury EV maker from Dayun, isn’t officially dead, but it seems close. Its storefront was replaced by the Deepal and Avatr store I mentioned. Geely’s tech-forward Ji Yue brand died this year, with its space turned into an indoor bungee jumping cafe.

On some level, my time at the Solana mall felt like a microcosm of what’s going on in China. A slowing economy is revealing some serious challenges for the country's auto industry, among other wider issues. Within the past three weeks, there have been monumental changes and scandals. Stressful sales targets allegedly caused employees of some EV brands to inflate sales by pre-registering and pre-selling cars, also known as the zero-mile used car scandal. Then, there are reports that Huawei may be incentivizing EV sales in some municipalities. All of this seems to have come to a head this week. The Chinese government has been criticizing provincial over-investments in EV supply chains and infrastructure, and its regulatory bodies have vowed to end China’s price war.

From the outside in, it looks like China’s EV market is faltering. And, on some level, it is. There’s no room for all of these brands, all of these cars and all of these companies to serve a limited number of buyers. That’s part of why I suspect so many Chinese car brands are trying to beef up their export business. When the chips fall, no one wants to be the odd man out; thus, a relatively stable new source of income (via a foreign car market) could be just the ticket to keep afloat in a too-cutthroat Chinese EV market.

Chinese car Analyst Tu Le of Sino Auto Insights agrees.

“We are moving towards Year #4 of the Price War, so these tactics you highlight point to the extreme measures companies are willing to take to make sure they are players after all the dust has settled. They have to keep these factories running,” he told InsideEVs via e-mail. “The 'Price War' will never go away, but I anticipate it dialing down in early 2026. The players that survive it will be much stronger so we're seeing companies bite, claw and scratch their way to being a survivor. Surviving the China Price War also gives these companies a chance to be international players. There may be a couple of dozen companies that go abroad, but they won't all be successful. But that promise of growth outside of China also keeps China EV Inc motivated to keep going in China.”

But that begs the question: what now? Le says that now it's time for Chinese car brands to wean clientele from purchasing solely on price, and instead on other factors. Now, it’s time for true brand building, not just cheap cars. Le says the Xiaomi YU7 is a great example of how Chinese car brands are trying to get buyers to choose vehicles based on the brand and the experience, not necessarily price alone. The YU7’s prices do undercut the Tesla Model Y, but unlike other competitors in the segment, the price difference isn’t as dramatic as you’d think. Similarly, the (Nio) Firefly’s elevated quality and driving experience are supposed to be a draw compared to the similarly sized but much cheaper BYD Seagull or Geely Xingyuan.

Will it work? I don’t know. But the Chinese market can’t go on in the state that it is. It was never supposed to. Some brands will have to go, but which ones will make it, and which ones won’t remains to be seen. We also don't know what levers the Chinese government will pull to maintain the health of its EV industry. Whatever the case, it’s naive to fully count China out.

What Is The Market Telling Us

Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 49 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 17 days ago when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that CEO Elon Musk announced over the weekend his intention to form a new political party, the ""America Party.""

The move has intensified a public feud with President Donald Trump and sparked significant investor concern about Musk's increasing political involvement and potential distractions from running the electric vehicle giant. The announcement immediately weighed on the stock, which fell nearly 7% in pre-market trading, reflecting market unease with the venture. This political controversy adds to existing headwinds for Tesla, which recently reported its second consecutive quarterly drop in vehicle deliveries for Q2 2025. The company delivered 384,122 vehicles, a 13.5% decline from the same period last year, and missed Wall Street's expectations. Analysts from Wedbush noted that investors are showing a ""broader sense of exhaustion"" with Musk's political activities during a crucial time for the company.

Tesla is down 20.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $302.55 per share, it is trading 37% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,203.",https://news-assets.stockstory.org/cover-images/tesla-cover-image-2e8ede050feb_2024-09-26-104730_oujq.jpeg,N,,2025-07-25 07:00:34.070636

”I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The post wasn’t enough to help Tesla’s stock, which fell sharply after the company reported another quarter of lackluster financial results and Musk warned of some potentially “rough quarters” into next year. The stock fell 8.2% and is now down more than 24% so far this year.

Late Wednesday, Tesla said revenue fell 12% and profit dropped 16% in the April-June quarter. Many prospective buyers have been turned off by Musk’s foray into right-wing politics, and the competition has ramped up in key markets such as Europe and China.

Investors have been unnerved by Musk’s social media spat with the president because Trump has threatened to retaliate by ending government contracts and breaks for Musk’s various businesses, including Tesla.

But Trump struck a starkly different tone Thursday morning.

“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!” Trump wrote. “The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us.”

After Trump’s massive budget bill passed earlier this month, Tesla faces the loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit and stands to make much less money from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. Trump’s tariffs on countries including China and Mexico will also cost Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars, the company said on its earnings call.

Musk has blasted the budget bill on his own social media platform X for adding to U.S. debt at a time when it is already too large. The Tesla CEO has called the budget pushed by the president a “disgusting abomination” and has threatened to form a new political party.

On Wednesday’s call, Musk said the electric vehicle maker will face “a few rough quarters” as it moves into a future focused less on selling cars and more on offering people rides in self-driving cars. He also talked up the company’s business making humanoid robotics. But he acknowledged those businesses are a ways off from contributing to Tesla’s bottom line.

Tesla began a rollout in June of its paid robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and hopes to introduce the driverless cabs in several other cities soon. Musk told analysts that the service will be available to probably “half of the population of the U.S. by the end of the year — that’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”

“We’re in this weird transition period where we’ll lose a lot of incentives in the U.S.,” Musk said, adding that Tesla “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead. He added, though, “Once you get to autonomy at scale in the second half of next year, certainly by the end of next year, I would be surprised if Tesla’s economics are not very compelling.”

(WATE) — Data centers for artificial intelligence and energy generation projects could soon be developed on federally owned land in Oak Ridge, the U.S. Department of Energy announced Thursday.
The Oak Ridge Reservation was one of four sites chosen by federal officials as they move forward with plans to invite private companies to develop AI data centers and energy infrastructure on federal lands.

(WATE) — Data centers for artificial intelligence and energy generation projects could soon be developed on federally owned land in Oak Ridge, the U.S. Department of Energy announced Thursday.

The Oak Ridge Reservation was one of four sites chosen by federal officials as they move forward with plans to invite private companies to develop AI data centers and energy infrastructure on federal lands.

A Request for Information issued by the DOE in April that identified 16 potential sites for development described the federal lands in Oak Ridge as “well-suited to support the President’s AI Infrastructure initiative within the two-to-three-year goal.” Site details included in the document identify a 562-acre plot for potential development with “approximately 100 acres suited for near-term development.”

Private sector partners could be selected by the end of the year, according to the announcement. Details regarding project scope at each site are expected to be released in the coming months.

Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), into law on 4 July 2025 in an afternoon signing ceremony at the White House (Pub. L. No. 119-21). Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) declared it to be a “generational—once in a generation kind of piece of legislation.”1 The legislation makes significant changes to many clean energy tax incentives that were created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These include accelerating the beginning of construction (BOC) date for hydrogen and certain wind and solar facilities and revising the terms of eligibility for the advanced manufacturing production tax and clean transportation fuels.2 The OBBBA also adds new “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE) rules that will restrict certain foreign entities and their affiliates from claiming tax credits and—perhaps more significantly for US developers—will prohibit energy projects and eligible components that incur too high a percentage of their costs from prohibited foreign entities from eligibility for tax credits.

This alert includes an overview of key changes to clean energy tax policy in the bill, followed by a matrix providing more details about the full array of clean energy credits affected by the OBBBA.

A Quick Overview of Key Changes

Wind and Solar

Wind and solar facilities are particularly impacted by aggressive credit phaseouts in the OBBBA. If construction of a wind or solar facility begins after 4 July 2026, such facility must be placed in service no later than 31 December 2027 to be eligible for production tax credits (the PTC under Section 45Y) or investment tax credits (the ITC under Section 48E). This requirement is expected to cause developers to race to begin construction by the applicable deadline. As discussed below, this BOC deadline is complicated by President Trump’s 7 July 2025 Executive Order (EO) and what appears to be two sets of BOC rules that taxpayers will need to comply with to qualify for wind and solar tax credits.

Wind and solar facilities are also subject to rigorous foreign entity restrictions. PFEs, discussed in more detail below, are prevented from claiming tax credits outright. Further, taxpayers must be able to demonstrate that a certain percentage of direct labor and material costs come from nonprohibited foreign sources for facilities to be credit eligible. Further discussion on this material assistance cost ratio (MACR) computation is included below.

Wind and solar facilities beginning construction before 5 July 2026 generally will be subject to the rules as prescribed in the IRA, subject to applicable foreign entity of concern restrictions.

Hydrogen

Hydrogen production facilities must begin construction no later than 31 December 2027 to be credit eligible, accelerating the termination of the Section 45V credit from the IRA’s original requirement to begin construction before 1 January 2033. Unlike wind and solar, the hydrogen PTC is not subject to enhanced foreign entity rules; like wind and solar, the President’s EO could impact the ability of planned facilities to meet BOC thresholds.

Advanced Manufacturing of Eligible Components

Wind components sold after 31 December 2027 will not qualify for the advanced manufacturing PTC under Section 45X. The bill imposes a phase-out schedule for critical minerals, beginning in 2031, except for metallurgical coal (added to the list of eligible critical minerals), which terminates on 31 December 2029. Critical minerals and the direct material costs of all eligible components are subject to MACR thresholds, with the percentages of non-PFE materials varying depending on the components.

Clean Transportation Fuel

The clean transportation fuels PTC is extended from 31 December 2027 to 31 December 2029. PFEs are ineligible for the credit. The special credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel was eliminated. Feedstocks must be produced in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Negative emissions rates are generally not allowed to be used to compute the credit, and indirect land use changes are disregarded when determining emissions rates.

Prohibited Foreign Entity Restrictions

Federal policy has increasingly sought to restrict reliance on entities from certain countries, with restrictions included in, for instance, recent defense authorization acts (e.g., Pub. L. No. 116-283), the CHIPS Act (Pub. L. No. 117-167), and the IRA (Pub. L. No. 117-169). The OBBBA expands these evolving rules to prevent most of the available energy tax credits from being claimed by PFEs.

PFEs are defined as one of two primary categories, “specified foreign entities, or SFEs,” and “foreign-influenced entities, or FIEs.” These categories generally target “countries of concern” such as China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea. SFEs are entities specifically noted in the legislative text, such as certain Chinese military companies, companies found to be relying on forced labor from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, or entities controlled by such entities. FIEs are entities subject to a certain level of control by one or more SFEs, or that cede “effective control” over certain aspects of the relevant creditable activity. Publicly traded entities, which may have a more difficult time tracking specific ownership of shares, face different applications of these rules. The rules are written so that certain affiliates and related parties of a PFE may fall within the scope of the restriction. In the legislative text, Congress provided specific direction to the Treasury Secretary for guidance “as may be necessary or appropriate” for these terms, with particular reference to “effective control” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

The bill also imposes a MACR test for wind, solar, and other clean electricity credits, and the advanced manufacturing PTC. The MACR requires a certain percentage of direct labor and materials costs (in the case of facilities) and the direct materials costs (in the case of eligible components) to be from a non-PFE source. If the MACR falls below the prescribed percentages for facilities, battery storage, and the various eligible components, the facility, storage, or component is not eligible for the relevant credit. Taxpayers may use Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2025-08 (originally released to provide a safe harbor for taxpayers claiming the domestic content bonus credit) and a certification from suppliers attesting to non-PFE costs as safe harbors to determine percentages of costs until the Secretary of the Treasury releases his own safe harbor table and related guidance no later than 31 December 2026. The domestic content bonus criteria and the MACR criteria are not the same, so use of the notice may be a bit like fitting a square peg into a round hole.

Applicability of the MACR is applicable for facilities beginning construction after 31 December 2025. The OBBBA codifies IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 to define BOC for this purpose. As discussed in the following section, codifying these notices for purposes of the MACR and not for other purposes is expected to create additional complexities and challenges for taxpayers trying to comply with already complicated rules.

Beginning of Construction

The BOC concept has been important to the development of renewable energy facilities for many years, integrated into the Section 1603 grant program (part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5), which allowed projects to qualify for the grants for an extensive period so long as the project was under construction in 2009 or 2010 (and other relevant grant requirements had been met). The extension of the PTC and ITC under the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (Pub. L. No. 112-240) extended the commence construction language to the PTC and, subsequently, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes of 2015 (included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, Pub. L. No 114-113) extended the commence construction rules to the ITC in the context of short-term extensions of the credits.

BOC dates are critical to determine eligibility for several of the tax credits. During the development of the OBBBA, Congressional Republicans were at odds over the use of BOC and whether a placed-in-service date was more appropriate (which would generally have the effect of a shorter timeline to qualify for the tax credits). While a BOC date approach ultimately prevailed, and taxpayers expected they could rely on the long-established notices to substantiate BOC, on 7 July 2025—only three days after signing the legislation—President Trump issued EO 14315, “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources,” directing the Secretary of the Treasury to take action no later than 18 August 2025 to:

“Strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

EO 14315 has introduced considerable concern for investors and facilities who thought they could rely on the IRS BOC notices but are now concerned that the rules, including several safe harbors, could change, rendering their projects ineligible for the tax credits. Guidance pursuant to the EO is expected to be issued in sub-regulatory form, meaning there will not be a public notice and comment period to allow stakeholders the opportunity to provide meaningful input or to receive much (if any) advance notice of relevant changes.

The EO appears to apply only to non-PFE BOC criteria because the codification of the IRS notices is included in the PFE section of the OBBBA. This could have the practical effect that taxpayers claiming wind and solar credits will need to take two separate BOC tests into account: one for the MACR and another for determining whether BOC occurs prior to 5 July 2026. Due to these complexities, taxpayers may have questions if and when any additional BOC guidance is released, including as it relates to the enforceability of such guidance.

A Quick Reference Guide

The following matrix is intended to be a handy guide to quickly identify many of the changes to the clean energy tax credits in the OBBBA. Note that this alert does not address every revision to IRA tax credits in the bill and is meant only as a general reference.

What’s Next?

The EO is likely only the beginning of guidance that will be developed to implement the OBBBA changes to clean energy tax credits. New and reopened regulatory projects, notices, and other sub-regulatory guidance, as well as IRS forms and procedures, are expected. Please contact any of the authors of this alert with questions about the bill and to discuss how to engage in the forthcoming guidance process.

2 26 U.S. Code § 45V; 26 U.S. Code § 45Y; 26 U.S. Code § 48E; 26 U.S. Code § 45X; and 26 U.S. Code § 45Z

3 To clarify, the phase-out percentage listed represents the percentage of the credit that is allowed that year.

4 Specifically, the bill says that “the beginning of construction with respect to any property shall be determined pursuant to rules similar to the rules under IRS Notice 2013–29 and IRS Notice 2018–59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance...), as in effect on January 1, 2025.”

5 Qualifying property includes qualifying solar water heating property, solar electric property, and small wind-energy property according to 25D.

6 See discussion under 45Y.

7 As explained under Section 45Y, the OBBBA codifies IRS notices defining the BOC to determine whether the PFE rules apply to a project based on its BOC date.

8 Qualifying property includes qualifying solar water heating property, solar electric property, and small wind-energy property according to 25D.

9 See Appendix B for more information.

10 See discussion under 45Y.

Appendix A

The material assistance rules apply to 45Y, 48E, and 45X, as follows. These are the minimum non-PFE required percentages to qualify for the credit. If the MACR is less than these percentages, that means material assistance has been received from a PFE, which is a credit-disqualifying event.

> 2029: 85%

Critical minerals (sold dates, total direct materials costs)

>31/12/2025 and < 1/1/2030: 0%

2030: 25%

2031: 30%

2032: 40%

>2032: 50%

The bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue new percentages for critical minerals no later than 31 December 2027 that equal or exceed the stated thresholds in the bill, taking into account domestic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity, and national security concerns.

The bill allows an election to exclude certain costs from the MACR computation in the case of binding contracts entered into prior to June 16, 2025, for facilities beginning construction before 1 August 2025, and constituent elements, materials, or subcomponents used in a product sold before 1 January 2030.

Treasury and the Department of Energy are directed to work to issue safe harbor tables that provide the percentage of total direct costs (in the case of a facility or energy storage) and direct material costs (in the case of an eligible component) attributed to a PFE no later than 31 December 2026.

Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may use the tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 to establish the percentage of total direct costs of any listed eligible component and any manufactured product and rely on a certification from the supplier of the manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component, certifying the total direct costs and direct material costs, as applicable, not produced or manufactured by a PFE or that the product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

Appendix B

A new paragraph pertaining to domestic content parity was added: “Rules similar to the rules of section 48(a)(12) shall apply, except that, for purposes of subparagraph (B) of such section and the application of rules similar to the rules of section 45(b)(9)(B), the adjusted percentage (as determined under section 45(b)(9)(C)) shall be determined as follows:”

Qualified investment in qualified facilities and energy storage technology that begin construction before 16 June 2025 would receive 40%.

Qualified facilities that are offshore wind farms would receive 20%.

Qualified investment in qualified facilities and energy-storage technology that begin construction on or after 16 June 2025 and before 1 January 2026 would receive 45%.

Qualified facilities that are offshore wind farms would receive 27.5%.

Qualified investment in qualified facilities and energy-storage technology that begin construction during 2026 would receive 50%.

Qualified facilities that are offshore wind farms would receive 35%.

Qualified investment in qualified facilities and energy-storage technology that begin construction after 31 December 2026 would receive 55%.

i The bill allows a tolerance for some PFE-tainted material assistance in a declining percentage as time goes by. The percentages given in the bill are the required minimum percentages of non-PFE content. The percentages get higher as time goes by, meaning that the allowable PFE share is reduced accordingly. The allowable PFE percentage is the inverse of the percentages stated. For example, if the percentage stated is 60%, that means that’s the minimum non-PFE percentage (based on costs) that is required, so the PFE allowance would be 40%. The formula to determine the share of a facility’s or component’s materials that do not come from PREs, expressed as a percentage of total costs is: total cost - PFE cost/total cost. This measure is known as the MACR. The bill also includes additional changes aimed at deterring taxpayers from obscuring ties to PFEs, including: 1) extending the statute of limitations for enforcement actions related to errors when determining material assistance from a PFE to 10 years; 2) imposing stringent, enhanced, and new penalties for accuracy-related errors; 3) and levying civil penalties for broadly defined “material misstatements” on the certification suppliers submit to determine whether the product or component was manufactured by a PFE and the total direct material costs not manufactured by a PFE. The text authorizes the Treasury Secretary to “prescribe such regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate” to implement these restrictions, as well as “regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the rules” included in this section. A PFE is the umbrella term for an SFE or an FIE.

ii Specified Foreign Entity: The OBBBA defines an SFE as: (1) a foreign entity that is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State; (2) a foreign entity that is included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury (“SDN List”); (3) a foreign entity that is alleged by the attorney general to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws, including the Espionage Act, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, and the Export Control Reform Act of 2018; (4) a foreign entity that is determined by the sScretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to the national security or foreign policy of the United States; (5) an entity identified as a Chinese military company operating in the United States; (6) an entity that is on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List (UFLPA Entity List); (7) a certain battery-producing entity identified in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act; or (8) a foreign-controlled entity. A foreign-controlled entity is further defined as: “A government of a covered nation (the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea; the People’s Republic of China; the Russian Federation; and the Islamic Republic of Iran), a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation provided the person is not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident of the US, an entity or qualified business unit incorporated or organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, an entity controlled by any of the listed foreign controlled entities,” or “an agency or instrumentality of a government” of a covered nation. For these purposes, “control of an entity” means: in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the stock; in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the profits interests or capital interests; or in any other case, ownership of more than 50% of the beneficial interests in the entity. In general, publicly traded companies are not foreign-controlled entities or FIEs (exclusions apply).

iii Foreign-Influenced Entity: An FIE is defined as: An entity which, 1) during the taxable year i) a specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer; ii) a single foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity; iii) one or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of such entity; or iv) at least 15% of the debt of such entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or, 2) during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity which entitles the entity (or an entity related to the specified foreign entity) to exert effective control over i) any of the taxpayer’s qualified facilities or energy storage technologies; or ii) with respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer, the extraction, processing, or recycling of applicable critical minerals or the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral. For these purposes, the OBBBA defines a “covered officer” as: “(1) a member of the board of directors, board of supervisors, or equivalent governing body; (2) an executive-level officer, including the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, or senior vice president; or (3) an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those described in (1) and (2).” For these purposes, and until the Treasury Secretary releases guidance further defining the term, “effective control” means: the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to 1) “determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;” 2) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at the taxpayer’s qualified facility or the storage of electrical energy in the taxpayer’s energy-storage technology; 3) “determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components; 4) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer; 5) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or 6) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity.” The text also defines effective control as it pertains to intellectual property for the purposes of licensing agreements. For the purposes of this section, a “contractual party,” is an entity “with which the taxpayer has entered into a contract, agreement, or other arrangement.” The text requires the Treasury Secretary to issue guidance no later than 31 December 2026 defining the FIE restrictions, “including the establishment of rules to prevent entities from evading, circumventing, or abusing the application of the restrictions through a contract, agreement, or other arrangement.”",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12205_2644.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 01:59:20.560459

The measure, which was advanced by a vote of 26-2, provides $38.6 billion in nondefense discretionary funding that includes funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

That agency—with oversees research and grant funding efforts that include several tied to waste management, recycling and brownfield remediation and demolition activities—will experience fiscal year budget cuts of about 5 percent if the Senate bill becomes law, according to the Washington-based Environmental Protection Network (EPN).

“Although the bill’s topline numbers fall short of the funding EPA needs to fully do its job, one thing is clear: this bipartisan Senate bill is a sharp repudiation of the massive 55 percent cut sought by President Trump,” writes the EPN.

The environmental advocacy group mentions four Senators for helping introduce and advocate for the bill: Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska); Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon); Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Patty Murray (D-Washington).

“It’s a welcome breath of clean air when Republicans and Democrats work together to reject the extreme EPA budget cuts sought by President Trump,” says Michelle Roos, executive director of the EPN. “This spending plan sends a clear and bipartisan message to the Trump administration that they have gone too far and must back off their plans to lay off EPA staff and shut down critical parts of the agency such as EPA’s science offices.”

“I am proud of the bipartisan and thoughtful work that went into the Interior-Environmental Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) Appropriations Act,” says Murkowski.

“This legislation fulfills our commitments to tribes while balancing energy production, conservation and recreation,” continues the senator. “It also supports our public lands while providing for clean air, clean water and clean soil.”

An Appropriations Committee news release says the bill restores $8.6 billion in EPA program and grant funding, along with $3.3 billion to the National Parks Service and similar and smaller announcements to other programs in the Department of the Interior.

A U.S. House version of the bill that is far less generous to the EPA passed that chamber’s Appropriations Committee this Tuesday by a narrower vote of 33 to 28.

The House Appropriations Committee press release covering that version of the bill refers to “rightsizing agency funding levels, including a $2.1 billion reduction (23 percent) to the Environmental Protection Agency.”

According to Molly Reynolds of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who submitted an explanation to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) website earlier this year, “Budget reconciliation is a unique legislative process that allows Congress to pass spending, revenue and debt-related bills with a simple majority in the Senate, bypassing the filibuster that would normally require a three-fifths vote.”

Adds Reynolds, “It starts with a budget resolution that includes reconciliation instructions directing specific Congressional committees to draft legislation within certain fiscal parameters.”

The policy analyst also wrote that a fiscal year 2026 budget resolution “could be used later in the year, with a deadline of Sept. 30, 2026.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/07/24/adobestock_299759371_epa.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 23:36:15.682983

Tesla's energy storage business is hitting record after record, even though it too suffered a revenue drop.

With a new Megapack factory ramping up in Shanghai, Tesla hopes to become a leader in China, the world's biggest market for energy storage.

Tesla revealed its second consecutive declining quarterly results, which confirmed all those declining sales reports from major markets around the world. Revenue was down 16% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, causing the stock price to fall by around 5%, marking a drop of almost 20% this year. However, even as its car business shrinks, the company's energy storage unit is quietly booming.

The EV manufacturer’s Tesla Energy division, which basically sells big batteries used for stationary applications, has had a been steadily growing over the last few years, and it’s expected to keep growing. In 2023, it only accounted for around 6% of Tesla’s revenue. But its deployment more than doubled in the first three months of 2024, according to Reuters, reaching 9.4 gigawatt-hours and accounting for almost 12% of its earnings that quarter.

That may come from Tesla executives downplaying the importance of its energy business. CEO Elon Musk has long sought to draw attention to Tesla's shift from an electric car manufacturer to a self-driving tech and AI company. In yesterday’s Q2 2025 earnings report, Tesla started by saying that the quarter had been “a seminal point in Tesla’s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics.”

But the company admitted in its earnings release that “the energy business is more critical than ever,” adding that “trailing twelve-month energy storage deployments achieved their 12th consecutive quarterly record.” Its financial summary lists a 7% year-over-year decrease in “energy generation and storage revenue” in Q2, however, attributing the decline to a lower average selling price.

It actually recorded growth in energy generation and storage gross profit, which reached $846 million, and it expects it to grow further as it ramps up Megapack production at its new Shanghai factory. The Megapack is a giant 3.9 megawatt-hour battery (equivalent to around 52 long-range Model 3s), which holds enough power to supply 3,600 homes, per Tesla. The company says it’s an infinitely scalable solution, meaning there isn’t a limit to how many can be linked together.

Tesla also sells the smaller Powerwall, which in its most recent (third) iteration has a usable energy capacity of 13.5 kilowatt-hours and can supply 5 kW of constant power for household and business needs. Just like the Megapack, Powerwalls can also be linked together to increase storage capacity as needed.

Tesla hopes to increase sales of both the Megapack and the Powerwall. It produces Powerwalls primarily at its Nevada Gigafactory, while Megapacks are made at its Megafactory in Lathrop, California. It shipped its first Shanghai-built Megapack in March, and it wants to ramp up production to the facility’s maximum annual capacity of 10,000 units.

The market for energy storage is projected to grow consistently by the end of the decade. BloombergNEF estimates an annual deployment rate of 442 gigawatt-hours and a yearly growth rate of 21% based on 2024 values. Much of the growth will be driven by China, followed by the United States, where Texas in particular is seen as the main market driver.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/pbjvRW/s1/tesla-megapack-energy-storage-system.jpg,N,,2025-07-24 23:59:17.598942

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

LCV STATE AFFILIATES AND GOVERNORS CALL FOR MAJOR ELECTRICITY GRID REFORM: LCV and our state affiliates joined governors from Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Tennessee to call for major reform from regional electricity grid operator Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection’s (PJM) leadership following the recent PJM capacity auction. The auction, in which power generators compete for bids to provide electricity for the PJM grid, saw prices jump by 22%, setting a record high for the second year in a row. Facing exponentially increasing energy demand, an affordability crisis, and worsening impacts of climate change, PJM is proving they’re stuck in the past by locking in fossil fuels rather than advancing cheaper clean energy solutions.

NEW JERSEY LCV TAKE: New Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak said, “The results of PJM’s latest capacity auction represents the highest price PJM could charge, and it’s New Jersey ratepayers who will pay the price. Thanks to Governor Shapiro’s leadership and Governor Phil Murphy’s strong support there was a cap on this auction and sadly PJM went right up to this ceiling. Once again, PJM is failing to connect clean energy projects in New Jersey to the grid, driving up costs and increasing electricity rates. Clean energy is the cheaper, faster, and healthier approach. A 100% clean energy standard will create good-paying, local union jobs that can’t be outsourced, improve public health, and finally free New Jersey from PJM’s costly delays. We call on the legislature to act immediately and pass the 100% clean energy by 2035 bill. New Jersey families, workers, and communities can’t afford to wait.”

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “We applaud Governor Shapiro for standing firm in his commitment to hold PJM accountable for skyrocketing energy costs. We reject PJM’s notion that there isn’t enough energy to meet rising demands while hundreds of renewable energy projects languish on the queue. Time and time again, we have seen PJM prioritize dirty energy over renewables, even when renewables are the cheaper, quicker option. We echo the sentiments of Governor Shapiro and his counterparts that PJM must make meaningful changes.”

MLCV TAKE: Maryland LCV Executive Director Kim Coble said, “Marylanders have seen their electricity bills rapidly increase as a direct result of decisions made by PJM. Maryland LCV is grateful to Governor Moore for this unprecedented bipartisan action demanding accountability in these decisions, and for partnering with governors across our grid to make sure PJM makes more responsible decisions that protect ratepayers.”

IEC TAKE: The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, in which Illinois Environmental Council serves as a steering committee member, said, “The results of PJM’s capacity market auction are sobering, particularly when Illinois ratepayers are already facing skyrocketing energy bills. As Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers sap up more and more power and President Trump’s Big Terrible Bill rolls back clean energy tax incentives that could save families hundreds, it is clear we need immediate action to protect Illinois consumers. While grid operators like PJM and MISO are slow to connect cost-effective clean energy to the grid and help meet growing demand, the Trump Administration is moving fast to bail out the fossil fuel industry at ratepayers’ expense. As new federal policies make our power dirtier and more expensive, it is crucial that Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act to protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our national leadership on climate action.”

MARYLAND ESTABLISHES STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FRAMEWORK: Governor Wes Moore signed an executive order to create an environmental justice advisory council and require all state agencies to prioritize environmental justice in their work.

MLCV TAKE: Maryland LCV Executive Director Kim Coble said, “This executive order demonstrates exactly the kind of bold environmental justice leadership Maryland needs. We are pleased Governor Moore is prioritizing the health of overburdened communities by applying an all-of-government approach to addressing cumulative environmental harms in our most vulnerable communities. The state will benefit significantly from meaningful community engagement across agencies to address concerns in Maryland’s most overburdened communities.”

CONNECTICUT LCV RELEASES 2025 LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCORECARD: Connecticut LCV (CTLCV) released its annual scorecard for the 2025 legislative session. The scorecard names 21 environmental champions, including Representative John Michael Parker, the 2025 Key Environmental Champion. CTLCV celebrated the passage of 10 pro-environment bills, including H.B. 5004 and S.B. 9, which address emissions and climate resilience, respectively.

CTLCV TAKE: Connecticut LCV Board of Directors Chair Joseph McGee said, “This year brought real challenges. While federal rollbacks threaten progress on climate and clean energy, we remain focused on pushing Connecticut forward. The momentum for climate action this session was prominent, proof that committed advocacy makes a difference.”

CONSERVATION VOTERS NEW MEXICO RELEASES 2025 LEGISLATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCORECARD: Conservation Voters New Mexico (CVNM) released their annual legislative Scorecard for the 2025 legislative session. Almost half of the state’s legislators received perfect scores for their votes to support pro-environment policies. CVNM highlighted the passage of S.B. 21, the Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Act, and S.B. 37, the Strategic Water Reserve Act, which target water quality and management.

CVNM TAKE: Conservation Voters of New Mexico Chief Operating Officer Molly Taylor said, “At a time when communities are reeling from the harmful actions of the Trump Administration, we’re fortunate to have state lawmakers stepping up to the plate in bold ways to protect our communities and economy. With nearly half of the legislature receiving the highest mark on the Scorecard, it shows that voters are electing leaders that are ready and willing to fight back against federal cuts and do all they can to protect our democracy and the Land of Enchantment. We express deep gratitude and appreciation to New Mexico’s climate and conservation leaders.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

EPA SHUTTERS SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARM: EPA announced its plan to close its Office of Research and Development, which plays an essential role in responding to national disasters and developing regulations to protect public health and the environment. This comes following EPA’s announcement last week of the “next phase” of its reorganization that will force out career staff across the agency.

LCV released a memo highlighting the Trump administration’s most recent disastrous executive actions and their harm to the environment and workforce, including these EPA layoffs.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Government Affairs Sara Chieffo said, “The Trump Administration’s systematic dismantling of environmental protections in just the last few weeks represents a ramp up of their unprecedented assault on public health, climate action, and energy affordability. The elimination of critical scientific investments, replacement of career experts, creation of bureaucratic roadblocks to clean energy, and blatant disregard for the law all indicate the Trump Administration’s fundamental rejection of the federal government’s responsibility to protect American families from environmental harm and costly energy demands. These destructive policies will cement decades of environmental rollbacks that will be felt by Americans today and long into the future through higher energy costs, dirtier air and water, and worsening climate impacts.”

HOUSE REPUBLICANS ADVANCE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL: House Republicans advanced the Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which seeks to dismantle environmental agencies and force through extreme anti-environmental policy provisions that harm our air, water, public lands, wildlife, and so much more.

Ahead of the markup, LCV joined over 50 environmental organizations urging members to oppose these extreme policy changes.

COALITION TAKE: From the letter, “Now is the time to invest more—not less—in the agencies and programs that steward our lands, water, air, oceans, and wildlife and protect our public health. Severe staffing shortages and the extreme cuts to the Department of the Interior, EPA, and other critical agencies would impede their ability to deliver on their missions for the benefit of the American people. Underinvestment in these agencies and the services they provide the public undermines bedrock environmental laws that have had bipartisan support for decades. Furthermore, poison-pill riders, such as those eroding protections for the environment and public health in this bill, have no place in the appropriations process, and must be rejected.”

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal all limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants.
And the EPA argues that more recent Supreme Court decisions raise further questions about the legality of the 2009 endangerment finding.
If the EPA finds the 2009 endangerment finding is no longer applicable, Bakst says that ""would preclude future greenhouse gas regulations.""
There will be a public comment period, rulemaking processes and legal challenges the Trump administration would have to overcome first.","The Trump administration wants to overturn a key 2009 Environmental Protection Agency finding that underpins much of the federal government's actions to rein in climate change.

The EPA has crafted a proposal that would undo the government's ""endangerment finding,"" a determination that pollutants from burning fossil fuels, such as carbon dioxide and methane, can be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The finding has long served as the foundation for a host of policies and rules to address climate change. The EPA's proposal to revoke the finding is currently under review by the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Already, environmentalists, climate advocates and others are bracing for what could be a fundamental shift away from trying to address the problem of a hotter climate. And the Trump administration is celebrating the proposal as a potential economic win.

""Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the proposal in March. ""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more.""

The administration's effort comes in the wake of the hottest year humans have ever recorded on Earth, climate-fueled wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes in Los Angeles and hotter ocean temperatures that made Hurricane Helene stronger and more likely to cause damage inland.

The move could still be overturned by courts. But if the decision is upheld, it would speed President Trump's efforts to end former President Biden's ambitious climate agenda and make it more difficult for future administrations to limit the human-caused greenhouse gas pollution that's heating the planet.

Repealing a cornerstone of U.S. climate action

On the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order asking the EPA administrator to submit recommendations ""on the legality and continuing applicability"" of the EPA's endangerment finding.

In 2007, the Supreme Court found in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency is required to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Then, in 2009 during the Obama administration, the EPA declared greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were a hazard to people.

""This long-overdue finding cements 2009's place in history as the year when the United States Government began seriously addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean-energy reform,"" then-EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in announcing the decision.

The endangerment finding is the basis for rules regulating climate pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants, car and truck exhaust and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Trump administration's intent is clear: They want to undermine or overturn the endangerment finding so as to evade EPA's legal responsibility to address the harms caused by climate change,"" says Rachel Cleetus, policy director with the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""This is simply a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry and an attempt to undo pollution standards to limit heat-trapping emissions from motor vehicles, from power plants, [and] from oil and gas operations.""

The EPA has repeatedly reaffirmed the 2009 endangerment finding. In 2022, Congress included language in the climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act that labels greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. That makes abandoning the finding more difficult.

But if the administration succeeds, that would make it easier to accomplish President Trump's other priorities, such as eliminating greenhouse gas limits on coal and gas power plants.

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal all limits on greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. In proposing the change, the EPA argues that pollution from U.S. power plants is a small part of global emissions and is declining. The agency claims eliminating climate pollution from these facilities would have little effect on people's health.

What the Trump administration is arguing now

On Jan. 20, Trump declared a ""national energy emergency"" and signed his Unleashing American Energy executive order. These contribute to the president's broader push to redirect the federal government away from former President Joe Biden's climate agenda and toward an even deeper embrace of fossil fuels.

Trump wrote in his order that the goal is to ""restore American prosperity"" and, as he said in his inauguration speech, ""We will drill, baby, drill.""

The Trump administration argues that the EPA, under then-President Barack Obama, established the endangerment finding in ""a flawed and unorthodox way"" and ""did not stick to the letter of the Clean Air Act.""

In seeking to reverse the endangerment finding, the Trump EPA is making a legal argument that previous administrators overstepped their legal authority and ""imposed trillions of dollars of costs on Americans."" The agency repeats past Republican arguments that the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision ""explicitly did not hold that EPA was required to regulate these emissions from these sources."" And the EPA argues that more recent Supreme Court decisions raise further questions about the legality of the 2009 endangerment finding.

Environmental groups instead see a proposal designed to benefit fossil fuel companies, who Trump courted during the campaign.

""By revoking this key scientific finding our government is putting fealty to Big Oil over sound science and people's health,"" Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign wrote in a statement. ""These proposals are a giant gift to oil companies that will do real damage to people, wildlife and future generations.""

In 2024, Trump suggested oil executives should raise $1 billion for his presidential bid because he would roll back environmental rules.

A long legal battle is ahead

Critics who cast doubt on the scientific consensus behind climate change see an opportunity to eliminate a decision they have long opposed.

""Since the 2009 endangerment finding, the EPA has been trying to regulate greenhouse gases and as a result trying to control large portions of the economy,"" Daren Bakst, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which advocates for regulatory reform on various policy issues, wrote in an email to NPR. He specifically points to rules limiting climate pollution from power plants and from cars and trucks.

Bakst calls the potential harms in the 2009 endangerment finding ""speculative at best"" and echoes an argument many conservatives make, saying, ""Even if the United States eliminated all of its greenhouse gas emissions, it would have little to no measurable effect on global temperatures.""

The U.S. is the largest historical emitter of man-made climate pollution and, under the Paris climate agreement, has agreed to contribute to the global effort to reduce emissions and limit warming. Trump has signed a directive to have the U.S. withdraw from that agreement.

If the EPA finds the 2009 endangerment finding is no longer applicable, Bakst says that ""would preclude future greenhouse gas regulations."" And he says ""it should be easy to repeal existing rules that are predicated on the 2009 finding.""

But that could still be years from now. There will be a public comment period, rulemaking processes and legal challenges the Trump administration would have to overcome first.

With Leviathan, Armada is taking a major step to advance American leadership in energy and AI through an alternative approach that enables distributed AI training and inference. Leviathan joins the Galleon product line and offers 10x more compute power than Armada's next-largest form factor.

""American energy and AI dominance hinges on one thing: moving massive compute to the edge—fast—where data and low-cost power live,"" said Dan Wright, Co-Founder and CEO of Armada. ""Leviathan, the newest member of our Galleon product line, does exactly that. Each unit delivers megawatt-scale performance in a fraction of the time and much more flexibly than traditional data centers, due to their ability to rapidly adapt to changes in AI chips and cooling, and co-locate with all available land and energy, regardless of its form or location. This latest product launch and funding further accelerate our mission to bridge the digital divide and ensure that the world runs on the American AI stack.""

Leviathan, the larger counterpart to Armada's Triton data center in the Galleon product line, has ten times the amount of compute capacity at megawatt scale. Powered by the Armada Edge Platform (AEP), Leviathan delivers autonomous compute and real-world AI with speed, resilience, and reliability. Leviathan is adaptable to customer requirements, designed for scalability with the ability to relocate between locations and markets as customer requirements evolve. Deployable in remote, mission-critical environments, Leviathan can be co-located with stranded natural gas, solar, nuclear, or other alternative energy sources. It can be operational in weeks, eliminating traditional data centers' long timelines and site limitations. As China ramps up efforts to export its AI stack and races to control the compute and energy supply chains of the future, the U.S. and its allies must move faster. Leviathan gives America the infrastructure advantage—modular, sovereign, and ready to deploy—so the U.S. can lead not just in AI development, but in the physical systems that power it. Leviathan enables AI-era dominance by delivering rapid compute power without the heavy infrastructure demands of traditional data centers.

""From day one, we backed Armada because they saw what others missed: America's AI leadership hinges on owning the entire stack—from power and silicon to software—and being able to deploy it anywhere,"" said Trae' Stephens, Partner at Founders Fund and early Armada backer. ""Leviathan drives that vision forward, expanding the Galleon lineup from suitcase-sized edge nodes for lightweight analytics and inference to megawatt-scale modules that can train and serve frontier models in the harshest environments. With a Galleon for every workload, Armada keeps U.S. and allied AI efforts a step ahead.""

The launch advances Armada's broader vision for distributed, sovereign AI infrastructure, as outlined in a recent white paper detailing the need to tightly couple energy and compute to sustain U.S. leadership in the global AI race. Armada is partnering with organizations such as Fidelis New Energy and Bakken Energy to deploy Leviathans in strategic locations across the U.S. and allied territories—including North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Louisiana—where surplus power can be converted into high-density compute.

""Leviathan embodies our belief that hardware should behave like software: deployable, upgradeable, and governed entirely by code,"" said Pradeep Nair, Founding CTO of Armada. ""Paired with the turnkey Armada Edge Platform and its growing Marketplace of AI models and applications, Leviathan's liquid-cooled, energy-agnostic modules deliver megawatt-scale training and inference in weeks—bridging the digital divide by bringing AI straight to the edge, where data and power already live.""

Was the move a genuine attempt to address the affordability crisis plaguing millions of Americans with diabetes, or a savvy response to mounting public and political pressure?

Around the same time, Amazon launched a telehealth clinic for its employees and their families, and Target expanded its in-store clinics to underserved areas while pledging funds to address Black maternal mortality.

These efforts are all part of sustained health-related corporate social responsibility initiatives where corporations step into public health roles. Whether driven by reputation, regulation, or real commitment to change, these efforts increasingly shape how communities access care.

This trend also offers a reservoir of story ideas. Corporate social responsibility programs may be aimed at improving health outcomes, but they often surface deeper inequities, reveal gaps in the health care system and open the door to probing questions: Who benefits? Who doesn’t? And who’s holding corporations accountable?

Here’s how to spot meaningful stories in health-related corporate social responsibility and dig deeper than the press release.

What is health-related corporate social responsibility?

Health-related corporate social responsibility includes any initiative by a company — especially one outside the traditional health sector — that seeks to improve health outcomes or access to health care. This can take many forms including: product changes, like CVS’s tobacco ban or Coca-Cola’s sugar reduction campaigns; philanthropic donations, like Johnson & Johnson’s global maternal health programs; access interventions, such as Walgreens partnering with the National Minority Health Association to expand COVID-19 vaccine access in underserved areas; and community health partnerships, such as tech companies funding telehealth startups in rural areas.

While corporate social responsibility campaigns may promote better health outcomes, they can also trigger skepticism — or even backfire — especially when perceived as inauthentic or self-serving. Corporate social responsibility can alienate the very people it’s trying to help if the company’s core business practices appear misaligned with its philanthropic messaging. That dissonance can deepen distrust among the public, particularly in marginalized communities.

Here are some ways to spot meaningful stories in health-related corporate social responsibility — and dig deeper than the press release.

How to report on health equity in corporate social responsibility

Health-related corporate social responsibility isn’t inherently good or bad — it’s a sustaining force in public health. Deeper reporting on these initiatives can help ensure they are more than PR stunts and hold corporations accountable for their impact on health equity.",https://healthjournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1280px-Eli_Lilly_Corporate_Center_Indianapolis_Indiana_USA.jpg,N,,2025-07-25 01:00:06.106479

Louisiana is home to some of the biggest hydrogen projects in the United States, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen projects as well as Air Products (NYSE:APD)' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant.
This week, BP announced that it will exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia.
Meanwhile, back in February, Spain's Repsol (OTCQX: REPYY) scaled back its 2030 green hydrogen production target, cutting it by as much as 63%.
Repsol cited challenges in market development, regulatory uncertainties, and the high cost of green hydrogen production, particularly without subsidies.","Three weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA)” that pretty much sounded the death knell for the nascent green hydrogen sector. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027 from January 1, 2033 as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Losing 45V tax credits is likely to seriously erode the economic viability of many hydrogen projects in the country, with Louisiana set to feel the heat the most. The state’s 46 hydrogen and ammonia-related projects are currently eligible for the credits. Louisiana is home to some of the biggest hydrogen projects in the United States, including Clean Hydrogen Works' $7.5 billion ammonia and blue hydrogen projects as well as Air Products (NYSE:APD)' $4.5 billion blue hydrogen plant.

However, OBBBA is not solely to blame for the stalling hydrogen sector, with dozens of green hydrogen developers across the globe scaling back investments or scrapping them altogether thanks to weak demand for the low-carbon fuel coupled with soaring production costs.

Last year, U.S. startup Hy Stor Energy canceled its reservation for over 1 gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity with Nel, a Norwegian electrolyzer manufacturer, for its Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub project. The company said the move was due to market headwinds and delays in bringing the project to fruition, making it financially unfeasible to make upcoming capacity reservation payments. However, Hy Stor said it was not canceling the hydrogen hub itself.

Back in February, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Air Products announced plans to cancel several green hydrogen projects in the U.S., including a $500 million facility in New York and a sustainable aviation fuel project in California. These decisions are part of the company’s broader $3.1 billion write-down and are driven by challenging commercial and regulatory factors, including the need to strengthen the company's focus on projects that deliver value for shareholders.

Not even Europe’s energy heavyweights have been spared the carnage.

Last year, we reported that Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand, days before Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, ""We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project,"" a Shell spokesperson has told Reuters.

BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) said in April that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. This week, BP announced that it will exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder.

Last year, Spain’s Iberdrola (OTCPK:IBDRY)(OTCPK:IBDSF), Europe's largest utility, said it would scale back its green hydrogen investments by almost two thirds due to funding delays for some projects. The company cut its 2030 production target to ~120,000 tons of green hydrogen a year, down from its previous goal of 350,000 tons.

Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal S.A. (NYSE:MT) has abandoned plans to convert two of its steel plants in Germany to hydrogen, despite the steelmaker being offered 1.3 billion euros in public subsidies for the 2.5 billion euro ($2.9 billion) project.

Meanwhile, back in February, Spain's Repsol (OTCQX: REPYY) scaled back its 2030 green hydrogen production target, cutting it by as much as 63%. The company's new target is between 0.7 and 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity, down from a previous goal of 1.9 GW. Repsol cited challenges in market development, regulatory uncertainties, and the high cost of green hydrogen production, particularly without subsidies.

The Australian market has been hard hit, too. In September 2024, Woodside Energy (NYSE:WDS), the country’s largest independent oil and gas producer, shelved plans to build two green hydrogen projects in Australia and New Zealand.

In March this year, giant oil and commodities trader Trafigura, ditched plans to build a green hydrogen plant at the company’s Port Pirie lead smelter in South Australia for A$750 million ($491.5 million).

Meanwhile, the Queensland state government pulled the plug on plans to fund a A$12.5 billion green hydrogen plant by 2028, with the massive project slated to become one of Australia’s largest and most advanced green hydrogen projects.

Finally, Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries announced it will not go ahead with its coal-to-hydrogen project in Latrobe, Australia, citing time and cost pressures.

The mounting cancellations suggest a sector still searching for viable economics, not just policy certainty. While OBBBA’s accelerated tax credit deadline has undoubtedly raised the stakes for U.S. developers, the global pullback points to deeper market fractures: low offtake demand, high capital costs, and insufficient infrastructure. With major players in the U.S., Europe, and Australia walking away or scaling back, the once-hyped green hydrogen boom is looking more like a trickle. For now.

Wall Street is looking past the weak part of earnings, and continue to focus on the potential of robotaxis and new lower-priced EVs

It might not be clear that Tesla Inc.'s stock was falling in early Thursday trading based on analyst commentary, as many looked past the negatives of the electric vehicle giant's latest earnings report and focused on the potential positives from robotaxis and new lower-priced models.

The stock (TSLA) dropped 6.5% in premarket trading, as Chief Executive Elon Musk followed the release of earnings that were in line with expectations with a warning of potential ""rough quarters"" ahead.

But of the analysts surveyed by FactSet, no less than six have raised their stock price targets, while three have lowered them.

Mega bull Dan Ives at Wedbush acknowledged that the market for EVs is ""difficult"" as overall demand has declined, but he's fixated on progress Tesla has made toward achieving Musk's goal of having autonomous ride hailing in half of the U.S. population by the end of the year.

For one of the negatives in the earnings report - free cash flow fell well below expectations - Ives turned it into a positive, saying it was because Tesla ""continues to invest strategically into AI, robotics and batteries,"" which is the company's future.

Fellow Tesla bull Mikey Legg of Benchmark said don't worry so much about the near-term challenges of tariffs and the expiration of the EV tax credits, because the company's balance sheet ""remains stocked.""

He said the company has plenty of money - $37 billion in cash and investments - to pay for its growth plans, again with the focus on full self-driving and robotaxi expansion, as well as on Optimus humanoid robots and the development of an AI chip.

""In our opinion investors should look beyond the short-term road bumps and focus on the breadth of upcoming opportunities with newmore affordable models scheduled for [the second half of the year], meaningful robotaxi revenues in [the second half of 2026], and at-scale Optimus production, long-term,"" Legg wrote in a note to clients.

Regarding the weakness seen in Tesla's core EV business, as automotive revenue in the latest quarter sank 16.2% to $16.66 billion, Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said the results ""spark some optimism,"" as they suggest the worst is now likely in the past.

He said the results show that Tesla has weathered the tariff environment better than projected, as the revenue topped expectations.

It wasn't all rosy, however, as CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said Musk's comments confirmed his concerns about how President Trump's recently passed tax bill will materially impact Tesla's business.

Nelson, who was one of the analysts who trimmed their stock price targets - to $300 from $320 - said he believes the company's challenges in the near term are ""underappreciated by investors.""

Keep in mind that despite the mostly upbeat commentary, the average price target of the 54 analysts surveyed by FactSet was $315.53, which was 5.1% below Wednesday's closing price of $332.56.

The stock is trading below that average in Thursday's premarket.

Federal disaster assistance remains vital, but it has faced growing criticism — for arriving too slowly, being too limited, or simply failing to meet the evolving scale of need.
It also highlights an urgent need for smarter, faster tools that help everyone make better decisions when time matters most.
Faster disaster data saves lives and cuts costs.
We must empower local governments with smarter data and faster insights to save lives and protect communities.","Another hurricane season is here for the Gulf and East Coasts, but the usual anxiety is no longer just about the storms themselves. This year, a deeper fear is setting in — what happens after the storm, when federal support may no longer be there?

A national conversation is unfolding about how federal, state and local governments should share responsibility for disaster management. While that debate continues, emergency managers of all backgrounds agree on two things: the system needs reform, and communities need better tools to respond to disasters.

In 2024 alone, more than 550 lives were lost to major storms, and damages topped $182 billion. Tampa, Fla., saw its worst storm surge on record. Asheville, N.C., is still recovering from Hurricane Helene’s catastrophic flooding. This year, forecasts predict another worrisome year. On July 4, historic flash flooding tore through Texas Hill Country, claiming 135 lives.

Meanwhile, state and local governments are being asked to do more with less. Federal disaster assistance remains vital, but it has faced growing criticism — for arriving too slowly, being too limited, or simply failing to meet the evolving scale of need. This puts more pressure on local responders, who are increasingly on the front line of disaster response. It also highlights an urgent need for smarter, faster tools that help everyone make better decisions when time matters most.

One of the more transformative new tools is satellite-based hazard monitoring, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar, which, unlike traditional imagery, can capture conditions on the ground through clouds, darkness and storms.

These capabilities allow decision-makers to act quickly, even when conditions on the ground are dangerous or inaccessible. Within hours of a storm making landfall, satellite-based insights can identify flooded areas, detect damaged buildings and track changing conditions at a block-by-block level.

This is not a futuristic promise — it’s being used today.

When Hurricane Helene marched inland to North Carolina, floodwaters surged across roads and neighborhoods, cutting off access for emergency personnel. The cloud cover remained for days following the event. But just hours after landfall, Synthetic Aperture Radar’s satellite-based capabilities revealed the extent of the flooding across Asheville.

With that rapid visibility, local leaders could immediately reroute emergency vehicles, prioritize evacuations and coordinate shelter access for displaced residents. The data also helped nonprofits like Samaritan’s Purse fly more than 60 critical supply missions despite the remaining cloud cover, long before boots could safely reach the ground.

Satellite-driven data helped shift the response forward, protecting both lives and municipal resources.

Faster disaster data saves lives and cuts costs. Today’s damage assessments are slow and costly, requiring aerial surveys and fieldwork. But with better situational awareness, these efforts can be fundamentally smarter and more precise. Quick insights reduce reliance on manual inspections, speed up aid and fight fraud with verified, evidence-based data.

Agencies at all levels are starting to recognize the value of technology, but we need to accelerate adoption. Preparation and resilience begin locally. This hurricane season, we need a new playbook. We must empower local governments with smarter data and faster insights to save lives and protect communities.

The future of disaster relief may be uncertain. But technology can help communities act faster, respond smarter and recover stronger — right now.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AdobeStock_501084865.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-25 02:00:04.024711
