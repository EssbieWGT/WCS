This move is in line with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. Countries around the world are increasingly shifting from coal-based energy to cleaner alternatives like solar, wind, and green hydrogen.

The Ministry of Power and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy have been directed to work on this policy. According to officials, necessary changes will be made to implement this plan effectively.

It is expected that the policy will be rolled out soon and will help reduce carbon emissions from factories and industries.

Currently, India has a total power generation capacity of 4.70 lakh megawatts. Out of this, 2.14 lakh megawatts come from renewable energy sources, while the rest is generated using conventional sources like coal and gas. Industrial power consumption accounts for 42 per cent of the country’s total electricity usage.

By 2025, industrial electricity consumption is expected to rise to 2.35 lakh megawatts. To meet this future demand, around 1.10 lakh megawatts of power would need to come from renewable energy sources.

The policy aims to shift all new industrial power demand to green sources. This includes energy from solar, wind, biomass, and green hydrogen.

Officials also noted that this change will not only help reduce pollution but also attract more foreign investment in India’s renewable energy sector.

With a target to increase the share of clean energy, the government is focusing on making India a leader in green manufacturing, which could also create new employment opportunities and boost sustainable growth.",https://knnindia.co.in/uploads/newsfiles/REN-Energy-1-3-202411.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 06:05:42.129094
,EPA,2025-05-29 09:35:09+00:00,Wilmington Star-News,What the EPA's rollback of 'forever chemical' rules means for NC - Wilmington Star-News,Gareth McGrath,,,,,https://www.starnewsonline.com/story/news/local/2025/05/29/what-the-epas-rollback-of-forever-chemical-rules-means-for-nc/83767773007/,"The substances are often called forever chemicals because they do not easily break down in nature or the human body.
“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated in a May 14 release announcing the changes.
""The EPA is pulling the rug out from communities that have already waited decades for protection and for clean drinking water.""
The nonprofit, non-partisan environmental group has estimated that there could be up to 30,000 polluters dumping PFAS into the environment, including into many water sources used for drinking water, across the country.
""When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean − allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.","The move has drawn criticism from environmental groups and activists, who argue it prioritizes industry over public health.

While federal action stalls, efforts to regulate PFAS are ongoing at the state level in North Carolina.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced plans to delay the rollout of new regulations for some ""forever chemicals"" like GenX. The move comes as the Trump administration moves quickly to reduce the size and the regulatory scope of the EPA, an agency that many Republicans think is a shackle on businesses and impedes economic growth.

But the decision has hit many in the Cape Fear region hard, considering Southeastern North Carolina has been the epicenter of the national pollution crisis since the StarNews first reported in 2017 the presence of manmade chemicals in municipal drinking water systems and groundwater wells that couldn't be filtered out. Decades of uncontrolled dumping of the chemical compounds into the environment, including into waterways and groundwater that serve as drinking sources for millions, and their widespread use, including in fire-fighting foam, has seen contamination and health concerns from the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), including GenX, proliferate across the country. The substances are often called forever chemicals because they do not easily break down in nature or the human body.

The resulting outrage set the stage for Michael Regan, then EPA administrator and North Carolina's former top environmental regulator, in April 2024 to announce in Fayetteville its first-ever drinking water standards to protect people against the toxic chemicals.

Spin forward a year and with a new administration in the White House, the application and efficiency of those proposed rules now seems murky.

What is the EPA now proposing?

The EPA in mid-May announced that it would uphold standards announced by the Biden administration last year for two manmade chemicals, but re-evaluate rules − including at what levels PFAS producers can safely release the contaminants into the environment − for four others, including GenX, the substance produced at the Chemours' Fayetteville Works plant about 75 miles upstream from Wilmington.

The new proposal also gives utilities an extra two years, until 2031, to comply with the federal standards to reduce the amount of manmade chemicals in their water supplies to what are considered levels safe for human consumption.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,"" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated in a May 14 release announcing the changes. ""At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.""

The Trump administration's move received support from some industry groups like the American Chemistry Council, which had questioned the science the Biden administration had used to make the initial rules and the costs it could impose on local communities and utilities.

“The question is not whether to regulate specific substances but how to best do so in a manner that is consistent with the state of the science and focuses on the most pressing drinking water priorities for local communities,"" the group said in a release. “We will continue working with EPA and other policymakers on strong, science-based regulations that protect our health and environment while supporting the needs of local water systems.”

How have the proposed changes been received?

Clean water activists and environmentalists see the changes as another giveaway by the Trump administration to its business backers, in this case the chemical industry, and an attempt to shift the burden of PFAS contamination, needed clean-up efforts, and current and future health risks from industry to local utilities and the general public.

""The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it’s sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come,"" said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, in a release. ""The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases.

""The EPA is pulling the rug out from communities that have already waited decades for protection and for clean drinking water.""

The nonprofit, non-partisan environmental group has estimated that there could be up to 30,000 polluters dumping PFAS into the environment, including into many water sources used for drinking water, across the country. In the Wilmington area, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority and H2GO, which serves customers in Brunswick County, have spent millions installing filters and other upgrades to remove PFAS from their water supplies − costs that the utilities have had to pass on to ratepayers.

Kelly Moser is a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has helped many North Carolina groups, residents and municipalities go after the businesses that have polluted their water supplies.

""When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean − allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.

What happens now?

While more stringent PFAS requirements appear to be stuck in mud at the federal level, activists are still hopeful they can be expanded through action in Raleigh. Federal standards are generally considered the bare minimum state's need to comply with and do not limit more stringent rules being adopted by state regulators, something California has done numerous times when it comes to environmental concerns.

But N.C.'s Environmental Management Commission, which develops the state's environmental regulations, has been slow-footing a push by first Gov. Roy Cooper's and now Gov. Josh Stein's administration to adopt new rules regarding maximum discharge limits for PFAS and 1,4 dioxane, another worrisome carcinogen that's been found in the Cape Fear River.

Action by the N.C. General Assembly to address the contaminants is another option, with state Sen. Michael Lee, R-New Hanover and the Senate majority leader, sponsoring the ""Water Safety Act"" that would force the state to adopt safe drinking water standards and discharge limits for major PFAS dischargers and users. It also would include funds to reimburse public utilities for their costs in filtering out the forever chemicals.

State Rep. Ted Davis Jr., R-New Hanover, also has sponsored a bill in the House that would hold companies that make PFAS from scratch, like Chemours, responsible to pay for upgrades implemented by public water utilities to filter out the manmade compounds.

A new report shows that businesses canceled or delayed more than $14 billion in investments and 10,000 new jobs in renewable energy and clean vehicle factories since January. These cancelations come amid rising fears over the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy, according to E2’s latest analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and Atlas Public Policy.

In April alone, companies canceled a record $4.5 billion in investments in new battery, electric vehicle and wind projects in advance of the U.S. House’s passage of a massive tax and spending package that would essentially kill federal clean energy tax credits. An additional $1.5 billion in newly found canceled projects from previous months was also tracked by E2.

As the Senate prepares to take up the legislation, E2’s analysis shows that more than 10,000 announced jobs have already been canceled amid concerns over the advance of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

“Now is not the time to raise taxes on clean energy and compound the business uncertainty that is clearly taking a greater and greater toll on U.S. manufacturing and jobs,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director at E2. “If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are canceled. Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

Republican congressional districts, which have benefitted the most from the clean energy tax credits passed in 2022, also are seeing the most cancelations. More than $12 billion and over 13,000 jobs have been canceled in Republican districts so far.

Through April, more than 61% of all clean energy projects announced — along with 72% of all jobs and 82% of all investments — are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

While cancelations continue to rise, companies are still investing in the potential of the U.S. clean economy. Businesses in April announced nearly $500 million in investments for new solar, EV and grid and transmission equipment factories across six states — including a $400 million investment by Corning to expand a solar wafer factory in Michigan that is expected to create at least 400 new jobs and a $9.3 million investment by a Canadian solar equipment manufacturer for a new plant in North Carolina. Combined, the seven projects announced in April are expected to create nearly 3,000 new permanent jobs if completed.

April’s announcements bring the overall number of major clean energy projects tracked by E2 to 390 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest nearly $132 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 45 announced projects have been canceled, closed or downsized. Nearly 20,000 jobs and $16.7 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects.

A full map and list of announcements is available at e2.org/announcements/. Cancelation data will be incorporated in the coming months.

TBA chose to partner with Sol Systems, which originated and developed the project, to install a solar farm that maximized the energy produced by locating the system on land adjacent to Toyota Boshoku Illinois (TBIL)’s Lawrenceville manufacturing facility. Onyx Renewables then acquired the project, offering immediate energy savings to TBA and TBIL under a power purchase agreement without any upfront capital investment.

“This project is a testament to what’s possible when manufacturers, clean energy developers, and local communities work together toward shared goals,” said Anna Toenjes, associate VP of impact and business development at Sol Systems. “From Day 1, Toyota Boshoku brought vision and dedication to the table, and we’re proud to have developed a project that will deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits — from long-term energy savings to workforce development and pollinator-friendly land use.”

The newly completed ground-mount solar array, which spans approximately 17 acres adjacent to TBIL’s manufacturing facility, is expected to generate more than 9.5 million kWh of electricity in its first year. The project marks TBA’s largest onsite solar installation to date and is a significant milestone in the company’s ongoing efforts toward carbon neutrality.

“We see it as our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact. With the installation of a large-scale solar panel system at our U.S. facility, we’re taking a clear step toward more sustainable manufacturing,” said Kenji Sugito, TBIL president. “We remain committed to environmentally conscious practices that support a better future.”

Onyx Renewables completed the project’s final development and construction. Nelnet Renewable Energy, a full-service firm specializing in commercial and small-scale utility solar, served as the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) partner. Onyx Renewables will continue to partner with TBA as the owner and operator of the project, ensuring it continues to deliver high-quality, affordable clean energy to TBIL.

“This is the kind of collaborative clean energy development that drives real progress and public support,” said Patty Rollin, chief commercial officer at Onyx Renewables. “Together with our partners, we are thrilled to deliver a project that reduces emissions, lowers energy costs, and sets a high standard for workforce development.”

The Onyx Renewables team worked closely with Nelnet to prioritize workforce development and environmental stewardship by allocating at least 15% of project labor for qualified apprentices and paying prevailing wages. In addition, Sol Systems committed to planting a pollinator-friendly habitat around the system. The plants, which Onyx has selected in consultation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, will be seeded onsite, enhancing local biodiversity and reflecting TBA’s own vision of sustainability. The project also received additional federal support as an “energy community,” designated due to the area’s unemployment and fossil fuel employment numbers compared to the national average.

“From the beginning, it was clear that Onyx and Toyota Boshoku America wanted to go above and beyond to set a new standard for solar development that included local jobs and job training,” said Alyssa Martin, president of Nelnet Renewable Energy. “The project represents a replicable model for how other manufacturers can meet their energy needs while minimizing environmental impact.”

Very specifically, the biofuel industry has played a big role in creating job opportunities for the youth in rural and semi-urban areas.

With the government backing clean energy projects through a slew of initiatives like SATAT, the compressed biogas sector has opened up multiple job opportunities across verticals such as feedstock collection, plant operations, maintenance and quality control. A 2024 Annual Review by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) indicates that 1.02 million jobs were created by the renewable energy sector in India.

On the global front, renewable energy jobs increased from 13.7 million in 2022 to 16.2 million in 2024. India was a key contributor to this growth. The biogas sector specifically has been making strides towards generating more employment, creating inclusive growth opportunities and stable career paths for lakhs of young people in India.

Current opportunities

The biofuel sector was once considered a niche space which had limited awareness and fewer opportunities available. However, the sector has been completely transformed over the last decade. The industry now offers lucrative opportunities for people with skill sets across engineering, supply chain, quality control and strategic roles around sustainability. From on-ground management to leadership roles, the biofuel sector will play a leading role in employment generation and in driving India’s green economy.

Building the green collar workforce

A report titled ‘World Energy Employment 2024’ published by the International Energy Agency indicates that biofuel jobs in India grew more than twice as fast as fossil fuel jobs. This is a clear indicator of the shift in the energy employment landscape in India and the country’s steadfast focus on clean energy.

While there is an increasing demand for a workforce, the lack of skilled talent continues to remain a challenge. As per a TeamLease report, India’s renewable energy sector has a skill gap of around 1.2 million people, and by 2027, India will need 1.7 million workers as the demand is expected to increase by 26%.

For India to realise its clean energy goals, it must be supported by a skilled workforce that caters to the growing needs of the sector.

What needs to be done?

Build training ecosystems: Since sectors such as CBG are still at their nascent stages, there is a lot of potential for introducing structured vocational training that can prepare workers of tomorrow with all the right skills. On-the-job training modules, certification programmes, technical training, and internship opportunities must be provided for youth interested in pursuing green careers.

Collaboration with colleges and universities: One of the key challenges currently is the lack of communication channels between academic institutions and the renewable energy sector. Not many universities and even students are aware of the remarkable opportunities that exist in clean energy sectors. If there is a bridge between academia and the industry, students can be aware of what the sector has to offer and the real-world skills required to excel in these jobs.

Need for public and private partnerships: A collaboration between the government and leading private players in the clean energy sector can play a defining role in meeting the rapidly growing demand for skilled workers. Introducing financial incentives to encourage private players to invest in training initiatives and offering apprenticeships can go a long way in building the right workforce for the sector. Additionally, it can also ensure that the skills being taught are aligned with real world job requirements.

While the focus remains on skilling the upcoming workforce, attention must be given to upskilling the existing workforce by ensuring they are updated with emerging technologies and skills required for the evolving clean energy sector.

Create a gender balance – can we get more women into the green workforce?

A report by the International Renewable Energy Agency indicates that globally only 32% of the workforce in renewable energy are women. This percentage will be far lower in India. If India has to reach its net zero goals, we need more women to be a part of the green workforce.

One of the challenges currently is the perception that biofuel jobs are for men. The gendered notion discourages many women from pursuing careers in the green energy sector. Very recently, our collaboration with Nimaya, a not-for-profit career accelerator for women in rural communities, was an example of how women can and are keen on taking on roles in the clean energy sector. In biofuel, there is a lot of scope for grassroots-level involvement with roles around feedstock collection, plant operations, managing logistics and supervisory roles.

We need to create an ecosystem that can provide women with immersive soft skills training, covering behavioural and workplace skills, digital proficiency, leadership development and placement support for career-building opportunities in the biofuel sector. By equipping women with the right skills, we are creating a future powered by a skilled and passionate workforce ready to drive the biofuel revolution forward.

Creating meaningful livelihoods

The biofuel sector is not only enabling a cleaner planet, but it’s also creating meaningful livelihoods for people. For India to achieve its net zero goals, we need to create a workforce that is skilled, inclusive and future-ready. Investing in building the right training infrastructure, focusing on creating gender balance in the workforce and ensuring awareness and easy access to biofuel jobs can be pivotal in India’s smooth transition to clean energy.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/05/29/Untitled-design-97.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 06:05:53.190562

The court, however, rejected Lliuya's claim against RWE, saying there was ""no concrete danger to his property"" from a potential flood.
- 10-year legal fight - RWE said in a statement it had ""always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law"".
The Essen court dismissed the case, but in 2017 the higher district court in nearby Hamm allowed an appeal.
The decision by the court in Hamm would ""a powerful precedent to support those efforts"", she said.","A German court on Wednesday rejected a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, but set a potentially important precedent on polluters' liability for their carbon emissions.

The judge in the case ruled that companies ""may be obligated to take preventive measures"" to counter their emissions, according to a statement from the higher regional court in Hamm.

""If the polluter definitively refuses to do so, it could be determined, even before actual costs are incurred, that the polluter must bear the costs in proportion to their share of the emissions,"" the court concluded.

The ruling supported arguments made by Saul Luciano Lliuya, who claimed that RWE, a global energy company headquartered in Germany, should pay towards the cost of protecting his hometown of Huaraz from a glacial lake swollen by melting snow and ice.

RWE has never operated in Peru, but the 44-year-old farmer argued that, as one of the world's top emitters of carbon dioxide, the firm was partly responsible for the flood risk.

The court, however, rejected Lliuya's claim against RWE, saying there was ""no concrete danger to his property"" from a potential flood.

Lliuya, who did not attend the presentation of the verdict in person, said in a statement he was ""disappointed"" the court had not overall ruled in his favour.

But speaking to journalists in a video call from his hometown, the farmer said he was ""very happy with the precedent"" set by the ruling.

Lliuya's lawyer Roda Verheyen said the court's reasoning showed ""that large emitters can be held responsible for the consequences of their greenhouse gas emissions"".

The outcome of the case would ""give a tailwind to climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, and thus to the move away from fossil fuels worldwide"", she said.

- 10-year legal fight -

RWE said in a statement it had ""always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law"".

Establishing such a liability could make it hard to do business in Germany, ""because it could ultimately allow for claims for climate-related damages being asserted against every German company anywhere in the world"", it said.

RWE had ""always operated its plants in compliance with applicable law"", it said.

""It would be an irreconcilable contradiction if the state permitted CO2 emissions, regulated them in detail and in some instances even required them, but at the same time retroactively imposed civil liability for them.""

Lliuya first filed a lawsuit in 2015 at a court in the western city of Essen, where RWE has its headquarters, demanding 17,000 euros ($18,400) towards flood defences for his community.

The Essen court dismissed the case, but in 2017 the higher district court in nearby Hamm allowed an appeal.

Lliuya based his claim on a study that concluded that RWE, which today uses a variety of power sources including wind, coal and gas, has been responsible for 0.38 percent of all global carbon emissions since the start of the industrial era.

In Wednesday's ruling, however, the court said the chances of Lliuya's home being flooded in the next 30 years was ""only about one percent"" and that high waters would ""not be able to endanger the structure of the house"".

The court in Hamm said the ruling was not open to appeal.

Despite going no further, the verdict in the farmer's case ""adds strength to a growing field of climate litigation"", said Joana Setzer of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

""Over 60 cases around the world are currently seeking to hold companies liable for climate-related losses and damages,"" Setzer said.

The decision by the court in Hamm would ""a powerful precedent to support those efforts"", she said.

It's all part of the huge budget bill that looks to advance President Donald Trump's agenda on several issues and includes provisions that would phase out a number of clean energy tax investments passed because of the Biden era Inflation Reduction Act.

Christian Stumpf, director of external affairs of The Nature Conservancy, said billions of dollars and thousands of jobs in Arizona are in jeopardy.

""The IRA has truly been a catalyst for infrastructure investments across Arizona. We've really increased our state's leadership position in the clean energy economy and we are providing good paying jobs that are putting Arizonans to work. We just can't afford to let that go away,"" he explained.

Since the passage of clean energy investments in 2022, companies have announced dozens of clean energy projects and created over 13,000 jobs in rural and urban Arizona communities - many of which are 'red' districts. But some provisions in Trump's ""big, beautiful"" bill have sparked concerns among Republicans who feel the repealing of credits would negatively impact energy production and the economy. If changes are made in the Senate, the legislation will need to be passed by the U.S. House again.

While some Republicans in Congress have questioned the impacts of the IRA and have opposed it because they claim it would raise taxes without helping curb inflation, Stumpf said it has been ""nothing but a success so far,"" and encourages local elected officials to advocate for the clean energy investments that have been made possible.

""We're having really positive conversations on both sides of the aisle and we're hopeful that both sides can come to meaningful compromise. We are trying not to see this through a Republican or Democrat lens,"" he explained. ""We really think that there is a strong case to be made for economic vibrancy and supporting sustainable communities.""

Republican leaders are hoping to pass the huge budget bill and have it signed by Trump before the Fourth of July.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

These tax credits have been working.
A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Montana’s residents who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills.
Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana.
I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.","On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Montana if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Montana. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

These tax credits have been working. Since 2022, Montana has benefited from $2.4 billion in specific investments covering 14 projects, and creating 3080 jobs. Mayors and county commissioners have been writing to our Montana delegation asking them to keep these tax credits because they are so beneficial.

The legislation has overwhelmingly helped Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Montana, where companies like Northwestern Energy (MT Hydro), Calumet/Montana Renewables, and NextEra, among others, have announced major investments thanks to these tax credits.

Counties from Cascade to Custer are thrilled — the tax revenues generated by the companies’ projects enable the counties to make large-scale renovations, build civic centers, and keep roads, bridges, and schools in great shape. If the tax credits are left intact, they could assist more companies to implement projects in all 56 counties, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in property taxes per year—money the counties won’t have to tax their citizens.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Montana ratepayers will face electricity prices that are up to 7% higher in the coming years.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean-energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects like upgrading and building transmission lines, hydroelectric power expansion, solar/wind farm projects, or even a potential nuclear plant in Colstrip currently being discussed in town hall meetings.

Households and local businesses will take a hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Montana’s residents who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners and ranchers to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

But, if they are protected, it would be a huge boost to Montana’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $8 billion to the state’s economy from 2025-2035 and support 5,200 full-time jobs in Montana annually. That’s real money and real livelihoods for Montanans.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are speaking up. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.” Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., wants to keep tax credits such as 45Q for carbon capture and 45U for existing nuclear power to also help reduce emissions while helping maintain dependable, affordable electricity.

Clean energy tax credits are working for Montana. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators Daines and Sheehy to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect all these tax credits.

Additionally, today is the last day for the Texas House to consider all bills on their second and third reading.
Nearly 12,500 Texans are employed and more than $50 billion is invested in the state’s solar industry, according to SEIA.","Three “anti-solar” bills, SB 819, SB 388 and SB 715, appear dead after failing to meet the state’s deadlines that would otherwise allow them to progress.

SB 819 would have placed additional fees, permitting restrictions, mandated setback and regulatory requirements on utility-scale solar and wind projects in Texas, which the state does not impose on other forms of energy. Despite the army of opposition the bill received while in committee, with more than 100 groups registering against the bill, the legislation passed the Senate 22-9 in April. Legislators did not take any action on SB 819 after it was engrossed and moved to the Texas House of Representatives.

“With people and energy-hungry industries flocking to Texas, we need an all-of-the-above strategy to meet demand, and solar and storage are the quickest resources able to be deployed to the grid,” Daniel Giese, the Texas state director for Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), told pv magazine USA.

SB 388 would have required at least half of all new generation in the ERCOT region come from “dispatchable generation other than energy storage.” The bill originally mandated the 50% threshold come from natural gas, but was amended to dispatchable generation “other than battery energy storage.”

Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, said that while the grid needs dispatchable energy resources, “we are not aware of any study by ERCOT, or any other entity that had determined that proportion to be optimal, or even an improvement from the status quo.”

Giese said Texas would be far more vulnerable to grid outages if new generation were limited to a small number of facilities. “The simple fact is Texas needs every resource on the grid to keep prices low for consumers and meet the demands of future population and business growth.”

Excluding California, Texas has more battery storage than the rest of the United States combined, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Additionally, the majority of Texas residents from both sides of the aisle believe solar paired with battery systems would make the grid more reliable and resilient, a survey by the SEIA, Global Strategy Group and North Star Opinion Research found last year.

Texas’s ample land and relatively hands-off regulatory environment have made it easier for developers to enter the state’s energy storage market, the Texas comptroller says. Added to this are plunging costs of lithium-ion batteries found by a BloombergNEF analysis and the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives, and energy storage’s position in the free market is bound to boom.

SB 715 aimed to establish a retroactive mandate that existing renewable energy installations install a backup energy source.

The legislation “would reduce reliability of the Texas power grid while increasing electricity costs for consumers, if enacted,” said Aurora Energy Research stated in a report.

The three bills missed Saturday’s deadline for legislation passed in the Senate to clear a committee vote in the House of Representatives. Additionally, today is the last day for the Texas House to consider all bills on their second and third reading.

“The failure of these three bills is a victory for ratepayers,” said Adrian Shelley, the director of Public Citizen’s Texas office. “It is also a tacit recognition by a legislature that is too friendly to fossil fuels that renewable energy sources are an indispensable part of powering the state,” he said.

Shelley said signing the bills into law would have meant higher energy prices and slowed the growth of energy sources that keep the Texas electric grid stable. He added, “When lawmakers return for their next session, the attacks on renewables must end in favor of legislation that will slow or reduce the state’s fast-rising demand for electricity.”

The anti-solar legislation came just as Texas began to take its place as one of the top states for installed solar capacity, which, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), is ranked first in the country for its utility-scale solar capacity. Nearly 12,500 Texans are employed and more than $50 billion is invested in the state’s solar industry, according to SEIA.

The conference brought together industry leaders from across the world to address the most pressing energy challenges and opportunities, including navigating the next wave of energy transition growth with a focus on reinvention, decarbonization, and business growth in an era of generative AI and increasing energy demand.

During a fireside chat with Exelon President and Chief Executive Officer Calvin Butler, the governor shared his perspective on leading the clean energy transformation; promoting clean energy as a means to promote economic growth and promoting sustainability in our energy sources.

Governor Moore on clean energy as a vehicle for economic growth:

“I knew that I could sum up what we needed to do in the State of Maryland in one word, and that was growth. We needed to make sure that our economy was growing. We needed to make sure that our economy was more competitive, and we needed to make sure that that growth was gonna be inclusive growth, And the thing that I always felt, and why this conversation around utilities and power became so important, was something had to power the growth. Something had to be the engine behind what we were getting going.”

“We really focused on how can we re-center the relationship that we have with our industry partners; do a better job of incentivizing people to be able to choose Maryland; come up with other additional avenues to be able to have grid enhancement and alternative sources while knowing that we can champion alternative sources and still do good things for consumers — but then also being able to listen and be a good partner with the industry about what is required.”

Governor Moore on energy affordability:

“I think we need to broaden our view of what clean energy actually is and how it correlates to the needs of our people. We can be a clean energy state while at the same time focusing on affordability for ratepayers — I don't think those have to be conflicting ideas. I just think we have to have the right infrastructure to be able to make those individualized things happen. And so I do think it goes back into — how are we focusing on both, short term diversification of options that people have.”

Governor Moore on promoting critical infrastructure and sustainable growth:

“Maryland should be the place where you can have additional measurements of growth, but it takes a measure of intentionality.”

“Passing legislation and working with industry to be able to pass what that legislation looks like; being able to do a better job of site readiness and identification of which places in the state could build and build fast to get that kind of infrastructure in place; and having that partnership with our utility partners to know that they could then power that level of growth—those were the three ingredients that we needed to create the correct kind of formula for the type of economic growth that I believe deeply and strongly is going to help create within our state.”

The Moore-Miller Administration is committed to advancing more sustainable, equitable, and affordable energy for all Marylanders. Over the past two and a half years, the governor has taken historic executive action to reduce emissions and promote clean energy standards; dedicated funding to create more equitable access to renewable energy sources; and secured more than $130 million in federal funding to create tens of thousands of green jobs—many of which do not require a college degree.

Most recently, Governor Moore signed the Next Generation Energy Act into law, which will modernize the state’s energy infrastructure, promote more in-state generation, and address rising utility costs that burden Maryland families. The bill expanded financial support to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions; established a procurement framework to advance nuclear energy and create more clean energy in the state; and will deliver meaningful relief to Maryland ratepayers, including a $200 million electricity bill credit directly to Maryland families.",https://governor.maryland.gov:443/https:/ci3.googleusercontent.com/meips/ADKq_NauRp68wgR0AQKisCnmnNBKbkMEbYuZ96mTqalIhoOcgLAR_zdoMs3WaTdlbQqVECPc9BawteB8W5VMGD_lGXmdeCY_qjQqzPp8SXqKDSLdQGJ0qn0qIoBlXEHvYYwb9uUUVmtsn89m0UAkQBIS6Y7hqJw1wdLmkZMs40apow=s0-d-e1-ft#https:/content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/MDGOV/2025/05/11696234/pi1-1709-1_original.jpeg,N,,2025-05-29 03:03:10.635940

We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy.
Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump's executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the ""very slow and very costly"" licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.
Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has ""identified some sites"" for potential development.
Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state's nuclear authority.","Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed ""nuclear energy nerd"" – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky's decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state's nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump's executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

""These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it's almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it's to that scale,"" Carroll said. ""That is the future.""

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment's prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that's still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by ""no later than 2030,"" though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump's executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

""These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,"" Long wrote. ""The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation's energy security.""

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump's executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the ""very slow and very costly"" licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has ""identified some sites"" for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state's largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

""Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,"" he said. ""There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don't think there's anything that couldn't be overcome with certain design changes.""

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state's nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state's Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky's next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the ""hyperscale"" data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

""I think, at this point, the one thing that we're really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,"" he added. ""Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That's been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.""

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state's baseload energy in years to come.

""To say that we're 'headed towards' a time when we don't have sufficient energy in this state – that's inaccurate. We're there. No question about it. We're there,"" he said. ""It's important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.""

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be ""a brand new economic driver"" for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with ""a sense of urgency.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08b46d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4665x2449+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F57%2Fada6085b45ec9d7a536a978509bb%2F28074713764-554d1f9a4f-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 05:02:11.526355

The report updates a previous assessment from 2008 and emphasizes the role of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) in unlocking this potential.

If enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology advances as projected, the potential for power generation from these systems significantly increases with depth, as deeper rock formations tend to be hotter.
This upper bound could result in an astounding 13 TW of power, roughly ten times the current U.S. power generation capacity.","The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has indicated that geothermal energy in Nevada’s Great Basin and adjoining areas could potentially supply electricity equivalent to one-tenth of the current U.S. power demand.

This represents a significant increase from current levels, as geothermal energy currently contributes less than 1% to the national power grid. The report updates a previous assessment from 2008 and emphasizes the role of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) in unlocking this potential.

The study covers the arid lands of the Great Basin, including parts of California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah. The projected 10% contribution to national electricity needs hinges on widespread commercial-scale development and ongoing technological advancements, particularly those developed in the geothermal and oil and gas sectors over the past few decades.

According to the USGS, most existing geothermal electricity generation relies on hydrothermal systems where groundwater naturally circulates through heated, permeable rock. However, the bulk of geothermal potential lies in areas where heat is trapped in impermeable rock. In such cases, EGS is required.

These systems involve engineering open fractures into impermeable rock as deep as 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) below the Earth’s surface, allowing water to circulate and extract heat for electricity generation.

The new assessment incorporates technological developments in mapping and subsurface surveys, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. New heat flow and underground temperature maps were created, along with methods to estimate energy extraction efficiency and the conversion of heat into electricity.

The USGS assessment of undiscovered geothermal resources reflects future potential and areas that have not yet been fully explored or developed.

Sarah Ryker, acting USGS director, stated that the Great Basin was selected due to its known history of geothermal activity and that current findings indicate even greater potential for baseload power than previously understood.

“Leveraging this work along with artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques will help us assess the entire nation’s potential for geothermal energy with greater speed and accuracy,” she said.

The USGS also highlighted the dual benefit of modern mapping techniques, which now support the identification of geothermal energy, critical minerals, and, in some cases, groundwater. While the geothermal heat in the Great Basin has been confirmed, realizing its full potential depends on further improvements in engineering efficiency and the commercial deployment of enhanced geothermal technologies.

If enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) technology advances as projected, the potential for power generation from these systems significantly increases with depth, as deeper rock formations tend to be hotter.

While depths exceeding 6 km might necessitate further technological breakthroughs, the current provisional estimate for the Great Basin, spanning 633,072 sq km, suggests a total EGS power production capacity of 135 GW.

This figure represents only 0.5% of the accessible electric-grade resource, indicating that 99.5% of the thermal energy remains as residual.

Notably, thermal resources from active hydrothermal systems, which account for less than 1% of the total rock volume, are not factored into this estimate. This new assessment aligns with the 518 GW estimated in the 2008 geothermal assessment for the upper 6 km of the larger western U.S., with Nevada and Utah alone contributing an estimated 150 GW.

While it is improbable to achieve the most extreme production efficiencies, these values establish a spectrum for the resource, ranging from negligible (if suitable geological conditions are scarce) to an impressive 44% of the resource base becoming useful. This upper bound could result in an astounding 13 TW of power, roughly ten times the current U.S. power generation capacity.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final rules for the clean electricity investment and production tax credits (technology-neutral credits). The final rules clarify which clean electricity zero-emission technologies qualify for the credits. These include wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic, geothermal, nuclear, and specific waste energy recovery technologies.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2519533361-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:01.285292

University of Kentucky

When Michael McGlue, Ph.D., took the helm of the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) last fall, he took on a key role at a pivotal time as Kentucky faces increasingly extreme weather.

“Kentucky really is a paradise for geologists,” said McGlue, a University o Kentucky alumni endowed professor and KGS director. “There are so many different aspects to the natural environment here that are fascinating. When I took over as director of the 14th Kentucky Geological Survey, a big motivation for me was to push hard on helping the state become more resilient to natural hazards.”

McGlue is leading a bold initiative focused on hazard preparedness, geoscience education and workforce development. At the heart of that agenda is the CLIMBS project, a major initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, uniting multiple Kentucky universities to prepare communities for the intensifying impacts of evolving weather patterns.

“Ultimately, we want our people to be healthy and safe. We want our infrastructure to be strong,” McGlue said. “And so, we need to prepare for extreme weather events that might trigger floods and landslides.”

The CLIMBS project goes beyond modeling environmental threats — it’s preparing students and communities. With funding for educational outreach and student training, McGlue sees the initiative as an important step toward strengthening Kentucky’s geoscience workforce.

“We really need to develop a workforce that has skills in the geosciences,” McGlue said. “That’s something that’s, at the moment, lacking in the state. We really need it to build our workforce moving into the future, to be climate and hazard ready.”

McGlue, a field scientist by background, brings that same philosophy into the classroom and lab.

“I think it’s really important for students to get out in nature and make observations,” McGlue said. “I want them to understand the world that surrounds them, ask good questions and critically think through how to solve problems.”

Students can also engage in projects under the mentorship of seasoned geologists through programs like the Paul Edwin Potter Internship at KGS. The program provides Kentucky university students interested in geoscience and adjacent research areas like geography, public health, data science and engineering the opportunity to get real-world experience and engage in a hands-on research project.

KGS also improves public access to geological data through its user-friendly website with interactive maps and resources for researchers, educators, industry and the general public. KGS researchers are actively engaged in projects that touch energy, water resources, natural hazards, karst, geohealth and more. KGS data are accessible and freely available to all stakeholders.

The company said this takes them into “previously uncharted territory” in terms of electrolyte strategy and the research could pay big dividends.

As CATL explained, the breakthrough could enable LMBs to have both a high energy density and a long lifecycle. Speaking of the latter, a prototype lasted 483 cycles and could be “incorporated into state-of-the-art designs to achieve an energy density of over 500 Wh/kg.”

To put that number into perspective, the solid state battery that Stellantis and Factorial are working on has an energy density of 375 Wh/kg. That means CATL’s lithium metal battery could beat it by over 33%.

CATL says “LMBs are widely regarded as the next-generation battery system thanks to their intrinsically high energy density, especially for high-end power applications such as long-range electric vehicles and electric aviation.” However, the company said the tradeoff has been a short lifecycle, which doesn’t make them commercially viable.

To help solve the problem, CATL “developed and refined a suite of analytical techniques to track the evolution of active lithium and each electrolyte component throughout the battery’s life cycle. This approach transformed a ‘black box’ into a ‘white box’, unveiling the critical depletion pathways driving cell failure.”

While previous assumptions pointed the finger at “solvent breakdown, dead lithium accumulation, or solvation environment disruption,” the dominant cause of cell failure is actually the “continuous consumption of the electrolyte salt LiFSI.” 71% is consumed by the time the battery dies and the firm says this shows there needs to be a focus on “electrolyte durability as a critical factor for sustained performance.”

CATL used the findings to create an optimized electrolyte formulation with a lower molecular weight diluent. The company says this “increased the LiFSI salt’s mass fraction, improved ionic conductivity, and reduced viscosity, all without increasing the total mass of electrolyte used.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ergfgrewgregregre.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 01:05:19.508872

Countries leading in solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies attract a growing workforce dedicated to sustainable solutions. These locations benefit from supportive policies, investment, and infrastructure that foster innovation and job creation. Understanding where people work in renewable energy highlights global efforts to transition to greener power sources and showcases areas driving the future of sustainable energy.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) recently revealed that the global renewable energy workforce reached 16.2 million people in 2023, marking a significant rise from 11 million employees in 2018. This increase underscores the rapid growth and expanding reach of the renewable energy sector worldwide. While employment opportunities in this industry are spreading across a wider range of countries, the majority of jobs remain concentrated in just a few key nations.

China stands out as the dominant force in renewable energy employment. In 2023, the country accounted for an impressive 7.3 million jobs within the renewable energy sector, representing nearly 45 percent of the worldwide total. This dominant share highlights China’s extensive investment and development in clean energy technologies, particularly in solar, wind, and hydropower industries. The country’s commitment to transitioning towards sustainable energy sources has positioned it as the global leader in both renewable energy production and employment.

Following China, Brazil holds the second spot for the largest renewable energy workforce. Despite its position as a distant runner-up compared to China’s massive workforce, Brazil’s renewable energy sector employed around 1.6 million people in 2023. The country’s strong emphasis on biofuels production, particularly ethanol derived from sugarcane, has made it the largest employer in the biofuels sector globally. Brazil’s renewable energy landscape benefits from abundant natural resources and policies that support sustainable energy development, contributing to its substantial green workforce.

Interestingly, when comparing Brazil’s workforce with the collective renewable energy employment in the European Union and Asia (excluding China and India), these regions have larger combined workforces. The European Union and parts of Asia have invested heavily in diverse renewable energy technologies, creating broad opportunities for employment across multiple countries. This collective growth reflects the increasing importance of clean energy in economic and environmental strategies globally.

In the United States, the renewable energy sector has also experienced notable growth over the past five years. Employment in this field expanded from 855,000 jobs in 2018 to approximately 1.1 million in 2023. This growth reflects increased investment in solar and wind energy projects, as well as advancements in energy efficiency and battery storage technologies. The expanding clean energy market in the U.S. continues to generate jobs across manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and related services, underscoring the sector’s role in economic development.

India is another country that has witnessed remarkable gains in renewable energy employment recently. The number of green jobs grew from 719,000 in 2018 to 1 million in 2023. This rapid expansion aligns with India’s ambitious renewable energy targets, which include significant increases in solar and wind capacity. Government initiatives and international support have accelerated investments in clean energy infrastructure, boosting job creation in manufacturing, project development, and operations. India’s growing workforce in renewable energy signals its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and fostering sustainable economic growth.

The global increase in renewable energy employment reflects broader trends in energy transition and environmental policy. As countries prioritize reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change, investments in renewable technologies are intensifying. This shift is not only transforming energy production but also creating millions of new job opportunities across a variety of sectors, from research and development to on-the-ground operations.

Despite the expanding geographic diversity in renewable energy jobs, the concentration of employment in a few countries highlights disparities in access to clean energy investments and infrastructure. While nations like China, Brazil, the United States, and India lead in job creation, many other regions still lag behind in developing their renewable energy sectors. Addressing these gaps requires targeted policies, financial incentives, and international cooperation to promote sustainable energy development globally.

In summary, the renewable energy industry has shown significant growth in employment over recent years, reaching over 16 million jobs worldwide in 2023. China leads this growth by a wide margin, followed by Brazil, with the United States and India also making substantial gains. This surge in renewable energy employment reflects a global movement toward greener energy sources and a more sustainable future. Continued expansion and diversification of the workforce will be crucial to meeting climate goals and ensuring inclusive economic opportunities across the world.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

(TNS)

A Republican-backed tax-and-spending bill passed by the U.S. House on Thursday aims to roll back federal clean energy incentives—a move critics warn could raise costs for consumers and derail investments in Georgia’s burgeoning electric vehicle and battery industry.

The GOP bill, backed by President Donald Trump, targets provisions in then-President Joe Biden’s signature climate and health bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. These include the $7,500 federal tax credit for buyers of EVs largely manufactured in North America, production tax credits for manufacturers of EVs and batteries, and funding for EV charging stations.

The bill, which will now be debated in the Senate and could undergo changes, also includes a new annual fee for electric vehicle and truck owners that would make buying and owning an electric vehicle more expensive.

Georgia is among states that led in the number of jobs created—and expected to come—in clean energy since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, according to researchers at the Rhodium Group, an independent research provider that combines policy expertise and data-driven analysis to help decision-makers navigate global challenges.

The manufacturing tax credits and incentives for buyers have spurred U.S. investment, with Georgia being one of the epicenters with about 38,000 created and promised jobs.

Kia committed more than $200 million and the creation of more than 200 jobs at its West Point plant to accommodate assembly of the company’s EV9 SUV. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s Metaplant near Savannah, which is producing the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 models, is a more than $7 billion investment the company has promised will eventually employ 8,500 people. EV upstart Rivian plans to build a manufacturing site near Social Circle, east of Atlanta.

Some industry leaders and observers, however, are warning the policy shift could slow project rollout.

Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which represents many EV and battery manufacturers, said companies may “reassess the scale and the pace of their investments in the United States.”

U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D- Ga., called the tax-and-spending bill “a win for China’s economy and a loss for Georgia workers.”

China is a top EV manufacturing nation and the country, like many advanced economies, is adopting electric vehicles at a far faster pace than the U.S.

“Georgia has been a national leader in creating clean energy jobs, particularly with new battery and electric vehicle supply chains coming to our state’s rural communities,” Warnock said in a statement, calling the legislation “a non-starter for me in the Senate.”

Fully electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions, reducing harmful exhaust that pollutes the air and contributes planet-warming carbon to the atmosphere.

The IRA took an existing U.S. EV tax credit and narrowed criteria to qualify to vehicles that are predominantly made in North America to encourage reshoring of jobs and investment. Biden had campaigned in 2020 on expanding EV adoption in the U.S.

But Hyundai Chief Executive Officer Joseph Muñoz previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that “(c)onsumer preferences—not politics or government politics—dictate Hyundai’s business decisions.”

The automaker has said it decided to build an EV factory in the U.S. during Trump’s first term, and announced it would build the facility in Georgia shortly before passage of the IRA in 2022.

Because of new criteria in the IRA, EVs made by Hyundai and other automakers lost eligibility. Vehicles it makes in the U.S. now get at least partial credit.

Hyundai has never invested in the U.S. based on incentives, Muñoz said previously, instead focusing on the market opportunity. Hyundai and Kia representatives were not immediately available for interviews.

Gov. Brian Kemp’s office also emphasized the “market-based approach” Georgia takes on economic development. A spokesperson told the AJC that thanks to the state’s efforts, “the e-mobility space was already growing in Georgia before the federal government’s intervention.” Kemp “vocally opposed the Biden administration’s decision to not only pick winners and losers but also to impose counterproductive mandates that disadvantaged Georgia-based auto manufacturers and disincentivized organic consumer adoption of electric vehicle,” the spokesperson added.

Subsidy repeals could deter consumer demand for electric vehicles, Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valadez Streaty said. Cox Automotive, like the AJC, is owned by Cox Enterprises. Cox Enterprises also has about a 3% stake in Rivian.

EVs made up about 7.5% of total U.S. new vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025, per data from Cox Automotive, and the figure is growing, though not as fast as many industry observers expected. That’s in part because of fears over range and charging away from home and because of persistently high interest rates for vehicle loans. EVs also generally have higher sticker prices.

In the short term, Streaty said, sales might grow as consumers look to buy electric vehicles before incentives go away. But in the long term, she said, there might be negative consequences because of price premiums on EVs. A survey of dealers conducted by Cox Automotive in the second quarter of 2025 revealed that “a majority of auto dealers feel the tax credits are having a positive effect on the market.”

One independent dealer commented in the Cox report that consumers appear worried about limited infrastructure for electric vehicles and “fear of plummeting value and inability to repair anything but the simplest of issues,” among other things.

Kevin Ketels, an associate professor of supply chain management at Wayne State University, said electric vehicles are expensive as is. To keep advancing the industry, he said, there needs to be a wider portfolio of vehicles that include lower cost EVs with fewer features than the expensive models on the market.

“If we discontinue the incentives in order to develop and roll out this technology, it’s going to happen at a much slower pace, and we’re going to fall behind the rest of the world,” he said. The U.S. is already lagging behind China in creating EV manufacturing processes and supply chains, he added.

Although current incentives largely benefit affluent customers, “if we give more time and there are more government incentives to make this transition, I think it would benefit less affluent customers in that situation,” Ketels added.

— Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA

HOUSTON , TX, UNITED STATES, May 28, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- PV Hardware USA (PVH USA), a global leader in solar tracking and foundation solutions, announced today it has the capacity to immediately Safe Harbor 5GW of tracker product, offering solar developers a critical opportunity to preserve eligibility for current clean energy tax credits amid legislative uncertainty.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While it has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, the legislation in its current form poses significant implications for the solar industry. PVH is encouraging developers to prepare accordingly.

“Time is of the essence,” said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA. “We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects’ economics.”

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project’s total capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been incurred before any new legislative changes take effect. By procuring tracker products now, developers can lock in the current, more favorable incentive structure. PVH USA’s readiness to support up to 5GW of Safe Harbor product can help developers meet these CAPEX thresholds quickly, mitigating risk and preserving the long-term viability of their projects.

“PVH’s scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,” Bitar said. “We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.”

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country’s largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. To date, the IRA is cited with helping to generate 330,000 new clean energy jobs and more than $70 billion in private investment in the American economy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed “nuclear energy nerd” – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky’s decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state’s nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump’s executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

“These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We’re seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it’s almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it’s to that scale,” Carroll said. “That is the future.”

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment’s prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that’s still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by “no later than 2030,” though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump’s executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

“These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,” Long wrote. “The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation’s energy security.”

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump’s executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the “very slow and very costly” licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state’s largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

“Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,” he said. “There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don’t think there’s anything that couldn’t be overcome with certain design changes.”

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state’s nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state’s Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky’s next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the “hyperscale” data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

“I think, at this point, the one thing that we’re really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,” he added. “Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That’s been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.”

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state’s baseload energy in years to come.

“To say that we’re ‘headed towards’ a time when we don’t have sufficient energy in this state – that’s inaccurate. We’re there. No question about it. We’re there,” he said. “It’s important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.”

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be “a brand new economic driver” for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with “a sense of urgency.”

“Our goal is not just to get nuclear reactors in Kentucky. It’s to create an entire nuclear ecosystem within the commonwealth that’s taking advantage of all aspects of nuclear energy development: research, industrialization, building, parts, education, whatever it might be. We want to take full advantage of it,” he said.",https://hoptownchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/power-plant.jpeg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:05.437310

It would also require manufacturers to conduct extensive supply chain checks for any foreign connections, particularly from China and Russia, for components used in clean energy projects, and set federal tax credit application timelines that will be virtually impossible to meet, according to the group, thus ""kneecapping"" investment in clean energy industries across the U.S.

“We’re signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump said Friday during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.

The actions follow the release earlier this month of his proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 spending that would slash more than $400 million from the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy.

Specifically, the newly signed executive orders allow for reactor design testing at the DOE’s National Labs; permit the DOE and the U.S. Department of Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land; ramp up the nation’s mining and enrichment of uranium; and require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) — which licenses nuclear reactors — to do so within 18 months of a requested license, according to the White House.

“Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America — that ends now,” said White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios on Friday. “Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades.”

Kratsios added that the goal is to restore a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuild a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and lead the world toward a future fueled by American nuclear energy.

“These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies,” he said.

Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) President and CEO Maria Korsnick attended the signing ceremony at the White House for the four executive orders signed by Trump.

“We appreciate the administration’s ongoing actions to preserve existing nuclear plants and usher in the deployment of next generation nuclear,” an NEI spokesperson said in a May 23 statement. “Policies to strengthen nuclear are essential to bolstering our national security and meeting our energy goals.”

NEI also said it looks forward to working with the administration and other stakeholders to ensure the implementation of the orders will help to build a reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy system.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright pointed out that the emergence of AI and the administration’s “pro-American manufacturing policies” will help unleash civil nuclear energy at the perfect time.

“Nuclear has the potential to be America’s greatest source of energy addition,” said Wright. “President Trump’s executive orders today unshackle our civil nuclear energy industry and ensure it can meet this critical moment.”

U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said the executive orders expand the administration’s so-called “Energy Dominance” agenda.

“As energy demand continues to surge, expanding our existing nuclear fleet and investing in advanced nuclear technologies ensures we have reliable energy to power our homes, fuel for President Trump’s manufacturing revolution, and a stronger electric grid,” said Burgum.

Asked about whether the executive orders would result in any reduction in NRC staff, a government official told CNN that, “reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”

The order to reform the NRC says the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”

In addition to these four orders, the president signed an executive order implementing what the White House has dubbed the “Gold Standard Science” to rebuild public trust in the national science enterprise.

The executive order defines the gold-standard science as “reproducible, transparent, falsifiable, subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, collaborative, interdisciplinary, accepting of negative results, and free from conflicts of interests.”

It also requires federal research agencies to conform their existing programs and activities to these fundamentals.

In addition to federal agencies, the administration is issuing a call to excellence for all American researchers and academic institutions to go back to the basics by restoring this gold standard.

“With this executive order, we are recommitting ourselves to scientific best practices and empowering America’s researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries,” Kratsios said, noting that the standard “starts in the policies and programs of our great federal research institutions, and continues with partnership across academia, industry, and philanthropy.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shutterstock_1038346219.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 04:02:10.147230

But, by allowing the case to proceed through the German court system for a decade, had accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs from around the world can use German property laws to sue German companies over their carbon emissions.","LIMA, Peru — A Peruvian farmer and mountain guide has lost a landmark climate change lawsuit against one of Europe's largest power companies.

Saúl Luciano Lliuya, who lives in a city in the central Ancash region, in the heart of the Andes, sued RWE, one of Europe's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, over the risk of flooding to his home from a glacial lake swollen by climate change. Although RWE has never operated in Peru, Luciano Lliuya argued the company's emissions contributed to the melting glaciers threatening his city.

But a court in Hamm, in northwestern Germany, ruled that the probability of the lake bursting its banks and devastating his home and the homes of some 50,000 other people in the area was too small for RWE to be held liable. It also barred him from appealing the verdict.

The ruling brings to an end a decade-long lawsuit in which Luciano Lliuya, supported by environmental group Germanwatch, had sought roughly $18,000 from RWE to pay for 0.5% of the cost of building a dyke to protect his home and the homes of his neighbors - the percentage equal to the proportion of RWA's total historic carbon emissions according to Germanwatch.

The company is now moving quickly into renewable energy and vows to become carbon neutral by 2040. But its power plants have been running on coal for more than a century.

Germanwatch warned that Lake Palcacocha had swollen to more than 30 times its historic volume and could overflow catastrophically in the event of an avalanche.

Ultimately, the court ruled that the probability of that happening was just over 1% in the next 30 years, below the threshold under German law for RWE to be found liable.

The German energy giant had argued that the issue of climate change should be resolved by governments and not in a court. In a statement after the verdict on Wednesday, RWE said a win against them would have had ""unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location, because ultimately claims could be asserted against any German company anywhere in the world for damage caused by climate change.""

This is just one of a wave of climate litigation cases against big industry and governments in recent years. Germanwatch is still claiming a win. It says that the court ruled on the specific risk of Lake Palcacocha bursting its banks. But, by allowing the case to proceed through the German court system for a decade, had accepted the broader principle that climate change plaintiffs from around the world can use German property laws to sue German companies over their carbon emissions.

Petra Minnerop, an expert in international climate law at the United Kingdom's Durham University, who was not involved in the case, broadly backed Germanwatch's interpretation. ""It was only a factual question, not a legal one,"" she told NPR, meaning that the door remained open for similar litigation in Germany.

Table 1: House Bill Changes to IRA Tax Credit Termination Dates [1] Text - H.R.1 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): One Big Beautiful Bill Act, H.R.1, 119th Cong.","Introduction

On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives approved H.R. 1, also known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the House Bill).1 The House Bill will next be considered by the U.S. Senate. The House Bill includes a number of provisions of interest to Wilson Sonsini clients. First, the House Bill would permanently extend many of the tax provisions initially introduced by P.L. 115-97, more commonly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (TCJA) and introduces other significant income tax changes relevant to businesses. In addition, the House Bill proposes to accelerate termination of or eliminate several of the tax provisions in P.L. 117-169, more commonly known as the “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) related to renewable energy credits. This alert summarizes the key provisions companies need to know in the House Bill.

For expanded coverage of the impact of the House Bill on Energy and Climate Solutions, please see this Wilson Sonsini alert, and for expanded coverage of the general tax provisions, please see this Wilson Sonsini alert.

Summary of General Tax Provisions Impacting Domestic and Multinational Businesses

The House Bill temporarily suspends the requirement to capitalize and amortize domestic R&D expenses for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2030. Foreign R&D costs must still be amortized over a 15-year period.

The deduction afforded to owners of certain pass-through businesses for qualified business income (QBI) is increased to 23 percent (resulting in an effective tax rate of 28.49 percent on QBI) and permanently extended. In addition, the complex phase-in limitations are replaced with a simplified two-step process that reduces the deduction for taxpayers with taxable income over the threshold amount, increasing the availability of the deduction.

The House Bill reinstates “bonus depreciation” for qualified property placed in service on or after January 20, 2025, and before January 1, 2030 (with certain exceptions), and increases the thresholds on permitted bonus depreciation. In addition, the full cost of certain “qualified production property” acquired or for which construction begins on or after January 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and that is placed into service before January 1, 2033, is also eligible for bonus depreciation. The property must be used in connection with the manufacturing, agriculture and chemical production or refining of tangible personal property and must result in “a substantial transformation of the property comprising the product.”

The calculation of the cap on the deduction for net business interest expense is changed from 30 percent of a taxpayer's earnings before income taxes (EBIT) to 30 percent of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as was the case prior to January 1, 2022.

Thresholds for filing IRS Forms 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC (miscellaneous income and nonemployee compensation, respectively) reporting is increased from at least $600 in a taxable year to at least $2,000 in a taxable year, indexed to inflation. The threshold for filing IRS Form 1099-K (payment card and third-party transactions) is increased from at least $600 in a taxable year to more than $20,000 and 200 transactions, significantly reducing the 1099-K filing burdens.

As anticipated, the House Bill increases the cap on deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from $10,000 (or $20,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The cap is phased down to $10,000 for taxpayers with a modified gross income over $500,000 (or $5,000 and $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The House Bill also eliminates the pass-through entity tax (PTET) workaround for businesses engaged in Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTBs), which has been a popular planning tool for owners in pass-through entities.

The House Bill slightly decreases rates for deduction of foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) (from 37.5 percent to 36.5 percent and 50 percent to 49.2 percent, respectively), but the proposed rates are significantly higher than rate cuts expected to go into effect on January 1, 2026 (21.875 percent and 37.5 percent). Similarly, the House Bill sets the rate on base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) to 10.1 percent from 10 percent currently, but lower than the 12.5 percent rate expected to go into effect on January 1, 2026.

In what appears to be a reaction to the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development’s Pillar Two initiative, the House Bill introduces a new income tax regime that increases tax rates on taxpayers associated with foreign countries that impose an “unfair foreign tax,” including taxes imposed under an undertaxed profits rule, digital services taxes, and diverted profits taxes. Payments made to persons associates with such countries may also be subject to increased withholding tax rates.

Summary of Provisions Impacting the Energy and Climate Solutions Sector

Eight tax credits enacted or extended by the IRA would fully terminate on December 31, 2025, including all of the electric vehicle (EV)-related tax credits and certain energy efficient home credits.

The clean energy production credit (Tech-Neutral PTC) and clean energy investment credit (Tech Neutral ITC) would terminate for any qualified facility (other than qualified nuclear facilities) or energy storage technology (EST), as applicable, which begins construction more than 60 days after enactment of the House Bill, and for any qualified facility (other than qualified nuclear facilities) or EST, as applicable, that is placed in service after 2028. In addition, several other energy-related credits would terminate earlier than what is provided for under current law.

The House Bill retains IRA’s transferability regime for eligible credits, subject to the timing of the underlying credit and, in some cases, earlier termination dates specifically for transferability.

The House Bill introduces significant restrictions beginning in 2026 around certain “prohibited foreign entities” (PFEs), which includes both “specified foreign entities” (SFEs) and “foreign-influenced entities” (FIEs). SFEs consist of various foreign entities of concern appearing on certain national security lists, as well as “foreign-controlled entities,” which are focused on the “covered nations” of China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia, and FIEs include entities for which one or more SFE has significant ownership, control, or influence over its operations. These rules limit not only who can invest in renewable energy projects, but also who can supply components and know-how to develop them.

Except for the foreign entity restrictions discussed above, the House Bill would not affect the carbon sequestration tax credit and extends the clean fuels tax credit to a new proposed termination date of December 31, 2031. In addition, the House Bill requires that to qualify for the clean fuels tax credit, the fuel produced must be exclusively derived from a feedstock produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.

[2] The House Bill creates a limited exception to this expiration date, under which vehicles produced by manufacturers that have not sold over 200,000 “covered vehicles” (i.e., any vehicles that would have qualified for the Section 30C credit) for use in the U.S. between December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2025, may qualify for the credit, if they are placed in service in calendar year 2026.

[3] Homes that have commenced construction by May 12, 2025, are eligible for the credit if they are acquired by December 31, 2026.

[4] Under the termination dates provided by both IRA and the House Bill, hydrogen facilities must have begun construction on or prior to the relevant termination date to be eligible for the 10-year production-based credit.

[5] Under IRA, the Section 45X credit begins to phase out in 2030 when the credit is worth 75 percent, and steps down in 25 percent increments until full termination in 2033; this phase-out schedule only applies to eligible components and not critical minerals.

[6] The House Bill does not change the existing phase-out schedule, meaning the credit would be worth 75 percent in 2030 and 50 percent in 2031, and also imposes this schedule (and termination) on critical minerals.

[7] Under the House Bill, the legacy ITC for geothermal heat pumps would phase out as follows: for property beginning construction in 2030, the base credit would be 5.2 percent (26 percent with prevailing wage and apprenticeship multiplier) and for property beginning construction in 2031, the base credit would be 4.4 percent (22 percent with prevailing wage and apprenticeship multiplier).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7499_58.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 22:04:17.278897

THE MUSK EFFECT: Elon Musk played a key role in killing California’s electric vehicle mandate — and he’s still a thorn in the side of Democrats as they try to get their EV ambitions back on track.

A new national poll conducted by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report just before Senate Republicans voted last week to revoke California’s vehicle emissions rules — shared exclusively with POLITICO — shows how much Musk and Tesla have complicated the EV landscape for Democratic voters.

While liberal voters — the most likely buyers of EVs — leaned toward both supporting requirements for car companies to sell more electric models and keeping California’s ability to set stronger-than-federal emissions standards, they don’t like the credit-trading system state officials devised to make that happen.

More than half of Democrats surveyed — 56 percent — said they oppose “allowing carmakers to sell their extra credits to other carmakers” that don’t hit their sales targets, while only 20 percent said they support the concept, according to the poll from Democratic consultant and pollster Evan Roth Smith. Republicans and independents also balked at the idea, with fewer than 30 percent in both categories saying they support credit sales.

Tesla has already contributed to stagnating EV sales in California, which saw slightly fewer purchases over the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period last year. While registrations of EV models by other makers jumped 14 percent, Tesla plunged by just over 21 percent, canceling out any gains.

Market experts say the results are in part due to the complicated nature of EV sales regulations. But they also point to a string of stories highlighting the fact that California’s rules undoubtedly helped turn Tesla into an EV behemoth. That’s because the state’s mandate requires automakers who don’t meet their sales requirements to buy credits from those that sell more, offering Musk’s company a lucrative revenue stream as the dominant player for over a decade.

“I think what it’s really about is hostility to Tesla and how they’ve been benefiting from this,” said Dan Sperling, director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis and a former member of the California Air Resources Board. “They just see it as Tesla getting a boondoggle deal.”

Musk’s rise to the role of Trump’s top fundraiser, adviser and architect of the administration’s slash-and-burn of the federal workforce has made Tesla — his largest and most public-facing company — the target of Democratic outrage.

The eccentric billionaire has since hinted that he’ll step back from politics, as Tesla’s revenues have plummeted amid sales contractions in Europe and California, America’s biggest car market.

But Smith said the damage has already been done, and California officials now need to go on the offensive to create daylight between Musk, Tesla and the larger EV market.

“We have the president of the United States selling Teslas from the White House,” Smith said. “So if Democrats want to preserve a political environment where they can enact real climate policy around EVs, they have to be a little more courageous and play a similar game.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom has signaled he’s thinking about playing hardball. Newsom said in November that he’d push to restore state EV tax credits if the Trump administration does away with a $7,500 federal incentive, as the “megabill” passed by House Republicans last week would largely do. (It would cap benefits for companies that already have a large market share or have received substantial state support, i.e. Tesla).

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor, when asked about the tax credit proposal, pointed to a press conference last week where the governor said he’s still waiting to see what happens in the Senate and that lawmakers should assess impacts on the state budget.

Smith said now is the time for Democrats to dig in.

“I don’t think Democrats should be shy about this,” he said. — AN

JUST CHECK ZILLOW: Angelenos with federal disaster loans to repair and rebuild homes destroyed in the January firestorm are borrowing $310,000 on average — six times more than the average borrowed by other disaster victims nationwide between 2017 and 2024, according to an analysis by Tom Frank of POLITICO’s E&E News.

That’s partly because the Biden administration increased the maximum Small Business Administration loan for home repairs after a disaster to $500,000 from $200,000 in July 2023, the first such increase since 1994.

But it’s also because the Los Angeles recovery is just so expensive, with the January fires hitting high-end real estate and causing more damage than floods and high winds.

For comparison, other states have also seen their average disaster loans increase, but not by as much: In Florida, the average disaster loan in 2025 has been $65,000, compared with $47,000 from 2017 through 2024. In North Carolina, the average in 2025 has been $55,000, compared with $36,000 from 2017 through 2024. — TF, CvK

NOT SO LAST-RESORT: The growth of California’s insurer of last-resort, the FAIR Plan, has not slowed despite the rate hikes regulators are approving for other private insurers to entice them to do more business in the fire-prone state.

FAIR Plan President Victoria Roach told lawmakers in Sacramento today her organization, which is actually a pool of private insurers required by state law to provide back-up insurance, is on track to grow by 40 percent in number of customers this year and 60 percent in total value insured, which is similar growth to last year.

“The growth just keeps going,” said Roach. “It shows that the market is in an unhealthy state right now.”

What’s more, those newcomers aren’t just coming from high fire risk areas, which private insurers ditched first because of historic wildfire losses. They’re also now increasingly coming from what Roach called “normal suburban tract homes,” with the FAIR Plan’s highest growth this year so far in low fire risk areas. — CvK

PUT A FORK IN IT: California air regulators have settled a lawsuit with the propane industry that challenged a rule banning the sale of new gas-powered forklifts.

The Western Propane Gas Association announced the details of the settlement Wednesday, a day after the California Air Resources Board issued an advisory encouraging companies to voluntarily report their progress at phasing in electric forklifts, but saying the agency wouldn’t retroactively hold them responsible if the rule is enforced in the future.

CARB approved the rule in June, but never received an EPA waiver that would make it enforceable. State officials agreed in the settlement to not enforce the regulation before getting federal approval, to name a new deputy executive director to serve as a liaison for the forklift industry and to hold three public workshops with WPGA. — AN

PERMITTING SHERPA: The Trump administration has tapped a top energy and environment staffer for former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to lead its efforts to speed up permitting for major projects.

Emily Domenech is the new executive director of the Permitting Council, a federal agency tasked with modernizing the permitting and review process for large infrastructure projects. She was most recently a lobbyist at the firm Boundary Stone Partners, Kelsey Brugger reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

Domenech told Kelsey her role is to “sherpa” major projects through multiple agencies, and pointed to mining projects as a top focus. The agency added 10 mining projects, some of them contentious, to its public dashboard of projects earlier this month. — AN

They’ve driven uncertainty to a peak, hurt our small businesses, and greatly raised the danger of a recession.
“The U.S. Court of International Trade agreed with what I and others have said for months: Trump was clearly abusing emergency authorities in ways not authorized by Congress to impose damaging tariffs on other countries, with obviously pretextual excuses.
Trump has threatened additional tariffs under this authority, known as Section 232, on semiconductor chips, copper, and pharmaceuticals, and he clearly is intent on abusing this power as well.
My bill, the Congressional Trade Authority Act, would prevent Trump from abusing this provision, return trade authority to Congress, where it belongs, and stop Trump’s trade war from doing further harm to the United States and the world.","Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA), who serves on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade and chairs the New Democrat Coalition’s Trade Task Force, issued the following statement on a ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade vacating and permanently enjoining Donald Trump’s across-the-board tariffs on nearly every country in the world, including his “Liberation Day” tariffs and separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China:

“This ruling is a major victory for the American people, who have spent months under threat of a stupid, self-imposed economic disaster thanks to Donald Trump’s trade war. Trump’s tariffs have already raised costs on Americans, strained our alliances, hurt our credibility, and threatened the global economy. They’ve driven uncertainty to a peak, hurt our small businesses, and greatly raised the danger of a recession.

“The U.S. Court of International Trade agreed with what I and others have said for months: Trump was clearly abusing emergency authorities in ways not authorized by Congress to impose damaging tariffs on other countries, with obviously pretextual excuses. Abuse of power has been the most consistent theme of Trump’s presidency, including power grabs on immigration, elections, and the structure of the government itself, which are clearly illegal and unconstitutional. Such is the case here.

“It is important to note that while Trump’s broadest tariffs, which he imposed using authorities under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, were just blocked by the Court, but his sector-based tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, and auto parts are not affected by this ruling and remain in place. Trump has threatened additional tariffs under this authority, known as Section 232, on semiconductor chips, copper, and pharmaceuticals, and he clearly is intent on abusing this power as well. My bill, the Congressional Trade Authority Act, would prevent Trump from abusing this provision, return trade authority to Congress, where it belongs, and stop Trump’s trade war from doing further harm to the United States and the world.

This bill would accelerate the expiration of nearly every major clean energy tax credit, which would be devastating to America’s energy transition. The proposal would end the tax credit for used electric vehicles and new EVs (with minor exceptions) by the end of 2025.

Residential energy efficiency credits would also disappear that year. The Clean Electricity Investment and Production tax credits would be phased down starting in 2029—three years earlier than planned—and completely eliminated by 2032 instead of 2035.

These aren’t minor technical changes. They are an aggressive dismantling of the very policies that have powered America’s clean energy boom. In 2024 alone, 93% of all new American energy supply came from solar, wind, and battery storage.

Gutting support for these industries just as energy demand is spiking—from the growth of artificial intelligence and crypto mining to expanded home electrification—would result in skyrocketing energy costs for families and businesses.

According to current estimates, repealing these clean energy tax credits would raise household electricity bills by more than $110 per year starting next year.

Worse yet, the bill would impose new restrictions so stringent that even the few remaining clean energy incentives would become inaccessible to most companies. This triple-pronged assault—early sunsets, fast phase-outs, and regulatory barriers are designed not just to slow down our clean energy progress, but to reverse it.

Clean energy investments are already creating jobs, lowering costs, and driving growth, especially in Republican districts. Since 2022, over half of the new clean energy jobs have been created in these very districts. Yet this bill would sabotage those economic gains in the name of short-term budget optics.

Fortunately, we can likely count on Senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego to oppose this legislation in the Senate. In the House, Democratic Representatives like Greg Stanton are expected to fight against it.

However, it will be impossible to sway most AZ Republican representatives—except maybe Reps. Juan Ciscomani and David Schweikert.

Now is the time for New York’s legislature to double down on rooftop and community solar by passing the ASAP Act.
We strongly urge lawmakers to pass the ASAP Act and keep New York at the forefront of clean energy leadership.""","Albany, NY – New York State Senator Pete Harckham was joined today by environmental and labor advocates at major rally at the State Capitol in support of legislation that aims to advance the successes of New York’s solar energy sector, as it creates thousands of new green jobs statewide, saves ratepayers billions of dollars and avoids emitting millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

The rally, which took place at the Million Dollar Staircase, was in support of the Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power (ASAP) Act (S.6570), legislation introduced by Harckham that sets a new target for “distributed”—i.e. rooftop and community—solar energy capacity. In addition to raising New York’s rooftop and community solar goal to 20 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, the ASAP Act directs the New York’s Public Service Commission (PSC) to implement common-sense reforms to the utility interconnection process in order to lower costs and accelerate deployment.

To see a video of the rally, click here.

“The implementation of solar energy systems statewide, including in underserved, low-income communities, deserves as much support and encouragement as possible,” said Harckham. “New York’s clean energy momentum is an incubator for good-paying blue- and white-collar jobs and ramping up our gigawatt goals will reduce energy costs for residents, provide cleaner, healthier air to breathe as well, and benefit our communities in countless ways.”

New York must significantly scale up clean energy deployment to meet the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) mandate of 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and zero-emissions electricity by 2040. ASAP raises the state’s distributed solar target from 10 GW by 2030 to 20 GW by 2035, supporting residential, commercial, and community solar access across New York. The legislation also directs the PSC and NYSERDA to develop a plan to cost-effectively achieve the expanded solar goal.

State Senator Liz Krueger said, “Solar is leading the way in delivering a more affordable and sustainable clean energy future in New York. We should be doubling down on this winning bet by increasing our ambitions and getting rid of unnecessary costs that weigh down solar interconnections. I thank Sen. Harckham for his leadership on this important issue.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett, chair of the Assembly Energy Committee, said, “New Yorkers have worked hard to reach—and surpass—the state’s distributed solar goal. And this success is a testament to the important role that these renewable energy projects will play in helping to reach our CLCPA goals. It stands to reason that we should build on our successes and continue to support the distributed solar industry.”

New York’s solar industry employs over 15,000 workers statewide. Right now, the state is ahead of schedule toward its 10 GW by 2030 rooftop and community solar goal. Building an additional 10 GW of distributed solar over the next decade will boost New York’s “affordability agenda” with ratepayer savings and revenue for municipalities and school districts while doubling the number of solar industry jobs.

The ASAP Act requires reforms to the utility interconnection process in order to streamline processes and lower costs for ratepayers. The legislation requires electric utilities to report and publish their actual distribution upgrade costs, enabling greater accountability and fairer cost estimation for solar developers. It also creates guardrails to protect against cost overruns, providing market clarity and reducing price volatility and surprise charges.

In terms of streamlining solar projects, the legislation directs utilities to establish a self-performance option allowing qualified solar developers to complete certain interconnection upgrades themselves—lowering costs and avoiding utility bottlenecks.

Prevailing wage requirements in the bill will ensure solar expansion creates high-quality local jobs. Additionally, is meant to support local solar supply chains, electricians, and construction workers—stimulating green job growth and attracting private-sector investment in New York’s clean energy economy.

The ASAP Act also directs New York’s utilities to expand upon their successful flexible interconnection pilot programs, an innovative approach that leverages smart grid technology to integrate more solar and energy storage capacity while avoiding cost-prohibitive traditional distribution system upgrades.

Lastly, the ASAP Act promotes equitable access by requiring at least 35% of solar program investments benefit disadvantaged and low-to-moderate-income communities.

Noah Ginsburg, Executive Director, NYSEIA, said, ""At a time when clean energy is under attack at the federal level, state-level leadership has never been more important. Now is the time for New York’s legislature to double down on rooftop and community solar by passing the ASAP Act. Not only will the ASAP Act deliver billions of dollars of electricity bill savings to New York families and businesses; it will also provide revenue to rural communities and support more than 15,000 good local jobs in the solar industry.""

Michael Richardson, Co-facilitator, Third Act Upstate New York, said, ""Climate scientists have issued a clarion call that we must massively fast-track the buildout of renewable energy generation on all fronts if we are to avert critical tipping points in the climate system. The ASAP Act would do much to answer that call by advancing the buildout of rooftop and community solar and streamlining the utility interconnection process. What is needed at this time when federal support for solar is being erased is dynamic state leadership to continue and expand those solar programs that have proven success.""

Kate Daniel, Northeast Regional Director of Coalition for Community Solar Access, said, “We are proud to be gathering in support of the ASAP Act—the bold, necessary step New York needs to power our present and our future. By doubling the state’s distributed solar goal and cutting red tape, this legislation delivers on affordability, equity, and climate. It means lower energy bills for working families, thousands of good-paying local jobs, and a smarter, cleaner grid for everyone. We strongly urge lawmakers to pass the ASAP Act and keep New York at the forefront of clean energy leadership.""

Vincent Albanese, New York State Laborers PAC Director, said, “The New York State Laborers staunchly support the ASAP Act, legislation that will create union jobs and shepherd the state toward a clean energy future. It is vital this legislation pass in order to safeguard the future of solar in New York State, improve interconnection, protect the environment for future generations of New Yorkers and create career-track jobs.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/05/28/asap-press-conf-5-28-25.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 23:05:05.657321

The New Mexico Environment Department today filed a lawsuit in the Third Judicial District Court in Las Cruces, asking the court to appoint an independent manager to oversee the daily operations of the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority, or CRRUA.

If granted, the order would effectively place the troubled water system into a status similar to receivership. The request comes after more than a decade of mismanagement at the utility, most recently demonstrated by repeated failed arsenic tests conducted by both CRRUA staff and NMED compliance and enforcement staff.

In addition to failing to properly treat its drinking water, CRRUA also failed to inform its customers of the dangerous levels of arsenic in their tap water — a violation that has been repeated for years.

“While the Environment Department has invested significant technical resources to assist CRRUA in fulfilling its duty to deliver safe and reliable drinking water, its failures continue to threaten public health,” said Environment Department Sec. James Kenney. “Today’s lawsuit and request to appoint an independent manager to oversee CRRUA signals a new approach in Environment Department efforts to protect the health of communities when they turn on their tap.”

NMED is seeking additional relief from the court, ordering CRRUA to:

Implement real-time arsenic monitoring

Distribute free arsenic test strips for all CRRUA customers

Provide an alternative drinking water source if arsenic levels exceed state limits

Conduct monthly public meetings

Pay civil penalties which, per state law, fund drinking water and wastewater utility operators for communities across New Mexico

Today’s filing aligns with NMED’s broader attitude towards water systems that habitually violate state drinking water regulations. In July 2024, NMED put 138 drinking systems across the state on notice, informing their owners that they had 15 days to submit a plan to resolve them.

However, many water systems remain out of compliance — including the City of Las Vegas and Cassandra Water System in Moriarity. If utility management cannot consistently provide safe, reliable drinking water to New Mexicans, the State will not hesitate to have them replaced.

Tu Le is Chief Executive Officer of Sino Auto Insights and Expert-in-Residence at TechTown Detroit.","Seven years ago, I wrote an op-ed for the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing titled ""The Driverless Duel."" I was living in China at the time —13 years in total — where I launched my consultancy, Sino Auto Insights, focused on mobility and transportation. In 2022, I moved back to Michigan.

In that piece, I made a prediction:

“Electric vehicles will be affordable to a large part of the market, and by 2025, people all over the world will have plenty of options at different price points.”

I was right. Kind of. In 2018, China sold 1.26 million New Energy Vehicles (NEVs—EVs + PHEVs). The U.S. sold just 361,000, mostly Teslas. By 2024, China’s NEV sales had skyrocketed to nearly 11 million. The U.S.? 1.5 million. China didn’t just lead — it lapped the field.

Fact: China became the world’s largest passenger vehicle market in 2009.

Fact: In 2024, nearly one in every two vehicles sold in China was an NEV.

Fact: Stellantis Chairman John Elkann said China’s car market will likely outsell the U.S. and EU combined in 2025.

China EV Inc. has spent the last seven years refining its EVs — more range, more tech, lower prices. A brutal price war — launched by Tesla in 2022 — is now in its third year.

At Sino Auto Insights, we’ve observed this transformation and distilled it into three phases defining the future of transportation: electrification, smartification and autonomation.

While the U.S. and EU are still slogging through electrification, China has sprinted into autonomation — where intelligent driving is rapidly becoming the norm.

Why the leap? Nearly every Chinese EV startup — and many legacy automakers including GM — now offer Level 2+ intelligent driving. And they’re all far cheaper than Tesla’s Full Self Driving.

Then came BYD’s seismic announcement: in February 2025, they made their Level 2+ system, God’s Eye, standard on 22 of their 28 models. That’s not a moonshot — that’s mass deployment. BYD will sell about 5.5 million cars in more than 100 countries this year. Most will have L2+ capabilities.

So how good are these systems? I’ve driven them. Extensively.

Last year, a friend and I drove an XPeng G9 from Beijing to Shenzhen — 1,200 miles in three days — using XPeng’s X-NGP intelligent driving for about 90% of the miles. This year, I drove a NIO ET5 with battery swapping tech from Beijing to Shanghai, relying on NIO’s NOP+ system, also for about 90% of the miles.

Both blew me away. Yes, they still require attention, but the tech is real, usable and evolving fast. When cutting-edge tech becomes mainstream, adoption isn’t linear — it’s exponential. Put it in 5 million cars? It explodes.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., we’re debating whether California should even be allowed to shape its own EV future.

I’m a Michigan boomerang — born here, spent years in the Bay Area and Beijing, and came back. Why? Family, yes. But just as importantly, to help position Detroit, Michigan and the U.S. as global players in the mobility revolution.

We need bold founders, daring startups, and relentless ambition. The legacy OEMs can’t do it alone. They need help. And Michigan — America’s mobility nerve center — has to lead.

If we’re ever going to catch up, let alone compete, we need to move into smartification and autonomation. Not next year. Not next decade. Now.

What are we waiting for?

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.
Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky?
The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency.
A power supply operating on the margins is a recipe for disaster.","A sudden blackout across Spain and Portugal earlier this month left 50 million people without electricity. While the cause of the outage is unclear, a leading culprit appears to be poorly integrated wind and solar resources. What’s clear is that, in an increasingly digital age, ensuring affordable and reliable power is more critical than ever.

The Spain-Portugal blackout came as U.S. power regulation authorities sounded an alarm about the safety of America’s electric grid and power supply. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky? And could Spain’s massive blackout happen here?

Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars. And when Americans crank up their air conditioners amid scorching summer heat, regional utilities must meet that hefty additional demand.

The problem is that there might not be enough electricity to go around.

The United States is suddenly using a lot more electricity than before. Electric vehicles, new manufacturing plants, and an exponentially growing array of data centers — which support the digital needs of cell phones, web browsers and AI systems — are gobbling up power. Power demand is growing so fast that, in the past year, NERC found America’s peak electricity needs grew by a staggering 10 gigawatts. That’s more than double the growth seen between 2023 and 2024.

Surging demand is also colliding with the remnants of a regulatory agenda that aimed to wipe out America’s coal power plant fleet and make it impossible to build coal and natural gas power plants. While the Trump administration has worked to undo this misguided regulatory blitz, grid operators have lost essential dispatchable power plants that work on demand. They’re now increasingly reliant on renewable power systems subject to the weather’s whims.

Because of this, NERC says that grid operators “face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

The greatest threat to grids nationwide will be heat waves when demand spikes. Windless, scorching summer days — and evenings when solar power disappears — could leave grids alarmingly short of supply.

NERC’s summer reliability warnings preview a growing risk. A few months ago, NERC warned in a long-term reliability assessment that more than half of North America faces a risk of energy shortfalls in the next five to 10 years as rising demand collides with the loss of traditional power plants.

The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie has observed that America is now “losing dispatchable generation at a pace that is not sustainable, and we are not adding sufficient equivalent generation capacity.”

The math is clear: The United States cannot afford to lose more existing power plants as we scramble to meet rising demand. The first place to start in addressing our looming power shortfalls is to ensure we don’t make our self-imposed hole deeper.

A power supply operating on the margins is a recipe for disaster. The Iberian blackout was a timely reminder of the risks we face. It’s time to heed the warnings of our grid operators and reliability regulators and rebuild solid, long-term electricity generation while there’s still time.

But this isn’t the first time Trump has tried to dismantle clean air protections.

Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress have eroded decades of progress, weakening the policies and safeguards we rely on to keep our air safe.

For more than 50 years, Earthjustice has used the power of the law to fight for the fundamental right to breathe clean air. The latest attacks against this right are unlawful, and we won’t back down.

Here’s what’s at stake, how it could damage public health, and what we are doing to fight back.

1. Slashing efforts to clean up car and truck pollution

Emissions from gas-powered vehicles are the largest source of carbon pollution in the country. And tailpipe pollution isn’t just a climate threat, it’s a public health risk fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory harm. Under the Clean Air Act, states hold the authority to pass stronger car and truck tailpipe pollution standards than the federal government to protect their residents.

Last week, Senate Republicans used an unlawful maneuver to overturn strong standards that a dozen states have adopted to protect their residents. The three state standards under attack – the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and the Heavy-duty Omnibus rule – can save thousands of lives a year from the heart and lung problems associated with tailpipe pollution. They also deliver billions in economic benefits and public health savings. In California alone, they’re slated to save the public an estimated $45 billion in health costs.

2. Freezing funds for EV charging stations across the nation

Despite the need to cut traffic pollution and modernize our transportation system, the Trump administration is withholding billions of dollars that Congress already allocated to build a national network of EV charging stations. Earthjustice has moved to join a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.

A national charging network is essential to accelerating the transition to zero-emissions, electric vehicles – a transition that is already underway as more Americans choose electric cars and trucks. Investing in this infrastructure is not only critical to ending harmful tailpipe pollution, but also keeping the U.S. economy competitive as the rest of the world goes electric. That’s why Congress promised billions for states to build out this infrastructure.

By freezing the money, the Trump administration is stalling climate progress and violating several laws, including the Constitution, which gives Congress — not the White House or the executive branch — the power of the purse.

3. Letting thousands of the worst polluters turn off clean air protections

Congress just let thousands of top polluters turn off technologies that capture or limit some of the most dangerous air pollutants.

Some 1,800 industrial facilities — including chemical plants, refineries, and pesticide manufactures — will be allowed to reclassify themselves as “minor polluters.” That frees them from the obligation to monitor, control, or report the most dangerous emissions. The facilities can shut off controls for seven of the most hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, dioxins, and PCBs, which are linked to birth defects, developmental harm, and cancers. These chemicals accumulate in the body and pose severe risks to pregnant women, infants, and children.

4. Want to pollute? Just email the White House

The EPA announced in April that companies can simply send an email to the Trump administration asking for permission to pollute on grounds of “national security.” Within weeks, Trump’s EPA granted exemptions to dozens of coal-fired power plants, allowing them to release more mercury, arsenic, and acid into our air. The administration is also considering granting exemptions to bypass clean air rules for eight additional polluting industries; rules that currently limit emissions of cancer-causing chemicals like ethylene oxide, chloroprene, and benzene.

The administration is using the “national security” excuse to stop the imminent retirement of a deadly coal plant in Michigan. According to the Clean Air Task Force’s Toll from Coal dashboard, the J.H. Campbell plant that the administration wants to extend is responsible for 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks every year. On top of the drastic health consequences, customers in the region will also have to pay more on their utility bills to cover the costs to keep the plant operational.

We will defend the right to clean air

This nonsensical wave of clean air attacks means more unregulated deadly pollution, dirtier air, and worsening public health. It doesn’t make economic sense, it isn’t in line with the direction the rest of the world is moving to build the clean infrastructure of the future with better air, and it isn’t what voters wanted.

But this isn’t the first time Trump has tried to dismantle clean air protections. When the first Trump administration delayed critical clean air safeguards, courts found these moves unlawful thanks in part to lawsuits by Earthjustice, workers, and communities.

We’re ready to go back to court to stop this Trump administration from gutting needed health protections and to ensure everyone’s right to breathe clean air.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2203455863_crop_2k.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 21:02:00.600930

(NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, issued a statement of support in response to the White House’s release of a series of executive orders focused on speeding up approval and adoption of advanced nuclear, reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), restoring the domestic nuclear supply chain, and overhauling testing and licensing processes for advanced nuclear.

As part of the announcement, Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte joined President Trump at the White House alongside other industry leaders. The event marked a historic moment in the administration’s effort to secure America’s energy future and unleash American energy dominance.

“These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

The executive orders direct agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to operate more effectively as both customers and enablers of new energy technologies. Oklo supports efforts to empower the DOE, DoD, and NRC to use existing authorities more efficiently and to prioritize performance-based, mission-aligned reviews.

Oklo is developing U.S. invented fast fission power plants capable of recycling used nuclear material and converting it into clean, firm power. The company is the only advanced nuclear developer with an active site use permit from the DOE, a fuel award through a competitive DOE and Idaho National Laboratory program, and active regulatory traction with the NRC for its first commercial power plant.

The executive orders also emphasize the importance of using existing feedstock of domestic nuclear fuel feedstock to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience. Oklo’s fuel award for its first core load is sourced from used nuclear fuel material from the successful Experimental Breeder Reactor II program.

The original NO GOTION Act was cosponsored by three Democratic members of the House.
Gotion is currently suing Green Charter Township over a breach of contract, work at the plant there is on hold.","A controversial proposed electric vehicle battery plant run by the company Gotion in mid-Michigan faces an uncertain future. That’s because a policy that would ban companies with ties to China from green energy tax credits has moved through the U.S. House earlier this month.

Gotion is a Chinese tech company. Their American subsidiary has plans to build an EV battery plant in Green Charter Township, located in Mecosta County. The $2 billion plant received over $175 million in state incentives.

The NO GOTION policy passed within the Big Beautiful Bill Act. It was introduced by U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Caledonia). The act would ban companies aligned with the Chinese government from taking advantage of green tax incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Moolenaar supports ending the mid-Michigan Gotion project, arguing Gotion's public ties to the Chinese Communist Party are a national security threat.

In a statement, Moolenaar touted the legislation saying the bill would ensure Michigan tax dollars “never go to Gotion and other companies affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party.”

Last year, a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing stated “Gotion is partially subsidized through government funding supplied by the People's Republic of China.”

The legislation currently sits in the Senate.

Skepticism of the Gotion deal has some bipartisan support. The original NO GOTION Act was cosponsored by three Democratic members of the House.

In addition, then-Representative Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) introduced a bill that would give the Committee on Foreign Investment more power to review sales to China-based companies. That bill had a Senate version backed by Democratic U.S. Senators Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow. Neither version passed.

This announcement comes on the heels of a budget reconciliation bill recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that proposes substantial reductions to clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While it has yet to pass the U.S. Senate, the legislation in its current form poses significant implications for the solar industry. PVH is encouraging developers to prepare accordingly.

""Time is of the essence,"" said Rodolfo Bitar, VP of Business Development for PVH USA. ""We are committed to supporting our partners during this period of policy transition by enabling them to take immediate steps to safeguard their projects' economics.""

Under current Internal Revenue Service regulations, projects can maintain eligibility for tax credits by demonstrating that at least 5% of the project's total capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been incurred before any new legislative changes take effect. By procuring tracker products now, developers can lock in the current, more favorable incentive structure. PVH USA's readiness to support up to 5GW of Safe Harbor product can help developers meet these CAPEX thresholds quickly, mitigating risk and preserving the long-term viability of their projects.

""PVH's scalable manufacturing and proven tracker technology position us to act decisively and reliably,"" Bitar said. ""We are encouraging developers to reach out now to explore Safe Harbor opportunities before the window of opportunity closes.""

Passed in 2022, the IRA was the country's largest ever investment in clean energy, allocating billions of dollars in tax credits to encourage investments in renewable generation, home energy efficiency and the purchase of electric vehicles. To date, the IRA is cited with helping to generate 330,000 new clean energy jobs and more than $70 billion in private investment in the American economy. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, U.S. solar industry employment is expected to double by 2033 and total U.S. solar capacity is projected to double to 440 GW by 2029.

It’s been more than two decades since major regulatory reforms were enacted.
The Senate now has the BBB, and with it the chance to ensure we don’t wait another 20 years.","In my latest Forbescolumn, I detail how the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) had the potential to revolutionize federal regulatory policy. But last-minute changes in the House stripped away provisions that could have both pruned existing rules and reshaped how regulations are made and managed henceforth. The Senate now takes up the BBB.

The original BBB featured reforms that would have strengthened Congress’s oversight of costly rules, particularly through tweaks to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). These changes would have enhanced disclosures about individual rules, and incorporated elements from the long-proposed Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act to secure congressional accountability over rulemaking.

Instead of simply allowing Congress to disapprove of notice-and-comment rules after enactment as the CRA now does, the original BBB aimed to require legislative approval for certain “major” rules—specifically those that increase government revenue (the BBB, after all, is a budget bill). This potentially could have added a powerful check on agencies imposing fees and penalties (with caveats, however; there was some nagging potential for progressives to exploit the change).

Another provision called for a comprehensive five-year sunset review of existing rules, such that rules would expire without Congress explicitly approving their continuance. The BBB also proposed addressing the so-called midnight rules concerns. Presidents tend to rush through rules in the final days of their terms; the BBB would have addressed that by allowing Congress to bundle such rules for disapproval.

Additionally, the bill directed the Government Accountability Office to perform a comprehensive estimate of regulatory costs.

Unfortunately, given the prospect of Senate procedural hurdles, these reforms were quietly dropped just prior to the BBB’s passage with single-line deletion.

However, as I noted in Forbes, hope isn’t lost. The final BBB incorporated a $100 million funding boost for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through 2028, earmarked to “improve regulatory processes and analyze and review rules” issued by several federal agencies. While the explicit congressional approvals, sunset mechanisms, and other innovations originally envisioned are now gone, this infusion still gives OMB an opportunity to streamline and modernize regulatory review.

Senate lawmakers now have a chance to reformat the foregoing provisions to avoid parliamentary fatality. Given the fusion of spending and regulation in modern America, bills like the BBB should increasingly tackle not just fiscal matters but also incorporate the overt and hidden costs of regulatory burdens. Proposals like a regulatory budget to cap the overall cost of new regulations could complement spending reforms and unleash economic growth—and may also be a better fit as far as parliamentary concerns go.

The policy brief highlighting these technologies can be found here.

Momentum is rapidly growing for advanced nuclear energy in the U.S. At the opening remarks for the 2025 United States Regulatory Information Conference in March, U.S. Senator and Chairman for the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, Shelley Moore Capito, held up to the audience a gift from Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Chairman David Wright – a solid white hat with the bold words “MAKE ATOMS GREAT AGAIN.” And in April, the Trump administration stated its support for advanced nuclear as part of a larger energy strategy for America to lead globally “in both energy production and environmental innovation.” Just one month later, the Trump administration issued four executive orders declaring that “it is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people.” The administration’s move is in line with public opinion. The most recent polling suggests a lopsided majority of Americans favor new nuclear energy.

CATF has long advocated for the advancement of nuclear energy as one of a suite of technologies critical to achieving a zero-emissions future at an affordable cost – and has been working specifically to transform the nuclear energy ecosystem to unlock economies of scale. Many of the policies in the orders are encouraging and are necessary to deploy new projects, but the federal government is still missing the mark on scaling advanced nuclear energy in the United States. In fact, Congress and the administration’s actions are misaligned with the administration’s stated goals of energy security, independence, and global leadership in nuclear technologies.

If the administration and Congress are serious about regaining U.S. leadership in nuclear energy and quadrupling American nuclear energy capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050, they must provide sustained and enhanced support for incentives and deployment programs at several agencies, including tax credits for clean energy development and generation and multiple offices within the Department of Energy (DOE).

Advanced nuclear energy can support American energy independence, provide reliable, affordable, and clean power, and create jobs.

Advanced nuclear energy is uniquely positioned to meet growing U.S. electricity and energy demand driven by data centers, expanded manufacturing, and the electrification of transport, heating, and industry. State legislatures across the U.S. continue to recognize advanced nuclear energy’s unique ability to support grid reliability and decarbonization goals, with more than half of states across the country pushing supportive policies for advanced nuclear energy deployment. These policies include the formation of early-stage multi-state coalitions, programs for scaled labor and supply chain development, repeals of decades-old moratoria on new nuclear power plants, and funding for feasibility studies to help support siting projects, among others.

This has sent a positive signal that has led to utility, industrial, and technology companies like Dow, Amazon, and Google signing commercial deals in Texas, Pennsylvania, and other states. Such agreements total nearly 17 gigawatts of additional U.S. nuclear capacity by 2040. The problem is very little of that capacity is currently under development, and industry alone is not able to overcome the economic barriers to reach efficient, cost-effective deployment. Meanwhile, Canada is leading G7 countries by providing financial support to Ontario Power Generation and moving forward with four advanced nuclear reactors that will create 18,000 Canadian jobs and add up to $500 million annually to Ontario’s economy. The U.S. nuclear industry is looking to the American government for strong and predictable leadership before undertaking new projects.

Bolstering the domestic advanced nuclear energy sector requires preserving existing incentives and greater collaboration to scale nuclear energy deployment.

A truly bold agenda would include:

Enhancement of front-end cost reduction federal mechanisms. The tech-neutral clean electricity investment and production tax credits under sections 48E and 45Y are essential for first- and early-of-a-kind projects that are aiming for early-to-mid 2030s deployment. While House Republicans were able to improve tax credits for new nuclear in a final version of the budget reconciliation bill sent to the Senate, the December 31, 2028 commence construction deadline will inhibit most new project construction. These credits, including provisions allowing the transferability of credits, should be extended through 2040 to support grid scale deployment of advanced nuclear. The 45X advanced manufacturing credit should also be extended through 2040 to assist in manufacturing capabilities for new projects, and Foreign Entity of Concern provisions for all three credits should be made workable to accommodate a global nuclear supply chain where limited domestic capabilities exist. Additionally, Congress must protect and enhance authority for the DOE’s Loan Programs Office to enable sufficient staffing, institutional management, and funding to support new nuclear development, and allow for blended federal financing with other DOE grants. This is especially true if, as set forth in one of President Trump’s nuclear executive orders, the administration plans to deploy 10 large, advanced nuclear reactors with LPO support.

Programs to support structured “orderbooks,” not isolated projects. While the administration’s plan for isolated project demonstrations across Department of Energy and Department of Defense sites, including the Generation III+ solicitation program, is exciting, it misses the core strategy required for scaling: replicating a standard plant design. Every successful nuclear buildout – domestically and globally – has involved deployment of multiple standardized units. A clear pipeline of projects sends a strong signal to scale up supply chains. Additionally, building out multiple units of the same design, thereby developing an orderbook of projects, enables cost reductions through replication and “learning by doing.” To achieve such cost reductions for advanced reactors, industry needs support for orderbooks, such as integrated project delivery (IPD) and risk management tools to lower up-front uncertainty from cost overruns. Congress can also expand existing DOE loan and grant programs to support orderbooks of advanced reactors.

Create a federal cost overrun insurance facility and other options to de-risk early builds. A cost insurance mechanism should feature tiered risk-sharing between project sponsors, states, and the federal government to protect against cost overruns. Access to cost overrun insurance would be granted only if certain conditions are met, including competitive selection, proven integrated project delivery, payment of a premium, and state support via Public Utility Commission (or equivalent) tariffs, offtake commitments, or cost ladders. In addition to an insurance mechanism, complementary options could be considered, like a Federal Power Purchase Agreement that uses a “contract-for-differences” model or directly procures a portfolio of nuclear projects through Build-Own-Transfer agreements, could help absorb first-of-a-kind risk. The federal government could also act as a co-developer alongside state or private entities, which is a model that was successfully used to deploy UAE’s Barakah project, as well as the Palisades restart in Michigan.

Scale the nuclear supply chain and make fuel available. Federal leadership is essential to help catalyze deployment of new reactors as supply chains mature. DOE and the national laboratory system can help centralize best practices in cost, project, and supply chain management; offer and support workforce training; and enable easier research and development through simplified Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs). Additionally, uncertainty about fuel availability for new reactor projects poses a significant risk. The previous administration enabled short- and long-term fuel supply development opportunities for both low- and high-assay enriched uranium fuel cycles, and now, the Trump administration must ensure these investments are anchored. As the authorized agency to implement LEU and HALEU procurement, the Office of Nuclear Energy at DOE must be appropriately staffed and empowered to develop the necessary programs for unlocking advanced nuclear energy.

Efficient and effective reactor licensing. Since the first Trump administration, the NRC has made progress towards a more modern regulatory organization by updating its regulations, optimizing its staffing, and implementing best practices to license new light water reactor and non-light water reactor technologies. Major pieces of legislation, including NEIMA in 2019 and the ADVANCE Act in 2024, have provided the NRC with specific legislative direction, additional hiring authority, and new statutory language to drive its modernization while maintaining its role as an independent agency focused on protecting the public and the environment. Now is not the time to undo years of regulatory reform through short-term cuts to NRC staffing or sudden reorganizations that will create long-term agency deficits, undermine the growing social license for nuclear energy, and harm interagency coordination with DOE, DOD, the U.S. Department of State, and other key agencies. Long-term modernization of the NRC, much like any critical infrastructure project, requires deliberate planning, continued investment, and robust oversight to make sure that both near-term and long-term licensing activities can be completed effectively, efficiently, and predictably. As part of ADVANCE Act implementation, the NRC is also updating regulatory processes that support rapid deployment of new nuclear energy based on reactor standardization and expedited environmental reviews. This should not be delayed by a wholesale review of NRC regulations.

Overhaul of the U.S. nuclear technology export offering. To deliver on the administration’s vision for U.S. energy dominance, the federal government must sharpen America’s competitive edge by reaching competitive parity with other global exporters, fostering interagency collaboration, and strengthening the capabilities of key diplomatic and financial agencies. In addition to the Section 123 Agreements encouraged by the executive orders, this includes establishing a national interest account to prioritize advanced nuclear fission export projects through the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM), raising its default cap, and modernizing EXIM’s mission to complement an international advanced nuclear fission deployment strategy. Raising the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation’s (DFC’s) contingent liability and loan size cap, as well as easing its country restrictions, would allow for a broader impact across the world. The administration’s call to accelerate the export of nuclear technologies comes on the heels of the reintroduction of the International Nuclear Energy Act (INEA) by the Senate, which would support the establishment of an office to coordinate on a secure and responsible civil nuclear export strategy, establish financing relationships, and promote regulatory harmonization, among many other things.

A strong, wholesale change in spent fuel policy. This will require a bottom-up approach in which the federal government works with states and communities to identify conditions, locations, and timelines for establishing facilities to store Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF). Multiple geologic repository pathways should be explored, including consolidated interim storage. This will build public trust and enable the long-term viability of high-level waste disposal, as seen in other SNF repository programs across the world.

Scale the workforce necessary to support new nuclear deployment. To carry out the administration’s vision for reinvigorating the nuclear workforce, nuclear workforce development programs should be prioritized and coordinated between sufficiently funded and staffed Departments of Labor and Education and state governments. Each new nuclear project is not just a leap toward bolstering domestic carbon-free energy production, but also a powerful economic engine for job creation – employing thousands during construction and providing high-paying, long-term careers in communities nationwide. From reactor operators to cybersecurity specialists, welders to policy analysts, the nuclear workforce is as diverse as it is skilled, offering opportunities for veterans, tradespeople, and graduates alike.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23111852/FusionBlog-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 20:09:47.932756

President Trump signed executive orders last week to boost production of nuclear power, an energy source with a complicated history in the U.S.

After World War II, nuclear was heralded as the future of American energy. Then, the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 marked a turning point and solidified opposition. In the last two decades, a dozen reactors in the U.S. have closed and only three new ones have come online.

But, as William Brangham reports, the site of America's worst nuclear accident may now be the site of its rebirth. It's part of our series Tipping Point.

William Brangham:

They sit quietly now, perched on an island in the middle of the Susquehanna River, four giant cooling towers, two nuclear reactors, and one terrifying chapter in American history.

Robert MacNeil, Former Anchor, ""PBS NewsHour"": Good evening. We're sorry to interrupt your regular programs, but we have been waiting all evening to go to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

William Brangham:

Back in 1979, a combination of mechanical failures and human error caused the radioactive core of one of the site's nuclear reactors to start overheating. For nearly a week, local communities around Harrisburg were on edge, fearing a full meltdown or explosion.

While the worst-case scenarios didn't happen, small amounts of radioactive material were released. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it had negligible effects on health and the environment, but a lasting impact on the nation and the industry.

William Brangham:

Bryan Hanson is chief generation officer for Constellation, the energy company which owns the other reactor on Three Mile Island, known as Unit 1.

We talked in its control room, which still looks very much like it did decades ago. Unit 1 was closed at the time of the accident for refueling. And while Unit 2, where the accident occurred, never reopened, Unit 1 restarted in 1985, a controversial move covered by the ""News Hour.""

Bryan Hanson:

Gas in Pennsylvania is very cheap, so gas plants were being built. We had to make that tough decision to say, we're going to have to shut you down because it's not economical anymore. It was our responsibility to the shareholders to do so.

William Brangham:

But, in the years since, nuclear's fortunes have started to turn around, including the understanding that, given the realities of climate change, nuclear emits no greenhouse gases and, unlike solar and wind, it can produce energy 24/7.

Last September, Constellation announced it would invest over $1.5 billion to restart the Unit 1 reactor. But the real reason Three Mile Island is coming back to life is because Microsoft, the tech company, has pledged to purchase the equivalent of all the energy that Three Mile Island would produce carbon-free for the next 20 years in order to meet the company's climate goals.

William Brangham:

Microsoft says it wants to be carbon-negative by 2030, meaning it would remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it pollutes. That's an even steeper challenge, given that Microsoft is also plowing billions into building new energy-intensive data centers for A.I. and other computing work, hence the deal with Three Mile Island.

So, absent Microsoft's involvement, would we be talking about reopening this place?

William Brangham:

While many of these projects are still years from fruition, it will also take years to get Three Mile Island back online.

So even though this thing looks like it is decades-old, this button, that dial, you can be confident that this is going to work like it was brand-new?

Bryan Hanson:

If you look at the robustness of the design, you look at the material condition, the craftsmanship, there's nothing that prevents these plants from operating for 100 years.

M.V. Ramana, University of British Columbia: I don't think we should think of this as actually dusting off an old plant.

William Brangham:

Physicist M.V. Ramana is a professor at the University of British Columbia and the author of the recent book ""Nuclear Is Not the Solution."" He says there's still no permanent solution for what to do with radioactive waste.

He argues accidents at Three Mile Island, at Chernobyl and at Fukushima prove these plants pose a grave risk, and that spreading the know-how about nuclear energy increases the risk of nuclear weapons spreading.

But, practically, he says nuclear plants take too long and cost too much to build.

M.V. Ramana:

The environmental community is not paying enough attention to the feasibility of using nuclear power. The current estimates of how much it is going to take to restart the plant are underestimates, and this is not new for the nuclear industry. They have always underestimated stuff.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/PoweringUp-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 23:05:19.405582

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation.
Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here.
Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.
That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.” Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state.","After trying and failing to carve out more exceptions to Wyoming’s longstanding ban against storing radioactive nuclear power plant waste earlier this year, lawmakers will take another swing at gaining support for the idea.

They’re particularly focused on clearing the way for Radiant Industries, which proposes manufacturing microreactors and “temporarily” storing their spent, radioactive fuel at a site near the towns of Casper and Bar Nunn.

After Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” went down in flames during this year’s legislative session, lawmakers on the joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee called in experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to answer questions about evolving safeguards and the industry’s track record.

In nearly 40 years of “dry cask” storage in the United States, “we have had zero release of radiation or radioactive material to the environment,” Idaho National Laboratory Used Fuel Management Department Manager Daniel Thomas told lawmakers last week in Casper.

“Similarly, in transportation, we have moved [spent nuclear] fuel for several million miles on rail, on road, by boat, with zero accidents,” Thomas testified.

Those assurances, along with evolving federal safeguards, rang true for Lander resident William Almas, who offered his perspectives to the committee via Zoom.

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation. But that’s not the point, he noted. Such expert testimony won’t be, and it shouldn’t be, enough to convince others in Wyoming.

Health and safety concerns are valid, Almas said, particularly in a state that doesn’t yet host nuclear waste. All the pamphlets, slide decks and expert testimony in the world don’t matter a lick, Almas suggested, unless state leaders initiate a long conversation with residents that, ideally, is moderated by a “third party.”

“A key factor contributing to the lack of success of these projects is the failure of the community to reach consensus on the safety and the value of the projects,” Almas told the panel. “The facts must be clearly presented and discussed by an impartial third party, moving both the proponents and opposition in a forum for discussion.”

Lawmakers on the panel nodded and noted the suggestion. The panel directed the Legislative Service Office to draft another version of SF 186 for further consideration when it meets again in July.

Radioactive hurdles

After decades of public opposition, Wyoming lawmakers tweaked statutes in 2022 to allow for storage of spent nuclear fuel — so long as it is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state.

The move was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer. The “advanced” nuclear reactor will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2030, will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

Wyoming’s legal pathway for TerraPower to store its spent fuel on site is contingent upon the company receiving approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will oversee the plant’s operation and radioactive waste storage.

While SF 186 would have made another exemption to the state’s ban by allowing microreactor manufacturers such as Radiant to store spent fuel, House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have opened the door to commercial operations to potentially take the waste from nuclear power plants from all over the country. Both bills failed this year. Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here. State statute prohibits a commercial high-level radioactive waste facility, whether it’s spent fuel from a power plant from another state or a microreactor built in the state, as Radiant proposes, unless the federal government establishes a permanent repository.

That’s not likely to happen anytime soon, according to federal officials. It will take an act of Congress to resume efforts to establish one at Yucca Mountain, or anywhere else, according to Idaho National Laboratory’s Thomas, who worked for more than a decade on the Yucca Mountain project.

“Yucca Mountain has been defunded and is not being pursued,” Thomas said. If Congress were to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to resume the work, he added, “I would say that we are probably four or more decades off.”

That leaves Wyoming to consider whether to make another exception to its nuclear waste storage ban.

What’s at stake

The Wyoming Energy Authority and Wyoming Business Council are eagerly pursuing companies interested in reinvigorating the state’s uranium mines, hoping to launch a mining-to-reactor industry that becomes an integral piece of domestic energy security.

Having a nearby supply of refined uranium ore would give a leg up to companies like Radiant and BWXT Advanced Technologies that want to build portable microreactors here and deploy them to industrial customers throughout the nation and world, according to the companies. BWXT, with a matching grant from the state, is already building a nuclear reactor component supply chain among existing fabrication shops here. Though BWXT is still exploring whether to set up an actual microreactor manufacturing shop in Wyoming, Radiant proposes a manufacturing facility just outside of Bar Nunn. Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.

“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance,” Radiant Director of Operations Matt Wilson told lawmakers. “But when you look at other countries — Russia, China — they are well ahead of us when it comes to projects not just in the pipeline, but coming on every year. And that’s not just on the advanced reactor side. That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.”

Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state. More public education and engagement are needed, he said, as well as details from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about containment measures should there be an “episode” at a nuclear facility.

“I would recommend that we reach out and ask for testimony so that we can have all sides of a picture before we make decisions on things,” Knapp said.

General Motors has abandoned a plan to pump $300 million into electric-vehicle motor production at its upstate New York plant and will instead invest $888 million to make the latest V-8 engines.

Since the EV announcement two years ago for its Tonawanda plant, electric-vehicle sales have slowed, prompting GM and other carmakers to walk back investment plans for the technology.

The company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant and makes Tonawanda its second propulsion plant to produce the sixth generation of V-8 engines.

The engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs, use new combustion and thermal management innovations to improve performance while reducing emissions, the company said.

The investment includes new machinery, equipment, tools and facility renovations, and builds on GM’s work to boost its manufacturing facilities in recent years, including a half-billion-dollar investment in its Flint engine plant in 2023, the company said.

Nay Sayers Were Right

The nay sayers were right, at least in the US, and for now.

That’s the group I have been in. The US is just not ready for mass EV adoption.

China is another matter.

EV Sales in the US

In the first quarter of 2025, electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for approximately 7.5% of total new vehicle sales in the U.S., according to a report from Kelley Blue Book. This represents a slight increase from the 7% share seen in the same period the previous year.

EV Sales in China

In 2024, approximately 50% of all car sales in China were electric vehicles (EVs), including both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). China’s EV market share is significantly higher than that of the US and Europe. In 2024, China also accounted for nearly two-thirds (65%) of all electric cars sold worldwide.

Long-Term

I expect battery technology to improve, costs to improve, charging times to drop, and eventually there will be more charging stations.

Once infrastructure is in place sales will take off. Just don’t expect EVs to do much of anything for the environment.

One can blame Trump for the short-term but the blame really goes to Biden’s preposterous targets.

The US infrastructure was not ready, charging times too long, EPA rules too preposterous, and charging stations too few.

The house budget bill will roll back tax credits. But if you have to subsidize something, it’s really not affordable.

In due time this will change. Meanwhile, neither Biden nor Trump will allow China’s cheap EVs into the US market, slowing adoption.

The problem: The “sky’s the limit” increases in energy costs for our home. We were fossil fools. Yes, we were getting a Faustian bargain, but at what price tomorrow? Global warming is here and now. Here’s our story.

Energy – the projections, estimated and actual

Average Massachusetts energy bills increased by about 10% in 2025 versus 2024. Projected electricity will cost $209,000 for an average Bedford home spread over 25 years1. That’s enough for a down payment on a home or pay for higher education. Our contractor, Sunergy, projected our 25-year savings to be $78,193 – averaging $3,128 per year savings.

Production?

Sunergy projected 1,013 kWh annual output. Actual for April-December 2024 was 8,100 kWh, or about eight times what Sunergy projected per year.

What happened to the excess?

Most went to consumption – an average of five megawatts annually. Any monthly net balance from long sunny days was banked to the grid and used in leaner times like winter months when solar days are short and consumption is high. In between it’s available to consumers like you. More supply means relatively lower cost – especially in peak demand times.

Even with recharging our all-electric car and electrically powering our heat pump, at an estimated 12MWh annualized electricity production, due to ongoing conservation efforts we are still producing significantly more than we consume. A bonus? Our April 2025 HVAC bill dropped from $113 per month to $30 per month because it is powered by free clean and green electricity. We use Bedford Community Choice 100% green for backup.

What did we do about our energy use pre-conversion?

We checked off these boxes:

Utilized the Mass Save conservation and insulation program

Shifted EV recharging to local stations

Used 100% renewable energy for our electrical power

Installed energy efficient light bulbs

Upgraded our furnace from 85% to 98% efficiency

Ensured annual furnace checkups

Installed smart thermostat technology

Lowered the setting of the water heater thermostat

Financial incentives

Federal funds. “The solar tax credit allows households to deduct 30% of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their federal taxes. This will be available until the end of 2032, at which point it will drop to 26%.” 2, 3

The projections and costs- estimated and actual. Our estimated payback with incentives is 7 years.

Our federal income tax reduced by $13,935 and our state income tax by $1,000.

Pollution abatement: In the last 8 months of 2024 (post solar installation period), not counting carbon emissions, or our additional clean car refueling savings, we have saved 12,600 pounds of carbon by converting to solar panels and a heat pump (July 2024). That is enough carbon to match the weight of three small pickup trucks each year.

Moral imperative. Massachusetts Climate initiatives.

“The Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2025 and 2030 (2025/2030 CECP) provides details on the actions the Commonwealth will undertake through the next decade to ensure the 2025 and 2030 emissions limits are met.” The goals of the initiatives are for a 50% carbon reduction from the 1990 level by 2030 and net zero emissions by 20504. Our climate-friendly actions are consistent with, if not ahead of, Massachusetts targets.

Legacy: Are we making our planet a little healthier every day? Yes!

Is our future to continue our past as fossil fools? No longer!

Gavin Newsom and President Trump over California’s EV mandates. Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta sued Trump after he backed a Senate vote to kill the state’s mandate to ban sales of all new gas or diesel-powered passenger cars and light trucks by 2035.

Zero-emission vehicles include all-electric, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen vehicles. Intermediate goals are 35% ZEV sales by 2026 and 68% by 2035.

But according to the California New Car Dealers Association’s 2025 Auto Outlook Report for Q1, just 20.8% of new cars were ZEVs – a decline from 22% in 2024. To meet that 35% goal next year, ZEV sales would have to increase by 68%.

“Dealers sell what customers want to buy,” said Robb Hernandez, the association’s chairman and president of Camino Real Chevrolet. “No mandate can force consumers to choose otherwise.”

Tesla still held the biggest EV market share at 43.9%, but that was down from 55.5% in Q1 of 2024. The problem: “Californians are giving the cold shoulder” to Tesla “and controversial owner Elon Musk.” Registrations “show a massive decline of 15.1%.”

Part of the decline stems from the anti-Musk protests since his Department of Government Efficiency began cutting government waste. A neighbor drives a Tesla sporting a bumper sticker: “I BOUGHT THIS BEFORE / WE KNEW ELON WAS CRAZY.”

Last November, Newsom proposed extending the state’s expired EV tax credit– except for Tesla. So far, no state extension. But Consumer Reports found as of May 7 car buyers “can still benefit from the federal EV tax credits as well as rebates from local utility providers.”

It’s going to be hard to meet mandates if you attack the top EV company. Meanwhile, Musk has moved on from DOGE. The Wall Street Journal headlined May 27, “Angry Elon is Back. That’s Good for Tesla.”

Another neighbor drives a plug-in BMW. I asked him how he liked it. “Great,” he said. “But my garage has nowhere to plug it in. So I just use gas.”

Let’s turn to politics. Newsom leaves office in 19 months. There’s no reason for the next governor to continue his signature issue. We’re already seeing action in that direction in the campaign for his replacement.

The Los Angeles Times reported May 26, “Villaraigosa, despite climate credentials, pivots toward oil industry in run for governor.” That’s former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. He’s taken $176,000 from the oil industry. And he said of recent oil refinery shutdowns blamed on Newsom’s hostility to the industry, “I’m not fighting for refineries. I’m fighting for the people who pay for gas in this state.”

On March 24 Villaraigosa told NewsNation Now he supports the 100% mandate by 2035. He added the state built 100,000 charging stations the last 10 years, but “needs about 2 million in the next 10 years.” That summarizes the dream – and the reality.

Locally, the nearly 1,300 new car dealers in California will pressure the next governor and the Legislature to postpone the unworkable mandates.

When the violent attacks on Tesla hit in March, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents Tesla’s Fremont factory and its 20,00 workers, posted on X, “There is zero tolerance for acts of vandalism against Tesla.” If new car dealers start going bankrupt from being unable to meet the EV mandate, sending tens of thousands of workers into unemployment lines, an old political quip comes to mind for Democratic politicians, “When they feel the heat, they’ll see the light.”

On May 25 the New York Times reported Democrats are spending $20 million on a new concept, “Speaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.” But what do men want, an EV SUV, or a Ford-350 Super Duty chugging gas at 14 mpg?

(WJBF) – State Senator Harold Jones and local clean energy leaders are speaking out about how those cuts could impact the funding of clean energy programs and what that means for the community.

Programs like the Weatherization Assistance Program and Solar for All help lower utility costs for some Georgia families. They also promote workforce development, home energy savings, and address climate issues. Georgia State Senator Harold Jones is opposed to those cuts. He says they’ll raise costs and cut jobs.

“These are not buzz words about clean energy or weatherization,” said State Senator Harold Jones. “These things actually matter to people. Actually, puts more money in their pockets. Also improves the economy and the environment. All of that is connected to actually having a better society.”

Nicole Lee is a business owner who has seen how weatherization and solar power help low- to moderate-income families save hundreds of dollars in utility costs thanks to these programs.

“Just to see the widespread of ones solar as well as weatherization work in in multiple states and seeing the impact that it helps in LMI communities is astonishing, and so I’m hoping that you know bipartisan funding is able to be passed so that these programs can continue to exist,” said Nicole Lee, Owner of Be Smart Home Solutions.

Paige Brockmeyer is part of the Citizens Climate Lobby in Augusta and wants to encourage people to continue reaching out to state and federal lawmakers and encourage them to vote against cuts to these programs. She says the health of Georgians depends on it.

“The more particulate matter that’s in the air from burning fossil fuels, the more respiratory problems we have. So, that’s kind of at one level, and at another level, you have events like Hurricane Helene,” said Paige Brockmeyer, Volunteer Group Leader, Citizens Climate Lobby Augusta.

Eversource and National Grid have switched between serving the most customers in the state depending on the year.

In 2017, DOER communicated an energy storage procurement target of 200MWh, signed by then-Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Lt Governor Karyn Polito, secretary Matthew Beaton and commissioner Judith Judson.

As explained by the law firm Foley Hoag in a recent company blog post, the current Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey, signed a new, expansive energy legislation in November 2024, which expanded the procurement of energy storage systems to 5,000MW by 31 July 2030.

Of the total 5,000MW, the act designates 3,500MW for mid-duration storage (more than 4 hours and up to 10 hours), 750MW for long-duration storage (more than 10 hours and up to 24 hours), and, if commercially feasible at a reasonable cost, 750MW for multi-day storage (more than 24 hours).

Existing storage systems can take part in the procurement.

The DOER and the EDCs’ joint draft RFP, which is not yet approved, is the first of at least four planned solicitations for securing 5,000MW by 31 July, 2030.

This filing is a staggered procurement schedule, outlined as follows:

1,500MW of mid-duration storage (environmental attributes) by 31 July, 2025 (the subject of this RFP).

1,000MW by 31 July, 2026.

1,000MW by 31 July, 2027.

The remaining capacity (approximately 1,500MW) by 31 July, 2030.

An Independent Evaluator (IE) report of the draft RFP found it likely to attract competition and provide a cost-effective result for ratepayers.

The IE also suggested enhancements for future procurements, such as giving stakeholders more time to provide input, considering the addition of distribution-connected projects and examining regional collaboration with other states to maximise benefits and lower costs.

DOER and the EDC proposed issuing the RFP on 31 July 2025, but that date will depend on the DPU issuing an order.

As of 31 December 2024, Massachusetts’ utilities have made considerable progress in achieving the goals set out by the legislation.

Eversource had approximately 4,546MWh and 1,244MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

National Grid had approximately 8,826MWh and 1,059MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

These both represent over 100% of the previous statewide energy storage target of 1,000MWh to be achieved by 31 December, 2025.

Unitil had approximately 62.2MWh and 20.7MW of energy storage installed or in the pipeline in its service territory.

Unitil’s energy storage projects represent 6.2% of the statewide target.

Massachusetts is a part of the regional transmission organisation ISO New England, which also includes Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Vermont.

Traders said Freeport LNG in Texas might reduce output and they pointed to forecasts for less demand this week than previously expected.

On its last day as the front-month, gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) fell 19.4 cents, or 5.7%, to settle at $3.214 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest close since May 19.

The contract's price was highly volatile, up as much as 3% and down as much as 7% during the session. Traders cited low volumes on expiration day for the June contract. The market only traded about 2,400 front-month contracts on the NYMEX, far below the year-to-date daily average of roughly 165,000.

Futures for July, which will soon be the front-month, were down about 4.6% to $3.57 per mmBtu.

Next-day prices at the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana traded around $3.20 per mmBtu. Low next-day Henry Hub prices have kept pressure on futures in recent weeks with spot contracts trading below front-month futures every day since late April.

Analysts have said that so long as spot prices remain far enough below front-month futures to cover margin and storage costs, traders should be able to lock in arbitrage profits by buying spot gas, storing it and selling a futures contract.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to 105.0 billion cubic feet per day so far in May, down from a monthly record of 105.8 bcfd in April.

On a daily basis, output was on track to drop to a preliminary two-month low of 103.7 bcfd on Wednesday, down from 105.4 bcfd on Tuesday. Analysts have said preliminary data is often revised later in the day.

Energy traders said output reductions this month were primarily due to normal spring maintenance on gas pipes, including U.S. energy firm Kinder Morgan's 2.7-bcfd Permian Highway from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast. Kinder Morgan said it exchanged a turbine at the Big Lake compressor station from May 13-26.

Energy firms usually work on gas pipes when demand is low in the spring and autumn.

LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will slide from 96.1 bcfd this week to 95.7 bcfd next week. The forecast for this week was lower than LSEG's outlook on Tuesday, while its forecast for next week was higher.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big LNG export plants operating in the U.S. fell to 15.1 bcfd so far in May, down from a monthly record of 16.0 bcfd in April.

The LNG feedgas decline this month was mostly due to maintenance at Cameron LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Louisiana, Cheniere Energy's 3.9-bcfd Corpus Christi under construction and in operation in Texas and Cheniere's 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass in Louisiana, and a few brief unplanned reductions at Freeport LNG's 2.1-bcfd plant in Texas, including most recently on May 28.

Looking ahead, energy traders said they expect LNG feedgas to remain below April's record high in June with Cheniere planning about three weeks of maintenance on a couple of liquefaction trains at Sabine around June 2-23.

Conclusion Taken together, the EOs chart an ambitious course to jump-start the U.S. nuclear energy industry.","President Donald Trump signed four separate executive orders (EOs) on May 23, 2025, intended to result in a quadrupling of U.S. nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts (GW) by 2050, all while strengthening domestic fuel cycle infrastructure and achieving deployment of demonstration reactors as soon as next year. Three of the EOs seek to reform the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) while leveraging the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) to streamline the licensing and construction process of new reactors, with a particular focus on advanced reactors. These EOs also seek to aid deployment of U.S.-developed reactor technology abroad. The fourth EO relates to improving fuel cycle infrastructure but largely calls for additional study and reports rather than immediate action. Each of the EOs is discussed further below in detail.

Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

The first of the EOs aimed at speeding reactor deployment orders the NRC to undergo reorganization while also overhauling its regulations with respect to reactor licensing. An underlying purpose of this EO is to direct the NRC to act in accordance with its revised mission statement following the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024 (ADVANCE Act) to not unnecessarily burden energy deployment while still maintaining its safety mission.

Specifically, this EO directs the NRC to work with Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to undertake a reorganization to align with the purpose of focusing NRC resources primarily on new reactor licensing. The order directs the NRC to undertake reductions in force while acknowledging that certain functions, namely new reactor licensing, may increase in size. It also directs the NRC to create a team of at least 20 officials to draft the new regulations discussed further below. The order also directs the NRC to reduce the personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) to the minimum necessary to meet its statutory obligations. The ACRS was created pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) and must review safety studies and facility license applications and advise the NRC on hazards of proposed or existing reactor facilities and the adequacy of proposed reactor safety standards.

Additionally, the EO directs the NRC to undertake several rulemakings that must be proposed within nine months and finalized within 18 months. Each of these rulemakings will be subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and great care must be taken to ensure any resulting rules and licensing reviews conform to applicable statutory requirements.

Most notably, the NRC is directed to establish fixed deadlines for its evaluation and approval of reactor licenses and other reactor licensing activities. This shall include a deadline of no more than 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type and no more than one year for a final decision on an application to continue to operate an existing reactor, with tolling allowed only in the event of an applicant failure. To facilitate quicker timelines, the NRC is directed to streamline its hearing process and revise its National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)-implementing regulations to reflect the 2023 amendments from the Fiscal Responsibility Act and Unleashing American Energy EO. The NRC's NEPA-implementing regulations currently direct NRC staff to ""take account of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality published November 29, 1978"" and have not been updated to reflect the 2023 statutory amendments.

The NRC is also directed to reconsider the reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and instead implement determinate radiation limits. Despite previous acknowledgements by the NRC that the LNT model cannot be validated at low doses, during its last extensive multiyear review of LNT beginning in 2015, the NRC ultimately concluded in August 2021 that there is not yet enough evidence to rescind the LNT's assumptions. This recent review could present a litigation risk to any renewed effort to rescind the theory as the basis of radiological protection regulations.

Other actions directed by the EO include:

establishing fixed caps on hourly fees for NRC reviews

establishing an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that have already been approved by the DOE or DOD, focusing only on new risks not evaluated by those agencies

establishing a process for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors and considering whether certain reactors or components may be built under general licenses

establishing stringent thresholds for when the NRC can demand changes after construction is underway

reducing burdens in the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) and reactor security rules and focusing on credible risks

revising reactor safety assessments to focus on credible, realistic risks

reconsidering the license for which a renewed license remains effective – currently, renewed licenses for commercial reactors typically extend for 20 years but are capped by the AEA at 40 years

Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the DOE

The second EO aims to increase the role of the DOE in deploying new reactor designs while reducing the NRC's role in this process. This order specifically seeks to facilitate construction of ""qualified test reactors,"" defined as advanced reactors that are determined by the DOE to have sufficiently demonstrated from a financial backing and technical development standpoint that they may feasibly be operational within two years from the date of a substantially complete application. The order makes a blanket finding that any such reactors ""over which the Department exercises sufficient control and that do not produce commercial electric power"" are subject to the exemption from NRC licensing contained at 42 U.S.C. § 2140.

The EO establishes requirements for the DOE to facilitate qualified test reactor development both within and outside the national laboratory system. The DOE must take action to ensure its regulations and policies enable deployment of a qualified test reactor within two years of an application.

The order also requires establishment of a pilot program outside of the national laboratories and ""shall"" approve at least three pilot reactors with a goal of achieving criticality in each of the reactors by July 4, 2026.

Lastly, the DOE is directed to streamline its NEPA-implementing regulations and to identify potential categorical exclusions and alternative review procedures as allowed by NEPA.

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security

The third EO seeks to leverage the military's energy needs to deploy new reactor technologies and to facilitate exports of U.S.-developed nuclear technologies abroad. First, the order directs the DOD through the Secretary of the U.S. Army to create a program of record for using nuclear energy to power both military installations and operational needs and deploy a nuclear reactor at a domestic military base or installation by Sept. 30, 2028. The order also directs the DOD to work with the DOE and U.S. Department of State to identify new regulations, legislation and international agreements needed to carry out this program.

Next, the order directs the DOE to take action to designate artificial intelligence (AI) data centers that are located at or operated in coordination with the DOE and related electrical infrastructure as critical defense facilities and to deploy advanced nuclear reactor technologies at one or more DOE sites. The order sets a goal of deploying the first reactor at a DOE site no later than 30 months from the date of the order (November 2027).

The order also directs the DOE to identify uranium and plutonium within its inventories that may be useful for nuclear fuel and to release at least 20 metric tons of high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) for use by the private sector at a DOE-owned or controlled site for the purpose of powering AI infrastructure. In connection with the goal of ensuring long-term supply of HALEU, the order directs the DOE and DOD to site, approve and authorize the design, construction and operation of privately funded nuclear fuel recycling, reprocessing and reactor fuel fabrication technologies at DOE and DOD sites.

With respect to exports of U.S.-developed nuclear technologies, the order directs the State Department to pursue at least 20 new agreements under Section 123 of the AEA and to renegotiate existing agreements set to expire in the next decade in order to facilitate transfer of nuclear technologies abroad by private parties. The order directs all applicable agencies to expeditiously grant required export approvals. The order also includes a number of provisions to finance and otherwise support development of U.S. nuclear technologies abroad, including financing through the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Export-Import Bank.

As with the other EOs, this order directs applicable agencies to leverage categorical exclusions to minimize the impact of NEPA reviews when carrying out the order's goals.

Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base

The final EO seeks to improve domestic fuel cycle infrastructure, including uranium enrichment and conversion, as well as waste recycling and disposal infrastructure. This order further seeks to fund nuclear power plants and develop a robust nuclear workforce. This EO includes a mix of immediate actions and additional studies and reporting on the substantial changes that would need to be made to U.S. nuclear waste statutory and regulatory regimes to achieve the EO's lofty aims.

The primary report directed by this order is a joint report by the DOE, DOD, U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), due within 240 days (Jan. 18, 2026) that covers various subjects around planning for and developing infrastructure to recycle, reprocess and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. This report is intended to set new policy and to identify regulatory and legislative changes needed to affect such policy.

Further, the DOE, NRC and OMB must develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacity to meet projected domestic demand. The DOE must also halt the surplus plutonium dilute and dispose program and establish a program to make surplus plutonium available for use as nuclear fuel. The DOE, in consultation with the DOD, must update the DOE's excess uranium management policy to align with the goals of the order, while factoring in the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapon stockpile. The DOE, in coordination with the U.S. Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission (FTC), must seek to enter voluntary agreements with nuclear energy companies under the Defense Production Act to procure low-enriched uranium and HALEU, including as needed by the U.S. government for national security purposes.

The DOE is also directed to prioritize work, particularly in the Loan Program Office, that will facilitate 5 GW of power uprates to existing reactors and ensure that 10 new large reactors are under construction by 2030. The DOE shall also consult with the DOD about the feasibility of restarting or repurposing closed nuclear plants to support military microgrid applications. The DOE is also directed to prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear reactor technologies.

Lastly, the order directs the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Labor to take various actions to prioritize nuclear education pathways and apprenticeships within existing programs and establish new training programs. The DOE is also directed to increase access to national labs for students studying nuclear engineering and related fields.

Conclusion

Taken together, the EOs chart an ambitious course to jump-start the U.S. nuclear energy industry. The orders focus primarily on rapid deployment of advanced nuclear reactors while also providing support and further study for other parts of the fuel cycle, including uranium conversion and enrichment along with waste reprocessing and recycling. Although the orders note current U.S. reliance on foreign sources of uranium and some of the proposed NRC reforms will benefit all stakeholders in the nuclear fuel cycle, direct support for domestic uranium recovery is notably absent from these orders.

These EOs build on the long-standing bipartisan support for nuclear deployment, including passage of the ADVANCE Act of 2024 and the HALEU Availability Program first authorized in the Energy Act of 2020. Ultimately, the success or failure of the goals of these orders will depend on how the orders are actually implemented. Some of the required actions are already in progress following last year's passage of the ADVANCE Act. Other actions will need to be started from scratch, and the applicable agencies will need to take great care to comply with applicable substantive statutes and the APA. Carefully crafting actions to survive potential litigation may create tension with the aggressive deadlines for action in the orders.

By streamlining permitting, Texas can accelerate the deployment of CCS at these plants, allowing them to continue providing affordable and reliable power while reducing emissions, especially as energy demands grow.
If Texas is granted Class VI primacy, it will unlock billions of dollars in private investment and create thousands of high-paying jobs in engineering, construction, and operations.
If we want to keep the Texas Miracle alive, we must eliminate the unnecessary roadblocks that slow down industrial investment and job creation.
Granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells will send a clear message that our state is open to innovation, ready to lead, and committed to supporting industries that power our economy.","For decades, our state’s economic growth, job creation, and industrial strength has been dubbed the “Texas Miracle.” Texas has remained the best place in America to grow a business by being forward looking, streamlining regulations, and committing to energy leadership.

One of the most immediate economic development priorities for Texas is securing state permitting authority over Class VI wells, a process known as “primacy” which will allow the state of Texas to efficiently permit infrastructure used to inject and store carbon dioxide deep underground. The US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) recently took a meaningful step forward by signing a Memorandum of Agreement outlining the state’s plan for administering its carbon storage programs, but additional milestones still lie ahead, including an opportunity for the public to express their comments.

As consumer demands for low-carbon products grow across the globe, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a safe, proven technology that will allow existing Texas industries to utilize domestic natural gas to introduce new products and adapt to these changing trends.

However, companies investing in these technologies have been stuck in a slow and unpredictable federal permitting process. About one-third of all permits pending at EPA today are from Texas, but staggeringly, only one permit has been approved in the last four years.

Texas has succeeded because we believe in letting Texans solve our state’s challenges. If Texas is granted primacy, it can take control of its own permitting, utilize its own resources to accelerate investment in a responsible manner, and ensure Texas remains a place where manufacturers can advance cutting edge technology. Primacy would allow the RRC to use its expertise to regulate underground injection with the same rigorous safety and environmental standards as the EPA. The RRC understands our state’s unique geology, workforce and industries and can fairly apply stringent safety and environmental protections.

Accelerating carbon capture and storage can also play a key role in strengthening the state’s power grid, which is important to businesses and residents. Natural gas power plants provide at least half of our electricity, ensuring grid stability and providing on-demand electricity. By streamlining permitting, Texas can accelerate the deployment of CCS at these plants, allowing them to continue providing affordable and reliable power while reducing emissions, especially as energy demands grow.

If Texas is granted Class VI primacy, it will unlock billions of dollars in private investment and create thousands of high-paying jobs in engineering, construction, and operations. These projects won’t just benefit the energy sector — they will strengthen the entire industrial supply chain. From equipment suppliers to logistics companies, the ripple effects of CCS investments will support businesses across Texas.

Every month that goes by means delayed investments, lost jobs, and a weaker industrial base. That’s why we were proud to have recently joined 32 other leading community organizations across the state in urging the EPA to approve Texas’ application for Class VI well primacy without further delay. West Virginia, Wyoming, North Dakota, and even Louisiana have successfully received primacy and there is no reason for Texas to continue waiting, especially when we have the experienced staff and resources to do the job efficiently and responsibly.

If we want to keep the Texas Miracle alive, we must eliminate the unnecessary roadblocks that slow down industrial investment and job creation. Granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells will send a clear message that our state is open to innovation, ready to lead, and committed to supporting industries that power our economy.",https://fortworthinc.com/downloads/7786/download/Oil%20Adobe%20Stock.jpeg?cb=3d65ac56af0f985bce2f823de3906c98&w=1200,N,,2025-05-28 21:01:56.615295

Trump just ordered ...,Graig Graziosi,,,,,https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-coal-plant-michigan-executive-order-b2759528.html,"President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan slated to close at the end of the month open through the end of summer.
A Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that it plans to ""comply with the Department of Energy order.""
The executive order falls in line with Trump's previously stated support of coal burning as a primary energy source for the U.S. power grid.
In April, he signed another executive order ramping up U.S. coal production.
“I call it beautiful, clean coal,” Trump said at the time.","President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan slated to close at the end of the month open through the end of summer.

The J.H. Campbell Plant in West Olive, Michigan was scheduled to close on May 31, but will now remain open after the Trump administration's Department of Energy warned of a heightened risk of blackouts during the summer.

The DOE warning stressed the need for caution with ""critical grid security issues"" in the Midwest, particularly in advance of the ""high electricity demand expected this summer.""

As annual temperatures continue to climb due to human driven climate change via the burning of fossil fuels, energy demands to power air conditioning and refrigeration have also increased.

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release on Friday.

He said the Trump administration would not ""sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families.""

The DOE's warning comes in response to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation that found the part of the country serviced by Midcontinent Independent System Operator — an electric grid operator for the central U.S. — is at an ""elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.""

That report specifically points to the scheduled closing of some power plants as a major contributing factor to the potential energy shortfalls and increased risk of power loss, The Hill reports.

While Wright insists that keeping the plant open will help keep energy prices from rising for Americans, Dan Scripps, the chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, argued that the executive order was ""unnecessary"" and would ""increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.""

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Scripps said in a statement.

He said that the MSPC will continue to ""work with MISO and Consumers Energy to assess the impacts of the DOE's order and work to limit unnecessary cost increases imposed as a result of this order.""

A Consumers Energy spokesperson said in a statement that it plans to ""comply with the Department of Energy order.""

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO. The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” the spokesperson told The Hill.

The executive order falls in line with Trump's previously stated support of coal burning as a primary energy source for the U.S. power grid. In April, he signed another executive order ramping up U.S. coal production.

“I call it beautiful, clean coal,” Trump said at the time. “We’re ending Joe Biden’s war on beautiful, clean coal, once and for all.”

His insistence on using coal has drawn the ire of climate change experts and environmentalists who warn that coal power will only harm Americans in the long run.

Gina McCarthy, a former head of the Environmental Protection Administration, previously told The Independent that ""there is no such thing as clean coal.

“Just as Trump’s tariffs are hitting Americans’ wallets, his administration is wasting taxpayer dollars to prop up an expensive, dangerous, and dirty industry when we have abundant, cheaper, better, and safer clean energy,"" she said.

Environmental experts have also called the Trump administration’s plan to remove the caps on greenhouse gas emissions at power plants “deeply concerning.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is drafting a plan to end all limits on greenhouse gases emitted by coal and gas-fired power plants, The New York Times reported this week.

The agency argues that the greenhouse gases emitted by these plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” according to a draft plan reviewed by the newspaper.

However, fossil fuels are the “single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the U.S.,” according to Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund. The United States is one of the world’s top greenhouse gas producers —second only to China.

The new rule is “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law,” Patton said.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/27/20/Coal_Plant_Michigan_19600.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-05-28 18:13:41.801442

The projects include 440 MW of solar and 106 MW of battery storage at the retired coal-fired Edwards power plant in Bartonsville and 287 MW of storage at the retired coal-fired Joppa power plant in Joppa, according to filings Vistra made at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The projects have been in development since at least 2022.

“The petitioners have been diligently pursuing the development of these resources, which can make an important contribution towards meeting resource adequacy needs in Illinois and the [Midcontinent Independent System Operator] region,” Vistra said in its requests at FERC.

However, supply chain constraints, growing demand for electrical equipment spurred by Inflation Reduction Act incentives and rapid load growth have significantly increased the time it takes to get critical equipment, according to Vistra.

“These supply chain constraints have been compounded by uncertainty and disruption arising from recent increases in import duties and continued uncertainty regarding the future trajectory of U.S. trade policy,” the Irving, Texas-based company said.

Vistra has signed contracts reserving capacity with an equipment supplier for needed transformers, but the supplier expects it cannot deliver them until the fourth quarter of 2029, according to the filings.

Also, Vistra’s suppliers expect it will take three years to deliver breakers for the projects rather than the 12 to 18 months that typically have been required to obtain the equipment, the company said.

Vistra has interconnection agreements that set an Aug. 31, 2028, commercial operation deadline for the Joppa battery project and a Dec. 31, 2028, deadline for the Edwards project. The company asked FERC to extend the deadlines by two years.

What Went Wrong?

Dodge had boldly stepped into uncharted waters with their concept. The Daytona SRT wasn’t just another electric car—it was supposed to be the new face of American muscle. It carried retro styling cues, was set to feature an 800-volt Banshee powertrain, and even had simulated gear shifts to mimic the feel of a traditional performance vehicle. To put it plainly, they were trying to make an EV that could scratch the same itch as a V8. That’s no small task.

But then reality hit. Despite the buzz, production delays, mounting costs, and shifting consumer interests started to weigh the whole thing down. Meanwhile, traditional ICE models like the Charger and Challenger were continuing to move units right up until their final days. Enthusiasts weren’t quite ready to say goodbye to combustion—especially when electrics came with a higher price tag and questionable sound effects.

The Pivot Back to Combustion

Instead of going all-in on the battery-powered muscle machine, Stellantis has pivoted. Reports indicate that while the Charger nameplate will live on, it’ll likely debut with internal combustion engine options first—possibly powered by the all-new Hurricane inline-six—and plug-in hybrid variants down the road. The full-electric version is no longer front and center. It’s not completely dead, but it’s been pushed to the back burner for now.

Was the EV Charger Too Much, Too Soon?

This about-face raises a lot of questions. Was the EV Charger simply too ahead of its time? Did they underestimate the loyalty to the V8? Or was the idea of a synthesized exhaust and fake gear shifts just a bit too much to stomach for the average muscle car fan?

For PowerNation viewers and muscle car diehards, the move comes with mixed emotions. On one hand, it’s a win for those who aren’t ready to trade the rumble of a big American engine for the whine of an electric motor. On the other, it represents a sort of identity crisis for the brand that once prided itself on being loud, bold, and unapologetically old-school.

Performance Isn’t Going Anywhere

It’s clear Dodge still wants to evolve. Their messaging has been about “eMuscle” and the future of performance, but it seems that future will now be reached with a more gradual shift—one that includes hybrids and high-output six-cylinders before full EVs take over.

What This Means for the Industry

What does this mean for the broader performance world? If Stellantis—the company that owns Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Chrysler—is scaling back its EV ambitions, it might be a sign of a larger trend. EVs are still coming, but the road may be longer and bumpier than expected. Consumers want performance, but they also want sound, feel, and heritage. And right now, battery-powered cars aren’t checking all those boxes.

The V8 Lives to Fight Another Day

So while the electric Charger isn’t entirely gone, it’s taking a back seat for now. And that means there’s still time to enjoy the roar of combustion, build that dream HEMI project, and hold onto the golden age of muscle—at least for a little while longer.

For those of us who still get goosebumps from a cold start or a third-gear pull, that’s not bad news at all.",,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:25.539427

Lately on the Hill

Tax Bill Passes the House

The reconciliation package continues its trip through the congressional process. After officially squeaking by the House on May 22 with a 215 to 214 vote, it now faces its next hurdle—the Senate. After an all-nighter debating specifics of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act , (the “Bill”, or the “House bill”), there were arguably three topics that tipped the scales for passage: the state and local tax (SALT) cap, clean energy credits, and Medicaid.

The SALT Caucus and House Freedom Caucus both presented obstacles to getting the bill through, both of which were largely appeased with adjustments included in the Manager’s Amendment issued late in the evening of May 21. In the passed version of the Bill, the SALT cap was raised to $40,000 beginning in 2025, but this amount phases out (to $10,000) for those with income of $500,000 or more. Further, the cap and the phase-out threshold increase 1% annually from 2026 until 2033 and then become permanent at 2033 levels.

Previously, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) was quoted late in 2024 that clean energy credit changes would be made “with a ‘scalpel not a sledgehammer.’” However, what came out of the House for certain investment and production credits were major changes for the clean energy industry. The most commonly claimed credits—Sections 45Y and 48E—now end after December 31, 2028. What’s possibly most significant, however, is that projects must begin construction no later than 60 days after the Bill’s enactment. Beginning construction is, however, often out of the hands of clean energy developers and investors who depend on things like permits and utilities to get their projects started. This means that projects that were planned and funded years ago may now be scrapped.

The Top Ten: What’s in the Bill?

While far-reaching in scope, the tax provisions in the Bill affect businesses, individuals, tax-exempt entities, and clean energy investors alike. Here are some highlights of what could be seen as 10 of the Bill’s most high-impact proposals:

1) The “Big Three”

Three separate topics were rolled into one adage: 100% bonus depreciation, allowing immediate expensing (rather than capitalization) of domestic research and development expenses, and reverting the §163(j) calculation to using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). In the Bill, 100% bonus would be implemented for property acquired after January 19, 2025 and placed in service before January 1, 2030, and research and experimentation (R&E) expensing would also be temporary through 2029 but allowed only for domestic R&E incurred after December 31, 2025 and before December 31, 2029. The §163(j) change will likewise be in effect through 2029.

2) Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction Permanence & Increase

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) implemented the §199A deduction to benefit pass-through entities (PTEs) and their owners in the wake of a decreased corporate rate. The Bill proposes not only to make the QBI deduction permanent, but also to increase the deduction from 20% to 23%. The Bill also modifies phase-in limitations and other computational items, while indexing certain amounts for inflation.

3) Pass-Through Entity Taxes

With the TCJA’s introduction of the SALT cap (the limitation of how much an individual can deduct for state taxes they paid), many states implemented PTE “workarounds.” This allowed partnerships and S corporations to pay state income taxes on behalf of their owners and ultimately circumvent the SALT cap’s deduction limitation. The House bill does not fully disallow this dynamic for all entities, but it does for non-specified service trades or businesses. These entities are service businesses like accounting firms, law firms, or doctor’s offices.

4) Manufacturing Business Topics

100% Depreciation for Nonresidential Real Property Used in Manufacturing

Bonus depreciation is currently only available for assets with lives of 20 years or less. Practically speaking, this carves out real property, aka buildings, and qualifies things like equipment or furniture and fixtures. The House bill would flip the script for those in the business of manufacturing, producing, or refining products (tangible personal property), allowing them to immediately expense not only their equipment but now also their buildings. Much of the administration’s rhetoric (especially with tariffs) has focused on onshoring or growing American manufacturing. This largely aligns with that school of thought—immediate expensing for one of a business’s largest assets could be an incentive to set up shop in the United States.

Gross Receipts Threshold for Small Manufacturing Businesses

Currently, businesses of any type are considered to be “small businesses” if their gross receipts are below $25 million. The Bill would increase this $25 million threshold to $80 million for those considered to be “manufacturing taxpayers”—those businesses that derive substantially all of their gross receipts from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualified tangible personal property produced or manufactured by the business. The impact of this designation could be huge—it permits the entity to be cash basis, exempt from uniform capitalization rules (UNICAP), exempt from §471 inventory accounting rules, and possibly most importantly not subject to §163(j) interest limitation.

5) Excess Business Loss (EBL) Limitation on Noncorporate Taxpayers

Currently, if a business’s deductions exceed its income (plus a threshold amount), individual business owners can’t fully take the resulting loss on their tax returns. Instead, the disallowed amount is converted to a net operating loss (NOL) carryover to future years without further limitation. The House bill would make this limitation permanent and implement a new cumulative limitation for losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.

6) No Tax on Tips, Overtime, & Social Security

Although three separate provisions are in the bill, they have been largely discussed in one breath since their introduction by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. The Bill provides deductions for “qualified tips” for those working in specific occupations, and for “qualified overtime” (excluding highly compensated employees) through December 31, 2028. The Byrd rule in the Senate reconciliation process restricts any bill from affecting Social Security directly. Thus, to accomplish “no tax on Social Security,” the House bill has proposed a new $4,000 deduction for individuals age 65 or over (with phaseouts starting for those with $150,000 adjusted gross income if married filing jointly (MFJ)). This deduction is also temporary through 2028.

7) Clean Energy Credit Changes

As noted previously, Republican House members were looking for ways to fund the various proposals in the Bill. One of their largest “pay-fors” ended up being clean energy credits. While many credits were simply repealed, others had their expiration dates adjusted, the option for transferring (or “selling”) the credit repealed, and/or had provisions that would exclude the involvement of certain specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities. Most of the credits on the chopping block were related to electric vehicles (and their chargers) or residential tax credits.

8) TCJA Individual Impacts

Most of the TCJA provisions being extended or made permanent by the House bill relate to individual taxpayers. Some notable items include:

Permanence of modification of individual, estate, and trust rates

TCJA-increased standard deduction would be made permanent, with a temporary increase of $2,000 MFJ (differing amounts for other filing statuses) through 2028

Personal exemptions permanently disallowed

Miscellaneous itemized deductions permanently disallowed

TCJA-increased alternative minimum tax (AMT) permanent

9) Tax-Exempt Entity Applicability

In addition to clean energy and other initiatives, the adjustments applicable to tax-exempt entities are considered revenue raisers that help the House meet the scoring parameters set by the budget resolution. The 21% excise tax on excess compensation now applies to any employee. Further, the maximum excise tax rate has increased on both net investment income of private foundations and on certain private colleges.

10) International Tax

For tax years 2026 onwards, the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) rates were increased to 10.878% and 13.335% respectively. Further, the House bill increases the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) rate to 10.1% but maintains the current method for utilizing credits in the calculation.

What’s Next?

The difficult question to answer is what approach the Senate will take. Will it largely adopt the House-passed version, or craft its own approach and pressure the House into accepting it? There are already some indicators of variations between House and Senate opinions. Last week, the Senate passed a separate bill on the “No Tax on Tips” issue, which makes the deduction permanent (instead of temporary per the House bill).

In Other News ...

Tariffs continue to make headlines as Trump threatens a 25% tariff on certain smartphones if they are not manufactured in the United States. Currently, smartphones are on the listing of exemptions from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs announced earlier this year. In addition, although Trump was previously in negotiations with the European Union, he stated that he is “recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” Over the weekend, however, he extended the deadline for that tariff to July 9, 2025 to allow for further negotiations.

Millions of American families are struggling to afford their energy bills. This situation could worsen as electricity prices — particularly in the Northeast — face potential hikes due to reciprocal tariffs from Canada. As energy prices fluctuate, and federal assistance programs face potential cuts, cities, states and utilities must take proactive steps to ensure that their most vulnerable residents can keep their lights on and homes heated and cooled.

Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, in his introductory remarks after swearing in, shared a troubling statistic: one in 10 Americans had received a utility disconnection notice in the past year. In his new role, one of his goals would be to “shrink that number to zero” by making energy more abundant and affordable. By flooding the market with fossil fuels again, the price of electricity and gas would decrease. However, the primary federal program to tackle energy affordability — the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — does not fall under Secretary Wright’s purview.

LIHEAP is funded through the Department of Health and Human Services, and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly terminated the entire staff running the $4 billion LIHEAP program. In 2023, more than 7 million Americans received assistance through LIHEAP. Despite its importance, LIHEAP reaches only 17% of eligible households, leaving a gaping hole in the energy safety net. Without it, those relying on it to meet energy needs will be at grave risk. Some have called for the modernization of LIHEAP, but these days the imperative must be to simply preserve it. Ongoing cuts to the program would likely push millions of Americans to experience the ill health effects and fatal consequences of energy insecurity.

Historically, states have relied on LIHEAP as the primary source of energy bill assistance. However, with rising demand and uncertainty about its future, local and state governments, along with utilities, must take greater action to tackle the growing energy affordability crisis.

State-level solutions

States have at least three avenues they can exploit to improve energy affordability. First, states can supplement energy assistance through their own budgets. State supplementation is generally low, but some states are actively working to make the energy safety net more robust. For example, Washington launched the State Home Energy Assistance Program using $35 million through Climate Commitment Act funding. By increasing the income limit, the program expanded eligibility to more than 1.2 million people, compared to 500,000 who would’ve been eligible under federal LIHEAP criteria alone. Another example is New York’s Energy Affordability Program, which supplements LIHEAP with additional bill discounts.

Second, state leadership can encourage respective public utility commissions to enhance rate designs that protect low- and moderate-income rate payers. This includes enacting or improving lifeline tariffs, percent of income payment plans, separate tariffs for low-income rate-payers and other energy affordability schemes. Third, state agencies related to housing, health and special populations can strengthen cross-program linkages to make it easier for households to access complementary social assistance programs. This would require harmonizing beneficiary databases and coordinating constituent engagement efforts to increase enrollment.

City-level initiatives

Cities can update their building codes and local laws to require landlords to invest in energy efficiency retrofits and provide adequate heating and cooling during periods of extreme weather. For instance, New York City’s Local Law 97 mandates that all large buildings, including affordable housing buildings, reduce their emissions by implementing prescriptive energy conservation measures. Another bill under discussion in the New York City council would require landlords to equip rental units with cooling devices. Though affordability challenges might limit use, such provisions can reduce energy burdens and protect the health of tenants, especially the elderly and medically vulnerable.

Finally, cities can also bring affordable and clean energy online faster by deploying distributed energy resources such as community solar and virtual power plants that get around long permitting delays, which plague grid-scale energy projects. These investments translate into direct savings via bill credits, while also ensuring that local residents benefit from clean energy infrastructure.

Utility strategies

Utilities can expand their customer engagement programs to proactively enroll and sustain eligible households in energy assistance programs. For example, Xcel Energy operates a fleet of RED trucks in Colorado that drive into communities and help customers access various assistance services. Further, utilities can track and prevent utility disconnections for customers with documented health risks, including homes with elderly members and those dependent on medical devices. Some utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power have eliminated utility disconnections for all customers during extreme weather events.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VLTk4srYzE6sAT7-qK4zn6JP0nHNvUSXwaBiB94tEqI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMjc3M19PcFZhczFyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-28 19:07:15.468322

With Electricity Bills Rising in June, NJ and PA Elected Officials, Consumer and Clean Energy Advocates Convene Outside Electric Grid Operator PJM Headquarters

Demand That PJM Act to Hold Down Electricity Costs and

Improve Energy Reliability by Clearing Long Backlog of Power Projects Awaiting Approval

NORISSTOWN, PA: With families and small businesses across the region about to be hit with increases in electric bills of as much as $30 more per month starting in June, consumer and clean energy advocates from Pennsylvania and New Jersey braved the rain and chill to gather outside the headquarters of electric grid manager PJM Interconnection to urge PJM leadership to do more to protect family budgets and bring more clean, affordable energy to the electric grid as quickly as possible.

PJM, headquartered outside Philadelphia, is the company that manages the regional electric grid for 65 million people across all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia.

June’s electric bill increases are expected to be only the beginning if PJM does not reform its practices to keep up with rising demand for electricity from large data centers coming online in the coming years. Speakers urged lawmakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and other PJM states to continue to put pressure on PJM to reform its decision-making and practices, including clearing the nearly 3,000 backlogged energy projects, most of them renewable energy projects, that are waiting for approval to connect to the electrical grid.

“Let’s be clear, our region’s upcoming electricity rate hikes are not due to MAGA’s manufactured ‘clean energy mandate’ - there is no such thing. These rate hikes are because of the greed of PJM Interconnection and some of its corporate members, and their failure to connect cheaper, cleaner energy that would provide much needed relief to ratepayers. Clean energy is cheaper, period. If PJM connected more clean energy to our grid and reform its process, the average New Jersey home would save $400 annually,”said Anjuli Ramos-Busot, Director of the NJ Sierra Club.

“PJM is relying on outdated, inefficient, expensive, and dirty energy sources to inflate prices and gouge customers to maximize profit,” continued Ramos-Busot. “Today, we are here outside of their headquarters calling on PJM to institute massive queue reform to move clean projects forward, not hand out fast passes to the fossil fuel industry that skyrocket prices for ratepayers.”

""We have an urgent responsibility to greatly increase the renewable energy sources in our grid, both to care for creation and to care for each other,” said Rev. Nathaniel Mahlberg of the United Church of Christ in Valley Forge and POWER Interfaith. “PJM has the power and the means to do so, but its skewed priorities are doing harm to ratepayers and the environment.""

“PJM’s dysfunction means low-income folks pay more for dirty energy,” added Patrick Houston, Campaign Manager, HERE 4 Climate Justice. “That’s not fair. But it is avoidable. PJM needs to get serious about approving clean energy projects that create jobs and cut pollution. Until then, PJMs delay on renewables—and their default to fossil gas—may force more low-income folks in Philly, and beyond, to have to choose between keeping the lights on or the fridge full.”

Renewable energy like solar and wind is now cheaper than other energy sources. Combined with energy storage, it can deliver power more reliably than ever. But currently, less than 5% of the PJM region’s electricity is powered by cheaper, home-grown renewable energy sources.

Advocates were joined by PA State Representative Chris Rabb (D-Phila.), who has introduced legislation (HB 782) to end secret voting on regional energy policies by members of PJM by requiring electric utilities to disclose their recorded votes and explain how their vote was in the public interest. “Decisions by PJM and its members directly impact people’s electricity bill and our commonwealth’s transition to affordable clean energy,” said Rabb. “Allowing these secret votes with no accountability is akin to the fox guarding the hen house. The people have a right to know about the decisions that are being made behind closed doors – especially as those decisions impact our policies and people’s paychecks.”

Speakers highlighted steps by PA Governor Josh Shapiro, NJ Governor Phil Murphy, and some other elected officials in the PJM region who similarly are pressuring PJM to institute reforms to protect consumers, hold down electricity costs, and strengthen grid reliability. They urged more elected leaders across PJM states to join those efforts to prevent future price hikes down the road while ensuring a reliable, sustainable electric grid.

(Reuters) -Cenovus Energy said on Wednesday it was scaling back non-essential workers at its Foster Creek facility in response to wildfires in northern Alberta.

Wildfires in the Canadian province of Alberta have prompted a temporary shutdown of some oil and gas production and forced residents of at least one small town to evacuate.

Cenovus' Foster Creek operation is among a number of oil sands facilities operated by companies with assets in the Bonnyville-Cold Lake region.

That region was affected on Wednesday by several wildfires spanning 2,900 hectares (11.2 square miles) near Chipewyan Lake, a small community in the northern part of the province approximately 130 km (81 miles) west of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray.

Cenovus added that it was closely monitoring the evolving wildfire situation in the region and the staffing measure was a precaution.

Alberta government officials said on Wednesday afternoon there was no threat at this time to the community of Chipewyan Lake, but residents have been placed on a one-hour evacuation notice as winds could shift.

Another blaze, nearly 1,600 hectares in size, is burning out of control about 7 km north of Swan Hills in the province's northern region.

The approximately 1,200 residents of the town of Swan Hills were ordered to evacuate on Monday evening. One oil-and-gas producer in that area, Aspenleaf Energy, said on Monday it had temporarily halted operations as a precaution and shut in approximately 4,000 barrels-of-oil equivalent per day of production.

The Canadian province of Manitoba declared a separate state of emergency Wednesday afternoon due to multiple wildfires threatening many communities and infrastructure. Evacuations and alerts were in effect for multiple communities in northern and eastern parts of that province as of Wednesday.

Company will invest $31.5 million and create 90 new jobs in Greater Peoria region

WASHINGTON, DC- Governor JB Pritzker, Damera Corporation and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) announced the company will open its first U.S. assembly plant in the Greater Peoria region. Damera Corporation (Damera Bus USA LLC in the U.S.) plans to make a capital investment of more than $31.5 million over four years with support from a Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) agreement, which will enable the company to expand into Illinois and create 90 new full-time jobs. The announcement was made with Governor Pritzker and Damera leadership in Washington DC as part of a larger business development trip.

“Over the past six years, Illinois has pushed to solidify our status as a hub of the EV future – and put our shoulder to the wheel to get that vision off the ground and on the road,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “With this investment of more than $31.5 million–supported by state incentives–Damera will expand into our state and create 90 new full-time jobs. Through our competitive incentive programs, workforce development, and other business attraction efforts, the state is bringing in companies like Damera that not only create jobs and opportunity for our people, but commit themselves to our communities.”

“Today marks a milestone for Peoria and Illinois,” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “Investments like this from the Damera Corporation are a testament to the kind of economy we are building here in Illinois; one that provides opportunity to all corners of our state and builds towards a sustainable future.”

Damera Corporation, a Canadian transit solutions provider, is the exclusive North American distributor of the Karsan eJEST, a zero-emission minibus (ZEB) with a capacity of 19 passengers and a range of 130 miles. Damera Bus USA LLC has leased a facility in the greater Peoria region to sell and service the eJEST and to establish their first U.S. electric transit bus assembly plant to deploy additional models. The facility will include assembly lines, testing zones, quality control, storage, and administrative offices as well as specialized areas for battery assembly, charging infrastructure, and sustainability initiatives.

With top infrastructure, a growing EV ecosystem, access to global supply chains and an abundant, qualified workforce, Illinois continues to grow and attract companies in the clean energy space. In recent years, Illinois has topped key economic development rankings, including Site Selection Magazine, which has ranked Illinois second in the U.S. for corporate expansions and relocations for three years running, and CNBC’s Top States for Business where Illinois ranks in the top ten for infrastructure, education, access to capital, cost of living, and tech and innovation.

“As we continue to expand Damera Bus USA LLC’s presence in the United States, our commitment to fostering long-term growth and job creation in the Peoria area remains unwavering. This investment not only strengthens the local economy but also creates hundreds of new opportunities for the community. We are proud to contribute to a vibrant workforce and are deeply committed to supporting the economic prosperity of the region,” said Roger D’Hollander, Chief Operating Officer of Damera. “This investment aligns directly with the BAA waiver application we have put forward that will facilitate our expansion in the US and help reinforce our long-term vision for the future. We would also like to thank Congressman LaHood and his office for their support of this effort and for playing a crucial role in ensuring its success. We are excited about the positive impact this partnership will have on the local economy, the creation of sustainable jobs, and the continued growth of Peoria County and the state of Illinois.”

The company met Team Illinois at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in 2024, which is an annual event that offers state and local economic development teams the opportunity to network directly with international companies considering expanding or relocating to the U.S.

“Illinois continues to attract global leaders in clean energy and advanced manufacturing thanks to our skilled workforce, strong infrastructure, and bold vision for a sustainable future,” said DCEO Director Kristin Richards. “Damera’s decision to establish their first U.S. assembly plant in Peoria is a testament our strategic investments through REV Illinois, and it marks another step toward cultivating a greener economy for all Illinoisans.”

“Damera's decision to be in Illinois for its first U.S. assembly base is a reflection of our state's strong electric vehicle sector. Intersect exists to ensure companies like Damera can find a home in our welcoming state,” said Intersect Illinois President and CEO Christy George. “Illinois is committed to remaining a leader in clean energy, so we welcome the role international innovators like Damera play in providing sustainable solutions and expanding economic opportunities for Illinoisians.”

“The Damera team have been great partners in this process from the very beginning,"" said Chris Setti, CEO of the Greater Peoria Region Economic Development Corporation. ""We are happy that they chose the Greater Peoria region to be their first location in our country, and we look forward to helping them grow in the community and be another successful business calling the Greater Peoria region home.""

Governor Pritzker has committed to a state goal of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030 and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Damera Corporation’s decision to expand into Illinois builds upon the numerous clean energy companies that have recently chosen to establish or expand their business in the state including Rivian, Avina Clean Hydrogen, and Wieland North America.

Guided by Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, the REV Illinois program supports a targeted industry for the state - clean energy production and manufacturing - which continues to grow with assistance from Illinois' leadership and their support of innovative technologies that reduce costs and emissions.

Last month, E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders, documented a major increase in clean energy plant closings since the Trump administration took office with draconian plans to restrict clean energy projects.
“The situation is that the clean energy business now has the clarity of a snowstorm in midnight,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe told Money Trail.
To be eligible for tax credits, clean energy programs would have to break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and deliver energy to the grid by the end of 2028.
If you follow the money in the clean energy business you will follow it to another country.","Conservative firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene is not one to promote clean energy in Congress, but when Qcells set up a solar manufacturing plant in her rural Georgia district in 2019, she became a fan. “I think they’re fantastic,” she told Politico’s E&E News when the plant announced expansion plans in her district town of Dalton two years ago. “I support all kinds of energy.”

South Korean-owned Qcells is not a household name in the United States, but it is a force in the burgeoning international solar market. Its Dalton facility is now the largest solar plant in the Western Hemisphere after the company invested $2 billion in it and another Georgia plant, which together support 3,800 jobs.

But with the Trump administration now in office, times have changed. The U.S. clean energy boom and the jobs it has created are suddenly threatened.

You would think that Rep. Greene would fight to keep the Qcells plant open when the House passed its massive $3.8-trillion domestic policy bill last week, which would not only cut Medicaid and food stamps, but also eliminate many of the Biden administration’s clean energy funding and tax credits.

You would be wrong.

Deficit-busting tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy are apparently more important than protecting manufacturing jobs in her district. “I just want to pass the big beautiful bill, Trump’s [executive orders], and DOGE rescission cuts and win, win, win!!” she posted on X just before the House narrowly approved its tax and spending bill by one vote.

An Uncertain Future

It’s unclear how much the House bill will impact the clean energy sector, but virtually everyone agrees it won’t be good. First, the Senate needs to weigh in and pass a bill of its own, and there are early indications Senate Republicans will not support axing job-producing clean energy programs in their home states. A group of them sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) last week voicing concerns about gutting clean energy tax credits, which many experts say is the key to competing in the growing international clean energy jobs market.

“We caution against the full-sale repeal of current credits,” the senators wrote, “which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

But energy experts say the damage is already done, and they fear more disruptions are on the horizon. Last month, E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders, documented a major increase in clean energy plant closings since the Trump administration took office with draconian plans to restrict clean energy projects. The ensuing chaos resulted in the cancellation of $8 billion in investments and 16 major clean energy projects across the country.

E2 attributes most of the investment cutbacks to the dramatic rise in business uncertainty injected into international markets after the Trump administration’s record increase in tariffs, which seem to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis. This uncertainty makes it nearly impossible for companies to plan for the future.

“The situation is that the clean energy business now has the clarity of a snowstorm in midnight,” E2 Executive Director Bob Keefe told Money Trail. “Europe is doubling down on clean energy while we’re pulling back…. Instead, we’re cleaning up oil spills.”

What is even more distressing for clean energy advocates is the growing rate of wind and solar project cancellations. In February and March of this year, 13 projects and more than $5 billion in investments were cancelled or downsized, E2 reported, including a cancellation of a $200-million Bosch hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina and $2.6-billion Freyr Battery plant in Georgia.

Adding to the debacle, the massive House tax and spending bill will add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit and eviscerate the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), clean energy advocates say, eliminating tax credits for renewable projects but maintaining them for nuclear plants. To be eligible for tax credits, clean energy programs would have to break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and deliver energy to the grid by the end of 2028. In addition, federal tax credits for popular consumer clean energy technologies, including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles would be terminated by the end of this year.

Losing Jobs and Money

According to the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, repealing the IRA would:

· Increase cumulative household energy costs by $32 billion over the next decade.

· Cost nearly 790,000 jobs in 2030 and more than 700,000 jobs in 2035.

· Decrease gross domestic product by more than $160 billion in 2030 and nearly $190 billion in 2035.

· Increase climate pollution more than 530 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035, the equivalent of adding 116 million cars to the road.

A handful of states would be hit especially hard by a combination of high energy costs and job losses. “Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Georgia stand out as the biggest losers from IRA repeal,” Energy Innovation says, “due to their poor combination of lost jobs and increased household energy costs.”

E2 Executive Director Keefe said one of the most frustrating aspects of the Republican attack on the U.S. clean energy industry is that much of the technology was invented here in the United States.

“American science created the photovoltaic and lithium ion battery, but we’re not investing in it,” Keefe told Money Trail. “Instead, we’re cutting Department of Energy research to the bone and ostracizing scientists…. If you follow the money in the clean energy business you will follow it to another country. Business investment will go elsewhere, not to places like Texas, Tennessee and Kentucky.”

Despite this dire situation, Keefe said he’s still upbeat about the future of his business. There’s still plenty of demand, he said, as the price of wind and solar energy continues to fall.

“The clean energy industry still has momentum,” he said. “No doubt we’ve hit a serious speed bump. But in two to four years, we’ll get back on track.”

Climate scientists and business leaders say the clean energy industry needs more support and investment—not less—if the United States is going to compete in the international marketplace. There is no other path forward to prosper in a sustainable world.

American Clean Power Association (ACP) chief executive officer Jason Grumet points out that the budget plan is at odds with President Trump’s goal of American energy dominance.
“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” Grumet cautioned.
Terminating Section 6418 transferability would have an immediate effect on the tax credit marketplace by putting a tight window on buying these tax credits, Ryan’s Boccaccio noted.
“The House bill contains several complex and potentially unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions on Sections 45Y and 48E, which could be applied at the ownership and component level,” Boccaccio confirmed.","“To build may have to be the slow and laborious task of years,” Sir Winston Churchill once quipped. “To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.”

So it was, and so it remains.

In 2022, following decades of a plodding, two-steps forward, three steps back dance on renewable energy progress in the United States, there was a watershed moment for believers in a net-zero future and America as something more than the place that puts the ‘Made in China’ sticker on: the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). President Joe Biden’s landmark infrastructure legislation was a much-needed shot in the arm, one that pumped hundreds of billions of dollars through long-limp veins of domestic manufacturing, spawned new industries, and was on pace to spare Americans from breathing in billions of tons of greenhouse gases. The IRA’s carrots-over-sticks approach to encouraging clean energy production, its long runways for incentives, and the ability to transfer and sell credits gave developers and financial institutions the peace of mind necessary to put together mega pacts that enabled infrastructure development at a New Deal-esque pace.

In light of a self-declared “energy emergency” amidst staggering load growth spurred by an invisible AI arms race, an honest observer might expect the IRA to be added to, much less set out to sea and shot with a flaming arrow. Lots of Republicans even signed their names to sternly worded letters warning the Ways and Means Committee that they’d better not mess with the benefits flowing into their districts since the IRA’s perks disproportionately benefit Republican communities, after all.

And yet.

Last week, the U.S. House voted 215-214 to pass a sweeping budget reconciliation bill, deemed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), that torches the IRA, neutering its tax incentives, undermining its goals, and all but guaranteeing dirtier air, fewer American jobs, and higher electricity bills nationwide.

Its fate now rests in the hands of the Senate. While some are optimistic that the bill won’t reach President Donald Trump’s desk in its current form (and Democrats may have a way to sabotage the debate over it entirely), the IRA and what it enabled – the chariot, the dress, the glass slippers – appear as close to midnight as ever. The OBBBA kills existing federal electric vehicle (EV) tax credits by year-end, accelerates the phase-outs of tech-neutral investment tax credits under Section 48E and the commercial production tax credit under Section 45Y, and eliminates credit transferability entirely, among myriad other shocks to what seemed to be functioning systems.

What took decades of work to put together risks being thrown asunder in mere months, and nobody in the energy industry (outside of the oil and gas lobby) seems particularly pleased about that.

Fewer Jobs, Higher Electricity Bills

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) estimates that the Ways and Means Committee’s recent proposal to slash federal renewable energy tax credits would put 331 U.S. factory openings, 330,000 jobs, and more than 145,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) at risk. The solar advocacy group launched a new site tracking the damage the House budget bill could cause, warning that “America’s Solar Industry is UNDER THREAT.”

“If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump,” alerted Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA. “This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation. If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China, and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

SEIA’s analysis shows $285 billion in local investments could be erased if the OBBBA becomes law and indicates consumer electricity costs will increase by $51 billion nationwide. The bill would also repeal the Section 25D residential tax credit, a key driver of energy freedom for middle-class families. Repealing it leaves households with no accessible path to lower their costs with solar, SEIA argues.

American Clean Power Association (ACP) chief executive officer Jason Grumet points out that the budget plan is at odds with President Trump’s goal of American energy dominance.

“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” Grumet cautioned. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption. It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses, and we stand ready to help. As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth, and global competitiveness.”

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” Grumet concluded.

ACORE president and CEO Ray Long echoes many of his peers in calling for an ‘all-of-the-above‘ energy approach to navigate load growth and improve reliability, but fears the House reconciliation bill only sets us back.

“As ACORE’s own survey of clean energy investors showed, recklessly disrupting tax incentives will undermine projects that are ready to come online, meet our nation’s growing energy needs, and create jobs,” shared Long. “ACORE is committed to working with Congress and President Trump to make any improvements to this legislation and help them deliver on his promise to slash energy costs for Americans by 50%. It’s time to achieve American energy dominance across all technologies.”

Losing the AI Race, Giving up on Clean Transportation

The House bill threatens U.S. energy development, heavily favoring fossil fuels and thereby driving up not only greenhouse gas emissions but utility bills since solar PV is the cheapest and fastest-to-market generation technology at the moment. The United States needs to add 206.5 GW of new energy capacity by 2030, with solar expected to supply 73% of that capacity, according to SEIA. Without solar and storage, America will have an energy shortage that raises utility bills and slows economic growth. And by stifling energy development, the OBBBA also crimps our ability to compete with China in our ongoing competition to create god in the machine.

“The House passed a bill that threatens U.S. energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China,” ventured Scott Elias, director of policy and market development at CleanCapital. “Put simply, Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments, and stall clean energy deployment, making it harder, not easier, to build new sources of energy generation that America increasingly needs.”

Mike Carr, executive director of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, said while he appreciates the endorsement of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit by the House, this retroactive repeal (considering many contracts are in place for products through 2030) of the incentives to purchase American-made solar components undermines existing commercial agreements.

“The result will push developers back to buying overly-subsidized Chinese products evading our trade laws, while raising electricity costs for everyone. If this were to become law, it would be a boon to Chinese manufacturers and a tremendous step backward for American jobs, competitiveness in manufacturing and AI, economic security, and energy security,” Carr ventured.

CALSTART president and CEO John Boesel noted that the legislation is a major setback for America’s clean transportation future and global competitiveness in the EV space. He called the Trump Administration’s policy U-turn an act of “economic self-sabotage.”

“By dismantling key pro-manufacturing tax credits, this bill jeopardizes more than $200 billion in private investments and threatens automotive-related jobs in the United States,” Boesel asserted. “The tax credits have been instrumental in establishing a robust domestic supply chain, fostering innovation, and positioning the United States as a global leader in clean transportation. Repealing these measures not only undermines our economic growth but needlessly cedes ground to international competitors who are rapidly advancing in this space.”

“We urge the Senate to reconsider the investment-crushing, job-killing implications of this bill and to prioritize forward-looking policies that support sustainable transportation, job creation, and American industrial leadership.”

Under the current proposal, all existing federal EV tax credits would be eliminated by year-end, requiring immediate action to comply with the existing credit constraints. Businesses would have to complete all EV deals before Ryan Seacrest reaches “1” in the Times Square New Year’s Eve ball drop, outside of a grandfather clause for binding contracts for commercial vehicles over 14,000 pounds. The specific EV tax code sections on the chopping block are the clean vehicle credit under Section 30D, the previously owned clean vehicle credit under Section 25E, and the credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles under Section 45W. All would expire by Jan. 1, 2026, except for the 45W grandfather clause mentioned, and a one-year extension for EV manufacturers with 200,000 or fewer units sold domestically from 2010 through 2025.

“This means, for example, that a fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks will need to be purchased by year-end but that a custom 10-ton EV snowplow would have needed to be already under binding contract before the bill passes if not placed in service this year,” observed Ian Boccaccio, principal and income tax practice leader at Ryan Tax Firm.

Terminating the Section 30C alternative refueling property credit would curtail the expansion of EV charging station infrastructure. The effect would be especially potent combined with the termination of the federal grant program under the Unleashing American Energy executive order signed in January, Boccaccio warns. Another initiative, the new residential energy-efficient home credits under Section 45L, would be eliminated at the end of the year, too, with no grandfather clause for beginning construction, meaning the lease-up or sale of the residential units must occur this year.

Far-Reaching Implications for Renewable Energy

Heather Cooper, a partner at law firm McDermott Will & Emery, believes the changes made by the House to an already grim-looking budget will be devastating to the renewable energy industry, its employees, and the United States’ investment in energy infrastructure.

“Developers will need to scramble to ‘start construction’ on their pipeline projects within 60 days of enactment, typically by making large procurement orders,” she assessed. “There is going to be tremendous pressure on developers to find suppliers and manufacturers with queue capacity. Once that deadline passes, developers are out of luck and will be ineligible for credits on energy-generating projects.”

“Residential solar projects, in particular, are hard hit by this bill, losing both the credit for individual homeowners and commercial developers who lease projects to homeowners,” Cooper added. “This bill removes any real grace period to give developers time to prepare and adjust to new economic realities and will cause a total cliff in investment in the energy sector.”

Transferability under Section 6418 would be repealed for Sections 45Y/48E projects that begin construction two years after the date of enactment, sometime in mid-2027. Terminating Section 6418 transferability would have an immediate effect on the tax credit marketplace by putting a tight window on buying these tax credits, Ryan’s Boccaccio noted.

According to the OBBBA’s language, the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X would end for all solar and storage components after Dec. 31, 2031. Transferability for the Section 45X credit would be repealed for components sold after Dec. 31, 2027. And perhaps most alarmingly, an eligible component is subject to strict “foreign entity of concern” provisions that drastically limit the use of Chinese equipment and intellectual property.

“The House bill contains several complex and potentially unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions on Sections 45Y and 48E, which could be applied at the ownership and component level,” Boccaccio confirmed. “This means that if you have direct or indirect foreign ownership or even debt to a foreign company, these should all be fully vetted before jumping into a major green energy project. FEOC restrictions would have an immediate impact and could stop investment from foreign entities such as Canada and Mexico.”

If the FEOC components aren’t altered by the Senate, something as simple as using a Chinese screw could now literally screw a project out of capitalizing on tax credits.

What Happens Next?

Despite what may read like a 2,100-word epitaph above, some energy industry analysts remain optimistic. This is the 55th repeal attempt of the Biden administration’s landmark tax-and-climate measure, Boccaccio pointed out. Over the previous attempts, 29 made it to the floor of the House, and the other 25 died in committee. The 29 votes that made it to the floor each failed by at least an eight-vote margin.

“We were kind of prepared to see potentially a full repeal of the IRA come out of the House Ways and Means Committee,” confessed Bryen Alperin, managing director at investment firm Foss & Co, which helps businesses utilize the tax credits enabled by the IRA.

“When you look back in history at the first tax cut and Jobs Act, a lot of times what comes out of the House is a little more aggressive, and the Senate has a softer approach. We land somewhere in the middle,” Alperin surmised. “So we might see that play out here.”

Considering that roughly 72% of all job creation and 86% of all private investment in green energy projects encouraged by the IRA have come in Republican districts, there is still hope that a fair number of Senators won’t let the budget language pass as-is. Hope can be a sufficient breakfast, but it’s always a bad supper.

“It’s now up to the Senate to fix this big, ugly mess of a bill,” recommended Bob Keefe, executive director of the national nonpartisan business group E2. “With more than 400 major clean energy projects and our energy future hanging in the balance, we hope they’ll put their constituents ahead of politics and make America great through action, not words.”

“It’s not too late for Congress to get this right,” chimed SEIA’s Hopper. “The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the U.S. Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-28-2025-11_31_27-AM.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:13:12.974572

If Republicans lose a few senators and aren't in a position to move the bill past a deadlock via a tie-breaking vote by Vice President JD Vance, President Trump could get very angry. But given that the legislation contains an all-important extension of the 2017 tax cuts, let's assume that GOP senators who fear the wrath of Don will fall into line.

That would mean it's game over what has been a burgeoning U.S.-based electric battery industry. InsideEVs' Tim Levin reviews the situation, duly noting that the bill also takes the axe to EV incentives. The loss of the longstanding $7,500 federal tax credit is likely to damage already slowing EV sales in the U.S., but what's more alarming is the degree to which the legislation could kill investment in domestic battery manufacturing.

Levin cites a recent report from Princeton's REPEAT project that summarizes in admirable detail the current and future landscape of EV and battery production in the States. It's extremely wonky, but worth a closer look if you care about this stuff. The researches highlight a critical linkage between EV incentives and increasing battery manufacturing capacity. Remember that not so long ago, the Biden administration was aggressively supporting an advanced, domestic battery supply chain.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reorganized previous EV incentives to favor vehicles made in America. Batteries were also supposed to be largely sourced here. The goal was to stand up an American battery industry that could challenge China's dominance, maintain national security, and generate potentially thousands of jobs.

Of course, building a bunch of new battery factories is pointless if you don't have enough electric cars to put them in. REPEAT maintains that if the expected battery manufacturing capacity of 400 GWh per year arrives in 2025, the country would be producing far more battery cells than needed by an EV business dealing with ebbing demand and withdrawn incentives.

How much excess capacity are we talking about? REPEAT says 29-72%. Let's get real: an industry that isn't using a third of its capacity is going to be an industry in big trouble. But an industry that has almost three quarters of its capacity sitting idle? That's not an industry. One would need Soviet levels of aimless production to keep it going.

It's not unreasonable to ask if all those big, beautiful battery factories were going to be a good thing. Clearly, the EV market in the U.S. isn't growing at quite the pace many analysts expected. Meanwhile, EV sales have been booming in China, justifying the country's foresighted investment in battery manufacturing.

I would also point out that what's driving the Big, Beautiful Bill politically is perpetuating tax cuts – and finding spending reductions to pay for them. Unbuilt battery factories, future employment, and the fate of EVs in America aren't exactly top of mind for a GOP that needs to juke the economy before it dips into a recession. Ironically, however, the battery factory boom was poised to lift fortunes in Republican-controlled states. Just goes to show you how twisted and weird life has become for Trump-supporting lawmakers.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/americas-hopes-for-big-beautiful-battery-factories-will-be-ruined-if-congress-passes-spending-bill/l-intro-1748377031.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:13:17.253117

GM is in the middle of changing its manufacturing operations to reduce tariff costs, Barra said.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra acknowledges the company could have been better positioned during its conversations with President Donald Trump in his first term — particularly when it came to the Detroit automaker's North American manufacturing operations.

GM's top executive said on stage at the Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything conference in New York City that she brings lessons learned from past interactions with Trump’s White House to today's tariff-related conversations.

“When we didn’t see eye to eye on some things, I think there’s actually some things where General Motors could have handled some situations better,” Barra said May 28, referring to the company’s past chats with Trump’s administration. “We had to do some restructuring, and we could have executed better, which would have positioned it a lot better.”

During the negotiation of U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement in 2018, the existing trade pact among the North American countries that Trump managed during his first term, conversations between the president and GM occasionally turned ugly. At the time, GM was in the process of shuttering its massive assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which had focused on manufacturing small cars, amid restructuring efforts that involved layoffs of nearly 6,000 salaried workers in North America.

The changes made national headlines and drew negative attention, and tweets from the president.

“But even through that period and then beyond, we’ve always continued to have dialogue, and that’s a kind of a lesson learned. I’ve been very clear that I believe in electric vehicles, I’m very clear about the importance of manufacturing,"" she told Editor in Chief Emma Tucker. “Having the dialogue to make sure they understand our industry — because I think we do have a shared goal of strengthening it — has been beneficial.”

GM making production changes

GM is facing costs up to $5 billion this year from Trump’s tariffs, the company said after its most recent earnings report. Barra applauded the relief stemming from the most recent executive orders signed April 29, which set 25% tariffs on all imported autos, which began in April, and another 25% on all auto parts set to begin by May 3. The change prevented stacking tariffs on top of previously announced duties on steel and aluminum, the costs of which Barra described as “untenable.”

GM has made a variety of production changes at plants in the United States this year, including an $888 investment the company announced late May 27 in its New York propulsion assembly plant to produce the next-generation V-8 engine, the automaker’s largest investment ever in an engine plant. GM said April 23 that it planned to expand transmission production at its Toledo Propulsions Systems plant where it builds transmissions used in the Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks.

“We’re trying to make changes to pay less tariffs because we’re strengthening our U.S. manufacturing,” Barra said. “There’s decisions we can make when we look at the entire equation … we have the capacity available in some of the assembly plants and engine plants that we have in this country that we’re going to continue to utilize.”

General Motors did not join automakers that advertised tariff-free pricing deals, and Barra would not commit to post-tariff vehicle price changes, citing the dynamic pricing in the automotive industry even without tariffs that requires flexibility to stay competitive.

“I’ve had the opportunity to talk to the president and his administration on a regular basis, and one of the things that I’m very appreciative is they have taken the time to understand ... the dynamics of our industry,” Barra said. “I can’t speak to all the other industries that are facing tariffs, but I can tell you for decades now, it has not been a level playing field with U.S. automakers globally with either tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers.”

State departments partner to support, lay out a roadmap to train 5,000 new infrastructure workers by 2030 to meet Michigan's critical infrastructure needs

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich. – Today, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II announced funding commitments of up to $107 million from the State of Michigan to support infrastructure workforce development initiatives through the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity’s (LEO) Building Michigan’s Infrastructure Workforce (BMIW) program.

The BMIW program recently released the Michigan Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan – developed by LEO in partnership with their Michigan High-Speed Internet Office (MIHI), the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), Michigan Department for Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), and Michigan Infrastructure Office (MIO) – laying out a roadmap to train 5,000 new infrastructure workers by 2030 to meet Michigan's critical infrastructure needs. The funding commitments mark an important first step in realizing the plan's strategies, creating and enhancing job opportunities and training programs and leveraging collaboration between the public and private sectors.

“Across Michigan, workers are rolling up their sleeves to fix our roads and bridges, build clean energy projects, and expand access to affordable, fast internet,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “Investing in our workforce is critical, which is why I am excited about our $107 million investment to support the Building Michigan’s Infrastructure Workforce program and build a skilled workforce statewide. Michigan has one of the strongest workforce systems in the nation, and today’s announcement builds on that progress. Let’s keep Standing Tall to help every Michigander get the skills they need for a good-paying job.”

Building on the momentum of the Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan, several state departments have committed funding to support workforce development programs for jobs that will help Michigan fix the roads, expand transit, protect clean water, connect more homes and businesses to high-speed internet and build out clean energy to lower costs for families.

“We’re continuing to invest in Michiganders by amplifying efforts to grow and train a skilled workforce,” said LEO Director Susan Corbin. “These efforts are paying off – Michigan is No. 1 in the nation in credential attainment for adults, No. 3 in the nation for helping adults get employed and top 10 in the nation for Registered Apprenticeships. Infrastructure investments will connect Michigan residents to training opportunities for good-paying jobs and make Michigan more prosperous for all.”

This funding advances the goals of Governor Whitmer’s Executive Directive (ED 2024-1), “Building Up Michigan’s Workforce and Infrastructure.” Programs highlighted in today’s announcement include:

$35.7 million through LEO’s Transmission Siting and Economic Development (TSED) Grant Program to support specialized education and training through electric utility apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs, as well as training for electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure construction and installation.

$11.5 million through EGLE’s Solar for All (SFA) and Training for Residential Energy Contractors (TREC) initiatives to support the deployment of solar to households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state. SFA will invest in the solar workforce and support access to high-quality, high-wage careers in solar, creating opportunities for low-income individuals to enter the clean energy workforce. TREC will fund training for solar installation, energy storage and energy efficiency upgrades – such as electrical panel updates or roof repairs by creating middle-class career pathways for workers from disadvantaged communities.

$60 million through MIHI’s Broadband, Equity and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide funding for non-deployment uses, including broadband infrastructure workforce development, to support the successful deployment of broadband infrastructure.

Michigan Department of Transportation: Committed workforce programming funding—through new and existing sources— supporting economic growth, mobility and safety through a skilled, diverse workforce targeting investment to meet Michigan's transportation infrastructure needs including roads, bridges, aviation and rail sectors. Training programs are supported by $11 million in existing funds.

“MDOT is committed to recruiting and training the workforce that will design and oversee the building of the infrastructure of the future,” said MDOT Director Bradley C. Wieferich. “This collaboration with our partner departments demonstrates our shared commitment to attracting and retaining the best talent.”

These funding commitments represent a shared recognition of the need for a skilled, diverse infrastructure workforce to support Michigan’s expanding infrastructure needs. The investments are formalized through agreements executed among the state partners that establish a collaborative framework that aligns workforce development with program-specific infrastructure needs.

""Michigan's ambitious infrastructure goals, from safeguarding our water to accelerating clean energy, hinge on a skilled and resilient workforce,"" said EGLE Director Phil Roos. ""As we make once-in-a-generation investments and project tens of thousands of new jobs, investing in our infrastructure workforce isn't just an option—it's a necessity for Michigan's future. The Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Program demonstrates our commitment to building that essential workforce and ensuring our communities thrive.""

Michigan is undergoing an unprecedented infrastructure transformation, with more than $16.7 billion in federal funding driving projects in transportation, rail and transit, clean energy, water, broadband and more. This federal funding is estimated to create approximately 11,000 new jobs each year, representing a historic surge in demand for skilled labor. Delivering these projects on time, on budget and safely will require a highly skilled workforce in every region of the state.

""Historic investments in broadband infrastructure and bringing high-speed internet across Michigan are transforming lives — giving people the technology they need to build skills, access healthcare and fully participate in education,” said MIHI Chief Connectivity Officer Eric Frederick. ""To make that vision a reality, we also need a skilled workforce ready to build and maintain the networks that connect us all. Investing in our workforce has a ripple effect – people have good-paying jobs, and employers have the skilled workers they need to thrive in Michigan.""

“We are excited to see the state already dedicating substantial funding to this program, supporting our state’s current and future infrastructure workers,” said Steve Claywell, President of the Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council. “Working with LEO and other state partners allows us to effectively align worker training with Michigan’s infrastructure needs.”

“As our state continues to invest significantly in roads and bridges, the BMIW program plays a critical role in ensuring we build a skilled, diverse workforce ready to deliver on transformative projects,” said Dannis Mitchell, Senior Director of Community Engagement at Barton Malow. “The Michigan Statewide Infrastructure Workforce Plan, coupled with these strategic investments, strengthens our ability to address workforce pipeline challenges while equipping individuals with the technical training needed to expand and maintain Michigan’s transportation systems.”",https://www.michigan.gov/leo/-/media/Project/Websites/leo/Images/Executive1/LEO_WebIMG/Someone-working-on-their-computer.jpg?rev=4a01d7cb73304829b4bbfbd5b080a586&hash=828DA554C5E1A9686253BB3B6A1EB500,N,,2025-05-28 17:16:29.712219

These are some of Mr. Trump’s policies that would be cemented into law if Republicans move the bill through Congress as planned in party-line votes.

Mexico City Policy

The bill would codify Mr. Trump’s order reinstating the Mexico City Policy that bans U.S. foreign aid from providing or promoting abortion services. It further requires aid recipients, such as nongovernmental organizations, to attest that they will not use U.S. funds or non-U.S. funds for abortion services.

President Reagan first adopted the policy in 1984. He announced it at the second International Conference on Population in Mexico City.

Since then, the policy has shifted with administrations. Democratic presidents have rescinded it, and Republican presidents have reinstated it. The House Republican bill tries to break this cycle.

Abortion rights advocates, who call the policy the “global gag rule,” say the restrictions on U.S. foreign aid reverse strides in global health, gender equality and human rights, making it harder for disadvantaged women to access health care.

Supporters say the policy has resulted in minimal disruptions to health care in foreign countries because pro-life policies do not negate quality health care.

Golden Dome

The legislation would require the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. In January, Mr. Trump ordered the creation of a system that would put U.S. weapons into space for the first time to protect against missile attacks.

The Golden Dome, based on Israel’s Iron Dome defense system, is a multilayered project to deploy next-generation technologies across land, sea and space, with space-based sensors and interceptors.

The system, first proposed by Reagan but never realized, would destroy missiles before launch or intercept them in flight.

Mr. Trump said building the Golden Dome would take three years and cost $175 billion. The House Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” includes a $25 billion down payment on the project.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the long-term cost of the system’s space-based components would reach $542 billion over 20 years.

Federal workers

The legislation would codify several of Mr. Trump’s orders that tightened the standards for some federal workers to receive full civil service protections.

It includes a new set of performance evaluations for federal workers during the probationary period of their employment, providing more opportunities to fire new employees before they become tenured civil servants.

Rather than making federal workers tenured civil servants by default, Mr. Trump’s Rule XI mandated that agencies affirmatively certify at the end of the probationary or trial period that a worker’s appointment advances the public interest.

The bill also enshrines into law Mr. Trump’s order to root out “deep state” partisanship. It classifies career government employees who work on policy matters as “schedule policy/career” employees who are “held to the highest standards of conduct and performance.”

“If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job,” Mr. Trump said.

Opponents say the order weakens the government’s civil service system, but Mr. Trump and his supporters insist it brings more accountability to a bloated bureaucracy.

Immigration and the border

Several of Mr. Trump’s executive orders cracking down on illegal immigration made their way into the legislation, including spending to complete the border wall and cutting off illegal immigrants from Medicaid and other taxpayer-funded benefits.

The bill would authorize about $175 billion to strengthen border enforcement and implement the president’s immigration agenda.

About $46.5 billion would go toward modernizing and expanding the border barrier system and completing 701 miles of primary wall and 900 miles of river barriers. Also, $2.7 billion would pay for other border security technology, such as sensors, surveillance towers and tunnel detection systems.

Another $4.1 billion would be spent on hiring and training Border Patrol agents, and $2 billion on retention and signing bonuses.

Protecting children

Mr. Trump’s order barring taxpayer dollars from paying for children to undergo transgender treatments would become law under the House-passed bill. The legislation would prohibit Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program or the Affordable Care Act from paying for sex-change procedures for minors.

Critics of Mr. Trump’s order said it denigrates and punishes transgender people. The president’s order, however, described the restrictions as a way to protect children from irreparable harm.

Reinvigorating the coal industry

The bill would codify the order for the interior secretary to make available for lease at least 4 million additional acres of known recoverable coal resources on federal land in Western states and Alaska.

Areas not open to coal-recovery leases would include land within a national monument, national recreation area, national military park, national historical park, national battlefield site, national memorial, unit of the National Fish Hatchery System, unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System and a National Conservation Area.

The elimination of coal has long been a top goal of climate change activists. Mr. Trump argues that forgoing coal puts the U.S. at an energy disadvantage when countries such as China continue to use coal to fuel their economies.

Unleashing American energy

Another provision is Mr. Trump’s order repealing the Biden-era electric vehicle mandate and Green New Deal policies.

The bill also codifies Mr. Trump’s declaration of U.S. policy to promote energy production and exploration on federal lands and waters.

It would require agency heads to review all regulations restricting domestic energy production and use and implement plans to roll back or alter those regulations.

By putting these measures into law, the Republican-controlled Congress would be undermining the climate change movement, which the Democratic Party has championed.

Oil drilling in Alaska

Mr. Trump’s order to fully use Alaska’s ample natural resources is part of the House package. It codifies the Trump administration’s rollback of policies implemented since January 2021 that restrict resource development on federal and state lands in Alaska, including the 19-million-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Oil and gas drilling in ANWR has been hotly debated for decades. The region could be a massive resource for oil and gas, but environmentalists warn that energy development would threaten diverse wildlife and Indigenous communities.

The bill would also codify Mr. Trump’s order to expedite the permitting, leasing and infrastructure projects critical for developing Alaska’s resources, particularly its liquefied natural gas industry and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

Garden of American Heroes

The bill includes Mr. Trump’s order to build a National Garden of American Heroes. This project was ordered in the first Trump administration and is intended to be part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration next year.

President Biden canceled construction of the Garden of American Heroes, which is envisioned as a sculpture garden of 250 life-size statues of people who have contributed to American history.

The legislation would appropriate $40 million to establish and maintain the statuary park. It would authorize spending $150 million on events, celebrations and activities commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/05/27/Trump_83422_c0-205-4912-3070_s1200x700.jpg?95f339deb9ac67256641f176e31c412377e41dcb,N,,2025-05-28 18:14:06.509881

In 2024, one in four vehicles sold by the company was already either fully electric or a plug-in hybrid.

At BMW Group plants, vehicles with electrified drive trains and internal combustion engines are produced alongside one another on the same production line.

The company launched series production of fully electric vehicles with the BMW i3, back in 2013. The electric city car was manufactured for nearly ten years at Plant Leipzig, alongside the BMW Group’s first plug-in hybrid, the BMW i8. At that time, due to its unique vehicle architecture, the BMW i3 was still being built in Leipzig in a dedicated area for electric cars, in parallel with production of vehicles with conventional drive trains.

Since then, the BMW Group has integrated electric cars into production at all its plants worldwide. Many of the plants initially assembled plug-in hybrid models on a single line, mixed in with their diesel and petrol counterparts, on a flexible basis. Electromobility accounts for a steadily growing share of production volumes, surpassing 25% in 2024, with around three-quarters of those vehicles fully electric. A total of 1.5 million BEVs from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands have already been delivered.

With the start of MINI Cooper SE production in Oxford in 2019, the BEV range was extended to the BMW Group’s second brand. The rollout continued from 2020 with the latest generation of e-drives. The BMW iX3 was built in China, while the BMW iX and i4 ramped up in Dingolfing and Munich in 2021. Within a year, all BMW Group plants in Germany had been enabled for production of fully electric vehicles. The company remains committed to integrating electrified vehicles systematically into existing production.

In China, electrification has already been introduced at all plant sites. In the US, Plant Spartanburg is preparing for production of fully electric vehicles from 2026, while Plant San Luis Potosí in Mexico will add BEV models for the Neue Klasse to its production portfolio in 2027. Both facilities already produce plug-in hybrid models. The plant in Rosslyn, South Africa, has been manufacturing plug-in hybrids since 2024. The BMW Group’s sites for local production in Brazil, India and Thailand also already build electrified vehicles.

Production of electric powertrain components is expanding beyond Germany. Since the launch of the BMW i3, battery modules, high-voltage batteries and electric motors have been produced in Dingolfing. As part of the electrification of the production network, the Competence Center for E-Drive Production was established at the site. By 2022, it had already reached an annual capacity of over 500,000 e-drives. Other locations gradually ramped up capacity to support the rapid growth in e-mobility. As a result, alongside Dingolfing, fifth-generation high-voltage batteries are now also assembled and installed in vehicles in Regensburg, Leipzig and Spartanburg. The expertise gained since then is now being applied to the sixth generation of e-drives, which will be introduced towards the end of this year with the NEUE KLASSE at the new plant in Debrecen, Hungary.",,N,,2025-05-28 18:13:15.800762

ENERGY STAR is strongly supported by a wide array of manufacturers, homebuilders, housing organizations, building owners, small businesses, and other organizations.","Washington, D.C. – Oregon’s U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden joined 20 of their Senate colleagues to demand the Trump Administration immediately reverse course on its plan to illegally and unilaterally terminate the ENERGY STAR program. In their letter, the Senators highlight the cost-saving benefits of the program, which is projected to save the average American household $450 on utility bills each year simply by choosing ENERGY STAR certified products.

“For over three decades, the ENERGY STAR program has lowered Americans’ energy bills by informing consumers about energy efficient products. The program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation under authority of Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, most recently receiving $35.7 million in fiscal year 2025 appropriations,” wrote the Senators. “Reporting has indicated, however, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate ENERGY STAR without Congressional approval. Not only is the program protected under federal statute and thus illegal for the Administration to terminate unilaterally, but this decision also lacks basic economic sense. We write to urge you to immediately reverse course.”

Since 1992, ENERGY STAR has reduced energy costs for American families and businesses by $500 billion, including $42 billion worth of savings in 2020 alone. For every federal dollar spent on ENERGY STAR, Americans have enjoyed $350 in savings.

The Senators continued: “ENERGY STAR is the epitome of an effective public-private partnership. As the program’s administrators, EPA and the Department of Energy set qualifying energy efficiency standards for products. EPA also protects the integrity of the ENERGY STAR brand, ensuring it remains well-known, trusted, and indicative of a quality product. Appliance manufacturers then voluntarily display the ENERGY STAR label, notifying consumers that a product will reduce their energy consumption and lower utility bills. The program strengthens consumer choice by sharing critical product information.”

Administered by the EPA and Department of Energy, ENERGY STAR is a voluntary, market-based program that has saved consumers billions of dollars annually. The ENERGY STAR program has cumulatively reduced four billion metric tons of harmful emissions and currently supports more than 790,000 American jobs manufacturing and installing ENERGY STAR products.

“Eliminating the ENERGY STAR program will not only raise energy costs for American families and businesses, but also inflict far-reaching economic harms, threatening industry jobs and the reliability of the grid at a time of growing demand. We again urge you to immediately reconsider eliminating this popular and effective Congressionally authorized program,” the Senators concluded.

ENERGY STAR is strongly supported by a wide array of manufacturers, homebuilders, housing organizations, building owners, small businesses, and other organizations. In April, the U.S. Real Estate Industry sent a letter to the Trump Administration expressing its strong support for the ENERGY STAR program. Additionally, the U.S. Green Buildings Council partnered with the Alliance to Save Energy in leading over 1,000 organizations in urging the Trump Administration to protect the program and maintain full funding and staffing levels.

The letter was led by U.S. Senators Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.). In addition to Merkley and Wyden, the letter was signed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Angus King (I-Maine), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Clarification regarding the Application of Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification (“Memorandum”).

The Memorandum is transmitted from EPA Office of Water Acting Assistant Administrator Peggy Browne.

Section 401 of the Clean Water Act prohibits federal agencies from issuing permits or licenses that result in exceedance of water quality standards, or other applicable authorities, of the state. This provision of the Clean Water Act requires an applicant for a federal license or permit to provide a certification that any discharges from the facility will comply with applicable Water Quality Standards. If not provided, the federal permit or license may not be granted. Further, the states can impose certain conditions upon federal permits or licenses as a prerequisite to granting the permit or license.

If a state fails or refuses to act on a request for certification in a timely manner, the certification requirements are waived with respect to such federal applications.

Examples of federal licenses and permits that may require Section 401 Water Quality certifications include (but are not limited to):

Clean Water Act Section 404 Dredge and Fill Permits.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Hydroelectric Licenses.

Clean Water Act Section 402 Pollutant Discharge Permits.

Natural Gas Pipeline Certificates issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The stated purpose of the May 21st EPA Memorandum is to address questions the federal agency states have been raised in regard to a rule promulgated in September 2023 (during the Biden Administration), addressing Section 401 certifications. It states that stakeholders raised questions about potential applications of the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.

By way of introduction, the Memorandum states in part:

…The purpose of this document is to reiterate the EPA’s longstanding position that states and Tribes must utilize CWA Section 401 only for its statutory purpose – to protect water quality – and not as a weapon to shut down projects for reasons with no basis in the statute or applicable regulations. A certifying authority’s evaluation is limited to considering adverse impacts to water quality, and only such impacts insofar as they prevent compliance with applicable water quality requirements.

This position arguably constitutes a narrowing of the activities that were potentially subject to the 401 certification process under the Biden Administration’s 2023 Rule promulgated by EPA.

The Memorandum also states in part:

…the regulations do not authorize a certification condition based on generalized concerns about water quality untethered to noncompliance with a specific applicable water quality requirement or requirements. It would be inconsistent with CWA Section 401 to deny or condition a certification based on potential impacts not connected to water quality (e.g., based solely on potential impacts to air quality, traffic, noise, project preference, or economic impacts that have no direct connection to water quality). If a certifying authority imposes certification conditions or denies certification for a reason or reasons such as these, then that certification decision would not comply with CWA Section 401 or the EPA’s regulations.

The Memorandum states that EPA will promulgate in the future a Federal Register notice a recommendations docket to identify additional areas of implementation challenges and regulatory uncertainty relate to the 2023 Rule’s scope of certification.",https://www.mitchellwilliamslaw.com/images/site/Social_Logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:06.670468

Now the revised legislation advances to the Senate, where it is likely to be amended before both chambers reconcile their differences and finalize the legislation for the President’s approval or veto. Although the legislation is not final and could change before final enactment, its impact on the clean energy provisions enacted as part of the IRA warrants attention from investors, developers, manufacturers, and financiers that rely on these provisions. The legislation imposes a number of significant changes to the IRA, including the elimination of the investment tax credit and production tax credit under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively, for any facilities that are not under construction prior to the date that is 60 days after enactment and a full repeal of the EV credits. Below is a summary of key provisions in the legislation most likely to affect energy and manufacturing transactions.

Phase-Outs and Terminations of Energy and Manufacturing Credits

Under the legislation, several energy-related credits are phased out or terminated. The legislation accelerates the sunset of numerous credits which, under current law, run well into the 2030s or have no fixed end date.

1. Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E)

The clean electricity production tax credit (the “PTC”) and the clean electricity investment tax credit (“ITC”) are very important components of the IRA. These two tech-neutral credits apply to investments in qualifying clean electricity generation or storage property. The PTC and ITC took effect at the beginning of 2025 and are available to all new zero-emission electricity production facilities. Under current law, the PTC and ITC are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032, or when the US power sector reaches 25 percent of 2022 emissions levels, whichever is later.

The legislation significantly accelerates the elimination of these credits. The ITC and PTC are repealed for projects beginning construction more than 60 days after enactment of the legislation. Additionally, in order to maintain eligibility to receive the tax credits, the projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2028. This is a significant departure from prior repeals and sunsets of the credits, in which Congress solely used a “beginning of construction” standard as a transition rule. The two-pronged transition rule under the legislation means that developers will be required to quickly incur 5% of a project’s cost or begin physical work of a significant nature, but doing so will not grandfather the qualification of a project that fails to be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Eligible advanced nuclear facilities and expanded nuclear facilities are exempted from the 60-day beginning-of-construction requirements and instead must only comply with the placed-in-service deadline on December 31, 2028. Additionally, the legislation specifically eliminates the credit for residential wind and solar leasing arrangements beginning on the day the legislation is enacted.

The effective date of the FEOC restrictions would vary depending on the specific FEOC restriction, as follows: (i) for taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity,” effective immediately for tax years beginning after enactment; (ii) for projects the construction of which includes any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” effective for facilities beginning construction after one year from enactment; and (iii) for taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity,” effective in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

In addition, 100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a “specified taxpayer” makes an “applicable payment” within ten years after the property is placed in service. This is longer than the typical five-year recapture period and does not include a step-down during the recapture period.

2. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit provides a credit for domestic production of key clean energy components like solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and critical minerals. Under the legislation, a phased reduction of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit begins in 2029. Production occurring after 2031 will now no longer qualify, one year earlier than current law. In addition, under the legislation, wind-energy components cease to be eligible after 2027, and the general phase-out mirrors the 45Y/48E schedule. Under current law, full credit is available through 2029 with a softer ramp-down (75% in 2030, 50 % in 2031, 25% in 2032, and zero thereafter). Similar to 45X, the nuclear production tax credit (45U) ends on December 31, 2031, one year earlier than current law.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers that are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment, taxpayers that are a “foreign-influenced entity” or make an “applicable payment” to a “prohibited foreign entity” with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning two years after enactment, and eligible components produced in tax years beginning two years after enactment that (i) include any “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity,” or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreement with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

3. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit offers a tech-neutral credit for the domestic production of low-emissions transportation fuels, with eligibility and credit value based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Under current law, the credit is available for transportation fuel sold before January 1, 2028. The legislation extends the Clean Fuel Production Credit to make credits available for fuels sold through December 31, 2031. Under the legislation, feedstock must be sourced exclusively from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. Credits are denied if the producer becomes a prohibited foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

The legislation would apply FEOC restrictions and disallow credits to taxpayers who are a “specified foreign entity” for tax years beginning after enactment and taxpayers who are a “foreign-influenced entity” in tax years beginning two years after enactment.

Foreign Entity of Concern Limitation

The legislation significantly expands the existing concept of a foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) found in other parts of the Code by introducing new criteria and definitions of a “prohibited foreign entity,” a “specified foreign entity,” and a “foreign-influenced entity.” Under the legislation, eligibility for the credits under Sections 45, 45Y, 48, 48E, or 45X (further discussed below) may be denied where a “prohibited foreign entity” is involved in certain aspects of the facility’s development or ownership (typically requiring meaningful connections to China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran). The complexity of these rules will require careful planning to ensure compliance and no inadvertent foot fault.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: a broad category established in the legislation encompassing both “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

Specified Foreign Entity: any foreign entity of concern as defined in section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, entities identified as Chinese military companies operating in the United States, entities included on certain federal government lists, certain battery-producing entities, and any foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign Controlled Entity: an entity owned or controlled by the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), citizens or residents of such a nation (excluding US citizens or lawful permanent residents), entities organized under the laws of a covered nation, or entities controlled by any of the foregoing, an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity.

Foreign Influenced Entity: an entity will be classified as a “foreign-influenced entity” if:

During the taxable year, (i) a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual; (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10% of the entity; (iii) specified foreign entities collectively own 25% or more of the entity; or (iv) one or more specified foreign entities collectively hold at least 25% of the entity’s debt.

In addition, an entity will also be deemed foreign-influenced if, during the prior taxable year, it knowingly makes, or had reason to know it made, payments of dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents or royalties, guarantees, or other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amounts (each, an “applicable payment”) either: (i) in an amount equal to or exceeding 10% of the total of such payments to any single specified foreign entity, or (ii) in an aggregate amount equal to or exceeding 25% of the total of such payments to multiple specified foreign entities.

While “specified foreign entity” and “foreign controlled entity” are not new concepts (although, as discussed below, the legislation would expand their applicability to more credits), the “foreign influenced entity” is a new category of FEOC. Presumably, these expansions are designed to capture both direct and indirect foreign influence or control, particularly from countries or organizations deemed adversarial or high risk, and serve as the basis for restricting access to certain federal tax benefits.

As discussed in more detail below, under the legislation, a taxpayer classified as a specified foreign entity would be ineligible to claim any credit for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. For taxpayers falling into certain less restrictive categories—such as foreign-influenced entities or those making payments to prohibited foreign entities—the legislation would generally bar eligibility for credits starting two years after the date of enactment.

The legislation applies the constructive ownership rules under Section 318, excluding Section 318(a)(3) related to partnerships, to determine whether an entity qualifies as a “prohibited foreign entity.” This exclusion of partnership attribution rules may prevent the application of Section 318 in the context of partnerships, narrowing the scope of entities deemed prohibited foreign entities through partnership relationships. However, the application of the remaining Section 318 rules could still pose significant challenges when assessing whether a US entity is treated as a prohibited foreign entity under the proposed FEOC restrictions. This raises compliance and structuring concerns, particularly for multinational holding company structures, and may call for a clarification or exception to avoid unintentionally sweeping US companies into the prohibited foreign entity definition solely through constructive ownership.

Material Assistance from an FEOC

A broad restriction applies to any project that receives “material assistance” from an FEOC during construction. This is a new restriction that did not exist under the IRA. A facility is deemed to have received material assistance if:

It includes any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined under Section 45X(c)(6)) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity; or

Its design relies on a copyright, patent, trade secret, or know-how provided by such an entity.

However, the bill carves out a limited exception for assembly parts or “constituent materials” that are not uniquely designed or formulated for use in qualified facilities or eligible components under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X and are not predominantly produced, processed, or extracted by prohibited foreign entities. Although this exception is potentially helpful to the industry, the breadth of this exception may depend, in part, on how broadly “uniquely designed or formulated” is defined in subsequent guidance.

As discussed below, this “material assistance” restriction would generally bar eligibility for credits starting one or two years after the date of enactment, depending on the specific credit.

Transferability of Certain Clean Energy Credits Repealed for Future Years

The IRA permits most clean-energy credits to be sold by taxpayers, which has created a robust secondary market that has allowed sponsors with limited or no tax capacity to efficiently monetize these credits directly to raise capital. The legislation would unwind this regime for some forms of tax credits. The affected credits are those generated under Sections 45Q and Section 48(a)(3)(vii) (i.e., geothermal heat pump systems). The legislation would repeal transferability for projects that “begin construction” two years after the date that the legislation is enacted, which could be as early as July and most likely by August 2025. Accordingly, we expect the familiar “beginning of construction” rules (i.e., 5% safe harbor and physical work test) will apply to grandfather 45Q and geothermal projects that begin construction during the two-year window. Project developers should consider entering into beginning-of-construction arrangements, particularly the 5% safe harbor which is not project specific, to preserve the option of transferability, keeping in mind that a project generally must be placed in service within four years of the date upon which it began construction.

For Sections 45Z and 45X, transferability of credits is terminated after December 31, 2027, for electricity generated or fuels or components made after that date. The legislation does not retroactively disturb transfers executed for 2023-2025 credits, and market participants can still transact in credits generated before the repeal dates.","https://www.mayerbrown.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400,quality=90,format=jpeg/-/media/images/tile-images-for-insights-and-news/tile_bucket-300x400_33.jpg?rev=988f4f8cabc54d06ad33b523a7a3274e",N,,2025-05-28 15:33:11.384323

Sites selected in Iowa are former grocery stores, a YMCA building, a meat packing plant, abandoned businesses and a smelting facility. The EPA Brownfields Program helps a community to assess, clean up and eventually reuse contaminated sites that would otherwise be unusable.

The City of Clinton received a grant for a little over $1 million, which City Administrator Matt Brooke said will be used to remove the pool section of the city’s former YMCA.

The former YMCA building is contaminated with asbestos and lead, which make it unsuitable for redevelopment until it is remediated.

“This grant funding will enable Clinton to continue a crucial environmental cleanup project,” Brooke said in a press release sent by EPA. “Clinton continues to work toward a cleaner and greener community for all people to live, work, and enjoy.”

Iowa Western Community College receives EPA grant for job training

The Iowa grants are part of a nationwide allotment of $267 million in brownfields grants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the program will help to create new opportunities for businesses and housing while strengthening local economies.

“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

The EPA Brownfields Program started in 1995, but saw a significant boost in funding under former President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan.

Another recipient of the recently awarded funding, East Central Intergovernmental Association, has facilitated brownfield clean up projects in eastern Iowa through its participation in the Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund with EPA. The association was awarded $1.5 million to help replenish the fund, which EPA said has been “high performing.” The fund thus far has supported projects like the YMCA remediation in Clinton and a property in Dubuque.

“Many communities are burdened with brownfield sites but lack the resources to address them,” said Dawn Danielson, ECIA’s brownfields coordinator. “The ripple effect of EPA’s investments is transformational, not only for the site itself but also for surrounding properties.”

Danielson said the remediated sites typically become “catalysts for economic development” in the area and breathe “new life” into communities.

Le Mars Mayor Rob Bixenman, similarly said the grant will revitalize “key areas” of the community and help to accelerate the city’s community development plan.

Le Mars was awarded $400,000 to assess and develop clean up plans at a former Walmart, meat packing plant, landscaping company and unused hotel along the city’s business corridor.

The City of Keokuk was also selected to receive just under $2 million to clean up a 16-acre site that formerly smelted and refined zinc and lead. According to EPA, the site is contaminated with coal tar, zinc smelting residuals that are high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH, and heavy metals. The plant opened in 1915 and operated until the 1980s.

The site has received a number of EPA grants as the city works to clean up the site and hopefully attract a redeveloper.

The City of Red Oak was also selected and will receive a $500,000 grant to conduct site assessments and community engagement for unused properties along its Broadway Street.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Keokuk-feature-electrode-paste-9-21-23-e1748455110447.png,N,,2025-05-28 15:34:35.352789

The impact of Trump's energy policy on U.S. hydropower activity will take longer to unfold.
Hydropower accounts for 27 percent of renewable energy generation in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
Such facilities account for the overwhelming majority of renewable energy storage capacity in the U.S. at 96 percent.","The Donald Trump administration has taken extraordinary measures to reverse the transition to renewable energy in the United States, but the decarbonization stage is already set. Wind and especially solar already far outpace natural gas for new power generation additions to the nation’s grid, and that trend is expected to continue as signs indicate the demand for renewable energy has nowhere to go but up. Here are three of them.

1. More information about greenhouse gas emissions is available at the click of a button

Federal energy policy aside, many U.S. states continue to pursue vigorous clean power portfolios. Global firms operating in the U.S. also require information about the sources of electricity flowing through the grid in order to fulfill their clean power commitments.

Responding to these demand-side forces, in 2022 the leading U.S. grid operator MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) launched an online greenhouse emissions dashboard, enabling users to track the carbon intensity of the MISO grid across 15 midwestern and southern states. Last year the organization improved its projections to achieve emissions reporting almost in real time.

MISO is one of several regional operators established in the 1990s to support national grid reliability and resilience. Its territory includes Iowa and other states with a considerable stake in wind energy. Part or all of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin also come under the MISO umbrella, along with a small foothold in Texas.

Even after President Trump took office in January, MISO continued to improve its emissions reporting, launching a new ""Consumed"" feature to the dashboard in March that provides a high level of detail on carbon emission at the user end.

“Increasingly stringent regulations, member goals and customer needs are driving requests for MISO to leverage its operational data to provide credible emissions data estimates,” the organization noted in a recent report on its emissions tracking activities. “Drivers for this interest include meeting and reporting emission reduction goals, creating new tariffs to support end use customer demands, increased visibility for operational decisions making, and information to aid investment decisions.""

2. They said it couldn’t be done, but it can

Another indication of the permanency of the U.S. energy transition comes from the green hydrogen industry. Green hydrogen can be produced from water in electrolysis systems that run on renewable electricity, but it is much more expensive than conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas. Globally, the industry has struggled to find buyers. But industry analysts have identified Texas as one market where green hydrogen can compete against natural gas, partly due to co-location opportunities for combining green hydrogen with waste carbon to produce synthetic liquid fuels called e-fuels or electrofuels. The co-location strategy reduces the considerable cost of transporting hydrogen over long distances.

Energy producers are starting to catch up to this analyst consensus. This month, for example, the leading e-fuels producer Infinium started construction on the new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility near Pecos in West Texas. Electricity to run the facility will come from a new 150-megawatt wind farm.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest e-fuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tons per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other e-fuel products,” Infinium wrote in a press announcement. The company has already enlisted buyers in the aviation industry that are motivated to reduce their dependence on conventional jet fuel, including American Airlines and IAG, the parent of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

The co-location strategy is already at work outside of Texas, too. In Iowa, for example, a solar-powered electrolyzer will supply green hydrogen to produce ammonia fertilizer locally, eliminating long-distance transportation costs. Additionally, the New York startup Ecolectro has introduced a containerized, transportable electrolyzer designed for on-site use in multiple hydrogen-dependent industries including fertilizer and steelmaking as well as e-fuels

3. The call is coming from inside the house

For all of President Trump’s enthusiastic embrace of fossil fuels, his “American Energy Dominance” plan includes three major renewable resources — biomass, geothermal and hydropower — under its protective umbrella. All three represent significant opportunities to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil energy.

In the case of biomass, the effect of that policy protection has been almost immediate. While the Trump administration delayed or abandoned other federally supported renewable energy projects, in February the biofuels firm Montana Renewables received approval to draw $782 million from a $1.44 billion loan guarantee issued by the Department of Energy during the Joe Biden administration.

The funds will enable the firm to expand its existing facility in Great Falls, Montana, that uses biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The drawdown was announced by its parent company, Calumet, which said the expanded facility will be one of the biggest in the world with a capacity of 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

The impact of Trump's energy policy on U.S. hydropower activity will take longer to unfold. New hydropower dams are long-term, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. But federal funding for upgrades and energy-efficiency improvements will enable the hydropower industry to maintain its aging facilities and continue its status as a major contributor to the nation’s renewable energy profile. Hydropower accounts for 27 percent of renewable energy generation in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy. Hydropower can also be used for energy storage in systems that pump water into an elevated reservoir at times of excess power and release it into turbines when power demand is high. Such facilities account for the overwhelming majority of renewable energy storage capacity in the U.S. at 96 percent.

An even more significant impact will be felt in the geothermal industry, as new drilling technology expands the range of geothermal power plants into new regions of the U.S. Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal is available at a constant, steady rate on a 24/7 basis, providing gas power plants with a new source of competition.",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/hydropower%20dam%20in%20North%20Carolina%20%E2%80%94%20renewable%20energy%20in%20the%20US.jpeg?h=ea6a6e00,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:34.601200

Solar developer Silicon Ranch recently agreed to a $500 million deal with Denmark-based AIP Management to bolster the solar company's market position amid political polarization around clean energy.

""Solar isn't just about sustainability anymore — it's about sovereignty,"" reported Industry Leaders.

Funding from AIP Management, an investment company that solely invests in clean energy infrastructure across Europe and North America, is expected ""to accelerate solar development initiatives across rural America, bringing economic and environmental benefits to underserved regions.""

To do this, Silicon Ranch is partnering with local communities and veterans to build the infrastructure, which is expected to create jobs, national independence, and energy availability.

At a time when clean energy companies face uncertainty from the Trump Administration, with the potential for public-private partnerships like the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to be rolled back, foregrounding the promotion of jobs and community independence is a move that can reposition the administration's stance on sustainability investments.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

""By leaning into a narrative of energy dominance, solar firms are making themselves indispensable to any administration, red or blue,"" Industry Leaders continued. ""That might just be the kind of political insulation they need to weather the coming storms.""

Staying up-to-date with these developments can empower small business owners to make decisions that positively impact their operational efficiency and sustainability goals.","As the energy landscape evolves, understanding the metrics of electricity generation becomes increasingly essential for small business owners. Recent analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shines a light on this critical topic, highlighting the nuances between different reports that offer insight into the country’s net electricity generation.

The EIA provides data from two distinct perspectives: the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor and the Electric Power Monthly/Annual reports. While these reports serve a similar purpose—to reflect electricity generation—small business owners must recognize their differences. Understanding these variations is crucial for making informed decisions about energy use and costs.

One significant insight from EIA’s analysis is that net generation figures from the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor may not align with those published in the Electric Power Monthly or Electric Power Annual reports. This discrepancy arises because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor captures only those generating units managed by a balancing authority. These authorities oversee the balance of electricity supply and demand at a regional or local level, which mainly encompasses larger, visible facilities and excludes many smaller resources, like rooftop solar panels.

EIA’s data indicates that for small business owners considering renewable energy solutions, relying solely on the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can lead to an incomplete understanding of potential energy generation. For instance, while a bustling city might be importing energy from large solar farms, the contributions from many smaller, community-based renewable sources may not be accounted for in the monitor’s figures.

“EIA’s Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more comprehensive view of net generation in the United States because they reflect all generation from grid-connected power plants located in the United States with at least 1 MW of nameplate capacity,” explains Jonathan DeVilbiss from the EIA. For small businesses operating in states with significant solar initiatives, this means they may want to consult the broader Electric Power reports to gain a more complete picture of energy generation—including prospective savings from solar investments.

The recent adjustments to the methodology, including a new survey to better account for generators metered by balancing authorities, can offer practical implications for small businesses. By examining the newly published lists of generators reflected in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, small business owners can identify opportunities for energy savings or local renewable energy partnerships.

However, there are challenges to consider. With different authorities potentially reporting overlapping data—like California’s Independent System Operator, which includes plants in Mexico—small business owners must navigate these complexities. Understanding which reports accurately reflect their local energy landscape will allow them to make better decisions about sourcing energy, thereby influencing their operational costs and sustainability efforts.

Real-world applications stemming from this analysis extend beyond just knowing the data; they involve actionable insights. For example, businesses keen on reducing their carbon footprint may take more calculated steps towards investing in solar energy, informed by both the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor and Electric Power reports. Partnering with local utilities that provide insights into generation data can further enhance their energy strategy.

Additionally, business owners may want to attend local energy forums or workshops to understand the current energy landscape and any available programs. This proactive approach not only helps in identifying potential savings but also positions small businesses to better adapt to future shifts in energy policy and technology.

This kind of engagement is vital, especially as energy costs continue to fluctuate. As energy policymakers refine reporting tools and resources, small businesses stand to benefit from remaining vigilant and informed regarding their energy consumption patterns.

Josh Stein on Wednesday voiced strong support for retaining and strengthening the state’s electric vehicle industry. Speaking at an Institute for Emerging Issues forum entitled “Future Forward Energy,” at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, Stein said he has communicated with the state’s congressional delegation about the urgency of keeping tax credits designed to support the EV industry.

U.S. House Republicans passed a budget reconciliation bill last week that would eliminate several tax credits for electric vehicles, a move that advocates say will harm North Carolina’s EV industry.

The cuts would undo tax credits leading to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state, according to nonprofit Electrification Coalition.

“Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” Stein told reporters.

He emphasized the importance of drawing businesses to the state to boost its economy and create jobs.

“Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina,” Stein continued. “We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”

Addressing the conference, Stein spoke about the Energy Saver North Carolina program that he launched with Secretary of Environmental Quality Reid Wilson.

This initiative offers more than $200 million in rebates for income-eligible households for the installation of energy efficient appliances and other products, like heat pumps and insulation.

Stein said the program is an example of moving forward toward a clean energy economy, strengthening the economy, and putting money back into people’s pockets.

“It is about moving forward. That is true nowhere more than western North Carolina,” he said, pointing to the devastation wrought last fall by Hurricane Helene.

Stein added that his administration has been “laser-focused” on helping western North Carolinians recover since his first day in office.

He also addressed the issue of climate change and its effects on the state.

“As we do the difficult work of seeking the federal and state dollars and putting them to work and communities, we cannot ignore the fact that North Carolina is experiencing more extreme weather with increasing frequency,” he said. “As we rebuild our energy infrastructure out west, we must be mindful of the need to adapt to a change in climate and insure greater resiliency for the future.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0786-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:32:43.767683

Stellantis Taps Insider CEO to Forge a New Path in the US Back to video

Article content

The company that built its brands around American heritage has been falling behind in the US market due to an aging lineup, model delays and pricing blunders. To reverse the slump, the automaker on Wednesday named Antonio Filosa its new chief executive officer — a company veteran picked in part because of his US experience. The 51-year-old Italian lives in Michigan, previously ran the Jeep brand and is seen as a less divisive leader than his predecessor, Carlos Tavares.

But Filosa is stepping into an automotive storm. President Donald Trump’s tariff moves are raising costs and upending global supply chains. In Europe, Chinese manufacturers led by BYD Co. are pushing into a stagnant car market, fanning the flames of competition with their low-cost models. Stellantis’ issues are gravest in the former profit center North America, where its shipments cratered 20% in the first quarter after Tavares hamstrung operations with a series of painful cost cuts.

Filosa now needs to set a clear strategy so the company can move forward, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at S&P Global Mobility. “Product is key to all of this,” she said. “It’s going to take time to get Stellantis where they envisioned it would be.”

Despite urgent pressure for change, finding a new CEO took months. Stellantis considered outsiders such as Hyundai CEO José Muñoz and AutoNation boss Mike Manley, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. With key decisions on the company’s future direction stalling, the board led by Chairman John Elkann in recent weeks honed in on Filosa, who beat out another internal candidate, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks were private.

Born in Naples, Italy, Filosa has had a lifelong passion for cars and motorcycles, buying his first Ducati at age 15, and an Alfa Romeo three years later. He joined Fiat in 1999 and later rose through the ranks as a protégé of the late Fiat Chrysler boss Sergio Marchionne. Living most of his professional life outside Italy, Filosa has held positions in Europe, South America and the US.

As Jeep CEO, he launched the long-delayed battery-powered Wagoneer sport utility vehicle just as EV sales were losing steam in the US. He’s now under pressure to rejig the lineup in the country as local drivers gravitate toward hybrids. Filosa took over as chief operating officer for North America in October as part of a broader shake-up in the waning days of Tavares’ tenure.

Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.
In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities.
Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful.
“Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said.","After days of intense political infighting between ultraconservative and moderate Republicans, the House of Representatives voted along party lines on Thursday morning to approve a sweeping tax bill that seeks to eviscerate the heart of landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats just three years ago.

The 2022 climate law on the chopping block—the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA—was the first legislation in more than a decade to attempt to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and was the centerpiece of former president Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, subsidies, and grants to utility companies, automakers, consumers, and others to become more energy-efficient and switch to sources of carbon-free power.

Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that lawmakers in districts receiving this cash would be disincentivized to undo the legislation supplying it, even under an ultraconservative president like Donald Trump. “Repeal is extremely unlikely,” Neil Chatterjee, a former Republican commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill last August titled “The Solar Investment Tax Credit is safe from repeal even if Republicans win in 2024.” In March, 21 House Republicans signed an open letter calling for any changes to the IRA tax credits to “be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion.”

Yet the House voted 215-214 on Thursday to wind down the IRA’s clean energy tax credits ahead of schedule, including the solar investment tax credit that Chatterjee was sure would be safe. Just two Republicans voted against the bill, one voted present, and two abstained—including only one of the March letter’s signatories.

Originally, the incentives were set to continue through at least 2032. Under the House bill, tax credits for all clean energies except for nuclear, which Republicans tend to view favorably, will apply only to projects that break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and begin sending energy to the grid by the end of 2028, a timeline that could seriously undercut the country’s clean energy industry. Federal tax credits to help consumers adopt clean energy technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles would be phased out by the end of this year.

The House bill needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump to become law, and it is likely to change during negotiations in the upper chamber.

Renewable energy developers warn that the House’s timeline for getting projects in service is prohibitively tight and would effectively make some of the tax credits obsolete. “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement.

The repeals would impact major utility-scale projects that are already underway, such as wind projects, said Katrina McLaughlin, an associate on the World Resources Institute’s U.S. energy team, because it takes a long time to get most renewable projects up and running.

“Placed in service means everything has to go right. We have interconnection queue delays, we have permitting delays, there can be challenges with getting different materials and resources,” McLaughlin said. “So getting in service by 2028 is actually a pretty aggressive timeline.”

In the two years since the IRA was passed, analyses show that federal funding has catalyzed more than $400 billion in investments in manufacturing, electric vehicles, hydrogen power, renewable energy, and other green initiatives and spurred more than 400,000 new jobs. Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.

As House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to unite his party behind Trump’s domestic agenda, two warring factions emerged: a far-right coalition focused on attaining deeper spending cuts by slashing the IRA and Medicare, and a moderate group agitating to retain clean energy funding in their districts and increase the cap on how much state and local tax can be deducted from one’s federal taxes—a change that would benefit high earners in blue states.

Unsurprisingly, the lawmaker leading the fight against the IRA comes from an area that hasn’t received much money from it. Representative Chip Roy, leading the ultraconservative crusade, represents a district in Texas that has a little less than a dollar per person in announced IRA investments. Meanwhile, one of his colleagues on the other side of the fight, moderate Republican Representative Nancy Kiggan, comes from a district in Virginia that is slated to receive $85.50 worth of investments per capita.

Republicans represent 18 of the top 20 congressional districts benefiting the most from clean energy investments since the passage of the IRA, according to the research firm Atlas Public Policy. The top three districts on that list, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, had together received nearly $30 billion from the legislation as of March this year. But in the end, all of the Republican lawmakers representing those 18 districts voted in favor of effectively ending the investments. Democrats, whose caucus has shrunk due to the deaths of three members this year, were united in opposition.

In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities. Moderates in high-tax states like New York were willing to use Biden’s tax credits as a bargaining chip for a higher limit on itemized state and local tax deductions—$40,000, up from the current cap of $10,000—a political win, with benefits that those lawmakers could reap immediately, that allowed them to sidestep having to defend legislation passed by a Democratic administration.

Republicans might also be banking on the fact that many of their constituents don’t know about the IRA. A University of Chicago and Associated Press survey last year found that two years after the IRA passed, most Americans had a supremely flawed understanding of what the legislation is and does, if they knew about it at all. Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful. Nearly 40 percent didn’t know enough to weigh in on the EV tax credits and a shocking 15 percent of those polled thought the policy—which gives consumers up to $7,500 for a new plug-in EV—hurt people like them.

According to Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way, part of the problem is that the IRA’s clean energy incentives—like new union jobs and major infrastructure projects—take years to manifest. “Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said. “It’s having a big impact, don’t get me wrong, but it hasn’t become part of the fabric of communities yet in a way that would freak people out if it disappeared.”

On October 4, 2024, the Supreme Court consolidated and granted certiorari in two appeals challenging the license for the Texas facility: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. State of Texas (No.
If the Court rules against the NRC’s licensing authority, nuclear facilities would be forced to continue indefinite on-site storage, and existing off-site storage facilities would face uncertain futures.
The Court’s decision will have implications far beyond nuclear waste storage.","In an effort to address this challenge, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently licensed two private CISFs: one in Andrews County, Texas, and another in Lea County, New Mexico. However, both licenses were invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held that the NRC lacked statutory authority to license private away-from-reactor storage facilities. State v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 95 F.4th 935 (5th Cir. 2024); Fasken Land & Mins., Ltd. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, No. 23-60377, 2024 WL 3175460 (5th Cir. Mar. 27, 2024).

This legal impasse traces back to two key pieces of legislation: the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982. AEA, Pub. L. No. 83-703, 68 Stat. 919 (1954) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 2011–2297h-13); NWPA, Pub. L. No. 97-425, 96 Stat. 2201 (1982) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 10101–10270). The AEA established the foundation for civilian nuclear power development in the United States, authorizing private commercial use of nuclear materials and creating a regulatory framework for nuclear power plants.

While the AEA granted the NRC broad authority over nuclear materials, it did not address nuclear waste management or disposal. This regulatory gap became increasingly problematic as commercial nuclear power expanded, leading Congress to enact the NWPA specifically to address the growing challenge of nuclear waste disposal. However, the NWPA created a significant hurdle by explicitly tying the development of nonfederal interim storage facilities to progress on a permanent geological repository. 42 U.S.C. § 10168(d)(1). This linkage, while perhaps well-intentioned, has effectively prevented the establishment of nonfederal CISFs (federal facilities face separate obstacles). In 1987, Congress amended the NWPA to designate Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the sole site for consideration as a permanent repository. Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, § 5011, 101 Stat. 1330-227, 1330-228 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 10172). However, the project faced substantial opposition from local communities and national stakeholders, impeding its progress. In 2009, President Obama eliminated funding for the Yucca Mountain Project in his budget, effectively halting the initiative and further complicating the path forward for both permanent and interim storage solutions. Blue Ribbon Comm’n on Am.’s Nuclear Future, Report to the Secretary of Energy at vi (Jan. 2012).

As noted above, the Fifth Circuit invalidated two NRC-licensed private CISFs—one in Andrews County, Texas (State v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 95 F.4th 935), and another in Lea County, New Mexico (Fasken Land & Mins., 2024 WL 3175460)—ruling that the NRC lacked statutory authority to license private away-from-reactor storage facilities and creating a circuit split on questions of judicial standing and agency authority. On October 4, 2024, the Supreme Court consolidated and granted certiorari in two appeals challenging the license for the Texas facility: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. State of Texas (No. 23-1300) and Interim Storage Partners LLC v. Texas (No. 23-1312) (collectively, NRC v. Texas).

The case before the Supreme Court presents two interrelated issues of administrative law. The first question is whether the NRC’s authority to license private parties to temporarily store spent nuclear fuel away from reactor sites is lawful under the AEA and NWPA. Second is a jurisdictional question under the Hobbs Act—the exclusive statutory basis for courts to review challenges to AEA licenses. While the Hobbs Act limits judicial review to parties “aggrieved” by an agency proceeding, the Court must decide whether entities can challenge an agency’s statutory authority even if they did not participate in the underlying regulatory proceedings.

Both issues reflect significant splits among the federal circuits. Several circuits have rejected challenges from parties who did not participate in agency proceedings, but the Fifth Circuit held that such ultra vires challenges can proceed when parties claim an agency exceeded its statutory authority. This position conflicts with decisions from the D.C., Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits. Heflin, supra. Similarly, while the D.C. and Tenth Circuits have upheld the NRC’s authority to license private storage facilities, the Fifth Circuit found no such authority in either the AEA or NWPA. Id. The petitioners contend that Congress implicitly approved this authority by remaining silent when passing the NWPA, as the NRC was already licensing temporary away-from-reactor storage facilities at that time.

The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for March 5, 2025, with a decision expected by summer 2025. This timing is critical for nuclear waste management in the United States. With no permanent repository in development, the nuclear power industry faces growing challenges in managing spent fuel storage. If the Court rules against the NRC’s licensing authority, nuclear facilities would be forced to continue indefinite on-site storage, and existing off-site storage facilities would face uncertain futures. Such a ruling would likely require congressional action to establish a new framework for spent fuel management.

The Court’s decision will have implications far beyond nuclear waste storage. While the ruling on NRC’s authority will determine the viability of CISFs as an interim storage solution, the Court’s interpretation of the Hobbs Act will affect judicial review across multiple regulatory domains. By clarifying when parties can challenge federal agency actions, the decision could impact how the public contests orders from agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Transportation. The Court’s resolution of these issues will thus shape both the future of nuclear waste management and the broader landscape of administrative law in the United States.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/photography/16x9/16x9-windmills-4.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:59.300160

Their actions are the latest in a slew of letters and pronouncements from professional organizations asking the federal government not to cut programs and tax credits.

The Energy Star program, which was created by the EPA and Department of Energy under President George H.W. Bush, sets energy-efficiency standards for home appliances. In turn, those that meet the standards can advertise with the program’s logo. Earlier this month, CNN reported that the EPA was planning to shut down Energy Star, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has now said that he hopes to privatize the program.

In response to the news that Energy Star might be shuttered, Consumer Reports, a nonprofit product testing organization, urged the EPA to “find a way to preserve” it.

“If this popular program goes away, it would be a big loss for the millions of consumers who’ve come to recognize and trust the label every time they shop for major products and appliances,” Consumer Reports’ associate director for product sustainability, research, and testing Shanika Whitehurst said in a statement. “The loss would hit especially hard at a time when people are dealing with unpredictable energy bills and trying to cut expenses.”

Consumer Reports also cited a March 2025 study it conducted, stating that 87% of the 2,291 people surveyed agreed that “home appliances for sale in the US should be required to meet minimum levels of energy efficiency.” A recent Retail Brew survey similarly found that nearly 85% of readers surveyed don’t want Energy Star shut down.

Other professional organizations are taking different avenues to pressure the federal government to protect Energy Star. Twelve major real estate and building associations, including The Real Estate Roundtable and American Hotel & Lodging Association, wrote a letter to Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright expressing their support for Energy Star and tied the appliance standards program to the Trump administration’s “all of the above” energy approach.

“Real estate assets rely on the Energy Star buildings program. Energy Star helps the real estate industry benchmark its energy use,” the letter said. “We look forward to working with DOE under your stewardship to achieve the Trump administration’s ‘all of the above’ plan to propel America’s energy dominance, independence, competitiveness, and profitability.”

Additionally, the US Green Building Council is asking its members and the public to contact their congressional representatives and ask them to block the Trump administration’s proposal to end the program—it’s even created a form, phone scripts, and email templates for participants to use.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/f779534ad8305b01a5c377a6211f40ce9090de10-6720x4480.jpg?rect=0,476,6720,3528&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-05-28 15:34:39.312142

The E-Check Ease Act, introduced by state Reps. Bill Roemer (R-Richfield) and Steve Demetriou (R-Bainbridge Township), was incorporated into the state’s biennial transportation budget bill signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine at the end of March.

Under Ohio’s E-Check program, residents in seven counties — Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage and Summit — who own cars that are between 4 and 25 years old are required to have their emissions inspected every two years. A passing inspection is required for vehicle registration in those seven counties.

The proposed change would expand the exemption for newer cars from four years old to six years old. Hybrid vehicles that are seven years old or newer would also be exempt.

The bill also allows vehicle owners to forego inspections entirely and obtain an “alternative emissions certificate” from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, attesting that their car meets state emissions laws “to the best of their knowledge.”

That attestation could be rejected if the EPA determines it was falsified or if the driver was cited in the past two years for excessive exhaust or a noisy muffler, or if their vehicle was in a collision in the prior two years which caused “substantial” internal damage. Rejected owners would then have to get the car inspected.

The Ohio EPA is required to submit the new certification process to the U.S. EPA, which must decide whether it complies with the federal Clean Air Act before it can move ahead. If approved, the Ohio EPA would then implement the state-level changes.

The public comment period for the bill opened earlier this month and runs through June 2. Public comments can be emailed to DAPC-Comments@epa.ohio.gov through then. The Ohio EPA is then expected to respond to the public comments and submit the changes to the U.S. EPA.

“For 30 years, Northeast Ohio has been unfairly burdened by E-Check,” Roemer is quoted in a Wednesday news release. “It is far past time to address this problem, and I encourage citizens to reach out to eviscerate this burden.”

State Rep. Sean Brennan (D-Parma) in a Wednesday news release said the E-Check program “may have been well-intentioned” when it was created in 1996, but there’s no evidence it has actually reduced vehicle emissions since then.

He said drivers actually burn about 600,000 gallons of gas per year just to comply with the mandate.

“The $11 million the state spends would be better spent on conservation education and public transit,” he is quoted in the release.",https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/04/echeck.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-28 17:17:11.796562

That was arguably one of the biggest lessons from President Donald Trump’s against-the-odds election to a second term.

From roads, to airports, to mining facilities, to manufacturing plants — we need to start building things in America again. And we need to apply that same pro-development attitude towards the most important, yet too often ignored, infrastructure system in our country: the power grid.

On this question, Nevada is a leader. Today in Lyon County, a major expansion of the Churchill Power Substation is taking place. When complete, the Churchill facility will become one of the largest electrical substations in the world and play a pivotal role in a much larger upgrade of Nevada’s power grid.

When connected to the existing One Nevada transmission line in the eastern part of our state, the two new transmission lines will form a triangle between Las Vegas, Reno and Ely.

This $4.2 billion upgrade to the state’s power grid — known as the Greenlink project — will allow for power generation investments in rural Nevada to expand, bringing jobs and tax revenues to parts of the state that badly need both.

At the same time, major population centers like Las Vegas and Reno will gain access to more secure, affordable and reliable sources of electricity to power homes and businesses. In particular, solar power — our state’s most plentiful resource and the cheapest technology for generating electricity today — will play a major role.

In effect, Nevada’s power grid upgrades will allow energy resources that are currently stranded in rural areas to be sold to the cities and suburbs where that energy is in greatest demand. Think of these new transmission lines like highways for electricity to be moved from where it’s produced to where it’s consumed.

Nevada isn’t the only state where this kind of investment is badly needed, of course. Across the country, the power grid is showing its age, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Seventy percent of the transmission lines that make up the grid are more than 25 years old and are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifespan.

“This has major consequences on our communities: power outages, susceptibility to cyber-attacks, or community emergencies caused by faulty grid infrastructure,” the DOE warns.

It’s clear that upgrading the grid, as Nevada is doing, is an example the rest of the country needs to follow for reasons of safety and security. But there are compelling economic reasons, too.

For example: Here in the West, decisions about electrical infrastructure are mostly made at the level of individual states. But if other states coordinated with Nevada, by expanding and upgrading their grids to connect rural communities with an energy surplus to urban centers with an energy deficit, the result would be a more efficient system that saves people money.

According to researchers at the University of California San Diego, Nevada and 10 other Western states could save consumers up to $3.25 billion per year just by working more closely on the planning and construction of transmission lines, power plants and other pieces of major electrical infrastructure.

Importantly, the researchers found that the closer coordination needed to deliver these savings did not require the creation of a single, regional electricity market — a complex political, technical and legal process that would take many years to accomplish.

The end result could be a multi-state power grid, anchored by Nevada’s leadership, providing more reliable electricity at a more affordable cost — and all the while generating more construction projects, jobs, investment and tax revenues to rural communities across the West.

If there was ever a time to make this happen, it’s during President Trump’s second term. Let’s go build the energy future we deserve, for Nevada and the rest of the West.

Multiple democrats debated for a shot to replace late-Rep. Raúl Grijalva

Grijalva daughter would continue her late father’s progressive agenda

All candidates say Democrats need to fight

Daniel Hernandez says the newest member of Congress needs to be someone who pays less attention to environmental concerns and more to the jobs these sometimes-controversial projects create.

But the question remains whether that reflects who Democrats want to be their standard bearer in the special election this summer to replace ardent environmental advocate Raúl Grijalva who they repeatedly elected to the U.S. House.

“When people are struggling to make ends meet, they need someone who will stand up to make sure they have good wages, protections for their families, and make sure that they have a job to be able to go to,” said the former state lawmaker during a debate May 27 hosted by KAET-TV, the Phoenix PBS affiliate. He is one of five Democratic candidates in the July 15 special primary.

Whoever survives will face off on Sept. 23 against the winner of the Republican primary. But the Democratic nominee starts off with a huge advantage of about 176,000 adherents compared with fewer than 93,000 Republicans in the district that stretches from Douglas through Nogales into parts of Pinal and Maricopa counties and west to Yuma.

Hernandez made it clear he supports mining projects like the plan by South32 to extract critical minerals in the Patagonia Mountains, a massive copper mine by Hudbay in the Santa Rita Mountains, and even a proposal to build a new Interstate 11, including a stretch that will run through environmentally sensitive portions of Pima County.

That brought him into sharp contrast with Adelita Grijalva ,who is not only a former Pima County supervisor, but also Raúl’s daughter. And she made it clear she does not see the claimed benefits to Arizona from the projects, saying the profits from digging out the ore are being shipped elsewhere.

“And what’s left in the aftermath is environmental destruction,” she said. Grijalva specifically criticized the plans for a new copper mine at Oak Flat, a project that survived a challenge when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider concerns by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others that the land was necessary for their ceremonies.

And if the message about what voters could expect wasn’t crystal clear, she said she was going to follow in her father’s footsteps.

“I am going to be another Grijalva,” she said. “I don’t think you can be too progressive when you’re on the right side of history.”

Hernandez found himself – and his position on jobs versus the environment – to be in the minority of Democratic contenders. Even Jose Malvido, whose father was a union organizer at Phelps Dodge in Ajo when the miners went on strike in 1983, said much has been lost as environmental concerns were brushed aside in the name of economic development.

“I grew up in a copper mining town where sacred sites were reduced into a giant mine pit,” he said. “It put food on the table, but at what cost?”

Inventor and former business owner Patrick Harris acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs. At the same time, he said, it does destroy the environment.

But for him, the question is a bit different, he said. Where do the profits go?

“Those are short-term jobs,” Harris said.

“That profit is being siphoned out of the district,” he continued. “There are good paying jobs that can be brought into the district.”

And Deja Foxx said that from her perspective – she is 25 – not enough has been done until now to protect the environment that was supposed to be preserved for her generation.

“Every year we see summers get hotter here in Arizona, get longer because of the inaction of older generations,” she said.

“Climate change is not theoretical to my generation,” Foxx continued. “We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.”

But Grijalva found herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.

The contenders were each asked about the wisdom of Republicans in Washington who say that reducing taxes is good for the economy and, more to the point, whether Democrats, who have found themselves losing ground politically, should also consider a reduction.

Hernandez responded that the difference is that Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working class families. Or “most Democrats.”

“The reality is people like Adelita tried to raise taxes just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Tucson,” Hernandez said, referring to a plan on the ballot to increase the sales tax by half a cent. “When we are in the height of inflation and people are hurting, the height of being out of touch was trying to raise people’s taxes.”

It failed by a margin of more than 2-1.

“What we have is a problem where out-of-touch politicians who spent almost two decades in office forget what it’s like to be able to buy groceries at the grocery store, and know what it’s like to have to put something back,” Hernandez said.

Grijalva was unapologetic for backing the proposed levy, saying that not just Tucson but Pima County have had to absorb more costs to provide government services even as the Republican-controlled Legislature was imposing a flat 2.5% income tax. Local governments get a piece of that levy.

“So the needs continue but the revenue decreased,” she said, saying that the cost of these local needs must be shared by federal and state government.

“You’re still trying to raise people’s taxes in the height of inflation,” Hernandez responded.

Foxx took her own shots at Grijalva, describing her own fight years ago with the board of the Tucson Unified School District – the board on which Grijalva served – over its sex education curriculum. Foxx said it had not been updated in decades, was medically inaccurate, and never mentioned things like consent.

Grijalva said afterward that the board already had been looking at making changes when Foxx made her complaints but could not do anything until state law was changed.

If there was a central theme to the debate – aside from the obligatory criticism by each contender of President Trump – it was the question of why Democrats are faring poorly among voters. Foxx said part of that is Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.

“We require activists,” Foxx said.

“They don’t know how to fight,” Harris said of Democrats. “They don’t have a strategy.”

Malvido agreed that Democrats are not fighting back hard enough against President Trump.

“We need to have the courage to really address issues and not worry about the big money people that also fund the Democratic campaigns,” he said.

“A lot of Democrats, career politicians, all they really want to do is get elected,” Malvido said. “So they’re not really going to address the issues and have the courage to fight in the way we need them to fight, especially now.”

Hernandez said the issue for voters goes beyond whether the Democrats are fighting hard enough.

“It’s that we’re not delivering results,” he said.

“You elect people time and time again and yet they come back every two years and they say, ‘We weren’t able to do that because that other person was in charge, but elect us and we’ll do it again next time,’ ” Hernandez said. “People are tired of empty promises.”

One position that did stand out was Harris’ proposal for what he called “capitated capitalism.”

In essence, it would cap individual wealth at $1 billion. And anyone whose assets exceeded that at the end of any year would have to make use of that through things like investing in research.

All that spending, he said, would help stimulate the economy.

“I’m the only one with an economic plan to fund our shared priorities,” Harris said.

As drafted, the Bill includes proposed tax law changes that would have sweeping effects across many of the renewable energy tax credit provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (such proposed changes, the Proposal).1 The Proposal’s most significant proposed changes include:

an extension of time for a taxpayer to be eligible for clean fuel production tax credits (PTCs);

elimination of the clean electricity investment tax credits (ITCs) and PTCs for qualified facilities that (1) do not begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment or (2) are not placed in service by December 31, 2028;

a phased-in elimination of credit transferability under Section 6418, with transferability of carbon capture PTCs being eliminated for projects that begin construction more than two years after the Bill’s enactment and transferability of advanced manufacturing and clean fuels PTCs being eliminated beginning in 2028;

eliminating tax credits after 2025 for commercial and residential electric vehicles (with a phase-down depending on volume of cars sold), residential solar systems for individuals, charging stations, hydrogen, and energy efficient homes; and

imposing certain foreign supply chain and ownership restrictions on taxpayers seeking ITCs and PTCs.

Notably, the Proposal — at least in its current form — does not propose to amend provisions related to PTCs under Section 45 or ITCs under Section 48.

The Bill now heads to the Senate, which is expected to revise the Bill, potentially including certain aspects of the Proposal. As a result, the Proposal, including the provisions detailed below, are subject to further revision, and potentially significant changes, as the Bill moves through the legislative process.

If the Proposal is passed in its current form, the following impacts should be considered:

Taxpayers sourcing materials and components from China must analyze their supply chain and non-U.S. ownership structure to evaluate ongoing ITC/PTC eligibility.

Taxpayers utilizing Sections 45Y and 48E must ensure (1) that they begin construction on their qualified facility within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment and (2) that such qualified facility is placed in service prior to January 1, 2029.

Taxpayers utilizing Sections 45Q, 45X and 45Z must consider alternatives to transferability in certain instances, with additional pressure on 45Z due to its general inability to access “direct pay.”

Taxpayers utilizing Section 45Q and seeking to utilize transferability as a source of monetization should begin construction prior to the second anniversary of the Bill’s enactment.

Key Proposals Affecting Renewable Tax Credits

Foreign Entity Of Concern (FEOC) Proposals

Historically, direct or indirect ownership by certain individuals and entities incorporated in, or with a strong nexus to, China, North Korea, Russia or Iran (each, a FEOC or a “covered nation”) jeopardized tax credit availability under the clean vehicle and advanced microchip tax credits. The Proposal would introduce new complicated FEOC restrictions that could limit taxpayers’ access to the (1) clean electricity ITCs and PTCs, (2) carbon capture PTCs, and (3) advance manufacturing and clean fuels PTCs. The earliest of these restrictions would first apply in 2026, with even more onerous FEOC restrictions applying beginning in 2028.2

In general, the proposed FEOC restrictions are in two categories: (1) an ownership- and control-based approach (the Ownership and Control Approach), and (2) a supply chain-based approach (the Supply Chain Approach).

FEOC Ownership and Control Considerations (Applied to Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E)

The Ownership and Control Approach would first apply beginning in 2026. Under the Ownership and Control Approach, any taxpayer that is a “specified foreign entity” would be precluded from claiming ITCs and PTCs.

The Proposal would define a “specified foreign entity” as any (1) covered nation, (2) entity that is 50% or more owned by a covered nation, (3) entity that is organized or has its principal place of business in a covered nation, (4) entity that benefits from Uyghur forced labor in the production of its products or (5) entity that is 50% or more owned by certain battery manufacturers (e.g., CATL, BYD, Envision Energy, Hithium, etc.).

In addition, beginning in 2028, any “foreign influenced entity” would be precluded from claiming ITCs or PTCs. The Proposal would define a “foreign-influenced entity” to include cases where: (1) a specified foreign entity (a) can appoint a covered officer to the taxpayer, (b) holds 10% of the equity (25% if two or more specified entities hold equity), or (c) holds 25% or more of the entity’s debt; or (2) in the prior taxable year, 10% of certain payments, including compensation, were knowingly made by the taxpayer to the specified foreign entity (or 25% of all payments if payments are made to multiple specified foreign entities).3

FEOC Supply Chain Considerations (Applied to Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E)

Under the Supply Chain Approach, a taxpayer would be precluded from claiming certain credits if the taxpayer received “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” This FEOC restriction would apply to (1) the ITC under Section 48E and the PTC under Section 45Y with respect to a facility for which construction begins after December 31, 2025, if the construction received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., since such facility would not be a “qualified facility”), and (2) the PTC under Section 45X, for taxable years starting two years after the Bill’s enactment.

The Proposal would define a “prohibited foreign entity” as any entity that is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-influenced entity.” And “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” would mean, with respect to property, (1) that a prohibited foreign entity provided, extracted, assembled, processed, recycled or manufactured any components, subcomponents or critical minerals (within the meaning of Section 45X) included in the property, and (2) that the property was manufactured using a prohibited foreign entity’s copyright, patent, know-how or trade secret.4

Significant Treasury and IRS guidance would be needed to understand the impact of the FEOC rules on taxpayers seeking to monetize their tax credits.

If the Proposal’s FEOC provisions are passed in current form, taxpayers sourcing materials and components from China (or other covered nations) would need to ensure they have an intimate understanding of their supply chain to ensure compliance with the FEOC rules.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing) Proposals

The Proposal would phase out the advanced manufacturing PTC for eligible components sold after December 31, 2031. This would eliminate the final year of eligibility that under current law is eligible for 25% of the base PTC. The PTC also would be terminated for wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The Proposal also would repeal the transferability of the advanced manufacturing credit for components sold after December 31, 2027.

If the Proposal is passed in current form, tax equity markets may be difficult to access for the Section 45X credit when transferability is repealed; as a result, taxpayers should consider financing options using direct pay — which, under the Proposal would still be available for five years — as the source to pay down debt or provide a return on equity.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuels) Proposals

The Proposal would make several technical changes to the clean fuel production credit and extend it through 2031.

Beginning in 2026, the Proposal would limit the Section 45Z credit to transportation and sustainable aviation fuels produced from feedstocks grown or produced in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. This proposed reform echoes prior guidance from the IRS, which commented on the difficulty of confirming the suitability and greenhouse gas emissions associated with foreign used cooking oil feedstocks. The Proposal also proposes to exclude greenhouse gas emissions from “indirect land use change” from the calculation of the Section 45Z credit.

The Proposal would eliminate transferability for any Section 45Z credits associated with clean fuels produced after 2027.

Given the lack of tax equity market for Section 45Z credits, and absent a corresponding extension to transferability, it is unclear whether the proposed extension to Section 45Z would provide a meaningful economic incentive to clean fuel producers after 2027.

Section 45Q (Carbon Capture and Sequestration) Proposals

The Proposal would (1) retain the availability of Section 45Q credits for qualified facilities that start construction prior to January 1, 2033, and (2) repeal transferability for Section 45Q credits if a qualified facility does not begin construction within two years of the Bill’s enactment. In addition, the Bill proposes to apply the FEOC ownership and economic-based rules discussed above.

If the Proposal is passed in current form, taxpayers seeking to monetize Section 45Q credits through transferability should ensure they begin construction on their carbon capture equipment within two years of enactment, since the proposed repeal of transferability for Section 45Q credits would negatively impact those associated with carbon capture equipment that begins construction after that date. Taxpayers claiming the Section 45Q credits for carbon capture equipment with respect to which construction begins on a later date could still consider financing options using direct pay — which, under the Proposal would still be available for five years — as the source to pay down debt or provide a return on equity.

Sections 48E (Technology-Neutral ITC) and 45Y (Technology-Neutral PTC) Proposals

The Proposal would eliminate the Section 48E ITC and the Section 45Y PTC for any qualified facility that (1) does not begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment or (2) is placed in service after December 31, 2028. The Proposal does not include any transferability restrictions with respect to these credits.

Under the Proposal, the Section 48E ITC and the Section 45Y PTC would be unavailable for any investment during the taxable year with respect to certain qualified properties under Section 25D (solar electric property, solar water heating property or small wind energy property) if (1) the taxpayer rents or leases such property to a third party during the taxable year and (2) the lessee would qualify for the Section 25D credit if the lessee owned the leased property. In addition, the FEOC rules discussed above would apply to taxpayers seeking to claim Section 48E ITCs and Section 45Y PTCs.

With respect to the Section 48E ITC, the Proposal would include a 10-year recapture period if a “specified taxpayer” makes certain “applicable payments” within the recapture period. “Applicable payments” would include certain payments (including compensation) made by a taxpayer claiming the Section 48E ITC in 2028 to a prohibited foreign entity that is greater than or equal to 5% of total expenditures related to the credit generating activity (or 15% of all expenditures if payment is made to multiple prohibited foreign entities).

If the Proposal is passed in current form, taxpayers constructing qualified facilities for the 48E ITC or the 45Y PTC (including accessing transferability) would need to begin construction within 60 days after the Bill’s enactment and place the facility in service before 2029.

Under the Proposal, projects that commenced construction in 2024 and currently are eligible for ITCs under Section 48 or PTCs under Section 45 should retain such eligibility. Those projects generally would need to be placed in service by the end of 2028 to satisfy the start of construction safe harbor. If placed in service after 2028, they would need to satisfy continuous construction requirements.

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen) Proposals

The Proposal would terminate the clean hydrogen PTC under Section 45V for clean hydrogen production facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Additionally, the Proposal would allow publicly traded partnerships to treat income from the transportation or storage of liquified or compressed hydrogen as “qualifying” income.

How does the ORD contribute to public health efforts?
Among the various ORD research centers, the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment investigates the health impacts of the numerous contaminants infiltrating our air, water, waste, and ecosystems.
For example, for a city to measure the amount of lead in its drinking water, its public water system would need to use an EPA-approved testing procedure.
But when it comes to public health goals, that can spawn major conflicts of interest.","The nation’s corps of federal health researchers is under siege. Drastic budget cuts, reorganizations, and reductions in force (RIFs) are hollowing out the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD) to meet Administrator Lee Zeldin’s goal of slashing his agency’s budget by 65 percent.

The proposed plan would terminate 50 to 75 percent of ORD staff and reassign remaining employees to other positions. In the words of one agency scientist, whose position will be eliminated in July, this decision is “lobotomizing our agency” by cutting away much of its scientific brain trust.

Specifically, the EPA is ushering out a wide swath of biologists, chemists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, emergency response specialists, engineers, and other experts who focus on protecting some of our most basic human rights: clean air, safe drinking water, a healthy home.

Through the research of these public scientists, the ORD has been critical to the implementation of such major laws as the Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Superfund program, which helps clean up toxic waste sites. The office provides up-to-date regulatory guidance and data to inform decisions on everything from how hazardous waste gets disposed to which emerging contaminants must be regulated.

Public health advocates like NRDC senior scientist Jennifer Sass point out that this loss at the EPA would leave a dangerous vacuum. It’s one that the government could fill “through expanding collaborations with chemical manufacturers,” she says, funneling our tax dollars into polluter-biased research.

How does the ORD contribute to public health efforts?

The ORD is the EPA’s largest office, and its span of work is massive. Among the various ORD research centers, the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment investigates the health impacts of the numerous contaminants infiltrating our air, water, waste, and ecosystems.

“They’re looking for answers to questions like, does this chemical cause cancer?” explains Erik D. Olson, NRDC’s senior strategic director for health. “If it causes cancer, what’s its potency? Can it cause reproductive problems? Developmental problems in kids? And then they come up with health risk values of that substance for human health.”

For instance, ORD scientists have been evaluating decades of research on the health effects of inhaling formaldehyde, a chemical compound that can be found in furniture and building materials, pesticides, insulation, car exhaust, and tobacco smoke. Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, but the scientists’ assessment concluded that it was even more harmful than previously thought, particularly in children and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

The office has also been looking at per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), “forever chemicals” that are now widespread in our daily lives. Studies show that PFAS can cause cancer, harm the development of fetuses and children, and pose other health hazards. But it wasn’t until last year that the EPA decided to restrict six of these chemicals in our drinking water. ORD’s research on PFAS toxicity, treatment, and destruction has been integral to the agency’s evaluations of many of these ubiquitous chemicals.

Public health advocates like Olson, who have been sounding the alarm on the dangers of PFAS for years, were hopeful that continuing ORD research would lead to tighter controls for the chemicals in all the places we encounter them. Instead, the EPA now plans to repeal its regulations for four types of PFAS and delay the restrictions of the remaining two.

There are hundreds of PFAS chemicals in use, many of which contaminate our water and air, and right now, EPA methods only test for 29 in drinking water, just scratching the surface. Without the ORD, there won’t be a standard way to monitor the vast majority of these toxic chemicals in the environment. The department’s researchers have also played a central role in developing methods to destroy harmful chemicals—especially pertinent for PFAS, given that they, as Olson notes, are almost indestructible.

“There will be a gaping hole in our safety net for protecting citizens,” Olson says. “Not only will we not be able to detect a lot of them, but we also won’t be able to figure out how to control them using up-to-date technology.”

And just how do the regional staff in all these places engage with their communities? Scientists working in the Duluth, Minnesota, lab participate in an annual educational program for students. Staffers in Corvallis, Oregon, worked with local farmers to demonstrate how to prevent water pollution while increasing crop production. And in 2024, the ORD signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chickasaw Nation to increase collaboration opportunities at the lab in Ada, Oklahoma, for sustainably managing groundwater resources.

Beyond the research that ORD scientists conduct, they also provide technical advice for local governments and industries on how to control, detect, and address environmental problems. For example, for a city to measure the amount of lead in its drinking water, its public water system would need to use an EPA-approved testing procedure. By standardizing these methods, the EPA ensures the whole country is using the same measuring stick, and that it is accurate and reliable.

The alternative is that scientific research is left up to individual states—a dangerous proposition that both Olson and Sass point out. Very few states have the capacity to take over the research that the EPA would do or to ensure municipalities are correctly implementing major environmental laws.

“Without these scientists, there won’t be anyone left to do the work,” says Sass, adding that there will be economic impacts to these cuts as well. “Businesses and industries save money when their workers are healthy—and alive! Without these research arms of our federal government, we’re creating this huge knowledge gap that will only get bigger over the next four years.”

Filling the public research vacuum: for-profit science

With increasingly fewer opportunities to conduct research for federal agencies—and now for federally funded universities, to boot—scientists may have to look elsewhere. That may mean working for groups with private interests. But when it comes to public health goals, that can spawn major conflicts of interest. “Often, it’s EPA science that will prove something as a problem, while industry science will miraculously claim everything they produce is safe,” Olson says.

In a recent op-ed she wrote for Scientific American, Sass highlighted the consequences that industry-biased science can have on driving misinformation about health threats. In 2016, after nearly a decade of research, the EPA found that the cancer risk from ethylene oxide exposure—such as from working at a facility that makes the chemical, working at medical sterilization facility that uses the chemical, or living near these polluting facilities—was 30 percent higher than previously thought. Sass writes that rather than accept this finding, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued its own alternative report on the chemical based on industry-funded science, which failed to fully account for the risk of cancer and could end up allowing more than 3,000 times more air pollution to be emitted from these facilities.

As Sass points out, we’ve seen this before from industry groups. Take Big Tobacco, which, in the face of rising cancer concerns in the 1950s, began funding its own research with the aim of allaying fears and keeping profits up. Similarly, the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade association for chemical companies, has long used flawed scientific methods to undermine existing and potential rules for harmful compounds. Among the misleading PR campaigns for toxic substances spearheaded by the ACC are those for BPA, flame retardants, and formaldehyde.

“By going after science and research, this administration is attacking our nation’s brain trust,” Sass says. At its core, publically funded investigative research teaches us more about how the world works, she adds. It’s also an indispensable part of protecting our very lives.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/oil-refinery-highway-traffic-pollution-residential-homes-detroit-2201136693.jpg?h=bb2c13f3&itok=OMk6QZTM,N,,2025-05-28 14:14:53.164529

The moves tee up the U.S. EPA to nix the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which would have required 75% of Class 8 trucks sold in the state to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2035.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin hailed the actions, noting Congressional Review Act rules mean that California can't seek substantially similar rules again in the future through an EPA waiver.

""We are glad to see that Congress recognized the truth, that EPA’s California waivers are rules that would create a negative impact on all Americans by driving up costs while limiting consumer choice, and acted accordingly,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

Besides the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, Congress also revoked waivers for California’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule and its Heavy-Duty Engine Omnibus NOx rule.

California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph called Congress's move ""unconstitutional, illegal and foolish,"" in a statement following the vote. She promised more action in the coming days and said the state agency would continue working with truck manufacturers on zero-emissions vehicles.

""California will pursue every available remedy to challenge these actions and defend our right to protect the public from dangerous air pollution. Turning the clock back on both cleaner combustion engine requirements and zero-emission technology is an attack on clean air,"" Randolph said.

The Advanced Clean Trucks rule had caught on in other states as a more ambitious transition timeline than that set by the federal government. Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington incorporated the requirements in the 2025 model year, according to the RV Industry Association.

Yet each of those states has debated or passed legislation delaying implementation of the ACT rule, as manufacturers have warned they won't meet the necessary production quotas.

The end of ACT comes after California backed off the waiver request process for a similar rule, Advanced Clean Fleets. If implemented, ACF would have set additional strict transition timelines for fleet owners rather than vehicle manufacturers, with dates dependent on fleet type.

Veronica Pardo, executive director of the Resource Recovery Coalition of California, said via email that waste fleet owners will likely feel ""some relief knowing they have a little more time to ultimately comply with California’s push to zero emission fleets."" But she noted it's still too early to discern direct effects.

Eric Evans, chief product officer at New Way Trucks, said the waiver revocation “doesn’t necessarily shift our focus as a refuse body manufacturer.” New Way previously partnered with Hyzon on hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles and is developing other near- or zero-emissions vehicles.

Fossil fuels are the leading cause of energy grid blackouts. As the climate crisis worsens, America’s rising energy demand and increasingly frequent extreme weather events are leading to more energy grid blackouts. Some are quick to point the finger at renewable energy, however, renewable energy has actually become more reliable than traditional fossil fuel-based energy in recent years.

Take Winter Storm Elliott in 2022—where failing gas plants were responsible for 70 percent of its forced outages and coal was responsible for 16 percent, while wind production remained high during the storm. In places like New England, the winds blow strongest when temperatures are the coldest, and therefore, when the heating needs are greatest.

2. Investing in clean energy creates jobs and opportunities

The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act sparked a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and production across the country. In just two years, the 2022 clean energy tax credits included in this legislation spurred $450 billion in private investments that created over 400,000 new jobs in the clean energy sector.

A good portion of these investments have been in rural areas—bringing over $56 billion in investment and 64,943 jobs to those communities across 32 states. These aren’t just numbers on a page, they represent additional income for landowners, tax revenue for local economies, and new career growth opportunities for families that work in manufacturing, construction, and operations.

3. Expanding renewable energy leads to cleaner air, water, and a safer climate across the country

The connection has never been more clear. Burning fossil fuels releases dangerous levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and along with it, a combination of chemicals that form particulate matter. These particles cause respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, premature death, aggravated asthma, and cancer. Air pollution also poses a significant threat to wildlife, impacting their health, reproduction, and survival, as well as the ecosystems they inhabit.

Unlike finite fossil fuels that are being depleted at a rapid rate, solar, wind, and next-generation geothermal are renewable resources that don’t emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants when operating.

That means no pollution seeping into our air and water or heating our planet. Even when comparing to the total life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels including extraction, manufacturing, and construction, renewables still emit much less than fossil fuels. For example, from cradle to grave, coal-fired electricity releases 20 times more GHGs per kilowatt-hour than solar or wind.

4. Expanding renewable energy will boost American prosperity, security, and independence

Investing in clean energy will make America’s energy system more secure and competitive in the global economy. The cost of wind and solar has already fallen over the past decade, making them the most affordable new electricity sources and good sources of state and local taxes, contributing roughly $1.4 billion every year.

Based on current trends, China is set to account for almost 60 percent of all renewables capacity worldwide over the next five years. The only way to maintain American leadership and outcompete other countries is to diversify our energy system—which includes the expansion of renewables and an updated energy grid that can support our demand.

The United States must secure our energy independence, protect our grid, and increase our domestic supply of reliable, affordable, carbon-free energy sources. We are currently too reliant on energy from overseas that is subject to global price fluctuations and geopolitics. Investing in clean energy manufacturing helps bring supply chains back to the U.S. and grow quality, American jobs.

5. Fossil fuels are expensive

Artificially low prices of oil and gas are dependent on heavy subsidies from the American taxpayers. Although subsidies can reduce the cost of living and cost of oil and gas in the short term, the government may need to raise taxes, acquire more debt, and reduce spending on other public services in order to give those subsidies to corporations.

The reality is that the American people pay for fossil fuel subsidies, $750 billion in 2022 alone. So are they really making things more affordable? Not when you also take into account the health issues caused by air pollution or the economic losses of air pollution—$790 billion per year or around five percent of GDP.

6. Clean energy helps people and wildlife

Renewable energy offers an unmatched opportunity to help meet the challenge of climate change by reducing fossil fuel side effects: carbon dioxide emissions. Through responsible siting, advanced mitigation measures, and ongoing environmental monitoring, we can ensure that renewable energy sources support clean energy goals while protecting wildlife and local ecosystems.

By responsibly developing renewable energy, we can both protect habitats and address climate change by advocating for avoidance and risk reduction measures like limiting activities during peak wildlife migration times, using innovative technology, and thorough environmental review of possible siting and development impacts.",https://blog.nwf.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/11/files/2025/05/pexels-thomas-shockey-DeKalb-IL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:13:54.999195

Long, snaking rail cars full of coal from Wyoming were poised to lurch to a halt this weekend. About 250 workers at the facility were slated to be shuffled around to Consumers Energy operations elsewhere in the state.

In a win for Republicans and local advocates that pushed the local “Save the Campbell” campaign, Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday ordered the aging 1,560-megawatt coal plant to remain operational, at least through this summer, to avoid any possible capacity shortfalls or what he warned was a “risk of blackouts.” Fueling that push are rolling outages in Louisiana this week, partly because the Midwest grid operator was short on generation and transmission amid a bruising spring heat wave.

“I hereby determine that an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy, a shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy, and other causes,” Wright declared.

Michigan has emerged as a test case for Trump’s first official move to buoy a struggling coal plant based on a rationale — the declaration of a national energy emergency — that critics say is questionable. Conservatives who pushed for Trump to intervene while flagging reliability concerns are now calling on Wright to extend the emergency order and keep the Campbell plant intact beyond Aug. 21. They’re also calling on the administration to block the closure of other coal-fired power plants, including the Monroe facility that pumps power into Detroit and the surrounding area, which is slated to close in 2032.

“Monroe is twice the size of Campbell,” said Republican state Rep. Dave Prestin. “Out of every one of the massive power plants in Michigan, Monroe would probably be the biggest one that I would be very, very upset with if we tore it down because of its impact.”

But the administration’s temporary orders won’t easily reverse the factors fueling coal’s demise, from cheap gas to waning demand and national shift to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Nationally, power generators are plowing ahead with plans to shutter more than 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by the end of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, though that figure is slightly exaggerated because it includes several plants that have delayed retirement plans. That includes Consumers Energy’s plan to close the Campbell plant 15 years ahead of schedule.

Consumers Energy, Democratic leaders like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and environmental groups have argued the closure is part of the long-planned evolution of Michigan’s power sector, one that delivers electricity without the planet warming pollution. They also say the move is poised to save Consumers’ customers more than $600 million. At the same time, Trump is taking aim at state-level climate and energy regulations. Whitmer has vowed to fight, declaring earlier this month at a conference in Detroit: “I’m not abandoning our climate goals.”

Greg Wannier, a senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said Trump’s invocation of the Federal Power Act is “an illegal abuse” of his presidential authority, one that will saddle the public with higher costs, and outdated and deadly technology. The region’s grid operator, Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) — not Trump — is responsible for safeguarding the system and concluded years ago that the plant could retire without triggering reliability problems, he said.

Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, has said regulators will work with MISO and Consumers to assess and comply with the DOE order, but criticized the directive as costly and unnecessary, and said Michigan produces more energy than it needs.

“I think it’s a difficult case to make that there is, in fact, this local energy need that can only be met through the extension of that plant,” Scripps told POLITICO’s E&E News.

Norm Kapala, vice president of generation operations for Consumers Energy, said the decision to shutter the Campbell plant was reached through a yearslong, collaborative process overseen by the state of Michigan.

Consumers Energy has said it has enough gas capacity to ensure reliability and that closing the power plant aligns with Whitmer’s ambitious plan to phase out coal by 2025 and completely shift to renewables, gas and other energy sources by 2040.

“It really is the best decision,” Kapala said. “We know that reliability is paramount to our customers.”

‘Come and say their goodbyes’

The J.H. Campbell plant has been churning out power for more than six decades on a rural stretch of land near Lake Michigan marked by dense forests, hiking trails, boat launches, blueberry farms, and a smattering of houses and antique shops.

The boxy, beige building and its towering smoke stacks — named after James H. Campbell, a former president of the utility who built the state’s first nuclear reactor — has been a staple of the community for generations, and a source of jobs and revenue.

The plant also has a national reach. Down the road, rail cars filled to the brim with piles of coal from the Powder River Basin in the West are parked on tracks, waiting to be unloaded.

The plant’s closure represents a blow to the Black Thunder mine, the country’s second-largest coal mine. Campbell is the Black Thunder’s fifth-largest consumer of coal over the last decade, having received more than 23 million tons of coal from the mine on Wyoming’s high plains between 2015 and 2024, according to a review by POLITICO’s E&E News of U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Black Thunder is operated by Core Natural Resources.

Consumers Energy has been preparing for the plant’s closure, offering hourlong bus tours for locals to say goodbye. Visitors donning hard hats have funneled into buses to get a peek at the 2,000-acre site, complete with a tour of the plant and an elevator ride up to the fourth-floor turbine deck, where the steam created by coal-heated water turns weighty turbines, generating electricity.

“Our community does want to come and say their goodbyes,” Kapala told a local Fox News affiliate during a tour late last year.

Consumers opted to close the Campbell plant years ahead of schedule as part of a state-level legal process filed in 2021 — and approved a year later — that requires companies to create a path for meeting demand while complying with state environmental goals.

Scripps with the MPSC explained utilities in the state are required to file such plans every five years, including demand projections. The commission also has the ability to call on utilities to come in earlier if demand changes significantly and they feel the plan is inadequate. What’s more, Scripps said utilities have to project demand out four years and show they’ve got sufficient resources in place.

As part of the settlement, Consumers was also required to buy a gas plant in Covert County, extend the life of gas- and oil-burning units, add 75 MW of storage by 2027, 550 MW of storage by 2040, 8,000 MW of solar by 2040 and a one-time solicitation for an additional 700 MW of generation by 2025.

Scripps said the state has yet to see a spike in demand from data centers that’s often cited in calls for coal-fired generation to remain intact. If that does happen, he said the state and utilities have the ability to act early.

“Unlike a lot of other instances where plants have retired and there essentially was no plan, this one went through a fairly sophisticated, integrated resource planning process,” said Scripps. “Ultimately, the commission felt that the concerns around reliability had been sufficiently addressed with the new resources that were brought online as part of that plan.”

Plotting a comeback

Trump’s decision to intervene in Michigan arrived shortly after the president inked executive orders to revive the fossil fuel — and amid Republican outcry in the state.

In late April, Michigan Republicans including Prestin, state Rep. Luke Meerman and state Sen. Roger Victory warned top Trump officials in a letter that the grid would be increasingly vulnerable with the Campbell plant’s closure. They called on Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to keep the Campbell and Monroe plants open.

“A state prone to adverse weather conditions and prolonged winters, energy failings in Michigan have dire consequences and we write to highlight the critical concerns we have for our energy security,” they wrote. “Michigan is regulated by a radical renewable energy plan that mandates untenable energy standards by year, and the state has already begun to phase out traditional fuel sources like coal.”

Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga, who represents Michigan’s 4th District, which includes the Campbell plant, said in an email that any time a plant like Campbell heads towards closure, “let alone during a National Energy Emergency, people rightfully become concerned and wonder what it means for their home, family, or farm in terms of cost.” Huizenga also said the plant’s closure is “a costly example of Jennifer Granholm, Joe Biden, and Governor Whitmer’s failed energy strategy.”

Victory also reached out directly to the Trump administration, he said, and argued that the plant was needed to fuel growth in the region, including energy-hungry data centers and manufacturing. “I just don’t understand the aggressive nature of how, why it’s so critical to get that plant decommissioned,” Victory said.

On the local level, members of the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners have for months debated the fate of the plant. The 11-member legislative body sets policies in the rural swath of land that includes the Campbell facility.

Sitting in a conference room in West Olive earlier this month, Republican Ottawa County Commissioner Joe Moss said he and his colleagues were hopeful Trump would intervene to keep the plant open and said they were planning to explore legal actions to prevent the plant from being demolished.

“I do think the Trump administration will try something,” said Moss. “I just don’t know if it would be enough to stop what’s going on.”

But Doug Zylstra, the board’s lone Democrat, said his colleagues’ arguments gloss over the fact that Consumers Energy is saving $600 million by closing the plant, and that the utility has invested in gas over a period of years to ensure grid reliability. Zylstra added that no city or other entity has stepped up to throw out a multimillion-dollar financial lifeline to keep the plant open.

“It’s an obvious point to say it has baseload generation, but if it costs $600 million to stay open, is that a cost-efficient source of base load power? I don’t think so,” he said. “People aren’t lining up to give Consumers $600 million to keep the plant open — they tend to be lining up to tell Consumers what to do with their own money.”

‘Hard test case’?

Proponents of Trump’s push to revive coal hope that the Campbell plant is just the beginning.

They cite a 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment by the grid’s monitor, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., or NERC, which found MISO is facing a “high” risk because the addition of new resources isn’t keeping up with retirements and growing demand.

Michelle Bloodworth, head of the coal power generation group America’s Power, said that report and NERC’s call for utilities to better manage plant retirements should prompt the Trump administration to step in and study regions like Ottawa County before any facilities are torn down.

Demand is increasing, EPA is reconsidering onerous regulations, and the economics of coal-fired power plants could change, she said, noting that 19 utilities since 2022 have delayed the retirement of about 28,000 MW of generation.

“I think from a resource adequacy, fuel security, and national security standpoint, we need to keep every coal plant that we have until analysis tells us differently,” said Bloodworth.

A spokesperson for MISO said the grid operator doesn’t comment on individual generating facilities, but instead shares regional and zonal summaries. The most recent survey, released in the summer of 2024, cited uncertainties around grid reliability, with results indicating the region could see as much as a 1.1 GW surplus to a possible deficit of 2.7 GW this summer. The actual outcome, according to the survey, will hinge on the pace and quantity of new resource additions and projected resource retirements.

“Resource Adequacy risks could grow over time across all seasons, absent increased new capacity additions and actions to delay capacity retirements,” MISO wrote.

MISO notably has not requested an emergency measure to keep Campbell open, a measure taken by other grid operators when faced with major power plant retirements in recent years.

Federal regulators approved a plan in January to keep open a Maryland coal plant, saying its continued operation was needed for the reliability of the Mid-Atlantic power grid. In New England, they approved a similar plan in 2022, which kept a large gas plant open for two additional years.

Trump’s declaration of an energy emergency and subsequent executive orders inked in April appear to override the regional process, at least temporarily.

Trump signed an order calling on DOE to craft a new “methodology” to assess grid reliability by early May and to implement a process to determine which coal-fired power plants should be kept online in the following months — even through use of DOE’s authority under 202(c) of the Federal Power Act. The department since 2000 has issued or extended such orders 21 times.

Wright stated that the order for the Campbell plant is “limited in duration to align with the emergency circumstances,” but it’s not clear if the administration plans to extend the order.

Scripps said the directive took him by surprise because the state and Consumers Energy used a “holistic approach” to analyze the closure of the facility, and because MISO found in its last auction that there was sufficient capacity in all zones and all seasons for the upcoming year, a conclusion that accounted for Campbell going away.

“You’ve got the secretary saying there’s an emergency here, and the market saying ‘it’s tightening, but we still have a sufficient reserve and we have it across the footprint,” said Scripps.

As for DOE’s move to keep the plant online, Scripps said: “I think this is a hard test case for that particular power.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e7/d5/63b826ce4f4ea1ac04a200a4120a/election-2024-trump-14954.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:35.304410

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and Jon Ossoff (D-GA) announced $2 million in federal funding for revitalization projects in Georgia. In total, the projects will receive $2,633,080 in Brownfields Grants to assess, clean up, and revitalize local lands.

The Georgia grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants across the nation. Brownfields Grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities have previous used the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) grants to assess, clean up, and attract new development.

“These federal funds will help our state get back on track by helping assess and eventually transform what are now uninhabitable areas, further strengthening Georgia’s economy,” said Senator Reverend Warnock.

“Above all this is about our communities’ health. No family in Georgia should live in fear of contaminants in their communities,” said Senator Ossoff. “That’s why Senator Warnock and I are delivering these historic public health and environmental cleanup efforts across the state.”

The City of Atlanta will receive a $500,000 assessment grant to conduct seven Phase I and five Phase II environmental site assessments, develop six cleanup plans, and support community engagement activities. Targeted areas are Chattahoochee Riverfront, Proctor Creek, and Jonesboro Road.

The Coastal Regional Commission of Georgia will receive a $1.2 million assessment grant for 20 Phase I and 50 Phase II environmental site assessments, reuse assessment, planning, and community engagement activities. Targeted areas are the cities of Darien, Brunswick, and Statesboro.

The City of Ideal will receive a $433,080 cleanup grant funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Grant funds will be used to clean up a former elementary school, vacant since 1981, and for community engagement.

The City of South Fulton will receive a $500,000 assessment grant for six Phase I and five Phase II environmental site assessments. Targeted areas are the Red Oak and Old National Highway districts.

Senator Warnock has an extensive history of securing federal grants to improve the health of Georgia’s communities, clean up the environment, and help bolster the state’s economy. Last year, Senator Warnock announced $45 million in federal funding for clean energy transportation across Georgia. Senator Warnock also announced $25 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to help rural and disadvantaged communities throughout Georgia remove PFAS and other dangerous chemicals from their water systems. Earlier in 2024, Senator Reverend Warnock was joined by then EPA Administrator Michael Regan at Stone Mountain Middle School to announce a $1 billion nationwide federal investment in clean energy school buses, including $60 million for Georgia schools.

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, Brownfields investments have leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

Ratepayer Fallout: Federal Move Forces West Olive Coal Plant to Stay Online

The U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order on May 23, 2025, mandating the continued operation of the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, despite its planned retirement at the end of the month. The decision has ignited controversy, with critics calling the move an unjustified burden on Michigan utility customers.

The plant, owned by Consumers Energy, was scheduled to cease operations on May 31, 2025, as part of the utility’s transition toward cleaner energy. Instead, under the direction of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the plant will remain operational under emergency powers authorized by the Federal Power Act.

Emergency Powers Used to Override Michigan Energy Transition Plans

The Department of Energy’s order is reportedly based on a national energy emergency declared by former President Donald Trump. The justification used to keep the Campbell plant running has been characterized by advocacy groups as fabricated and politically motivated.

“This is a radical abuse of the Federal Power Act’s emergency authorities,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, in a statement released the same day. “Forcing ratepayers in Michigan to pay to keep the inefficient, expensive, and polluting J.H. Campbell coal power plant operational… serves no purpose beyond attempting to prop up the dying coal industry.”

According to the DOE’s directive, Consumers Energy is expected to file a cost recovery application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). This move could pass financial responsibility to ratepayers, potentially increasing utility bills across the state.

Critics Warn of Financial and Environmental Costs for Michigan Residents

Michigan ratepayers may bear the cost of operating a facility that was deemed economically and environmentally unsustainable. The Campbell plant, which has been a major carbon emitter in the region, was on track for decommissioning as part of Consumers Energy’s commitment to reduce coal use and shift to renewables by 2040.

“This decision could impact thousands of Michigan households already struggling with high energy bills,” said Slocum. Public Citizen has announced plans to file a formal protest at FERC, challenging the order and demanding oversight into what it describes as “an outrageous abuse of emergency authorities.”

Environmental groups have long targeted the Campbell plant as one of Michigan’s most polluting facilities. The plant emits an estimated 7.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to EPA data from its last full year of operation.

Energy Policy Clash Brings Federal-State Tensions to the Forefront

This action highlights growing tensions between federal energy policy under the Trump Administration and Michigan’s long-term environmental goals. While the federal government claims energy security concerns justify the move, state officials have not publicly confirmed any emergency need for the plant to remain online.

The lack of transparency around the emergency declaration has also raised concerns. Neither the DOE nor the Trump administration has released supporting data indicating a credible threat to grid reliability that would necessitate the Campbell plant’s continued use.

But many researchers fear that the order will do the opposite by putting US scientists and science under the thumb of political appointees — and they are mobilizing opposition.

‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts

The order, titled “Restoring Gold Standard Science”, states that research-integrity concerns, including high-profile retractions and an inability to reproduce many scientific studies, have caused the public to lose faith in science. It accuses Trump’s predecessor, former president Joe Biden, of misusing scientific evidence while crafting public policies on climate change, public-health guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic and more. The order comes as the Trump administration slashes funding for science across federal agencies and at major US research universities.

Although they agree that breaches of scientific integrity are important to address, researchers who spoke to Nature worry that language in the 23 May order opens the door to political interference in US science.

“It all sounds very non-objectionable, but it’s extremely dangerous” in the details and subtext, says Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a science advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The order “steamrolls” longstanding efforts to create a buffer between science and politics, says Goldman, who helped to develop scientific-integrity policies under Biden that the new order revokes. For instance, enforcement of the new research-integrity policies could be left up to political appointees rather than non-partisan career government employees, as required under Biden.

Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which coordinates science policy across the US government, said to Nature in a statement that the order creates a path to rebuilding trust between the scientific community and the public “through common-sense scientific principles”. She also accused the Biden administration of incorporating “radical woke ideology” into the scientific enterprise by introducing diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. “If that’s not politicizing science, I don’t know what is,” she said.

The latest order has incensed some in the scientific community: nearly 4,900 scientists and others had signed an open letter at the time this story was published arguing that it promotes a “Fool’s Gold” standard for science. “The Executive Order further consolidates political control over the Nation’s scientific infrastructure, co-opting the language of open science to implement a system under which direct presidential appointees are given broad latitude to designate many common and important scientific activities as scientific misconduct, and to penalize those involved accordingly,” the letter says.

Competing policies

During Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, researchers and public-policy specialists repeatedly accused his administration of undermining science and censoring government scientists. For instance, scientists at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were sidelined as the administration sought to weaken environmental and public-health regulations, and hundreds of scientists later reported political interference in a survey. Partially in response, Biden issued an executive order during his first week in office in 2021 calling on some 30 federal agencies to create or update scientific-integrity policies to shield government scientists from political interference.

Trump’s new executive order revokes those policies while calling for the OSTP to issue guidance within the next 30 days on establishing new ones; federal agencies then have 60 days to develop policies and report back to the OSTP. Among other requirements, the order directs agencies to ensure that their policies “protect employees from efforts to prevent or deter consideration of alternative scientific opinions”. OSTP head Michael Kratsios and other Trump officials have said that scientific groupthink on topics such as climate change and COVID-19 response has squashed valid opinions and caused harm.

One of the main fears among critics of the order is that Trump’s new policies will allow agencies to put politically appointed officials in charge of investigations into allegations of research integrity. That could enable the administration to punish government scientists for failing to meet vague expectations to “transparently acknowledge and document uncertainties” when using data in agency decision-making. “This could be used as a cudgel to punish almost anyone: it’s just frightening,” says one senior government official who has worked on scientific-integrity issues under multiple administrations. The official requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.

Sometimes this type of financial juggling may entail using money allocated for other daily needs or expenses to pay the utility bill.

But a recent study by Payless Power shows that this is becoming a new normal for some households dealing with ""energy poverty.""

What is ""energy poverty""?

Why you should care:

""Energy poverty"" is the inability to afford essential energy needs without relinquishing other necessities like food or medication, according to a study by Payless Power. The report revealed that 57% of low-income Americans are dealing with energy poverty.

Energy costs consume most household incomes

By the numbers:

Forty-two percent of respondents in a survey from Payless Power said they spend 10% or more of their monthly income on energy bills. While 31% admit they had delayed or skipped buying essentials like food, medication, or hygiene products just to afford their energy bill. And 8% said they postponed paying their utility bill every month because they can’t afford it.

Separately, the study revealed 19% of Americans had their electricity turned off because they couldn’t afford it in the past year. Millennials were the most likely to lose power (22%), followed by Gen X (20%), Gen Z (17%), and baby boomers (11%). And 11% went without power for 1–3 days.

Another 65% of respondents said they felt increased stress or anxiety because of energy insecurity, compared to 44% who shared that they endured physical issues like sleep problems and illness from extreme temperatures (10%), while 21% felt ashamed or depressed by their living circumstances. Meanwhile, 25% said they lived in unsafe or unhealthy indoor temperatures to keep their bills low.

Study shows groups most impacted by energy poverty?

Dig deeper:

Approximately 60% of Gen Z and 59% of millennials living in low-income households admit in the Payless Power study that they struggle to meet their basic energy needs. Generation X trails at 56%, while nearly half of baby boomers (48%) are also impacted.

According to the study, many Americans are taking significant steps to reduce their spending with some of the main strategies being using fans or space heaters (45%) in their homes, unplugging electronics (45%), and skipping heating or air conditioning altogether (44%).

Moreover, the study noted that the state most affected is Texas, where more than three in five low-income residents report living in energy poverty. Twenty-eight percent had their power turned off in the last year, with cities like Houston (30%) and Austin (28%) seeing the highest rates of disconnection because of unpaid bills.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1280/720/person-looks-at-utility-bill.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:40.705538

All GM EVs currently use a chemistry called nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NCMA), which tends to drive up costs.

China dominates the LFP battery supply chain and has rapidly advanced the tech, which was invented and first developed in the U.S.

Electric vehicle battery production in the U.S. has long centered around the pricey nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistry. But automakers are now shifting gears, moving toward cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries to cut costs and make EVs more accessible to a broader audience.

General Motors especially is pressing ahead with alternative chemistries to lower the cost of its EVs. The Korea Economic Daily reported on Tuesday that GM’s two main battery suppliers—LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI—are planning to bring LFP battery production to the U.S.

If they move fast enough, these could be the first LFP plants in the U.S., potentially beating Ford’s CATL-backed LFP factory in Michigan to the punch. That plant was initially supposed to start production in 2026, but after a delay and some political headwinds, the timeline is no longer clear.

Samsung SDI and GM’s $3.5 billion joint venture in New Carlisle, Indiana, is already set to start building prismatic cells by 2027. But now, Samsung SDI will retrofit part of the facility—originally designed for NMC cell production—to manufacture LFP cells. The company is already sourcing raw materials and equipment for the switch.

LG Energy Solution, GM’s primary battery supplier, is also looking to convert a section of its Ohio and Tennessee facilities into LFP manufacturing, according to the report. Currently, LGES makes NMC pouch and cylindrical cells and has eight battery plants in the U.S.—some of them are already up and running whereas others are nearing completion.

GM previously announced that the next-generation Bolt EV and a future trim of the Silverado EV will also get LFP packs. But as for other models, GM hasn't said which ones will get LFP packs.

“Our EV strategy is focused on designing products that continue to lower cost, improve performance, and localize production,” a GM spokesperson told InsideEVs. “Battery technology is a key enabler of that strategy. We don’t comment on rumors,” he added.

Still, there’s a strong case for an LFP-equipped Chevy Equinox EV. It's already the most affordable EV in the U.S. with over 300 miles of range. It starts at $33,600 before destination. For commuters who can live with that shorter range, an LFP version could slash thousands of dollars off the price, possibly dropping it below $25,000 with the tax credits factored in. Alternatively, if those credits disappear—the Trump administration is pushing hard to do that—the lower-cost battery could help GM stay competitive and cushion the blow of tariffs, especially since the Equinox EV is built in Mexico.

That said, current GM trucks and SUVs use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NCMA) batteries. They’re an evolution of traditional NMC batteries with higher nickel content and a lower cobalt concentration. Even though these batteries offer superior energy density, they’re expensive and are part of the reason why EV trucks and SUVs tend to be pricier than their gas-powered counterparts. With an LFP battery, GM is expecting to save as much as $6,000 on the Silverado EV compared to NMC packs.

Several other EVs in the U.S. already use LFP packs, such as the entry-level Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Rivian R1T and R1S in their dual-motor trims with the standard pack.

GM is also looking beyond NMC and LFP. It is working on a novel chemistry labeled lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which uses less of the expensive nickel and cobalt content and dramatically increases the portion of manganese. GM will use LMR with a prismatic cell to deliver an estimated 400+ miles of range on its electric trucks and full-size SUVs at costs that are comparable to LFP, the company says.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAqbOl/s1/2026-gmc-sierra-ev.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:14:13.947755

My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.'”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.

“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.

Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.

“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”

As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world. But, he suggested that state goals could be more ambitious.

“I was teasing in the other room, our governor wants to increase the amount of energy that we produce by double in the next 10 years. And if he were here, I’d put my arm around him and say, ‘governor, I love you. But that is not enough,'” Curtis said about Gov. Spencer Cox’s Operation Gigawatt. “There are demands coming on energy that far exceed doubling in 10 years.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.standard.net/images/2025/05/28110005/IMG_0960-scaled-e1748445478641-1536x878-1-1200x686.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:21.398741

Though no nuclear power is generated in Kentucky, officials and companies have taken strides in recent years to lay the groundwork for atomic energy developments.

Republican state Sen. Danny Carroll has been one of the leading voices when it comes to nuclear technology and its applications in the commonwealth.

The Paducah lawmaker – a self-proclaimed “nuclear energy nerd” – carried both the bill that lifted Kentucky’s decadeslong moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2017 and the measure that created the state’s nonregulatory nuclear authority in 2023. Trump’s executive orders would accelerate research efforts and approvals of new nuclear reactor designs, reconsider some radiation standards used to protect workers and the public from health risks and restructure the NRC itself, among other steps. Carroll said he thinks they come at a crucial time.

“These are historical times, not just for our state or our country – for this world. We're seeing the conversion to nuclear energy. And to me, you know, it's almost like when [man-made] electricity was first invented. I think it's to that scale,” Carroll said. “That is the future.”

The changes could pay dividends for some projects in the works across the country, like Global Laser Enrichment’s prospective uranium enrichment facility in Paducah. The planned $1 billion, first-of-its-kind facility in western Kentucky is expected to use an innovative laser process – one that’s still being tested at a North Carolina facility – to enrich depleted nuclear tails in storage at the nearby former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant.

Right now, CEO Stephen Long said GLE is on track to have the plant operational by “no later than 2030,” though his statement to WKMS also indicated it was too soon to tell how Trump’s executive order could support an accelerated schedule.

“These directives recognize the critical role of nuclear energy and a robust fuel supply chain in ensuring American energy dominance, as well as the necessary actions to accelerate deployment,” Long wrote. “The administration has underscored the importance of expanding domestic conversion and enrichment capacity … [and] our proposed Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility is uniquely positioned to support both of these objectives, advancing innovation and U.S. technology leadership and enhancing the nation’s energy security.”

Moving forward, Carroll hopes Trump’s executive order can spur nuclear energy developments of all sorts across the state and expedite the “very slow and very costly” licensing and approval process for new nuclear facilities.

Though there are currently no plans to build nuclear power plants in the state, Carroll said the Kentucky Nuclear Energy Development Authority has “identified some sites” for potential development.

Carroll said, in the future, some of the state’s largest power providers could likely afford to build nuclear reactors, and smaller utilities, like electrical cooperatives, could partner on facilities. He thinks his home city – particularly the site of the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a uranium production facility that ceased operations in 2013 – is a good candidate for a small modular reactor similar to the one in the works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

“Our DOE site here in Paducah would be a great site for that,” he said. “There are some concerns about the seismic activity, but I don't think there's anything that couldn't be overcome with certain design changes.”

Recently, several states have put together major initiatives to attract nuclear developments to their part of the country. The Texas Legislature is currently weighing a proposal to put $350 million towards grants aimed at the industry, and Tennessee upped its commitment to nuclear advancements last year, adding $10 million for a total of $60 million in nuclear grant funding.

Kentucky set aside $40 million as a part of the legislation that created the state’s nuclear authority. Some of that money is going towards the operations of that entity, as well as those of the state’s Energy Planning and Inventory Commission, and $10 million was used to set up a similarly motivated grant program for nuclear developments.

Carroll wants to see that number grow tenfold in Kentucky’s next budget, to $100 million. He sees nuclear energy as the pathway to attracting more industry of all stripes to the state. That includes businesses that demand large amounts of power, like the “hyperscale” data center recently proposed in Oldham County.

“I think, at this point, the one thing that we're really lacking is sufficient investment by the state,” he added. “Kentucky has always been known for having low energy costs. That's been one of our main attractors for getting business and industry to our state, and I think nuclear is the future of that.”

Carroll, citing rolling blackouts experienced by some Kentuckians during intense winter weather in recent years, said nuclear power should be a key component of the state’s baseload energy in years to come.

“To say that we're ‘headed towards’ a time when we don't have sufficient energy in this state – that's inaccurate. We're there. No question about it. We're there,” he said. “It's important that we create a larger baseload, especially as we start decommissioning some of the coal-fired plants that we have in the state.”

Carroll said the nuclear industry has the potential to be “a brand new economic driver” for Kentucky, if the state plays its cards right and with “a sense of urgency.”

“Our goal is not just to get nuclear reactors in Kentucky. It's to create an entire nuclear ecosystem within the commonwealth that's taking advantage of all aspects of nuclear energy development: research, industrialization, building, parts, education, whatever it might be. We want to take full advantage of it,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08b46d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4665x2449+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2F57%2Fada6085b45ec9d7a536a978509bb%2F28074713764-554d1f9a4f-o.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:38.921749

Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.
In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities.
Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful.
“Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said.","After days of intense political infighting between ultraconservative and moderate Republicans, the House of Representatives voted along party lines on Thursday morning to approve a sweeping tax bill that seeks to eviscerate the heart of landmark climate legislation passed by Democrats just three years ago.

The 2022 climate law on the chopping block—the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA—was the first legislation in more than a decade to attempt to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and was the centerpiece of former president Joe Biden’s legislative agenda. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits, loans, subsidies, and grants to utility companies, automakers, consumers, and others to become more energy-efficient and switch to sources of carbon-free power.

Until recently, the conventional wisdom in Washington was that lawmakers in districts receiving this cash would be disincentivized to undo the legislation supplying it, even under an ultraconservative president like Donald Trump. “Repeal is extremely unlikely,” Neil Chatterjee, a former Republican commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, wrote in an opinion piece for The Hill last August titled “The Solar Investment Tax Credit is safe from repeal even if Republicans win in 2024.” In March, 21 House Republicans signed an open letter calling for any changes to the IRA tax credits to “be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion.”

Yet the House voted 215-214 on Thursday to wind down the IRA’s clean energy tax credits ahead of schedule, including the solar investment tax credit that Chatterjee was sure would be safe. Just two Republicans voted against the bill, one voted present, and two abstained—including only one of the March letter’s signatories.

Originally, the incentives were set to continue through at least 2032. Under the House bill, tax credits for all clean energies except for nuclear, which Republicans tend to view favorably, will apply only to projects that break ground within 60 days of the bill’s enactment and begin sending energy to the grid by the end of 2028, a timeline that could seriously undercut the country’s clean energy industry. Federal tax credits to help consumers adopt clean energy technologies like heat pumps, rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric vehicles would be phased out by the end of this year.

The House bill needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump to become law, and it is likely to change during negotiations in the upper chamber.

Renewable energy developers warn that the House’s timeline for getting projects in service is prohibitively tight and would effectively make some of the tax credits obsolete. “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered a historic American manufacturing renaissance,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, in a statement.

The repeals would impact major utility-scale projects that are already underway, such as wind projects, said Katrina McLaughlin, an associate on the World Resources Institute’s U.S. energy team, because it takes a long time to get most renewable projects up and running.

“Placed in service means everything has to go right. We have interconnection queue delays, we have permitting delays, there can be challenges with getting different materials and resources,” McLaughlin said. “So getting in service by 2028 is actually a pretty aggressive timeline.”

In the two years since the IRA was passed, analyses show that federal funding has catalyzed more than $400 billion in investments in manufacturing, electric vehicles, hydrogen power, renewable energy, and other green initiatives and spurred more than 400,000 new jobs. Analyses show that the vast majority of IRA clean energy tax credits and grants—78 percent—have gone to red districts in rural and suburban areas.

As House Speaker Mike Johnson sought to unite his party behind Trump’s domestic agenda, two warring factions emerged: a far-right coalition focused on attaining deeper spending cuts by slashing the IRA and Medicare, and a moderate group agitating to retain clean energy funding in their districts and increase the cap on how much state and local tax can be deducted from one’s federal taxes—a change that would benefit high earners in blue states.

Unsurprisingly, the lawmaker leading the fight against the IRA comes from an area that hasn’t received much money from it. Representative Chip Roy, leading the ultraconservative crusade, represents a district in Texas that has a little less than a dollar per person in announced IRA investments. Meanwhile, one of his colleagues on the other side of the fight, moderate Republican Representative Nancy Kiggan, comes from a district in Virginia that is slated to receive $85.50 worth of investments per capita.

Republicans represent 18 of the top 20 congressional districts benefiting the most from clean energy investments since the passage of the IRA, according to the research firm Atlas Public Policy. The top three districts on that list, in North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, had together received nearly $30 billion from the legislation as of March this year. But in the end, all of the Republican lawmakers representing those 18 districts voted in favor of effectively ending the investments. Democrats, whose caucus has shrunk due to the deaths of three members this year, were united in opposition.

In the end, the moderate Republican caucus was willing to trade IRA tax credits for other policy priorities. Moderates in high-tax states like New York were willing to use Biden’s tax credits as a bargaining chip for a higher limit on itemized state and local tax deductions—$40,000, up from the current cap of $10,000—a political win, with benefits that those lawmakers could reap immediately, that allowed them to sidestep having to defend legislation passed by a Democratic administration.

Republicans might also be banking on the fact that many of their constituents don’t know about the IRA. A University of Chicago and Associated Press survey last year found that two years after the IRA passed, most Americans had a supremely flawed understanding of what the legislation is and does, if they knew about it at all. Only 21 percent of adults polled, for example, thought tax credits for individuals to buy electric vehicles were helpful. Nearly 40 percent didn’t know enough to weigh in on the EV tax credits and a shocking 15 percent of those polled thought the policy—which gives consumers up to $7,500 for a new plug-in EV—hurt people like them.

According to Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way, part of the problem is that the IRA’s clean energy incentives—like new union jobs and major infrastructure projects—take years to manifest. “Not enough clean energy funding got out the door quickly enough,” he said. “It’s having a big impact, don’t get me wrong, but it hasn’t become part of the fabric of communities yet in a way that would freak people out if it disappeared.”

Car shoppers considering buying an electric vehicle in 2025 will have more factors to consider than buyers in previous years. Most of it is good news. For instance, automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs and improve their current models. Expanded charging options and very attractive used EV prices are also hot topics for this year. But there are also negative trends you need to watch out for. Edmunds’ auto experts break down what you can expect before heading out and buying an EV for 2025.

Higher new vehicle prices are a distinct possibility

According to the NPR article “ Here’s how Trump’s tariffs could impact you and your wallet,” the price for certain imported electric vehicles will increase with the Trump administration tariffs. Tariffs on other components or materials used for vehicle manufacturing will also have an impact. Estimates vary widely on how much extra you might have to pay should these tariffs be in effect for a long duration, but it could potentially be thousands of dollars depending on the vehicle.

The new administration has also said it would repeal the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs. Right now, certain new EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which can be put toward the sales price with a purchase or lease or toward your tax liability if you purchase it. Used EVs priced under $25,000 can qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000.

More charging options for EVs

Tesla charging stations, which used to be available to Tesla vehicles only, are now open to most non-Tesla EVs. This expansion includes Tesla’s vast network of fast-charging stations called Supercharger stations, and it’s a big deal because it significantly increases the number of charging stations EV owners can use. Public charging stations from various third-party companies like EVgo and Electrify America were the only options for non-Tesla EVs in the past. Tesla’s network of charging stations is nationwide and the largest in the country. The stations are also very reliable and are rarely offline.

Tesla stations can be easy to use once everything is set up. But you need to check with your vehicle’s manufacturer to find out how to use a Tesla charging station and likely buy or obtain a charging connector adaptor.

More EVs to choose from, and more range

EV shoppers have plenty of choices in 2025, and most of these models offer plenty of range. Many vehicles, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5, provide over 300 miles of range on certain models. Some high-dollar EVs from Mercedes-Benz and Lucid and electric trucks from GM easily exceeded the 400-mile mark when Edmunds tested them.

EVs are also becoming more affordable; a few have starting prices below $35,000 even without the federal tax credit, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. For the lowest monthly payments, consider leasing an EV. Automakers offer great lease deals during certain months thanks to big incentives and the tax credit.

The good and bad about low prices for used EVs

Even with federal tax credits, a new EV is typically more expensive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle. But the resale value of EVs — essentially, how much they are worth a few years after purchase — is dropping quicker than those for gas-powered vehicles. That’s great news if you’re in the market for a used EV. For example, 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GTs that cost more than $60,000 when new are now selling in the low $30,000s.

However, this big drop in value isn’t so great if you’re the one trying to sell or trade in your used EV. You’ll likely be surprised and dismayed that your vehicle is worth substantially less than what you bought it for. It’s especially bad if you owe a significant amount of money on your loan. It’s possible you could owe more on your loan than what the vehicle is actually worth.

Edmunds says

If you’re planning on buying an EV this year, it’s best to do it soon in case EV tax credits are repealed and in case prices increase. If you do purchase one, find out how to get access to Tesla charging stations because they are far easier to use than the various third-party stations.",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_547866107-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 15:32:53.499230

Previewing a challenging future for Michigan’s manufacturers, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently evoked Michigan’s storied past.

Speaking in Washington, D.C. earlier this year, Gov. Whitmer cited the Arsenal of Democracy era in World War II Detroit as a model of Michigan’s innovation and drive. During that era, Detroit produced an almost miraculous amount of output for the Allied war effort. Fourengine B-24 bombers rolled off the assembly line at Willow Run at the rate of one per hour. A single plant in Warren churned out hundreds of battle tanks a month.

Gov. Whitmer said, the task is to channel that historic period to meet tomorrow’s challenges.

“Today, we have a lot going for us, but our future is uncertain,” Gov. Whitmer said. “We have good cards, but good cards alone don’t mean jack unless you play them right. This year and in the years to come — no matter who’s in the White House — let’s bet on American workers … Let’s innovate and let’s build.”

Michigan in a Position of Strength

As stockbrokers are fond of saying, past performance is no guarantee of future success. Certainly Michigan’s manufacturers face many challenges, from the unsettled outlook for trade and tariffs to the slower-than-expected market demand for electric vehicles. But as Gov. Whitmer said, Michigan starts from a strong position, with a century of manufacturing prowess behind it, legions of skilled engineers and technicians, and a work ethic second to none. If you were wagering on the future, Michigan’s assets would make the state a good bet.

Manufacturing Prowess Runs Deep

Today, the state’s signature auto industry remains strong, with more than 1.2 million jobs tied to the industry, according to MichAuto, an arm of the Detroit Regional Chamber. And these are some of the bestpaying jobs in the marketplace, with average compensation in the industry of $71,547.

But Michigan’s manufacturing muscle goes far beyond giants like General Motors and Ford. There are leading auto suppliers like Lear Corp., headquartered in Southfield, and Stryker, a leading maker of medical devices headquartered in Portage near Kalamazoo. And Michigan’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem has spawned startups like Orbion Space Technology, maker of propulsion systems to nudge satellites into their proper orbits, headquartered in Houghton.

Detroit is a Center of Startup Activity and Innovation

Michigan increasingly draws the eye of big-time venture investors who can bankroll future progress. During 2023, Michigan’s entrepreneurial startups enjoyed more than $1 billion invested into Michigan-based portfolio companies. And Detroit has emerged as a center of startup activity, ranking second among startup ecosystem growth worldwide, according to industry analyst PitchBook’s recent Growth Score research.

Where will innovation come from? Many places. There are hubs to nurture startups like TechTown at Wayne State University and Newlab at Ford’s Michigan Central campus catering to mobility startups. The University of Michigan is building its Center for Innovation at the Ilitch family’s District Detroit to house hundreds of researchers.

Michigan also has a major defense industry in Macomb County at places like the Army’s TACOM that manages the Army’s ground equipment supply chain, and Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a key defense hub and economic anchor that supports thousands of jobs and hundreds of military families in Macomb County.

Community Colleges Have a Key Role to Play

There are also the community colleges and universities turning out an increasingly sophisticated workforce.

And, as cited recently by Gov. Whitmer, there is the Michigan Maritime Manufacturing, or M3, Initiative, a job training program built in partnership with Macomb County and Macomb Community College to prepare thousands of Michiganders for careers in maritime welding and machining.

Referencing that maritime training program, Gov. Whitmer quipped, “Together, we can train thousands of Michiganders to do what they do best — GSD — Get Ship Done!”

When America Innovates, It Wins

A key strength: Michigan has leaders who continue to point the way to innovation and growth. As Bill Ford, Executive Chair of Ford, said when he opened the beautifully remade Michigan Central Station in Detroit as a hub of idea generation, “Five years ago, we set out to create a place that would accelerate Detroit and our region’s role in solving the most pressing mobility challenges and change people’s lives for the better. We see an opportunity to bring new companies and jobs to Michigan, while also attracting the best and the brightest talent for our industry.”

Or as Gov. Whitmer said in her recent speech, “The bottom line… when America innovates and when America builds… America wins.” And so can Michigan.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Detroiter_car_featured.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:15:47.618740
,Clean Energy ,2025-05-28 16:55:55+00:00,MIT Sloan,Workers need good jobs. The climate sector can help | MIT Sloan,Betsy Vereckey,,,,,https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/workers-need-good-jobs-climate-sector-can-help,"In conjunction with business, policy, and labor organizations, the Families & Workers Fund developed a working definition stating that good jobs should: Pay enough for workers to sustain their families.
Economic stability Many jobs, including some climate jobs, don’t provide enough money to change people’s economic realities, Weissbourd said.
Economic mobility Good climate jobs should also offer clear pathways for advancement, paid training, and wealth-building opportunities.
“We have to be talking to the private sector because they’re providing many of these jobs and we have to be demonstrating to companies that [good jobs are] in their business interest.” 3.
Equity, respect, and voice Good jobs should provide equal opportunities and address discrimination where it exists.","Facing low wages, poor working conditions, and a lack of training, a third of working Americans can’t afford their basic needs. The transition to a sustainable economy represents a unique opportunity to address those challenges and create fair, well-paying jobs — even amid freezes to federal funds intended to support the growth of such roles.

Clean energy is a sector “where there are huge needs both for the climate issue and for our country’s workforce development,” said MIT Sloan professor , co-director the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research.

At an April event hosted by IWER and the MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative, Kelly and guest speaker Jenny Weissbourd, MBA ’18, a program director with the nonprofit Families & Workers Fund, discussed what a “good job” means in the 21st century.

In conjunction with business, policy, and labor organizations, the Families & Workers Fund developed a working definition stating that good jobs should:

Pay enough for workers to sustain their families.

Provide numerous chances for advancement.

Create opportunities for agency in the workplace.

Over the past four years, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act collectively pledged about $2 trillion in climate and infrastructure projects.

Those laws were projected to create about 12 million new jobs, which Weissbourd characterized as “an enormous window of opportunity to really support the transition to net zero while also moving workers into these higher-quality jobs.

“As it relates to the infrastructure and climate investments, we know that many of those dollars are now on hold, but many have already moved toward the ground, and we really want to make sure that they effectively support a clean energy transition,” Weissbourd said.

The pause in funding comes at a time when the climate crisis is creating “new vulnerabilities for people who are perhaps not fully covered by existing labor standards or for whom pushing for enforcement of existing labor standards feels risky,” Kelly said.

Even so, Kelly and Weissbourd expressed optimism that growth in climate jobs could help the country move toward a sustainable economy if policy and advocacy were to center around the following issues.

1. Economic stability

Many jobs, including some climate jobs, don’t provide enough money to change people’s economic realities, Weissbourd said.

“There’s a crisis around job quality,” she said. “I've talked to solar panel installers who have part-time work who don’t get benefits, who are out there on the roof every day facing extreme weather.”

Givng people the opportunity to earn enough money to support their families, receive health benefits, and work in safe conditions with a good schedule would move the needle on economic mobility.

The Families & Workers Fund, for example, supports PowerCorpsPHL, a Philadelphia-based organization that connects young people, including those who have been involved with the legal system, to quality green infrastructure jobs, such as climate resilience work in the city’s water department or its parks and recreation department.

“What they get is effective paid training, along with a set of other wraparound supports [and] mental health support, helping participants connect with things like transportation and child care, which we know can often stand in the way of successful completion of a training program and success in a job,” Weissbourd said.

“As a result, more than 90% of the people that go through this training program end up not just connecting to a living-wage quality job but staying in that job and advancing in that job over time.”

2. Economic mobility

Good climate jobs should also offer clear pathways for advancement, paid training, and wealth-building opportunities. “When you invest in the workforce, it helps you attract and keep talent; it helps drive engagement and productivity,” Weissbourd said.

She said that while federal funding for job training isn’t going away altogether, “I think we can expect a much smaller-scale investment than [in] the last few years.”

In this economic climate, it’s imperative that other parties get involved — not just the government, but private business and workers themselves, too.

“It’s about really showing the value to each of the stakeholders of this work,” Weissbourd said. “We have to be talking to the private sector because they’re providing many of these jobs and we have to be demonstrating to companies that [good jobs are] in their business interest.”

3. Equity, respect, and voice

Good jobs should provide equal opportunities and address discrimination where it exists.

“Clean energy jobs haven’t always included women and people of color,” Weissbourd noted. “There’s lots of great research on how diversifying your workforce can lead to really important business benefits.”

Add in a historic labor shortage and high rates of retirement in the workforce, and “it’s imperative to attract people from all walks of life,” Weissbourd said.

Kelly said that it’s important for workplaces to engage in open conversation: As we increasingly talk about what a good job should consist of, people can start to expect more for their futures.

“The more that there is organizing via labor movements of all kinds, as well as policy initiatives, then there’s a sense of being ready to push,” Kelly said.",https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-05/solar-worker.jpg?h=517d30df&itok=D63BAFA5,N,,2025-05-28 14:13:57.329228

It would also kill the clean hydrogen tax credit at the end of this year and give most zero-carbon power plants, including wind, solar, and geothermal, an end-of-year deadline to start construction, among many other damaging provisions.

To date, at least eight Senate Republicans have spoken out against at least some of these changes, but none of them have tied their vote to the issue. The pressure to stick with your party is “enormous” when your vote is the difference between a bill’s success or failure, Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy at Third Way, told me. “As we saw in the House, the biggest question is whether any Republican Senator, when push comes to shove, has any willingness to try to stop this bill in order to defend energy tax credits.”

Pay attention to what they say over the next few weeks — and when they say it. It’s one thing to speak out when everything’s still up in the air. It’s quite another to keep talking when votes are on the line.

The Letter Writers

When the budget fight was first heating up in April, four senators led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune warning that repealing the tax credits “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The three co-authors were Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Last week, after the House modified its proposal to phase out the tax credits more aggressively, Murkowski told Politico the Senate was “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.” The moderate Republican has a history of supporting environmental policy, and has already broken with her party on at least one vote this year. In February, she was the only Republican who voted in favor of a Democrat-led effort to reinstate 5,500 federal public lands employees that had been fired by the Department of Government Efficiency. (The legislation failed.) Murkowski has also gone her own way to support more efficient energy codes, loans for electric vehicle manufacturers, and the impeachment of President Trump over the January 6 insurrection. But she did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and if you look at her overall voting record, these occasions of deviating from the party line have been rare.

Tillis, who is a member of the Finance Committee and will therefore be directly involved in writing the tax credit portion of the bill, has made more specific comments. He said he would push to wind down the tax credits more slowly to give businesses more time to prepare. “We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.

While Tillis does not have the same kind of track record as Murkowski, he’s up for re-election next year, and his state has a lot to lose. Some 34 clean energy projects worth $20 billion in investment and tied to more than 17,000 jobs came to North Carolina because of the tax credits, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. Toyota invested in an EV battery manufacturing plant and just started production last month. Several EV charger manufacturers are setting up shop in the state. Siemens Energy is building a factory to make large power transformers, equipment that is essential to expanding the grid and is currently in very tight supply.

Curtis has also continued to rally around the tax credits. He attended a press conference for Fluence, an energy storage company, back in Utah where he told the Deseret News on Tuesday that the House’s changes to the subsidies were “a problem for the future” of energy. “And I think if I have anything to say about it, I’ll make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future,” he said.

The Come-Latelies

When it became clear that the House was considering changes that would effectively repeal the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia chimed in to voice their concerns. Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

After the bill passed the House, Jon Husted of Ohio decided it was time to speak up. “You have companies that have already made investments, made commitments,” he told the outlet NOTUS. “Supply chains have been built around them, and we need to phase that out more slowly. I think that they deserve to have at least five years of that credit.” Like Tillis, Husted has an election coming up — and 35 clean energy projects in his state to protect.

The Wild Cards

The D.C. insiders I spoke to mentioned a few other powerful senators who could play a role in the debate who’ve been mum on the IRA so far. Thune, of South Dakota, has a history of being friendly toward tax credits for wind energy, and was honored by the American Council on Renewable Energy for his support for renewable energy in 2019. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Budget Committee, has also long been a sometimes-ally for climate action in the Senate. His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.

Susan Collins also came up repeatedly as one to watch, despite her not saying much of anything publicly about the tax credit changes yet. Collins is up for re-election next year, and while the IRA hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom. The Maine Climate Labor Council, a coalition of unions, estimates there are 145 utility-scale clean energy projects that are either operating or in development that could be eligible for the tax credits. The state has also made a big energy efficiency push in recent years, with the tax credits supporting the expansion of efficiency jobs.

Then there are the potential spoilers. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on the bill in order to send it back to the House and ultimately to the President’s desk, and the party has already split into a number of factions looking for various tweaks. Some, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, oppose the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said they will push to reduce spending even more.

In the House, defenders of the tax credits ultimately cared more about raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction than fighting for clean energy subsidies. We could see a similar dynamic play out in the Senate, where Murkowski and Collins have also expressed concern about cuts to Medicaid. The Senate also can’t afford to change the bill so much that it will lose support in the House, so any changes will have to be surgical. The calculation will be, “What is the smallest thing that the authors of the bill can give these folks to fall back into line so that it is relatively easy to both pass the Senate and then get back through the House?” Freed explained.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy. The North Dakota Senator wrote a letter to Republican leaders in early May railing against the “indefinite entitlement” given to energy sources that depend on the wind and sun, and arguing that the tax credits should prioritize electricity generators on the basis of “reliability,” so as to encourage “geothermal, hydropower, coal and natural gas with carbon capture, and nuclear without excluding wind and solar.”

Capito has barely made a fuss about the energy credits, but she and Cramer will be the ones to watch to see how the Senate deals with the bill’s provision to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, as both sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Capito is the chair. The repeal may not be allowed under the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, as it doesn’t have a direct effect on the federal budget. The Senate Parliamentarian hasn’t yet weighed in, but a negative ruling did not stop the two Republicans from leading the fight to revoke waivers granted to California that allowed it to set pollution limits on cars and trucks.

In the end, if any of these Senators wants to take a stand for big changes to the tax credits, they are going to need at least three colleagues to stick it out with them. A more likely outcome, Freed told me, is for them to attempt some smaller adjustments.

“Hopefully they can make it better, but they’re also under enormous pressure to not deviate too significantly from what the House wrote,” he said. “We just need to go in clear-eyed that it's going to be difficult.”

Editor’s note: A previous version of this article misidentified one of the signatories of the letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune. It’s been corrected. We regret the error.

At the same time, the administration’s ambitious goals come against a backdrop of reduced “personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility,” Jennifer T. Gordon, the director of the Nuclear Energy Policy Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Global Energy Center, writes — all of which will “make it challenging to realize the full potential of the U.S. nuclear energy industry.”

2. EPA to propose that power plants don’t contribute ‘significantly’ to climate change

EPA

The Environmental Protection Agency is poised to propose that greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuel-burning power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change, The New York Times reported Saturday, based on a review of an internal draft of the document. The EPA’s rationale in the proposal is that the emissions from the sector are small enough that their elimination would have no impact on public health — although according to the agency’s own accounting in 2022, the power sector is the second biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, behind only transportation.

The move by the EPA, while in keeping with the Trump administration’s deregulatory ambitions, also serves to justify its pending proposal to “repeal all greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants,” including coal-powered units. Previously, the agency had argued that Biden-era restrictions on coal- and gas-fired plants could prevent up to 1,200 deaths and 1,900 cases of asthma per year.

3. BYD slashes prices by up to a third

BYD

BYD announced steep discounts on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models between now and the end of June, with some price cuts as big as 34%, Bloomberg reports. The company’s cheapest car, the Seagull hatchback, is down to just $7,780, while the Seal hybrid sedan saw the steepest discount of more than $7,000, to a mere $14,270. Shares of BYD closed down 8.6% after the announcement.

BYD’s cuts aim to boost customer demand, with Citi analysts anticipating the discounts could increase dealership foot traffic by 30% to 40% week on week. But the analysts also appeared skeptical that the move by BYD would be hugely beneficial to the company in its price war with rival EV automaker, noting “competition remains relatively mild.”

4. South Africa proposes LNG deal with the U.S.

South Africa has proposed a liquified natural gas trade package with the United States, following a contentious meeting between President Cyril Ramaphosa and President Trump last week, Reuters reports. The deal would see South Africa import 75 to 100 petajoules of LNG annually from the U.S. over a 10-year period. Though South Africa currently does not have an LNG import terminal, the government plans to build one at the Port of Richards Bay, with the first phase going online by 2027, in order to lessen its reliance on the dwindling supply via pipeline from Mozambique. The U.S. will reportedly also help South Africa explore fracking opportunities within South Africa; the Karoo region of the country is believed to hold shale reserves, though drilling has been held off due to concerns about contaminating the water supply.

The trade package additionally includes an agreement for South Africa to avoid paying a duty on imports of cars, steel, and aluminum. According to Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, who shared details of the deal, it will amount to $900 million to $1.2 billion in trade per year.

5. Trump urges U.K. to abandon ‘unsightly windmills,’ drill for more oil

President Trump on Friday urged the United Kingdom to “stop with the costly and unsightly windmills and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken,” the Associated Press reports. Trump specifically cited Aberdeen as a potential hub for the “century of drilling left” — the same Scottish city where his Trump International Golf Links golf course is located, and where he unsuccessfully opposed the building of 11 offshore turbines before he became president. Despite Trump’s frequent complaints that turbines are eyesores, the BBC reported this weekend that wind farms have become an “unusual” and “surprisingly popular” tourist attraction in the UK.

Cruz, Jackson Friedman, victor bryant, Indy Staff, Jean Yamamura, Sol Morrison, S.B",,,,,https://www.independent.com/2025/05/28/santa-barbara-county-full-steam-ahead-in-electric-vehicle-transition-despite-federal-pushback/,"However, Santa Barbara County officials are unfazed.
Local momentum toward the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is still going strong, officials say, and will not be significantly impacted by the Trump administration and Congress’s attempts to curtail the state’s transition away from gas.
While the state vows to fight the decision in court, Santa Barbara County is continuing its transition to EVs “pretty aggressively,” in the words of Garrett Wong, the county sustainability division manager.
The county is not relying on any federal funds to support the transition.
The City of Santa Barbara is acting equally calm and collected.","Senate Republicans gave California’s landmark plan to phase out gas-powered vehicles a big thumbs-down on Thursday. However, Santa Barbara County officials are unfazed. Local momentum toward the shift to electric vehicles (EVs) is still going strong, officials say, and will not be significantly impacted by the Trump administration and Congress’s attempts to curtail the state’s transition away from gas.

For context, last week, Republicans in the Senate and a few Democrats in the House voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate — requiring all new cars sold in the state be electric by 2035 — and two rules cleaning up diesel trucks, saying they are expensive, impractical, and rob consumers of choice.

This marked the first time the state’s waivers to enact clean air standards that are stricter than the federal limits — allowed by the 1970 Clean Air Act — were revoked by Congress (in a questionable workaround move too complicated to explain here). But it extends beyond California’s borders, as 11 states were set to follow in California’s footsteps to reduce their own greenhouse-gas emissions.

While the state vows to fight the decision in court, Santa Barbara County is continuing its transition to EVs “pretty aggressively,” in the words of Garrett Wong, the county sustainability division manager. The county is not relying on any federal funds to support the transition. It already has momentum, Wong said, backed by funding from the state — including a recent $4.7 million grant — that is not at risk. The federal governments’ actions have a “chilling effect,” he noted, but “nothing is going to stop that progress,” such as plans to greatly expand the county’s EV charging network, in accordance with its 2030 Climate Action Plan.

The City of Santa Barbara is acting equally calm and collected. While its staff is tracking any potential repeals on EV tax credits, they are still “moving forward with our plans to electrify or decarbonize our fleet by 2035,” said Jefferson Litten, the city’s energy and climate division manager, including current plans to add 52 new charging stations at the city’s fleet yard. “If there are speed bumps along the way, we’ll deal with them as they come.”

County Supervisor Laura Capps was especially optimistic, still riding the high of the Board of Supervisors’ recent historic vote to phase out local oil and gas operations: “We’re on fire — no pun intended. We can channel our angst into what we do here. I feel as though we’re signaling to the Trump administration: Not on our watch.”

“We all understand that climate change will be combatted on a local level,” she continued, adding that local EV programs are “going to work,” and will not be impeded by the recent decision.

“We are full steam ahead,” she said. “What the Trump administration is doing has only energized local support for our climate action in terms of advocacy and awareness.”

Still, “Any reduction in funding for EVs and the associated infrastructure would have a negative impact on local air quality, specifically the pollutants the form ozone/smog and toxic diesel exhaust,” said Lyz Bantilan, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District. Governor Gavin Newsom also expressed concern that the Senate vote, which he called “illegal,” will “make America smoggy again.”

A dramatic legal battle between California and the Trump administration is expected to unfold in the coming months, with Newsom promising to “fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.”",https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/County-Newsletter-2023-Department-Spotlight-General-Services-JPG.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 14:13:29.497245

Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades.
We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy.
The executive orders “expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda,” according to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.
Environmental groups have expressed concerns about the safety of nuclear reactors, as well as their supply chain.","President Donald Trump on Friday signed four executive orders intended to stimulate a “nuclear energy renaissance” by building new reactors to meet the electricity demands of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and other emerging industries.

The executive orders clear a path for construction on America’s federal lands, allow for design testing of nuclear reactors at United States Department of Energy labs and “remove regulatory barriers by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue timely licensing decisions,” a press release from the White House said.

“Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America – that ends now. Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades. We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy. These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies,” said Michael Kratsios, the director of science and technology at the White House Office of Science.

The executive orders “expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda,” according to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

On the first day of his second term as president, Trump declared an energy emergency, moving to reverse a Biden-era pause on new export terminals for natural gas and to expand drilling for oil and gas in Alaska.

Nuclear energy doesn’t produce the carbon emissions that the use of fossil fuels does, but it does produce radioactive waste that the country does not have the ability to permanently store, reported The Guardian. Environmental groups have expressed concerns about the safety of nuclear reactors, as well as their supply chain.

The executive orders are intended to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the purpose of advancing nuclear technologies and lowering regulatory barriers, while increasing the country’s nuclear capacity from 100 to 400 gigawatts by mid-century, a press release from the American Nuclear Society said.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” Burgum said at an event where the orders were signed, as The Guardian reported. “President Trump here today has committed to energy dominance, and part of that energy dominance is that we’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China.”

In past decades, accidents at nuclear plants both in the U.S. and overseas have caused public opposition to nuclear energy. And while Trump has described nuclear technology as “very safe,” the downsizing of the federal workforce by the Department of Government Efficiency, such as layoffs at the National Nuclear Security Administration — which oversees the country’s nuclear arsenal — has created issues.

The job cuts have been feared to hinder the cleanup of decades-old nuclear waste at the Hanford nuclear plant in Washington state, which was decommissioned in 1989.

Republicans in Congress have made efforts to implement Trump’s energy policies while reversing those of the former Biden administration.

This week, the sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. It alters the availability of tax incentives for renewable energy plants, limiting them to projects that begin construction 60 days after enactment of the bill and are finished by 2028.

This achievement positions Uttar Pradesh as the frontrunner in India’s green mobility push. The state’s success is largely driven by the widespread adoption of e-rickshaws, which make up 85% of its EV sales. These vehicles have become the preferred mode of last-mile connectivity, especially in urban centres, boosting both passenger and goods transport. The state’s EV growth has been reinforced by the Yogi Adityanath-led government’s EV Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, which aims to attract ₹30,000 crore in investments and create 10 lakh jobs. The policy focuses on accelerating green mobility, strengthening charging infrastructure, and making Uttar Pradesh a global EV and battery manufacturing hub.

Uttar Pradesh has also benefited the most from the central government’s FAME I and FAME II schemes, which incentivise the adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles. As part of its infrastructure boost, the state has approved over 300 new charging stations across 16 municipal areas. Ayodhya is set to receive the largest number of these stations, reflecting the state’s tourism-driven infrastructure planning. Despite India having 33,000 EV chargers, the EV-to-public charger ratio remains a concern at 135, compared to the global benchmark of 6 to 20. However, the UP government is prioritising rapid deployment of fast chargers and upgrades to existing infrastructure. With projections estimating 10.2 crore EVs on Indian roads by 2030, Uttar Pradesh is laying a strong foundation.

The state’s three-pronged strategy focuses on local manufacturing, public infrastructure rollout, and increasing adoption, positioning UP as a national and global leader in electric mobility.

With the vote, the resolution to revoke a permission issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under former President Joe Biden in December that permits California to require at least 80% of vehicles to be electric by 2035 is sent to President Donald Trump.

The decision is a defeat for California and environmental organizations who argue that the regulations are necessary to guarantee cleaner cars and reduce pollution, as well as a victory for General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab, Toyota (7203.T), and other manufacturers who vigorously opposed the laws.

In 2020, California first proposed a plan to mandate that by 2035, at least 80% of newly sold automobiles be electric, with up to 20% of those vehicles being plug-in hybrids.

California Governor Gavin Newsom declared, “This Senate vote is illegal,” and added that the Senate’s move would result in an additional $45 billion in health care expenditures for California taxpayers. “We’re going to fight this unconstitutional attack on California in court.”

Since 1970, California has received more than 100 waivers under the Clean Air Act

Moving forward, Senate Republicans disregarded the lawmaker’s recommendation. In March, the Government Accountability Office stated that the waivers cannot be revoked by a majority of the U.S. Senate alone under the Congressional Review Act.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” stated John Bozzella, the CEO of the group. “In reality, meeting the mandates would require diverting finite capital from the EV transition to purchase compliance credits from Tesla.”

Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, condemned the vote. “While our Republican leaders may try to put the horse back in the barn when it comes to electric vehicles, the world has already shifted under their feet,” she stated.

Tesla refrained from commenting right away. The vote, according to GM, will “align emissions standards with today’s market realities.”

Separately, the Senate voted Thursday to revoke the EPA’s 2023 approval of California’s plans to ban California’s low-NOx, or low-nitrogen oxide, regulation for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles and engines, as well as to mandate an increasing amount of zero-emission heavy-duty trucks.

These are the most current measures targeting electric automobiles in recent months.

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a separate bill Thursday that would repeal car pollution regulations intended to encourage automakers to produce more EVs, eliminate a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, and levy a new $250 yearly fee on EVs for road repair costs. Additionally, it would phase away tax credits for the production of EV batteries in 2028.

It will be simpler for automakers to postpone or cease certain EV production if the courts uphold the revocation of California’s regulations. Automakers have warned that they could have to restrict gas-powered automobiles in several areas in the upcoming months.

According to California regulations, 35% of light-duty vehicles must be zero-emission versions by the 2026 model year. Given current EV sales, which are 10% or less in some areas that have adopted the regulations, automakers claim they are unable to reach that number.

Mitchell Schmidt | Wisconsin State Journal Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!","Federal funds that took years to secure to build out Wisconsin's network of electric vehicle charging stations are now in limbo after President Donald Trump's administration earlier this year halted the allocation of the previously approved dollars.

If the funding freeze remains in place, Wisconsin stands to lose out on nearly $63 million in National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds intended to bolster the state's network of EV charging stations — particularly in more rural parts of the state outside of urban hubs like Madison and Milwaukee.

“The biggest part with NEVI was that it was solving that chicken-or-the-egg issue of what comes first: Is it the vehicles that get charged, or is it the chargers that get put in place?” said Ben Behlke, clean technology manager with Renew Wisconsin. ""The hard part with this is that the freezing of the funds is really affecting areas that have low adoption already, or it’s affecting areas that are rural. It’s affecting those areas that might have not seen this construction.”

The funding freeze was announced in early February and comes after a yearslong effort in Wisconsin to update state laws in order to open the door to more than $78 million in federal funds first approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation in 2022 aimed at boosting the number of EV charging stations along state highways and interstates.

Legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in March 2024 — a little over a week before the deadline for Wisconsin to secure the funding — opened the door to the grants.

The new state law requires private businesses to sell electricity by the kilowatt-hour — that is, by the amount used — rather than by the length of time it takes to charge a vehicle. The state in January also imposed a 3-cent per kilowatt-hour excise tax on electricity sold through an EV charging station.

Previously, a business that wanted to operate EV charging stations had to be regulated as a utility.

Shortly after the federal funds were approved, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation announced plans to build 53 fast-charging stations to support the more than 29,000 electric vehicles registered in the state.

By Feb. 6, when the Trump administration ordered a pause on those funds, the agency had signed agreements for 38 projects accounting for $16 million of the original allocation. Those include four completed projects, including new charging stations at Mount Horeb's Kwik Trip on Ridgeview Road, four other projects currently under construction, and another 32 projects that have been obligated and are actively moving forward.

Fifteen additional projects had not yet been obligated by the time funds were halted and cannot proceed, and nearly $63 million in the federal funds allocated to Wisconsin cannot be currently accessed, according to state transportation officials.

In early May, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul joined attorneys general in 16 other states to sue the administration to reopen the flow of funds allocated as part of former President Joe Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, arguing that Trump ""can't cancel part of the law by fiat.""

“The Trump Administration and Secretary (Sean) Duffy are singlehandedly trying to block Wisconsin from receiving the investments we were promised,"" Evers said in early May. ""It’s bad for the people of Wisconsin, it’s bad for our infrastructure, it’s bad for our economy, and it’s illegal.""

Duffy, a former Wisconsin Congressman and Trump's U.S. Transportation Secretary, responded to the lawsuit a week later, writing in a statement that the Biden administration ""failed miserably to deliver EV chargers despite their promises"" and the new administration is focused on streamlining the program.

""Congress gave the Secretary the authority to issue program guidance and ensure money is being spent efficiently, and that’s exactly what we are doing,"" Duffy said.

Steve Baas, executive director of the Wisconsin Transportation Builders Association, said the organization supported the change in state law aimed at sparking additional charging station projects across the state, but he also noted he's not concerned at this point that those funds are gone forever. Baas said it's likely some, if not all, of the remaining dollars could open back up after the federal review process.

""That’s the only thing I’m concerned about with some of the litigation floating around out there, is that the people trying to make a point might end up actually delaying things further, rather than moving them along,"" Baas said.

Baas agreed that among the primary beneficiaries of the federal funds were some of Wisconsin's more rural communities.

""This subsidy money helped spur development in some of those areas that might have needed a little more time for the actual market demand to justify buildout,"" Baas said. ""But I think over time, as demand increases and the technology turnover happens somewhat organically, that demand will come back up to a point where it makes sense from a straight market standpoint, even without the subsidy.”

The offices of Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, and Rep. Nancy VanderMeer, R-Tomah, who co-authored the charging station bill that was eventually signed by Evers, did not respond to a request for comment on the funding freeze.

""Dozens upon dozens"" of Teslas, mostly Cybetrucks, are sitting in front of a shuttered Bed Bath & Beyond in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

The city's planning head wants them out.

The parking lot of a shuttered Bed Bath & Beyond store in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills has become the resting place for “dozens upon dozens” of unsold Tesla EVs, a new report says. The growing number of electric vehicles sitting in the parking lot has attracted the attention of the local planning commission, which wants the electric cars out of there, according to Crain’s Detroit Business.

Most of the inventory EVs are Cybertrucks, for which demand has cooled dramatically in recent months, despite it being crowned America’s best-selling electric pickup last year. A few Model 3s and Model Ys can also be spotted among the unsold cars sitting in the former shopping center’s parking lot.

The city’s director of planning and community development said in a statement that the landlord of the property has “been notified that storage of vehicles is not a permitted use” of the land, and that “the enforcement process is being followed and takes time.”

The issue first came into view in an Instagram post from two weeks ago, where several unregistered Cybertrucks were filmed sitting in the parking lot.

Tesla Cybertruck sales have fallen off a cliff in the first quarter of this year, with the American EV maker delivering between roughly 6,400 and 7,100 units in the first three months. That’s a huge drop compared to the previous quarter, when Tesla sold approximately 13,000 units. (Though automakers tend to sell more in the last quarter of the year than the first quarter of a new year, the fall-off is still dramatic). This predicament cleared the way for the Ford F-150 Lightning to retake the crown as the country’s best-selling battery-powered pickup.

The situation in Detroit’s suburb isn’t new to Tesla. America’s best-selling electric car maker has been known to use private parking lots and even unused land to store excess inventory for nearby stores. Car dealerships often do this, too. In the Farmington Hills case, Tesla has a store just one mile away from the disused Bed Bath & Beyond parking lot, in the neighboring West Bloomfield Township.

The new store opened late last year in a former Barnes & Noble space, according to Crain’s Detroit Business, and is one of just a handful of Tesla stores in the state of Michigan. That’s because the automaker was not allowed to run its own stores in Michigan, as the state barred direct-to-consumer sales to protect its dealers. That changed after Tesla won a lawsuit it brought in 2016 to overturn the ban.

Now, Tesla stores can operate in the state. They just can't fill random parking lots with unsold Cybertrucks, apparently.

Task forces are typically formed by a resolution of the House or Senate and make recommendations about legislation to consider the following year.

Osborne said in a statement that lawmakers will “continue to use our interim to address the challenges facing our Commonwealth.”

“Whether through interim committees or formal task forces, we are positioning ourselves to create policies that help Kentucky and Kentuckians succeed,” Osborne said. “The groundwork we lay now allows for more efficient and productive debate once the session is underway, reducing rushed decisions and increasing the likelihood of passing meaningful, effective legislation.”

A meeting schedule for the task forces has not been released yet.

The interim legislative task forces are:

Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force

The chairs, Sen. Shelley Funke-Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, and Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, were the sponsors of resolutions to establish the group. The task force will explore ways to implement directives from the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, policies. During a committee hearing on her resolution, Funke-Frommeyer said “this is our starting point” to start addressing Kentucky’s dismal health statistics. The commonwealth has high rates of diabetes and cancer deaths, maternal mortality and more.

Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force

This task force is the only one of the five with bipartisan co-chairs, Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton, and Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson. While Webb sponsored the Senate resolution for the task force, Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, introduced the House resolution. Webb said during the floor debate on her resolution that she had been working on the idea of the task force for some time, but the Senate considered the resolution on the heels of statewide floods and winter storms in February. Kentucky has faced more weather-related challenges, such as tornadoes and flooding, since lawmakers adjourned the 2025 session.

Artificial Intelligence Task Force

Both Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, and Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, chaired the AI task force in 2024 but saw more policy areas to explore when it comes to possible state legislation on AI. This year, the General Assembly passed initial legislation to regulate AI in state government carried by Bledsoe. The co-chairs were part of an April panel on AI and discussed ways the technology could be used in health care, energy, education and more.

States’ AI laws may be impacted by actions at the federal level. The budget bill passed by the House last week includes a 10-year moratorium on enforcement of state AI laws as a way to a patchwork of different policies nationwide.

Housing Task Force

Last year, lawmakers on the Housing Task Force compiled information to better understand the state’s housing needs. The task force is continuing this year under co-chairs, Senate Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson, and Rep. Susan Tyler Witten, R-Louisville. In a final report released ahead of the 2025 legislative session, the task force found that local elected officials are confronting a problem exacerbated by a boom of jobs in some communities and natural disasters in others. This year, the task force will review issues around housing availability, affordability and development statewide this interim session.

Suniva is not alone in choosing PERC technology for its US cell production, when most of the international solar market has switched to n-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) technology.

ISC Konstanz said PERC was “particularly suitable” for the US, “as it relies on proven, highly efficient technology to maximise production output, which is critical in supporting the United States’ resurgent module manufacturing sector and the overwhelming demand for domestic content in the country’s home markets.”

TOPCon technology has also become the subject of a broad swathe of intellectual property (IP) litigation. PV Tech Premium spoke with emergent US cell producer ES Foundry earlier this year, which said that it opted for PERC technology because of the number of TOPCon IP cases sweeping the industry.

Domestic cell content

Matt Card, president of Suniva, said: “The evolving US regulatory landscape places extreme importance on the need for domestically-produced solar cells.”

Indeed, last week the US House of Representatives passed a bill which promised to massively cut the incentives for solar PV deployment and manufacturing under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Crucially for the US solar manufacturing industry, restrictions on “Foreign Entities of Concern” (FEOC) could potentially cause huge disruption to the supply chain. Though the 45X Advanced Manufacturing credit was broadly preserved in the bill, the language around FEOC could render products from Chinese or Chinese-backed companies unusable. These products overwhelmingly dominate the global solar supply chain, and the US is still largely reliant on imports from abroad to supply its emerging solar manufacturing sector, which consists mostly of module production facilities.

“The main concern for the prohibited foreign entity provisions would be the limitation on receiving ‘material assistance’ from companies with ties to China or other ‘covered nations,'” Don Lonczak, partner at US law firm Pillsbury told PV Tech. He continued: “Basically, any component or subcomponent obtained from such a company could result in full denial of the tax credits.”

PV Tech Premium analysed the potential impact of the FEOC provisions in the draft House bill last week.

Last week, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation favorably reported out the WIPPES Act (S.1092), as amended, on a voice-vote. The legislation now heads to the Senate Floor where it awaits to be scheduled for consideration and a vote. Importantly, the amendment to S. 1092 by the committee does not substantively change the intent of the bill, its enforcement gravity if enacted into law, and does not conflict with California’s existing state “Do Not Flush” labeling law. This success is due to the bill’s commonsense policy, diverse stakeholder support from a wide cross-section of those engaged on this issue, and CASA’s continued effective and collaborative leadership on this issue that has now spanned two Congresses.

White House Transmits FY2026 Budget Request to Congress: Support Requested

Last month, the White House transmitted the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget request to Congress, marking the official start of the annual appropriations process and identifies the Administration’s spending priorities. However, while the budget request outlines what the Administration would like to be funded, and not funded, Congress makes the ultimate funding decisions. As a result, the budget request, in its original form, is often considered colloquially as “dead on arrival.” The new fiscal year starts on October 1. However, Congress has a proven track record of missing this deadline.

The budget request’s recommendation to reduce the SRF by $2.46 billion risks jeopardizing the ability for CASA agencies, and other clean water agencies, to fulfill basic public health and environmental protection responsibilities. Given the stated desire of congressional appropriations leadership to continue to support the SRF, CASA agencies are encouraged to underscore this by writing to your congressional delegations urging Congress protect the SRF in FY2026. Template letters for House and Senate offices have been developed to help with this outreach. If you have any questions, please contact CASA’s federal advocate, Sarah Sapirstein at ssap@ensresources.com.

Following the transmittal, the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have begun the process of reviewing the request. As part of this process, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Administrator, Lee Zeldin, testified before the House and Senate Subcommittees on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies to the Administration’s USEPA FY2026 budget request. During both hearings, subcommittee leadership, on a bipartisan basis, voiced strong concerns about the request’s severe cut of $2.46 billion to the State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF), citing it as a critical program, and that it is imperative to continue to fund the program. While leadership did not specify a funding level for the SRF for FY2026, more details will be available in the coming months as the subcommittees draft their respective spending bills.

USEPA Unveils PFAS Action Strategy

At the end of last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the Agency will be taking major actions to address PFAS contamination. The actions are the first round with future USEPA actions to be announced. The actions are guided by the Agency’s stated principles of 1) strengthening science, 2) fulfilling statutory obligations and enhancing communication, and 3) building partnerships. USEPA offices, including the Office of Water and Office of Solid Waste, with jurisdiction over the identified actions will begin coordination efforts to implement the Administrator’s strategy.

In the April 28 announcement, USEPA outlined a series of actions to address PFAS contamination. Many of the listed actions align with CASA’s advocacy, policy and regulatory priorities on the issue and what the clean water sector’s role should be as a partner in responding to PFAS contamination. Most notably is the action for the Agency to work with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that operates on polluter pays and protects passive receivers. This action aligns with CASA’s priority that clean water agencies are not held liable for cleanup costs associated with PFAS contamination following their hazardous substance designation under Superfund.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Chevron shareholders voted against three stockholder proposals during the U.S. oil producer's annual meeting on Wednesday, including one calling for a report on the company's human rights practices, while larger rival Exxon Mobil faced no investor resolutions for the first time in decades.

There have been fewer resolutions on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters this year than they did in 2024 and 2023 due to lack of investor appetite for such proposals. Lower-than-expected returns in renewable energy projects have also shifted shareholders' focus back to oil and gas.

Chevron investors rejected a resolution that would have allowed holders of at least 10% of the company's common stock to call special meetings. They also voted down a proposal to produce a report about whether company investments in renewable energy could result in so-called stranded assets, or projects that lose value prematurely, according to preliminary voting results on Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, Exxon's annual meeting featured no qualifying shareholder resolutions for the first time since 1958.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods said he attributed that to the company's performance that has outpaced competitors, and to Exxon's willingness to fight back against proposals he said were a detriment to the business.

Investors approved all director nominees and executive compensation plans for both companies.

The traditional auto industry is nearing a breaking point. The old order is starting to crumble due to a combination of seven unprecedented changes.

First, we’ve hit Peak Auto. New car sales were higher 25 years ago than today, even though the U.S. population has grown by 58 million people. If the same percentage of Americans bought a new car as they did in the year 2000, automakers would have sold 22 million vehicles last year, not 16 million. The trend lines suggest we’ll never go back to previous levels.

Second, technology is upending the way cars are designed, engineered and manufactured. Software defined vehicles, zonal-centralized computing platforms and digital twins are obsoleting the old way of doing things.

Third, the industry invested billions of dollars in electric vehicles that haven’t paid off. While EV sales continue to grow, they’re not growing fast enough. Worse, for the auto industry, Congress just eliminated EV incentives.

Fourth, the talent shortage. President Donald Trump wants to bring back manufacturing, but who’s going to work in the factories? Every company I visit says their Number One problem is getting the people they need. There are currently half a million manufacturing jobs nationwide going begging.

Fifth, China. The country now leads the global auto industry in technology, innovation and speed to market. While Chinese automakers are effectively banned from the U.S. market, they’re on a global export binge like we’ve never seen before.

Sixth, tariffs. They have crippled the highly efficient North American supply chain. Tariffs may buy time for Americans to catch up to the Chinese, but they do nothing to solve the problems listed here.

Seventh, government regulations. The EPA is focusing on CO2 regulations. NHTSA sets fuel economy regulations. But the only way we know how to cut CO2 emissions is by burning less fuel, which is effectively a fuel economy regulation. The EPA’s CO2 regulations and NHTSA’s CAFE regulations are trying to achieve the same thing, but with different targets, timetables and procedures.

Here’s a suggestion. Why not get rid of NHTSA’s CAFE standard and simply rely on the EPA’s CO2 standards? The end result will be about the same, but it would get rid of a ton of regulation.

Meanwhile, NHTSA writes safety regulations that add more structure and safety technology to cars that makes them heavier, which means they burn more fuel and emit more emissions. And yet, even with all this safety equipment, traffic fatalities are 30% higher than before that equipment was added. It seems like we need to rethink the whole approach.

Instead of different agencies writing rules that duplicate each other, or even conflict, why not establish one Office of Automotive Regulation? It could issue regulations that are stable and predictable. I believe we can regulate the auto industry a lot more efficiently and still achieve world-class levels of clean air, fuel efficiency and vehicle safety.

All the problems the auto industry faces are invisible to the general public and the country’s political leadership. When it comes to lobbying in Washington, D.C., the industry punches well below its weight. Imagine if the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the OEMs), the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association (the suppliers), the National Auto Dealers Association and the UAW all spoke with one voice. They could exert enormous political power.

It is in the self-interest of the United States to have a healthy and vibrant automotive industry. It is an economic engine for the economy and critical to the country's national defense. It’s time for a comprehensive national strategy to keep it that way. We lose by waiting, so let’s get going.

That’s good news for the offshore wind industry, which had already been struggling with elevated financing costs.

That’s good news for the offshore wind industry, which had already been struggling with elevated financing costs. But with the budget bill under debate in Congress, the industry still faces a difficult political environment.

One person who’s happy that Empire Wind is back under construction is Gordon Videll.

“Literally this morning we just got another contract, so things are looking good,” he said.

Videll’s company, Sea Services, helps ensure that offshore wind construction doesn’t damage undersea cables or other infrastructure.

“We provide safety vessels to make sure the assets are protected,” he said.

And while Videll is glad to work on the $5 billion Empire Wind project, expected to power half a million homes, he’s less confident about what comes next.

“After these projects, there’s probably gonna be a lull,” he said.

Because all the policy whiplash, he said, could chill new investment. President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at halting offshore wind, even as he declared the country to be in an energy emergency.

David Victor, an energy researcher at UC San Diego, said offshore wind projects already take years to plan and finance, and the federal government’s stance isn’t helping.

“You’re not quite sure what they’re doing or why they’re doing, or whether they’re gonna come after you next,” Victor said.

The Republican budget bill could also eliminate federal tax credits for offshore wind, said Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind energy research at BloombergNEF.

“If we see the end of tax credits, then making the economic case for any future projects would be very, very difficult,” Metcalfe said.

This could put a dent in domestic manufacturing too. Kris Ohleth heads the think tank Special Initiative on Offshore Wind. And she said companies had announced plans to build equipment here in the U.S., including underwater transmission cables.

Now though, “The policies of the Trump administration are actually pushing these supply chain and manufacturing companies to other countries,” Ohleth said.

But, she said, states remain committed to offshore wind. Especially in the northeast, where demand for energy is high, but there’s not much room for siting projects on land.

“Yes, it's a three to four year delay from the federal level, but there is a lot of work to be done on the state side,” said Alicia Gené Artessa with the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. “And so we can work on building out our transmission infrastructure.”

So that someday down the line, she said, the state will be ready to buy power from a new crop of offshore wind projects.",https://img.apmcdn.org/245bc7d3edfb4f96b1ff2eabf2740ae1cb03b5df/widescreen/a93935-20250528-waters-off-block-island-host-america-s-first-offshore-wind-farm-2000.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 12:27:16.322310

Since then, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued three additional orders related to electricity generation or transmission in Puerto Rico (here and here) and Michigan (here) under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act (FPA).

These orders aim to ensure grid reliability amidst challenges involving weather, infrastructure, and shifts in energy policy. As we discuss below, while these orders may appear ideological, they are targeted to specific local problems that could cause blackouts.

Resilience in US Generation Policy

Federal and state governments, along with private actors, play crucial roles in US electric generation policymaking. The DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) set national energy policies, while state governments implement local priorities, leading to a diverse energy landscape. Weather impacts both electric demand and infrastructure itself. Federal and state officials share the responsibility to responding to weather events, with federal officials responsible for setting standards for resilience projects, funding initiatives, and coordinating emergency response.

In April, the president issued an Executive Order titled “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid,” which expanded the role of the federal government in energy policy. Specifically, it authorized the use of emergency powers to require existing fossil fuel-fired power plants to stay online. Citing its earlier declaration of a “National Energy Emergency,” the Administration preemptively invoked Section 202 of the FPA, which allows FERC to require specific energy generation or facility interconnection to meet energy demands in times of war or emergency. The three orders discussed below are the first the Administration has issued under this authority.

May 16 Puerto Rico Orders

Puerto Rico’s electrical grid faces challenges stemming both from geography (i.e., being a tropical island without fossil fuel resources) as well as history (e.g., underinvestment and weather events, including three hurricanes and major earthquakes in the past decade). In April, following an island-wide blackout, the governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Order EO-2025-016, declaring a state of emergency for Puerto Rico’s electric system.

On May 16, citing Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, DOE issued two emergency orders to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA). The first order sets out emergency measures for generation and the second sets out emergency measures for transmission. The orders together compel short-term actions to address well-known risks to the stability of Puerto Rico’s electric grid.

The risks are both recently chronicled and not in dispute. This year, a systems analysis, conducted by Puerto Rican officials, determined that any major generation unit anywhere on the island would result in significant numbers of Puerto Ricans losing access to power. To minimize potential power losses, DOE ordered that 34 fossil-fuel fired units, some of them mothballed, be made available for 90 days (subject to being extended) to promote grid reliability.

In terms of transmission, DOE’s order also notes that Puerto Rico’s transmission lines are “currently operated with up to 70% derating to avoid failures from infrastructure conditions (e.g. line sagging into vegetation)” and that lack of vegetation control on transmission and distribution rights-of-ways is “one of the main causes of power failures.” Localized transmission failures can cascade into larger issues. Accordingly, DOE ordered PREPA to reestablish rights-of-way by managing vegetation and report back to DOE on its progress in 90 days, with DOE deploying regulatory heft to addressing long-term issues to the Puerto Rico electric grid.

The Michigan Order

A week later, DOE issued an emergency order to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Consumers Energy directing them to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant [set to close on May 31, 2025] is available to operate.” The Campbell plant was rated to produce 1,560 MW of electricity. This order trumps a state order — supported by the facility owner — to shut down the plant.

The Michigan order noted that “[m]ultiple generation facilities in Michigan have retired in recent years” and since “2020, about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generation capacity have been retired and no new coal-fired facilities are planned.” Indeed, since the middle of 2024, 1,575 megawatts of capacity were retired. A regulatory assessment issued May 14 forecast an increased potential for regulatory shortfalls. To address these forecasted shortfalls, the order requires that, for a period of 90 days, MISO and Consumers must “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate. For the duration of this order, MISO is directed to take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” The essential effect of this order is that the Campbell Plant will continue to operate for at least the next 90 days to better allow DOE to understand whether shutting down the plant will negatively affect the overall electric grid.

What to Watch

We’ve talked a lot about the Administration’s energy deregulation. How do the DOE orders listed above fit within that deregulation scheme? Here are three notable points about how they may be consistent:

1. The Orders are Not Necessarily Ideological

It is easy to see power generation as an ideological issue particularly in light of the Administration’s desire to “Reinvigorate America’s Beautiful Clean Coal.” But, at least in the short term, fossil fuel generation would continue in Puerto Rico as it always has because, according to federal regulators, fossil fuel plants accounted for 93% of Puerto Rico’s generation capacity in 2024, with petroleum-fired power plants themselves accounting for 62%. Rather than encouraging the reduction of fossil fuels, the orders largely seem focused on minimizing blackouts.

2. Local Control of Power Generation Isn’t Ending

The orders likely reflect a cautious approach intended to promote grid stability and likely do not themselves address the transition from fossil fuels. The orders in both states react to local conditions, such as recent grid instability in Puerto Rico and Michigan’s spate of fossil fuel resource retirement. In both locations, the orders are at least nominally consistent with local political realities. The transmission-focused order in Puerto Rico indicates that some of the concerns raised in the order originated at recent meetings with local stakeholders. Puerto Rican government officials reportedly supported the orders. In Michigan, this order followed a May 7 county commission resolution requesting that state regulators postpone the plant’s retirement.

3. The Orders Will Last Longer Than Previous 202(c) Orders

Finally, the FPA 202(c) orders here initially last 90 days with requirements for reporting back to DOE. When DOE has used emergency orders in the past, the authorizations have generally lasted hours or days — not months — and are frequently tied to specific events like weather. (See examples here and here.) During the first Administration DOE entertained (but denied) a request from coal-related generation concerns to keep a number of coal-fired plants running for grid reliability concerns using the same provision.

The Puerto Rico and Michigan orders were issued under FPA Section 202(c) and were intended to address “emergency” situations, rather than FPA Section 202(b), which federal regulators have historically used to improve operational efficiency and reliability of the electric grid under non-emergency conditions. The longer-than-typical duration of these emergency orders and the nature of the “emergency” is unique and worth monitoring.",https://www.afslaw.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-02/ENERGY_CLEANTECH_0.jpg.webp?itok=nqrBfGUs,N,,2025-05-28 15:33:42.343969

In parallel, the House of Representatives' budget bill limits availability of most non-nuclear tax credits.

Nuclear Executive Orders

On May 23, 2025, President Trump issued four Executive Orders, entitled ""Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base"", ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"", ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"", and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"", which intend to broadly expand and support the production and use of nuclear energy with the goal of reestablishing the United States as a global leader in the sector. The Executive Orders mandate multiple governmental agencies to identify the current state of nuclear fuel, waste disposal and uranium conversion capacity, and recommend policies to improve these capabilities, reduce regulation where possible, and provide for government funding of nuclear projects and their related supply chains. The Executive Orders also mandate the acceleration of the licensing approval process for new nuclear reactors and the creation of a pilot program for reactor construction and operation.

These Executive Orders demonstrate the importance the current administration places on nuclear energy, which is considered crucial to support energy intensive industries, particularly data centers for artificial intelligence. According to the International Energy Agency, ""China and the United States are the most significant regions for data center electricity consumption growth, accounting for nearly 80% of global growth to 2030, with a consumption increase of around 240 TWh (up 130%) compared to the 2024 level"".1

Adapting the legal and regulatory framework to accelerate the development and deployment of nuclear technologies and increase the use of nuclear power in the energy mix has become a national priority in the United States.

Strengthening and Financing the Nuclear Fuel Cycle

As nuclear has made a dramatic comeback these last few years after decades of disinterest, the nuclear sector needs to rebuild not only its supply chain but also its workforce. These last few years have seen a resurgence of innovation through the development of numerous new reactors by historic nuclear vendors (i.e. Westinghouse and GE-Hitachi), national laboratories (i.e. Idaho and Oak Ridge) and start-ups (i.e. Holtec, NuScale, Last Energy and X-Energy). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (""IAEA""), over 20 small modular reactor (""SMR"") designs are currently under development in the U.S., and around 15 SMR start-ups have been established—highlighting the vibrant innovation driving the American nuclear sector.

The ""Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base"" Executive Order includes provisions that strengthen educational pathways in the industry and increases potential funding of nuclear projects. The Executive Order directs the Secretary of Energy, through the Loan Programs Office of the Department of Energy (""DOE""), to prioritize making available resources for restarting closed nuclear power plants, increase power output of operating nuclear power plants, complete construction of nuclear reactors that were prematurely suspended, construct new advanced SMRs, and improve the nuclear fuel supply chain. By the end of this year, the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration must prioritize funding for qualified advanced nuclear reactor technologies through grants, loans, investment capital, funding opportunities, and other available support. In this respect, the DOE is also instructed to prioritize work with the nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030. One of the latest initiatives to fund the nuclear sector has been the DOE's Generation III+ SMR program2, which is intended to fund up to US$ 900 million for the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors by scaling the production and deployment of reactors to stimulate nuclear industry.

The Executive Order further directs the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads, to issue a report by January 18, 2026, with recommendations regarding:

the management of nuclear fuel and high-level waste and the development and deployment of fuel cycle capabilities (since the termination of the project to locate a deep geological repository (""DGR"") in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, there has been no other project regarding the final disposal of high-level waste in the U.S. Worldwide, there is currently one finalized DGR in Finland, and two under construction in France and Sweden);

the reprocessing and recycling of nuclear fuel, including the efficient use and disposal of uranium and other products recovered through such processes. The U.S. does not reprocess nor recycle its nuclear fuel. While several European countries (including France and the United Kingdom), Russia, China and Japan have policies to reprocess used fuel, only a few countries actually have a reprocessing capacity currently (i.e. France, India, Russia and the United Kingdom);

plans for decommissioning existing nuclear reactors, to make the process more efficient;

the methods and technologies to transport used and unused advanced nuclear fuels and advanced nuclear reactors, domestically and overseas. Without the necessary transportation capacity to support an increase of nuclear material transportation around the world, including the carriage of sealed micro-reactors containing nuclear fuel, it will be difficult to operate national and international nuclear projects.

In addition, the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads and the Chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC""), is directed to develop, by September 20, 2025, a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and enrichment capabilities to meet both civilian and defense reactor needs. This aims to complement the Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act of 2024, which is currently implemented with a number of waivers that may be applied for until January 1, 2028.3

Facilitating National and International Deployment of U.S. Nuclear Reactors

The Executive Orders on ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"" and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"" emphasize the importance of civilian nuclear power and the national security importance of reliable nuclear energy. These Executive Orders seek to strengthen the nuclear reactor infrastructure and increase nuclear exports. They add to the framework established by the International Nuclear Energy Act (""INEA"") and the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act (""ADVANCE Act""), both of 2023.

The Executive Orders on ""Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy"" and ""Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security"" both task the Secretary of Energy, jointly with other agency heads, to determine before the fall 2025:

a regulatory and procedural infrastructure that expedites the review, approval, and deployment of qualifying advanced test reactors to operate at DOE owned or controlled facilities within 2 years following a substantially complete application.

eliminate or expedite environmental reviews, including determining which DOE functions are not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (""NEPA""), creating categorical exclusions as appropriate for reactors within certain parameters (or relying on existing categorical exclusions), and relying on supplemental analyses where reactors will be located on existing sites.

a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside of National Laboratories, with at least three being approved and achieving criticality by July 4, 2026.

determine a strategy that optimizes the financial support that the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank and other relevant agencies may provide to projects of national strategic interest developed by recently graduated high income economies utilizing U.S. civil nuclear technology.

The Secretary of State is also directed to pursue at least 20 Agreements for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation (or ‘123 Agreements') by the close of the 120th Congress (January 3, 2029) to enable the U.S. nuclear industry to access new markets in partner countries and fully leverage the resources of the Federal Government to promote the United States nuclear industry in the development of commercial civil nuclear projects globally. The United States has entered into 25 ‘123 Agreements' covering 49 countries and Taiwan to date.

The Secretaries of Energy and State must now, subject to consultation with the NRC, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense, approve or deny technology transfer export authorization requests within 30 days of receipt of a complete application and completion by the DOE of the required accompanying analysis, excluding any time period waiting for (i) concurrence from the Department of State; and (ii) retransfer and nonproliferation assurances to be received from the government of the country where the export is proposed to be sent.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Reform

The NRC was already directed by the 2019 Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (""NEIMA"") and the ADVANCE Act to streamline the process and lower costs for licensing of advanced nuclear reactors by for example reducing the licensing fees for advanced SMRs, eliminating the costs for pre-application activities and early site permits at the DOE sites or other locations implicating national security, and initiating rulemaking to support the development of small modular reactors on brownfield sites such as retired coal-fired power facilities.

The Executive Order on ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"" intends to ensure that the NRC commits to the following along with other related objectives:

to consider the benefits of increased availability of and innovation in nuclear power to national security and economic interests when carrying out licensing and related regulatory functions.

to increase new reactor licensing.

to undertake a review and revision of regulations and guidance documents in order to establish fixed deadlines in its evaluation and approval procedures and ensuring that its conclusions regarding the licensing process are delivered within 18 months, instead of following its nonbinding ""generic milestone schedules"" guidelines.

establish an expedited pathway to approve reactor designs that the Department of Defense or the DOE have tested and that have demonstrated the ability to function safely, by aiming to focus solely on risks that may arise from new applications permitted by the NRC licensing, rather than revisiting risks that have already been addressed by the other departments' processes.

The ""Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"" Executive Order is the second one to be issued by the current administration. The ""Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies"" Executive Order, issued on February 18, 2025 requires that any significant regulatory actions taken by independent regulatory agencies, including the NRC, be subject to the White House oversight. This Executive Order allows the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to set performance standards and management objectives to ensure consistency with the President's policies and priorities, while also allowing for adjustments in agency apportionments where appropriate to aid in advancement of such policies and priorities.

Tax Credits Bill

The Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") provided for an eight-year production tax credit for qualifying existing nuclear power plants and new technology neutral zero-emission production, as well as investment tax credits for new, advanced nuclear energy facilities.

On May 23, 2025, the House of Representatives passed ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" that, unless modified by the Senate, will significantly narrow the availability of several types of tax credits. The bill repeals clean energy, technology neutral electricity generation and storage tax credits provided under the IRA, such as §45Y and §48E credits for projects beginning construction 60 days after enactment as law, with projects that begin construction after such date needing to be placed in service by December 31, 2028, to receive the tax credits.

However, the bill provides beneficial treatment to nuclear project §45U (zero-emission nuclear power production) tax credit provided under the IRA by extending the credit at its full value and with full transferability through to 2031. Notably, the §48C (clean energy manufacturing and recycling, industrial decarbonization, and critical mineral projects) tax credit that was originally established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and renewed and expanded under the IRA, remains unchanged by the bill. The effect of the bill on tax credits is the subject of an extensive review published by White & Case here.

Campbell Plant in West Olive was originally slated to shut down May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy.
We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed.
As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Scripps said.
The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” the spokesperson said.","The Trump administration has issued an emergency order directing a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to remain open for operation through at least the end of summer.

The J.H. Campbell Plant in West Olive was originally slated to shut down May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy.

But the Department of Energy (DOE) warned of heightened risk of blackouts this summer and stressed the need to address “critical grid security issues” in the Midwest, especially “ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”

“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release Friday.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” he continued.

The DOE cited a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation indicating the region serviced by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) is “at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.”

The report points to the planned retirement of certain power plants as a key factor contributing to the heightened risk, as well as the “supply shortfalls” later in the summer when the sun sets earlier in the day and produces less energy.

But Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, pushed back on the order in a statement, calling it “unnecessary” and saying it “will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.”

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” Scripps said.

“The MPSC will continue to work with MISO and Consumers Energy to assess the impacts of the DOE’s order and work to limit unnecessary cost increases imposed as a result of this order,” he continued.

A spokesperson for Consumers Energy said it “plans to comply with the Department of Energy order.”

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO. The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” the spokesperson said.

But the chairman of the Michigan Public Service Commission says no energy emergency exists and the move will increase customer costs.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced the emergency order May 23, calling for Consumers Energy's J.H.

The J.H. Campbell Complex began operating in 1962 and generates up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity — enough to serve a million people. The 2,000-acre facility was named after James H. Campbell, a former president of Consumers Energy from 1960 to 1972.

The utility in recent years announced plans to provide coal-free power generation and reduce its carbon emissions by 90% by 2025, 15 years faster than earlier projections. By 2040 Consumers Energy officials expected 90% of their electric generation to come from cleaner energy sources.

Consumers Energy officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration cited its emergency authority under the Federal Power Act, which allows the secretary of energy to require temporary connections of facilities and generation, delivery, interchange or transmission of energy as the secretary determines will best meet an emergency and serve the public interest during a time that the U.S. is engaged in a war ""or when an emergency exists by reason of a sudden increase in the demand for electric energy, or a shortage of electric energy, or of facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy"" or other causes.

May 8, 2025

An increasingly warming climate intensified the deluge of rain that fell on Kentucky and other states in early April, according to a new report from a multinational academic group that studies climate change’s connections to extreme weather events.

Torrential downpours inundated communities across Kentucky in early April, with some parts of Western Kentucky receiving more than a foot of rain in just four days. Some waterways including the Kentucky River in Frankfort crested at near-record highs as Kentuckians were forced to evacuate low-lying homes and businesses. Dozens of counties declared states of emergency, hundreds of roadways were closed and Gov. Andy Beshear said the storms were responsible for the deaths of seven Kentuckians.

A report from World Weather Attribution found, based on climate modeling, that the extreme rainfall across Kentucky and seven other states was about 9% more intense because of warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, that already has occurred.

Climate change increased the likelihood of the extreme rainfall — which pulled its moisture from a significantly hotter Gulf of Mexico — by about 40% compared to a cooler climate according to the report. The likelihood of such a rainfall event is still relatively rare, the report authors found, at about a 1 in 100-year event.

Bernadette Woods-Placky, a chief meteorologist at the New Jersey-based nonprofit research organization Climate Central, said in a Wednesday briefing that it’s hard to discern how climate change impacted flooding in specific waterways and communities without studying the hydrology of each area.

But she said an increase in flooding intensity, even if marginal, can be significant when talking about a “tipping point” of whether a river crests a bank or barrier that’s holding it back.

“If you hit that tipping point, then it floods over to everything. And so the littlest bit in certain areas can make a huge impact,” Woods-Placky said. “A warmer atmosphere forces more evaporation, so our atmosphere in general has more water to come down whenever there’s a trigger, wherever there’s a trigger. So that’s why we’re seeing, overall, an increase in heavy rain events.” Basil Griffin Park in Bowling Green remains inundated on April 7 after days of heavy rain.

Friederike Otto, an author of the report and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said while the methods used in the report have been peer reviewed, the study on the April rainfall has not yet been peer reviewed.

Based on modeling, the report predicts that if current climate policies across the globe remain consistent, the climate will warm by approximately 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2100; in that case, extreme rainfall events “are expected to approximately double in likelihood again” and further increase in intensity by another 7%. Earth recorded its hottest year on record in 2024, crossing a warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius that the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 aimed to avoid exceeding.

Otto, the report author at Imperial College London, said significant increases in the likelihood of such weather events from climate change could also compound the costs of recovery in communities hit repeatedly by flooding. If recovery from an extreme weather event costs billions of dollars, having it happen again could transform “what extreme weather can mean for a community.”

Those speaking Wednesday also commended the National Weather Service’s preparedness and early warnings of the incoming weather last month across multiple states, saying it was vital in protecting people and property.

Woods-Placky advocated for the national agency in light of reporting that multiple NWS offices across the country, including three offices covering almost the entirety of Kentucky, were without a chief meteorologist to lead teams of forecasters and other staff.

“They did some tremendous work, and they did save lives,” Woods-Placky said.",https://mountaincitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/climate-change-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 16:14:23.072500

Law 15,042/24 (the “Consumption Tax Reform”) was a milestone for the regulation of Brazil's carbon market. It established the regulated market called the Brazilian Emissions Trading System (SBCE), recognized the ""voluntary market,"" and established tax rules for the trade of carbon credits. Simultaneously, Complementary Law 214/25 regulated various aspects of the Consumption Tax Reform, providing for the introduction of new consumption taxes (IBS and CBS) in 2026.

To explain the tax treatment on the sale of carbon credits and clarify some important points, we have prepared this analysis of the tax treatment after Law 15,042/24 takes effect (from 2025) and after Complementary Law 214/25 (from 2026), with a special focus on the controversy over the levying of IBS and CBS on ""carbon credits.""

Below is a summary of the content and download the complete content at the end.

Introduction

The main innovation of Law 15,042/24 was the creation of a typical cap-and-trade system called the Brazilian Emissions Trading System (SBCE) for operators responsible for sources that emit more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually. The SBCE will be implemented in phases and is currently in Phase 1 of its regulation.

In addition to establishing a ""regulated market"" per se, Law 15.042/24 also recognized the ""voluntary market"" as the environment characterized by carbon credit transactions (a tradable, autonomous asset, representing the effective retention, reduction, or removal of one ton of CO2 emissions) voluntarily established between the parties, for the purposes of voluntary offsetting CO2 emissions.

The ""voluntary market"" for selling carbon credits is already a reality. There are several projects underway in Brazil by private and public entities, spanning a wide variety of techniques (e.g., forestry, renewable energy, biofuels) and at the center of numerous tax controversies.

Tax Landscape

There is some consensus among tax practitioners that the sale of carbon credits is not taxed by Local Services Tax (ISS) because it does not constitute the provision of services; it is not taxed by State Value-Added Tax (ICMS) because it does not constitute the sale of goods (whether tangible or intangible); and it is not taxed by the Federal Excise Tax (IPI) because it does not involve industrialization or an operation assimilated to industrialization by law.

Thus, until 2024, the taxation of carbon credits was restricted to social contributions on net revenue (PIS/COFINS) and Corporate Taxes (IRPJ/CSLL). The main controversies regarding these taxes can be summarized as follows:

For the Carbon Credit Originator opting for the Presumed Profit and cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: What would be the percentage of presumed profitability to be applied: (i) standard percentages of 8% for IRPJ and 12% for CSLL, or (ii) 32% for IRPJ and CSLL provided for ""assignment of rights"".

For the Carbon Credit Originator opting for the Real Profit and non-cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: What would be the applicable PIS/COFINS rate: (i) standard tax rate of 9.25%, or (ii) reduces tax rate of 4.65% provided for ""financial revenues"".

For the Carbon Credit Acquirer opting for Real Profit and non-cumulative PIS/COFINS regime: Whether the expenditure on the carbon credit would generate PIS/COFINS credit on inputs, and if it would be a deductible expense for corporate taxes purposes.

Repercussions and Changes

Law 15,042/24, effective as of January 2025, eliminated all of these controversies: (i) it provides for the non-levy of PIS/COFINS on revenues from the sale of carbon credits (art. 19); (ii) ensures the deductibility for IRPJ and CSLL purposes of expenditures on carbon credits (art. 18); and (iii) institutes a specific system of taxation for IRPJ and CSLL purposes (iii.1) in presumed profit, as a ""capital gain"" without applying any percentage of presumed profitability, and (iii.2) in real profit, under the ""net gains"" regime for sales on the stock exchange or ""capital gain"" for sales off the stock exchange.

Thus, as of January 2025, the sale of carbon credits will not be subject to ICMS, ISS, IPI (as they are not taxable events), and PIS/COFINS (as expressly provided for in Law 15,042/24). Only IRPJ/CSLL will be taxed, in accordance with the special taxation rule indicated above.

With the regulation of the Consumer Tax Reform by Complementary Law 214/25, the new taxes (IBS and CBS) will be levied from 2026 in a ""test phase."" From 2027 onwards, CBS will be levied, and PIS/COFINS will be abolished. From 2029, IBS will be levied, with a staggered reduction in ICMS and ISS.

The main controversy is over the incidence of IBS/CBS on ""carbon credits.""

On the one hand, it could be argued that the IBS/CBS levy is possible because Article 156-A of the Federal Constitution (included by EC N. 132/23) allows IBS and CBS to be levied on ""material or immaterial goods, including rights,"" and Complementary Law N. 214/25 made no exception for the sale of carbon credits. Thus, unlike the ISS and ICMS, the legal nature of carbon credits (tradable assets representing the retention, reduction, or removal of one ton of CO2 emissions) does not prevent IBS and CBS from being levied.

On the other hand, it should be noted that Article 146 §3 of the Federal Constitution (also included by EC N. 132/23) provides that the National Tax System must observe the principle of environmental protection. Charging the IBS/CBS - at least, without any mechanism for presumed credits or cashback - would significantly increase the tax burden purchases in the voluntary carbon credit market by non-IBS and CBS taxpayers (e.g. individuals) or taxpayers not subject to the regular IBS and CBS regime. It appears to violate the constitutional requirement to protect the environment.

What Conclusions Can We Draw?

As of January 2025, the sale of carbon credits will not be subject to any consumption taxes (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS). Income tax will only be levied on the capital gain from origination/trading, in accordance with the special rules set out in Law 15,042/24.

As of January 2027, CBS will be levied instead of PIS/COFINS. There is some controversy over the possibility of levying the tax on carbon credits because charging the CBS (and later the IBS) - at least without any mechanism for presumed credits or cashback - would significantly increase the tax burden for purchases in the voluntary carbon credit market by non-IBS and CBS taxpayers (e.g. individuals) or taxpayers not subject to the regular IBS and CBS regime.","https://www.mayerbrown.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=400,quality=90,format=jpeg/-/media/images/tile-images-for-insights-and-news/tile_bucket-300x400_56.jpg?rev=a5b1d3df461c4b7b87770f128eeb7869",N,,2025-05-28 12:27:20.592150

Feds line up with Republican states in climate-investing case

U.S. federal antitrust enforcers last week expressed support for arguments wielded by Republican states accusing asset managers BlackRock, BLK Vanguard and State Street STT of conspiring through climate activism to decrease coal output.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission came in a case brought by Texas and 12 other states. Their complaint claims the firms used their substantial holdings in U.S. coal companies to discourage competition, such as through their past involvement in an investor climate group.

The entry of the federal officials raises the stakes for the case that tests how freely the three fund firms may act with the combined $27 trillion they manage for investors. Given how much criticism there has been from Republicans - many from energy-producing states - of environmental investment practices, the filing hardly comes as a surprise.

But it serves as the agencies' signal to the market that they care about the area, said Megan Gerking, a partner with law firm Morrison Foerster following the case. ""This statement of interest is a shot across the bow by the administration's new antitrust leadership against asset managers - and potentially others - regarding investments and related conduct connected to sustainability objectives,"" Gerking told me via e-mail.

The companies have pushed back, with BlackRock taking the strongest line to call the case baseless and ""based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production."" Forcing the fund firms to divest from coal companies — one outcome sought by the state plaintiffs — would harm the companies' access to capital and likely raise energy prices. The new agency support for the case undermines the goal of American energy independence, BlackRock said.

In March the companies asked a federal court to dismiss the case. A hearing is set for June 9. You can read more of our coverage by clicking here.

In internal documents, the agency said carbon dioxide does not significantly contribute to pollution, and eliminating greenhouse gas emissions would not tangibly impact public safety, the Times reported May 23.

Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, was unable to independently verify those documents. But an EPA spokesperson May 27, while declining to explicitly confirm the Times report, said that the agency was ""developing a proposed rule"" on power plant emissions that would be published following an interagency review. The spokesperson said the agency would use the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which overturned the Obama administration's ""Clean Power Plan,"" to argue that Biden-era power plant emissions limits overstepped the agency's authority.

Separately, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said, ""President Trump promised to kill the Clean Power Plan in his first term, and we continue to build on that progress now. In reconsidering the Biden-Harris rule that ran afoul of Supreme Court case law, we are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

The EPA in March said it would ""reconsider"" the Biden-era rule. Finalized in April 2024, the rule imposed the first-ever limits on CO2 emissions from existing coal-fired and new gas-fired power plants. The rule, which effectively requires coal plants to install carbon capture technology or retire, drew praise from climate groups but sharp criticism from electric utilities, which said that carbon capture retrofits were too expensive and the resulting plant retirements would threaten grid reliability.

The EPA spokesperson said the Biden administration's rule would ""shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States"" and raise electricity prices and increase the US' ""reliance on foreign forms of energy.""

Fossil fuel-fired generators are the nation's largest stationary source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 25% of economywide CO2 emissions in 2022, according to the EPA. The Biden EPA projected the carbon limits would result in up to $370 billion in climate and public health net benefits over the next two decades.

Stakeholder reaction

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade organization representing investor-owned utilities, told Platts in March that the EPA should adopt a ""consistent federal framework"" when revisiting the power plant rule.

""EPA regulations should be flexible and account for impacts to customer bills and grid reliability,"" Alex Bond, EEI's executive director of legal and clean energy policy, said in a March 12 email.

Stellantis-Samsung agreement: UAW recognized in Kokomo JV

The UAW is now officially the union representative for the approximately 420 employees of the joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI, based in Kokomo, Indiana. This decision follows the clear preference expressed by the majority of workers.

This important union milestone is a direct result of the agreement reached in 2023 between the UAW and Stellantis, which followed a 44-day targeted strike. The agreement provided for a recognition system through signature collection (card-check) for the Kokomo plant, paving the way for the UAW to represent workers in this new manufacturing entity. The agreement also allows Stellantis to transfer its employees to the joint venture, which supplies essential components for the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands.

“UAW members at StarPlus have worked to ensure that battery jobs are considered good unionized jobs,” said Dave Green, UAW Region 2B director. “Workers in Indiana and throughout the region know they deserve fair wages, workplace protections and the dignity UAW members have been fighting for for 90 years. As a union, they need to know that we will support them every step of the way.”

The UAW’s recognition in Kokomo marks a point in the union’s favor in the electric vehicle battery industry, creating a stark contrast to the difficulties encountered in Kentucky.

UAW, success in Kokomo, obstacles in Kentucky

Production in Kokomo began earlier this year. Stellantis had announced plans in 2022 to build a first battery plant in the city, where it already produces powertrains and transmissions. The planned investment was at least $2.5 billion for a 33-gigawatt-hour plant, with the creation of 1,400 jobs. In 2023, the company expressed its intention to build a second $3.2 billion, 34-gigawatt-hour plant, scheduled to open in 2027, adding another 1,400 jobs.

Jodi Tinson, spokesperson for Stellantis, confirmed the UAW’s recognition, “Employees at the StarPlus Energy plant in Kokomo, Indiana, hired by Stellantis, have completed verification of union cards, demonstrating majority support for representation by the United Auto Workers (UAW).” He added, “In accordance with established procedures, the UAW was recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.”

While StarPlus Energy in Kokomo, a joint venture of Stellantis, recognized the United Auto Workers (UAW) union representation through a card check, the situation is quite different at BlueOval SK in Glendale, Kentucky. Here, Ford Motor Co. has rejected a similar system for electric vehicle battery workers. In January, the UAW called for a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) vote after most employees signed authorization cards in November. However, the vote is still pending, with the union alleging delaying tactics and intimidation by the company, and accusations of unsafe working conditions by some workers.

StarPlus Energy joins battery workers already represented by the UAW at Ultium Cells LLC, the joint venture between General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution Ltd.

Uttar Pradesh is spearheading India’s green mobility revolution with more than 414,000 registered electric vehicles (EV).

This way, the state has clintched the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (183,000) and Maharashtra (179,000) in the EV sales.

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, EVs have emerged as a critical solution.

Recognising this, the Yogi Adityanath government launched the EV Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating green mobility, building a robust charging infrastructure and establishing UP as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract an investment inflow of Rs 30,000 crore and create a million jobs, setting the stage for transformative growth in the state’s EV ecosystem.

A key driver of this momentum is the widespread popularity of e-rickshaws, which now account for 85% of EV sales in UP.

These vehicles have proven highly effective for passenger and goods transport, particularly in urban areas.

UP has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further bolstering its e-mobility efforts.

In line with its focus on infrastructure, the Yogi government recently approved the installation of over 300 new EV charging stations across 16 municipal bodies.

Ayodhya, a rapidly growing tourist destination, is expected to see the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has around 33,000 EV chargers, of which 35% are fast chargers. Given the rising demand, Chief Minister Adityanath has prioritised the development of additional fast-charging stations and the upgrading of existing facilities.

Projections suggest that India could have 102 million EVs by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135, far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, as per a study by Alvarez & Marsal.

While the dominance of two and three wheelers, often charged at home, partly offsets this challenge, the UP government is moving swiftly to bridge the gap in public infra.

The state’s comprehensive EV strategy focuses on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

With these decisive steps, UP is not only driving India’s transition to green mobility but is also positioning itself as a national and global leader in the EV domain.",https://www.economypost.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/EV.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 13:12:53.013285

Below are statements in response: “I am deeply disheartened by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to permit the construction of the CP2 LNG export facility.
“Ignoring the findings of the most recent DOE LNG Export Study and giving CP2 LNG the green light for construction is irresponsible and reprehensible.
A broad coalition of local residents, fishermen, economists, environmental organizations, and retired military officials submitted comments on the Department of Energy’s report, telling the Trump Administration that LNG exports, especially the CP2 LNG export facility, are not in the public interest.
Regardless, the Trump Administration has already begun greenlighting new LNG projects despite public opposition, while burying the truth about the dangers of LNG exports.","Washington, DC — Late last week, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave the controversial Venture Global permission to proceed with construction of its CP2 LNG export facility, despite Former FERC Chairman Phillips raising concerns about the facility’s emissions last year — which are equivalent to more than 42 million gas-powered cars or 46 coal-fired power plants.

A report from Louisiana Bucket Brigade found that Venture Global was in noncompliance for 82 days and had over 2,000 permit violations in 2023 at one of its other facilities, Calcasieu Pass LNG, where CP2 would sit adjacent to. When neighbors’ documentation is combined with filed reports, operational problems were documented on 115 out of 181 days in the first half of the year, or 63% of the time. Shrimpers and fishermen have also broadly opposed CP2, citing the likelihood that the project would wipe out their way of life.

A report by the Bullard Center for Environmental Justice found that LNG export facilities in the Gulf South add to the environmental burdens BIPOC, lower-income, and fenceline communities bear from decades of oil and gas development, where the dominating presence of this industry has created sacrifice zones. These vulnerable communities do not reap the gains from the industry operating in their neighborhoods–tax incentives go to fossil fuel companies instead of investing in education or other public services.

Moreover, approving more LNG exports raises US consumers' power bills while putting US resources in the hands of the nation’s geopolitical rivals. CP2 is already contracted with China Gas for a portion of its LNG exports, despite concerns from national security experts that companies connected to the Chinese Communist Party are leveraging US gas to build geopolitical power and make profits reselling US LNG to Europe and other markets.

Below are statements in response:

“I am deeply disheartened by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to permit the construction of the CP2 LNG export facility. This isn't just a setback for our communities; it’s a grave threat to our environment and a direct assault on the livelihoods of our fishermen and shrimpers,” said Roishetta Ozane, Founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana. “With CP1 showing 82 days of noncompliance and thousands of permit violations, it’s clear that Venture Global doesn’t care about our communities and this project won’t be any different as it also prioritizes profit over people. The emissions from CP2 will be staggering, equivalent to millions of gas-powered cars, and this will only exacerbate the climate crisis we are already facing. I will continue to fight to oppose this and other reckless decisions that jeopardize our resources and put our communities at risk for the benefit of geopolitical interests because my children’s lives depend on it, this planet depends on it.”

“CP2 isn’t just another permit—it’s an eviction notice for the ecosystems, livelihoods, and cultures that define coastal Louisiana. I’ve watched fisher families grieve as the shrimp vanish and they now get nosebleeds while they working in the waters their family has known for generations” said Alyssa Portaro, Founder of Habitat Recovery Project. “FERC’s decision ignores science, skips community input, and rewards a company already proven to violate basic protections. We’ve worked with over 150 fishermen this past year and they all see this is not development—it’s dispossession. We deserve air monitors, not more emissions; restoration, not abandonment. We will continue to work toward a future where our people, waters, and ways of life are protected—not sold off to the highest bidder.”

“Moving forward with CP2 is bad news for the American public and for our climate,” said Gillian Giannetti, senior attorney at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council). “LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs. FERC once again greenlighting CP2 is throwing the health of our communities and the public interest out the window just to line the pockets of fossil-fuel-industry billionaires. NRDC remains dedicated to protecting Gulf communities affected by this dangerous proposal.”

“Granting Venture Global the permission to proceed with the construction of CP2 LNG is catastrophic for both frontline communities and the environment,” said Elizabeth Purcell, Environmental Policy Coordinator at Turtle Island Restoration Network. “Ignoring the findings of the most recent DOE LNG Export Study and giving CP2 LNG the green light for construction is irresponsible and reprehensible. This administration proves time and time again that they place corporate interests and profits over our planet and our people.”

“Organizations and impacted landowners have spoken out against the horrific impacts that CP2 would have on their communities, their health, and their livelihoods, but now, FERC has greenlit Venture Global to begin construction immediately, even during future challenges to the project,” said Nathan Matthews, Sierra Club Senior Attorney. “This shows once again that the Trump Administration is ignoring the realities of LNG exports in order to rubberstamp these projects so that Big Oil and Gas CEOs can reap the benefits while everyday Americans suffer the consequences.”

“FERC has once again shown that it does not care about people. By reauthorizing CP2, they’ve ignored basic public health standards and the lived reality of communities in Cameron. This project will be built less than a mile from people’s homes — yet there’s not even an air monitor in town. Our shrimp are disappearing, our air is poisoned, and our voices are silenced, while corporations get nearly a billion dollars a year in tax abatements to export gas — and profits — out of our communities. This isn’t regulation. It’s abandonment,” said James Hiatt, For a Better Bayou.

“FERC’s approval of CP2 is yet another attack on the frontline communities of Cameron Parish, American energy consumers and global climate stability,” said Drew Guillory, Food and Water Watch Policy Analyst. “LNG exports poison air and water, drive up domestic energy prices and spew climate emissions into the atmosphere. In a region already ravaged by industrial pollution, FERC is giving the green light to more pollution and misery, all for the sake of corporate profits”

“This decision is both unlawful and morally indefensible,” said Megan Gibson, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “FERC is once again rubber-stamping fossil fuel infrastructure that will permanently displace fishermen, effectively eradicate their way of life, bulldoze fragile coastal wetlands, and lock in decades of pollution for export. There is no public benefit here—only private gain for a company aiming to export U.S. gas overseas.”

""Approving Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility dismisses the well-documented risks LNG projects pose to public health, air quality, and local economies while deepening the climate crisis.” said Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice. “Gulf Coast communities have long battled fossil fuel pollution, enduring disproportionate health impacts like cancer and asthma. FERC’s decision also overlooks the financial burden on families as LNG expansion drives up energy costs. We remain committed to advocating for energy policies that prioritize public interest, advance environmental justice, and protect vulnerable communities.

“FERC’s decision to greenlight CP2 is a direct assault on environmental justice. The Gulf South isn’t a sacrifice zone.” said Alexa White, Climate and Environmental Justice Policy Director at the Hip Hop Caucus. “It is home to Black, Brown, and Indigenous families who deserve clean air, safe water, and a future. This approval ignores the overwhelming evidence that LNG expansion poisons our communities, destabilizes our climate, and burdens working families with rising energy costs. Hip Hop Caucus stands with frontline leaders demanding accountability, not another pipeline of pollution.”

“Authorizing the construction of another mega-polluting fossil fuel project in the Gulf South epitomizes this administration's interest in catering to the political will of those who get rich off of harming communities with oil and gas pollution,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “The health, safety, and livelihoods of Louisianans are impacted by this decision, which worsens the injustices they face every day. This approach to energy policy is not in the public’s best interest, and will ultimately cause serious harm across the country.”

Additional Information:

The DOE’s 2024 LNG Export Study: Energy, Economic, and Environmental Assessment of U.S. LNG Exports found that:

There are enough LNG exports already approved to meet global demand for decades to come;

Unfettered exports of LNG will increase wholesale domestic natural gas prices by over 30%;

LNG facilities tend to be concentrated in communities overburdened with petrochemical pollution;

Increasing LNG exports threatens our ability to meet our global commitment of limiting warming to 1.5ºC and would displace more renewables than coal globally.

A broad coalition of local residents, fishermen, economists, environmental organizations, and retired military officials submitted comments on the Department of Energy’s report, telling the Trump Administration that LNG exports, especially the CP2 LNG export facility, are not in the public interest. Regardless, the Trump Administration has already begun greenlighting new LNG projects despite public opposition, while burying the truth about the dangers of LNG exports.

LNG exports in the United States have rapidly increased in recent years, harming public health, devastating the environment, raising prices for families, and threatening national security. Peer-reviewed research indicates that the climate impact of LNG is even greater than coal. Nevertheless, the oil and gas industry is seeking to build on its record profits by rapidly increasing the US’s LNG export capacity – even as demand drops in Europe and security concerns rise around exports via China.

Proven success in Southwest Virginia can be the catalyst for national progress when backed by smart policy.
Coal and natural gas are more than just economic inputs in Southwest Virginia.","In Southwest Virginia, we've long known the value of what's beneath our feet. For generations, coal has powered the region's economy, sustained communities, and fueled American industry. Now, it offers America a practical example of how energy communities can lead the way in innovation and resilience, as Southwest Virginia offers a playbook for American energy growth. With the help of new technology and investments, the coal and natural gas industries are creating pathways for growth in our communities—such as mine methane capture—revitalizing local economies, supporting jobs, and turning waste into valuable energy assets.

Recent data underscores just how significant Southwest Virginia's energy sector is to the region's economic stability and growth. A new study from Chmura Economics & Analytics found that these industries, along with the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority (VCEDA), generated over $13.4 billion in economic output and supported more than 51,000 jobs in the region in 2024 alone. These are not temporary boosts or one-time gains. They represent a durable, ongoing contribution to the regional economy that many other areas could also benefit from. Proven success in Southwest Virginia can be the catalyst for national progress when backed by smart policy.

One of the most promising drivers of this growth is through coal mine methane capture, a fast-expanding segment of Virginia's energy production. Historically treated as waste of which the vast majority is simply vented into the atmosphere, methane from coal mines is now being captured, refined, and integrated into existing natural gas infrastructure. In 2024, coal mine methane projects and the natural gas industry contributed to $481.7 million in economic impact and supported over 1,100 jobs in Southwest Virginia. These projects exemplify the kind of practical, investment-ready solutions that deliver on core policy goals: strengthening Virginia's economy, creating jobs, and supporting domestic energy production.

This opportunity goes well beyond Southwest Virginia. Coal mining communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, and Alabama can replicate this model. The geography is already there; so are the people, the pipelines, and the local knowledge built over generations. These are not communities that need to start from scratch. They need a level playing field and policy support to scale a proven model. By investing in what's already working, Congress can help accelerate economic revitalization in places that have long been asked to wait for future solutions.

But that growth won't happen automatically. Coal mine methane projects are currently excluded from the federal Section 45Q tax credit, even though other emission-reduction technologies—such as carbon capture and storage (CCS)—are eligible. Meanwhile, other waste-derived fuels such as renewable natural gas (RNG) benefit from existing incentives, including the Renewable Fuel Standard program and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), while coal communities and coal mine methane are left behind. The Methane Reduction and Economic Growth Act, recently reintroduced in Congress, would fix this by including coal mine methane in 45Q. By giving coal mine methane projects access to the same credit structure as other technologies, Congress can attract investment, reduce barriers, and ensure rural energy workers aren't left behind.

Coal and natural gas are more than just economic inputs in Southwest Virginia. They serve as the backbone of local life, powering homes, fueling industries, and supporting everything from supply chains to small businesses. In many counties, energy production drives tax revenue, funds public services, and provides stable employment. These industries contribute far more than raw output; they sustain communities and strengthen America's overall energy position.

At a time when global energy supplies remain fragile and domestic demand is rising, the U.S. can't afford to overlook proven opportunities like coal mine methane capture. This is about energy independence, economic security, and getting the most out of what we've already built. With clear policy support, companies are ready to invest, and workers are ready to lead.

Let's turn overlooked energy into undeniable strength for communities nationwide, starting now.

30%: Antonio Filosa Has To Get Stellantis Ready For What's Next

Stellantis Brands

Photo by: Stellantis

Stellantis is kind of a preposterous car company, when you really think about it. It's the product of a merger between Fiat Chrysler (itself a merger, naturally) and France's PSA Group, so it counts under its umbrella everything from Fiat and Jeep to Citroën and Opel. This was all supposed to give Stellantis unprecedented scale to meet the future of carmaking, which will be powered by batteries and software instead of engines and conventional hardware.

It's fair to say things haven't exactly gone that way. Under the previous CEO Carlos Tavares (who was as much the architect of Stellantis as anyone) the company's multi-national collection of brands faced issues with profitability, sales, pricing, competing on technology, coming in late to electrification and cooperating with one another. Then you add in the usual set of auto industry problems these days, including declining sales in China, high labor costs and market declines in Europe, tariffs, layoffs, labor unrest, angry dealers... the list goes on and on.

By the time Tavares left, everybody wanted him gone. The dealers were mad, the unions were mad, the investors were mad, and the customers were mad at the outrageous prices they were paying for the cars. It's hard to parse what's actually gone well at Stellantis, if we're being brutally honest—even if some individual brands have done better than others.

He's an Italian native who started with the Fiat Group in 1999 and had an expansive career across Latin America, then North America, and most recently heading up the entire Jeep brand and serving as Chief Operating Officer for the Americas. ""Since his appointment, he has initiated the strengthening of the U.S. operations, including by significantly reducing excessive dealer inventory, reorganizing the leadership team, driving the process of introducing new products and powertrains, and increasing dialogue with dealers, unions and suppliers,"" Stellantis officials said in a statement.

Besides repairing many fractured relationships, Filosa will need to better transition Stellantis into an electrified and software-powered car company in many of its markets—a tall order when many of its contingents seem eager to fall back on internal combustion.

And he may be tasked with killing off some brands, which is probably overdue.

60%: May New Car Sales May Be Milder, Just Like EV Growth

New car sales, including EVs, have been relatively strong this year despite still-high interest rates. But a new report from S&P Global Mobility says that May's numbers are expected to be cooler as customers brace for the impact of tariffs.

""Given the swirling tariff, consumer and auto inventory conditions, the expected May 2025 auto sales result will likely be the last period this year to post positive growth in year-ago and month-prior comparisons,"" said Chris Hopson, principal analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""Shifting tariff policies have automakers scrambling to produce vehicles while they can, but uncertainty abounds in the immediate term and upcoming monthly sales levels are expected to decelerate further.""

S&P reports that the same is unfortunately true for the EV field in America. While EV tax credits remain in effect for now, and likely will for several more months, it's clear that they're in the crosshairs of the Trump administration and Congress.

""BEV share fell to an estimated 7.0% in both March and April, and while some of the lower share could be attributed to strong non-BEV demand, BEV growth is moderating,"" the report said. ""May BEV share is expected to reach a similar 6.8% share, reflective of the uneasiness as automakers, dealers and consumers continue to digest potential changes to BEV incentives.""

If you are shopping for a new EV, now is the time to do it before the credits go away and tariffs really start to hit.

90%: GM Replaces Electric Motor Plan For More V8s

GM may be playing the long game on EVs and batteries, but for the foreseeable future, it still makes its money with big, gas-powered trucks. And EV sales haven't begun to eclipse the sales of gas cars at the pace once predicted by the entire industry.

Hence, a GM plant in Buffalo once destined for electric motors is now going to make new V8 engines instead. From the Wall Street Journal:

The company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant and makes Tonawanda its second propulsion plant to produce the sixth generation of V8 engines.

The engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs, use new combustion and thermal management innovations to improve performance while reducing emissions, the company said.

The investment includes new machinery, equipment, tools and facility renovations, and builds on GM’s work to boost its manufacturing facilities in recent years, including a half-billion-dollar investment in its Flint engine plant in 2023, the company said.

GM still says it sees the future as all-electric—eventually. But getting there is the tricky part.

At least here in America, it's often disappointing to see Stellantis' brands so behind the curve on electrification. Sure, it's had success with hybrid Jeeps and the like, but its pure EV game leaves a lot to be desired so far. Then again, the company seems to have more immediate, existential issues it must face before it can tackle the future.

Uttar Pradesh now leads the country in electric vehicle adoption, with over 4.14 lakh EVs registered—outpacing Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh)

Lucknow, May 28: Under the dynamic leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh is spearheading India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution. With more than 4.14 lakh electric vehicles registered, the state has taken the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh).

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a critical solution. Recognizing this, the Yogi government launched the Electric Vehicle Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, building a robust charging infrastructure, and establishing Uttar Pradesh as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract an investment inflow of ₹30,000 crore and create 10 lakh jobs, setting the stage for transformative growth in the state’s electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.

A key driver of this momentum is the widespread popularity of e-rickshaws, which now account for 85% of electric vehicle (EV) sales in the state. These vehicles have proven highly effective for passenger and goods transport, particularly in urban areas.

Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further bolstering its e-mobility efforts.

In line with its focus on infrastructure, the Yogi government has recently approved the installation of over 300 new electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across 16 municipal bodies. Ayodhya, a rapidly growing tourist destination, is expected to see the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has around 33,000 EV chargers, of which 35% are fast chargers. Given the rising demand, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has prioritised the development of additional fast-charging stations and the upgrading of existing facilities.

Projections suggest that India could have 102 million electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135, far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, as per a study by Alvarez & Marsal. While the dominance of two- and three-wheelers, often charged at home, partly offsets this challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government is moving swiftly to bridge the gap in public infrastructure.

The state’s comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) strategy focuses on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations, and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

The bill increases oil and gas leasing, calling for more lease sales in the Gulf of America (Mexico) and reviving leasing in Alaska, which will reverse policies put in place by former President Biden. It also cuts clean energy tax credits. The bill now moves to the Senate.

GOM Lease Sales

The House bill requires at least 30 lease sales in the U.S. Gulf of America (Mexico) over the next 15 years, with the first to be held August 15. The lease sales would rotate between August and March through 2040. Each Gulf lease sale would have to offer at least 80 million acres, if that much unleased acreage is available. The bill directs the Interior Department to “immediately resume” quarterly onshore lease sales, in contrast to Biden’s policy that curbed oil and gas drilling shortly after he took office in 2021. The 30 lease sales represent a significant shift from the policies of the Biden administration, which implemented an offshore leasing program featuring only three lease sales in five years. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum is already working on a revamped offshore oil and gas lease plan that will add more lease sales to the current schedule produced by the Biden administration.

The bill also modifies the GOM Energy Security Act (GOMESA), which outlines how offshore oil and gas revenue is distributed to Gulf Coast states, raising the distribution cap from $500 million to $650 million from 2026 to 2034 before lowering the cap back to $500 million.

Lease Sales in Alaska

The House bill orders the Interior Department to hold at four lease sales in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and restores oil and gas leases that were canceled by the Biden administration. It also orders Interior to resume the oil and gas program in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and requires at least six lease sales in the next decade in Alaska’s Cook Inlet, with the first required by March 2026.

“Clean” Energy Credits

The bill rolls back tax credits for solar and wind, along with clean hydrogen production, and “clean” vehicles, among other measures.

Specifically, the House bill requires projects to “commence construction” within 60 days of the bill’s enactment to qualify for tax credits and be placed in service by the end of 2028. According to “clean” energy developers, the bill weakens the “clean” electricity investment and production tax credits in a way that could make them largely unusable. Because the credits mostly help wind and solar — technologies that have been around for decades, receiving massive subsidies during that time — they should be considered mature and no longer need credits. In fact, driven by subsidies, wind and solar have overtaken coal in their combined share of the generating market. While coal once had a 50% share, it is now reduced to 15%.

Nuclear developers are subject to a phaseout, but would be able to access investment and production tax credits when they start construction on a plant, instead of when they begin delivering energy, extending the window within which they can benefit from subsidies. Existing nuclear reactors have received an extended lifeline, as the production tax credit now phases out at the end of 2031, rather than at the start of 2029, as proposed under the previous plan. For nuclear energy, companies are allowed to transfer tax credits to a buyer in exchange for cash, an option known as transferability.

The bill also rescinds unallocated funds from the IRA. It also repeals funding for a methane emissions reduction program under the Clean Air Act. The carbon capture tax credits that were increased through the IRA, known as 45Q credits, were left intact.

Other Provisions

The bill sets a $1 million fee for gas companies that apply to the Department of Energy to import or export liquefied natural gas and allows those applicants to pay an additional $10 million to expedite their federal regulatory reviews.

The bill also provides $1.32 billion to the Energy Department to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and repeals a provision that would have forced the agency to draw down specific amounts of oil from the SPR in 2026 and 2027. President Biden substantially drew down the emergency oil reserve to keep oil and gasoline prices low during the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.

Tax credits for electric vehicles remain largely the same as in previous drafts, as they were approved by the Ways and Means Committee.

(“Fluence”) (Nasdaq: FLNC), a global market leader delivering intelligent energy storage systems, operational services, and asset optimization software, welcomed U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) to the Utah-based manufacturing facility that is producing Fluence’s battery modules. The visit spotlighted Fluence’s growing investment in U.S.-based manufacturing and its leadership in building a resilient domestic supply chain for battery energy storage solutions that has been accelerated by the availability of federal tax credits that directly support manufacturing in the United States.

Senator Curtis toured the U.S. domestic manufacturing facility and joined Fluence executives for a press conference and discussion centered on the economic and strategic benefits of U.S. domestic energy production and manufacturing.

“As energy demand continues to grow, we need an all-of-the-above approach that supports Utahns and provides the long-term certainty businesses need to invest and expand,” said Senator Curtis. “In Utah, we’ve seen firsthand how smart policies—like energy tax credits—can drive innovation, strengthen our economy, and create real opportunity. I was pleased to visit Fluence’s energy storage operations at the manufacturing facility in Tooele County to see the value of these incentives in meeting both our energy production and economic development goals.”

Since first announcing operations in the manufacturing facility in Utah in 2022, Fluence has quickly expanded its U.S. domestic manufacturing footprint, sourcing battery cells from a supplier in Smyrna, Tennessee—the first facility in the United States to manufacture LFP battery cells for utility-scale stationary energy storage. The company is working with manufacturing partners to ramp up the use of U.S. domestic manufacturing facilities in Arizona and Texas, further anchoring its commitment to onshoring production in the United States of every major product and component of its grid-scale battery energy storage systems for U.S. demand.

“We’re proud to host Senator Curtis and show firsthand how U.S. federal policy is translating into high-impact local manufacturing investment,” said John Zahurancik, President, Fluence Americas. “When the industry first started putting battery storage onto the grid in 2008, the core equipment was sourced from facilities in the United States. Since then, production has largely shifted overseas, even though U.S. domestic demand has skyrocketed. This facility is building the future of energy storage right here in Utah, and we’re helping to build the foundation for the United States to once again be a leader in battery manufacturing.”

Fluence’s solutions support a more flexible, reliable, and modernized power grid. By expanding access to U.S. manufacturing and sourcing U.S. domestically produced materials, Fluence is supporting the United States’ growing energy demand and energy security goals while contributing to regional economic growth.

“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said.
Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.
During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.
“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,"" he wrote.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Elon Musk is criticizing the centerpiece of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda, a significant fracture in a partnership that was forged during last year's campaign and was poised to reshape American politics and the federal government.

The billionaire entrepreneur, who supported Trump’s candidacy with at least $250 million and has worked for his administration as a senior adviser, said he was “disappointed” by what the president calls his “big beautiful bill.”

The legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. While speaking to CBS, Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.

“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”

His CBS interview came out Tuesday night. Trump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.

“I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,"" he said.

Trump also suggested that more changes could be made.

“We’re going to see what happens,"" he said. ""It’s got a way to go.”

Republicans recently pushed the measure through the House and are debating it in the Senate.

Musk’s comments come as he steps back from his government work, rededicating himself to companies like the electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX. He's also said he'll reduce his political spending, because ""I think I’ve done enough.”

At times, he's seemed chastened by his experience working in government. Although he hoped that DOGE would generate $1 trillion in spending cuts, he's fallen far short of that target.

“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”

The White House is set to send proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE's cuts.

A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.

Musk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. He wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis.

He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.

“The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,"" Musk said in February. ""Frankly, I love him.”

Trump repaid the favor, describing Musk as ""a truly great American.” When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into a makeshift showroom to illustrate his support.

It's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate. During the transition period, he helped whip up opposition to a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.

Speaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.

However, Musk's criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was “still time to fix it.”

“The Senate version will be more aggressive,” Lee said. “It can, it must, and it will be. Or it won’t pass.”

Only two Republicans — Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.

Davidson took note of Musk’s comments on social media.

“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,"" he wrote. ""Don’t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.”

The Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.

House Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit neutral or reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.

Here's why.,"Kaicey  Baylor, Christian  Olaniran",,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/bge-customers-energy-price-increase-june-1/,"Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) customers in Maryland will see another significant increase in the price of electricity starting June 1.
The increase comes amid frustrations from BGE customers who have been grappling with high energy costs throughout the year.
""There's an acute misalignment between supply and demand for electricity in Maryland,"" said BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos.
BGE said Tuesday that the increase was not due to the company raising its distribution rate, but an increase in the price of ""electricity itself.""
BGE customers express frustration BGE customers said the price hike is another high bill that will be added to their plates.","Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) customers in Maryland will see another significant increase in the price of electricity starting June 1.

The increase comes amid frustrations from BGE customers who have been grappling with high energy costs throughout the year.

Why will BGE's electricity costs go up on June 1?

According to BGE, the increase is the result of an unexpected spike in capacity auction prices and the Talen Energy reliability-must-run (RMR) fee.

A capacity market auction is a competitive bidding process where power companies promise to make their electricity generation available in the future.

""There's an acute misalignment between supply and demand for electricity in Maryland,"" said BGE spokesperson Nick Alexopulos. ""In short, we don't have enough power plants to meet the energy demand.""

Plus, Alexopulos said some plants are retiring.

""PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, has determined that those power plants have to run past their retirement date to maintain reliability of the entire electric grid in the region,"" Alexopulos said.

Last week, legislators criticized PJM Interconnection, saying that the company was responsible for an energy supply undercount at the most recent auction, causing the total cost of electricity across the PJM region to go from $2.2 billion to $14.7 billion.

BGE said Tuesday that the increase was not due to the company raising its distribution rate, but an increase in the price of ""electricity itself.""

Alexopulos said, based on historical averages for those paying for gas and electricity through BGE, you could see an estimated $40 increase in their highest bill.

""That said, if July, which is typically the hottest month where customers use the most energy, is much hotter than expected, those bills are going to be higher because you're going to be using more energy,"" Alexopulos said.

BGE customers express frustration

BGE customers said the price hike is another high bill that will be added to their plates.

""Not pleased,"" said customer Kyla Cools. ""Not thoroughly surprised either.""

""Not happy,"" Peter Bearden, another customer, said. ""Just increases the burden with the rest of inflation.""

While some have accepted the upcoming change.

""Am I going to feel bad about it?"" Jim Considine said. ""Sure, but you can't stop them.""

They said they will adjust their home practices to save a bit of cash.

""I'm paying a lot of attention to the usage metrics,"" Cools said.

""Usually, we don't put in our air conditioners until middle or late July, and I'm sure we'll do the same thing this year,"" Bearden said. ""So, we hold off as long as we can.""

What is the Talen Energy RMR fee?

The Talen Energy RMR fee refers to the fixed payments made to Talen Energy for continuing to operate its Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner power plants in Maryland, beyond their planned retirement dates.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator, pays a fee of $312 per megawatt per day for the Brandon Shores plant, amounting to approximately $145 million annually, along with a $5 million performance incentive. For the H.A. Wagner plant, PJM pays a fee of $137 per megawatt per day, which totals about $35 million per year, plus a $2.5 million performance incentive.

The details are outlined in a settlement agreement reached in January 2025.

Energy-saving tips for the summer

BGE said there are several things you can do to lower your bill:

Schedule service for your HVAC system to keep it operating efficiently.

Lower your water heater temperature and set it to 120 degrees.

Raise your thermostat to a level that is still safe and comfortable.

Monitor your energy usage in your BGE My Account or in the BGE mobile app.

Maryland struggles with ongoing energy rate increases

BGE raised rates on January 1, increasing the average residential gas bill by 9% and the electric bill by 7%. Some customers saw even larger jumps, with winter bills climbing by more than $200.

The utility cited several reasons for the hikes, including higher distribution costs regulated by the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC), a 30% rise in natural gas prices over the past year, and increased spending on energy efficiency programs mandated by the state.

BGE also pointed to major investments in gas infrastructure upgrades.

Baltimore City Council President Zeke Cohen has raised questions about the company's long-term plans.

Earlier this month, Cohen called for transparency around BGE's proposed multi-year rate increases for 2026.

In 2023, the PSC approved BGE's multi-year delivery rate increases, enabling the company to raise rates by approximately $408 million over three years for both gas and electric services.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/25/bdd0ec2b-9a5f-4b66-943f-8e5df80f3121/thumbnail/1200x630/b6fe4b563a614332b5bf7a6813470756/bge-rates.jpg?v=f5922acb8cfbf6d7fe1f82314e5e9885,N,,2025-05-28 13:13:17.743384

The lot is home to a now-closed Bed, Bath and Beyond, an also-shuttered Torrid, and a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant that’s still open, and has plenty of space for the EVs. But using the land for vehicle storage is against city code.

The shopping center landlord has already been informed of the violation, according to comments made by Charmaine Kettler-Schmult, director of planning and community development for Farmington Hills, Michigan to CDB. But she admitted to reporters that the enforcement process “takes time.”

The report notes Tesla recently opened a brand new showroom close to the Hunter’s Square shopping center in West Bloomfield, which could be the source of the idled Cybertrucks. Crain’s Detroit Business reached out to both the registered owner of that site and the landlord of Hunter’s Square, which is due to get a major overhaul, but neither responded.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk once bragged of having 1 million reservations for the Cybertruck, but the much-delayed EV has failed to live up to sales expectations since its official debut in late 2023. Only 40,000 were sold last year, well short of the 250,000 Tesla predicted, according to Forbes. And recently the Cybertruck was outperformed by its more conventional-looking Ford F-150 Lightning rival.

Tesla has made moves to open up the Cybetruck’s appeal, however. In April it finally unveiled a single-motor, rear-wheel drive, entry-level model for $69,990 and buyers of other grades have been offered discounts, lease deals and free supercharging.

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation.
Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here.
Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.
That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.” Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state.","After trying and failing to carve out more exceptions to Wyoming’s longstanding ban against storing radioactive nuclear power plant waste earlier this year, lawmakers will take another swing at gaining support for the idea.

They’re particularly focused on clearing the way for Radiant Industries, which proposes manufacturing microreactors and “temporarily” storing their spent, radioactive fuel at a site near the towns of Casper and Bar Nunn.

After Senate File 186, “??Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” went down in flames during this year’s legislative session, lawmakers on the joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee called in experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to answer questions about evolving safeguards and the industry’s track record.

In nearly 40 years of “dry cask” storage in the United States, “we have had zero release of radiation or radioactive material to the environment,” Idaho National Laboratory Used Fuel Management Department Manager Daniel Thomas told lawmakers last week in Casper.

“Similarly, in transportation, we have moved [spent nuclear] fuel for several million miles on rail, on road, by boat, with zero accidents,” Thomas testified.

Those assurances, along with evolving federal safeguards, rang true for Lander resident William Almas, who offered his perspectives to the committee via Zoom.

Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation. But that’s not the point, he noted. Such expert testimony won’t be, and it shouldn’t be, enough to convince others in Wyoming.

Health and safety concerns are valid, Almas said, particularly in a state that doesn’t yet host nuclear waste. All the pamphlets, slide decks and expert testimony in the world don’t matter a lick, Almas suggested, unless state leaders initiate a long conversation with residents that, ideally, is moderated by a “third party.”

“A key factor contributing to the lack of success of these projects is the failure of the community to reach consensus on the safety and the value of the projects,” Almas told the panel. “The facts must be clearly presented and discussed by an impartial third party, moving both the proponents and opposition in a forum for discussion.”

Lawmakers on the panel nodded and noted the suggestion. The panel directed the Legislative Service Office to draft another version of SF 186 for further consideration when it meets again in July.

Radioactive hurdles

After decades of public opposition, Wyoming lawmakers tweaked statutes in 2022 to allow for storage of spent nuclear fuel — so long as it is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state.

The move was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer. The “advanced” nuclear reactor will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2030, will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

Wyoming’s legal pathway for TerraPower to store its spent fuel on site is contingent upon the company receiving approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will oversee the plant’s operation and radioactive waste storage.

While SF 186 would have made another exemption to the state’s ban by allowing microreactor manufacturers such as Radiant to store spent fuel, House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have opened the door to commercial operations to potentially take the waste from nuclear power plants from all over the country. Both bills failed this year. Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here. State statute prohibits a commercial high-level radioactive waste facility, whether it’s spent fuel from a power plant from another state or a microreactor built in the state, as Radiant proposes, unless the federal government establishes a permanent repository.

That’s not likely to happen anytime soon, according to federal officials. It will take an act of Congress to resume efforts to establish one at Yucca Mountain, or anywhere else, according to Idaho National Laboratory’s Thomas, who worked for more than a decade on the Yucca Mountain project.

“Yucca Mountain has been defunded and is not being pursued,” Thomas said. If Congress were to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to resume the work, he added, “I would say that we are probably four or more decades off.”

That leaves Wyoming to consider whether to make another exception to its nuclear waste storage ban.

What’s at stake

The Wyoming Energy Authority and Wyoming Business Council are eagerly pursuing companies interested in reinvigorating the state’s uranium mines, hoping to launch a mining-to-reactor industry that becomes an integral piece of domestic energy security.

Rare Element Resources’ Bear Lodge Project in northeast Wyoming, to mine uranium ore and refine it, is well underway. That project has sparked interest among others on the nuclear fuel supply side to join the effort in the Equality State.

Having a nearby supply of refined uranium ore gives a leg up to companies like Radiant and BWXT Advanced Technologies that want to build portable microreactors here and deploy them to industrial customers throughout the nation and world, according to the companies. BWXT, with a matching grant from the state, is already building a nuclear reactor component supply chain among existing fabrication shops here. Though BWXT is still exploring whether to set up an actual microreactor manufacturing shop in Wyoming, Radiant proposes a manufacturing facility just outside of Bar Nunn. Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.

“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance,” Radiant Director of Operations Matt Wilson told lawmakers. “But when you look at other countries — Russia, China — they are well ahead of us when it comes to projects not just in the pipeline, but coming on every year. And that’s not just on the advanced reactor side. That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.”

Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state. More public education and engagement are needed, he said, as well as details from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about containment measures should there be an “episode” at a nuclear facility.

“I would recommend that we reach out and ask for testimony so that we can have all sides of a picture before we make decisions on things,” Knapp said.

To understand the problems with the Bank’s climate finance reporting, it's essential to grasp how the Bank estimates its climate finance.
Consequently, basic information about the Bank’s climate finance, including which activities get financed and how much climate finance is delivered in each country, remains unknown.
The second report estimated that, on average, actual climate finance expenditures could differ from budgeted climate finance expenditures by between 26-43%, between 2017 and 2023.
By implementing this important change, the World Bank effectively becomes a leader on transparency of climate finance reporting not only among all Multilateral Development Banks but also bilateral climate finance contributors.","In the current climate crisis and in the face of massive challenges, every positive development in the climate fight is worth celebrating. On this front Oxfam welcomes recent positive news from the World Bank. The Bank has amended its climate finance assessment and reporting methods, reflecting Oxfam's recommendations. And these changes represent an important precedent and promise greater clarity on climate finance allocation and spending, enhancing the ability of researchers and affected communities to obtain accurate information for monitoring and accountability. Let's remember that the Bank is the largest single conduit of climate finance – providing US$ 42.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2024.

What was missing from the Bank’s climate finance reporting?

To understand the problems with the Bank’s climate finance reporting, it's essential to grasp how the Bank estimates its climate finance. As each project the Bank will finance is approved by its board, staff at the Bank assess all the activities in the project (using an agreed upon methodology) to calculate which activities qualify as “climate finance”. The total value of these activities across the annual portfolio constitutes the Bank's annual climate finance.

Oxfam identified two primary issues with this approach:

Partial assessment: Climate finance is estimated when a project is approved, not when it is completed. Projects often change during implementation, but, historically, the Bank did not reassess climate finance based on actual expenditures. This means the Bank’s climate finance claims reflect intended financing (in Bank parlance this is termed ex-ante reporting), not actual financing (which would be termed ex-post reporting). Consequently, basic information about the Bank’s climate finance, including which activities get financed and how much climate finance is delivered in each country, remains unknown.

Lack of granularity of Reporting: Each World Bank project is comprised of components, which are comprised of sub-components, which are themselves comprised of activities. Historically, the Bank has only systematically provided information on their climate finance at the project level – broken down by mitigation and adaptation finance. This is a problem because it is at the level of sub-components and the activity that issues of qualifying for climate finance are determined. The Bank reports climate finance at the project level, not at the activity level where climate qualification is determined. This makes public oversight of project implementation and tracking of claimed climate finance on the ground impossible. Effectively, under this approach, the public had no choice but to accept the Bank’s estimates at face value.

Oxfam’s Research and Advocacy

To highlight these issues, Oxfam produced two research reports estimating the potential inaccuracies in the Bank’s climate finance claims due to the lack of granularity in the Bank's reporting and timing of their assessment. The first report examined data from FY20 and found that the Bank’s climate finance claims could be off by as much as $7 billion or 40% of the Bank’s claimed climate finance for that year. The second report estimated that, on average, actual climate finance expenditures could differ from budgeted climate finance expenditures by between 26-43%, between 2017 and 2023. This difference amounts to between $24.28 – $41.31 billion in climate finance, which is effectively untracked in terms of its impact on climate. This does not mean any money is missing or has been misused; rather, we don’t know for sure whether it was spent on activities that qualify as climate finance. These two Oxfam reports served to quantify the inadequacies of the Bank’s climate finance reporting and raise awareness of the issue. The scale of these numbers made clear that these reporting issues were too large to ignore, which opened a space for Oxfam to discuss solutions with the Bank's climate unit and top decision-makers.

The Bank’s Response

Partly in response to Oxfam’s advocacy, the Bank announced significant changes:

Improved granular reporting: For all projects with climate finance approved after April 1st, 2025, the Bank will publish their calculations and justifications for climate finance at the sub-component level.

Reporting at the end of the project: For projects closing after July 1st, 2025, the Bank will analyze and report ex-post assessments of climate finance, detailing the climate qualifying activities actually supported after project completion.

These steps are important and commendable, especially given the Bank’s existing data management challenges. The swift implementation of ex-post reporting is particularly important not only for accountability reasons but critically to move towards outcome and impact reporting and ensure the quality of climate actions financed with limited climate resources. By implementing this important change, the World Bank effectively becomes a leader on transparency of climate finance reporting not only among all Multilateral Development Banks but also bilateral climate finance contributors.

Remaining Challenges

Despite these improvements, challenges persist. An important remaining issue relates to data storage and access. Most data are stored in project-associated PDFs, making large-scale analysis difficult. To address this the Bank should collect all this new climate finance data into a central climate finance database that is publicly available, easy to search and in a machine-readable format that facilitates the use of the data. Additionally, while reporting at the sub-component level is a positive step, the implementation details will determine whether the public can fully understand and assess climate finance expenditures. For this, the Bank should make additional efforts to also publish climate finance data at the activity level for each project – a level of granularity that allows for an independent audit of both the application of the method and an on-the-ground assessment of projects.

Encouragement for Future Actions

Oxfam commends the Bank’s willingness to continue improving its climate finance reporting and hopes that the Bank's leadership sets a precedent that other Multilateral Development Banks and bilateral climate financiers will follow. We urge other actors working on climate finance issues to use this new data to enhance accountability and ensure effective climate action, particularly in less industrialized countries with significant needs and minimal responsibility for the climate crisis.",https://webassets.oxfamamerica.org/media/images/Oxfam_InuruID_.width-1200.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:11.992311

Statesman News Service | Lucknow |

Uttar Pradesh is at the forefront of India’s electric vehicle (EV) revolution. With over 4.14 lakh EVs registered, the state has claimed the top spot nationally, surpassing major states like Delhi (1.83 lakh) and Maharashtra (1.79 lakh).

At a time when global concerns over environmental sustainability and climate change are intensifying, electric vehicles have emerged as a key solution. Recognizing this, the Uttar Pradesh government launched the Electric Vehicle Manufacturing and Mobility Policy 2022, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, building robust charging infrastructure, and positioning the state as a global hub for EV and battery manufacturing.

The policy aims to attract ₹30,000 crore in investments and create 10 lakh jobs, laying the foundation for transformative growth in the state’s EV ecosystem.

Officials stated on Wednesday that a key driver behind this momentum is the widespread use of e-rickshaws, which now account for nearly 85 per cent of EV sales in the state. These vehicles have proven especially effective for transporting passengers and goods in urban areas.

Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as the biggest beneficiary of the Government of India’s FAME I and FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) schemes, further strengthening its e-mobility initiatives.

As part of its infrastructure focus, the Yogi Adityanath-led government has approved the installation of over 300 new EV charging stations across 16 municipal bodies. Ayodhya, a rapidly growing pilgrimage and tourist destination, is expected to receive the highest number of new charging points.

India currently has approximately 33,000 EV charging stations, 35% of which are fast chargers. Projections suggest that India could have 102 million EVs on the road by 2030. However, the current EV-to-public-charger ratio in India stands at 135—far above the global ideal of 6 to 20, according to a study by Alvarez & Marsal.

While the dominance of two- and three-wheelers, typically charged at home, somewhat mitigates this challenge, the Uttar Pradesh government is working swiftly to improve public charging infrastructure.

The state’s comprehensive EV strategy is built on three pillars: expanding EV manufacturing, accelerating the rollout of charging stations, and increasing public adoption of electric mobility.

With these decisive initiatives, Uttar Pradesh is not only steering India’s transition to green mobility but also positioning itself as a national and global leader in the electric vehicle sector.

The law presumes “that air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,” the complaint states.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — On days of heavy pollution in Sulphur, a southwest Louisiana town surrounded by more than 16 industrial plants, Cynthia “Cindy” Robertson once flew a red flag outside her home so her community knew they faced health hazards from high levels of soot and other pollutants.

But she stopped flying the flag after Louisiana passed a law last May that threatened fines of up to $1 million for sharing information about air quality that did not meet strict standards.

On May 22, Robertson’s group Micah 6:8 Mission and other Louisiana environmental organizations sued the state in federal court over the law they say restricts their free speech and undermines their ability to promote public health in heavily industrialized communities.

When neighbors asked where the flags went, “I’d tell them, ‘The state of Louisiana says we can’t tell y’all that stuff,’ ” Robertson said.

While the state has argued the law ensures that accurate data is shared with the public, environmental groups like Micah 6:8 Mission said it was intended to censor them with “onerous restrictions” and violates their free-speech rights, according to the lawsuit.

Despite having received Environmental Protection Agency funding to monitor Sulphur’s pollution using high-quality air monitors for several years, Michah 6:8 Mission stopped posting data on the group’s social media after the law was signed last May, Robertson said.

Federal law requires publicly disclosed monitoring of major pollutants, but “fence-line” communities in Louisiana have long sought data on their exposure to hazardous and likely carcinogenic chemicals like chloroprene and ethylene oxide, which were not subject to these same regulations.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened regulations for these pollutants, though the Trump administration has committed to rolling them back.

The Biden administration’s EPA also injected funding to support community-based air monitoring, especially in neighborhoods on the “fence-line” with industrial plants that emit pollutants that they were not required to publicly monitor under federal law. Some groups, saying they lack confidence in the data the state does provide, embraced the chance to monitor the air themselves with federal funding.

“These programs help detect pollution levels in areas of the country not well served by traditional and costly air monitoring systems,” the lawsuit stated.

In response to the influx of grassroots air monitoring, Louisiana’s Legislature passed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act, or CAMRA, which requires that community groups that monitor pollutants “for the purpose of alleging violations or noncompliance” of federal law must follow EPA standards, including approved equipment that can costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“You can’t talk about air quality unless you’re using the equipment that they want you to use,” said David Bookbinder, director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which represents the plaintiffs. He added there was no need for community groups to purchase such expensive equipment when cheaper technology could provide “perfectly adequate results … to be able to tell your community, your family, whether or not the air they’re breathing is safe.”

Community groups sharing information based on cheaper air monitoring equipment that did not meet these requirements could face penalties of $32,500 a day and up to $1 million for intentional violations, according to analysis from the Environmental Integrity Project.

“We’re a small nonprofit, we couldn’t afford to pay one day’s worth of that,” Robertson said. “And the way the law is written, it’s so ambiguous, you don’t really know what you can and can’t do.”

There is no known instance in which the state has pursued these penalties, but community groups say the law has a chilling effect on their work.

“The purpose of this was very clear: to silence the science, preventing people from doing anything with it, sharing it in any form,” said Caitlion Hunter, director of research and policy for Rise St. James, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

“I’m not sure how regulating community air-monitoring programs ‘violates their constitutional rights’,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill countered in a written statement.

Industry groups are excluded from the law’s requirements, the lawsuit notes.

The law presumes “that air monitoring information lacks accuracy if disseminated by community air monitoring groups, but not by industry participants or the state,” the complaint states.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency refused to comment, citing pending litigation.

The stated rationale for the administration’s action is a combination of a domestic energy emergency and a desire to win the geopolitical competition against China and Russia. However, if implemented as written, these orders could undermine the very objective they intend to promote.

The new orders assert that the failure of the U.S. to develop the nuclear energy sector in recent decades is primarily attributable to a myopic and misguided approach to nuclear regulation by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Under the Atomic Energy Act, the commission licenses the design, construction and operation of domestic nuclear and radiological facilities, including commercial nuclear power plants.

The orders lay out a series of radical steps to scale back, reorient and even bypass the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by having the Departments of Energy or Defense license non-commercial reactors to be built on their federal sites. In total, they aim to achieve rapid development of new nuclear designs and expedited construction of advanced nuclear power plants.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is also ordered to effect a “wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance” within nine months.

The desire to revamp the U.S. nuclear industrial base, encourage and support new nuclear power plant construction, and streamline Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing is welcome.

However, it is neither new nor specific to the Trump administration. Under the ADVANCE Act passed by Congress in 2024, the commission had already begun to adapt its licensing processes for new reactor designs and recruit staff to do this work.

Three flawed premises guide the new executive orders. First, they see the future of nuclear energy as fundamentally similar to that of other energy sources — whereby innovation in design and fast deployment are seen as inherent net positives, and bugs, if any, can be fixed later.

The orders downplay or ignore the special magnitude of nuclear risks, the series of traumatic accidents suffered by leading nuclear power nations and the unique environmental and multi-generational footprint of nuclear waste and spent fuel.

Second, nuclear regulation is mostly viewed as unduly burdensome, expensive, time-consuming and an outright drag on efficiency.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is explicitly blamed for “throttling nuclear power development” in the U.S. In this regard, the orders fail to recognize a central purpose of regulation: to build and maintain trust in nuclear energy.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not presented the key obstacle to nuclear development in the U.S. And it is the key instrument to earn and keep trust in nuclear energy both nationally and internationally.

Third, the executive orders grossly exaggerate the delays to new deployment legitimately attributable to excessive nuclear regulation. They underestimate the addition of time to market due to limitations on workforce availability, supply chain, financing, specialty fuels and community buy-in.

What Americans need is confidence that any nuclear power plant built and operated in the U.S. is safe, secure and ultimately beneficial to American and host community prosperity.

However, the net result of these executive orders, coupled with the additional impact of other administration actions to reform governmental regulatory processes to align with White House policies, is to risk public trust in nuclear energy.

Downscaling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s staff, curtailing its political independence, compromising its technical integrity, scaling back its community engagement role or avoiding the commission outright introduces more uncertainty than inspires confidence in a nuclear renaissance.

It would shatter the commission’s credibility, nationwide and worldwide, to lower the risk standards it has been credibly using for years to minimize adverse radiation effects from nuclear power plants.

Furthermore, the orders are bound to expedite the brain drain from the agency, whose credibility, speed and efficiency are all dependent on a quality workforce that firmly believes in its mission and inspires all others with its professionalism.

They will reduce confidence in further extending the lives of aging nuclear power plants —many of which have been operating for 60 years or more — or in restarting mothballed plants.

And they could unnecessarily increase public wariness that new nuclear designs will not be subjected to a rigorous and transparent review before their performance can be fully demonstrated and tested.

The public reactions to the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima underscore how critical trust is to sustaining public support for nuclear power.

Here, the global setback to the credibility of the Federal Aviation Agency as a U.S. aerospace licensing authority is a poignant reminder, when it emerged after deadly crashes of Boeing’s 737 Max, that the agency had delegated some of its licensing process to the company.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s credibility as a professional, independent regulator is also a major selling point for U.S. nuclear vendors seeking to win overseas contracts.

At a time when the U.S. nuclear industry is trying to achieve economies of scale to bolster its competitiveness against Russian and Chinese firms (who can offer better financing and other perks), the commission’s reputation as the gold standard in nuclear regulation is one of the few comparative American advantages.

Yes, Nuclear Regulatory Commission operations should be more efficient. The effort to make them so is already well underway and could be further encouraged.

But now — just as nuclear power nears a new dawn — is the worst possible time to damage the commission’s capacity to credibly assess and faithfully, independently and publicly report its evaluations and licensing considerations and decisions.

A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists published Tuesday found River Bend was the most problematic nuclear plant in the U.S., when measuring regulatory violations.","Elected officials homed in Tuesday on the timeline of events that led to an abrupt order of forced blackouts on Sunday in Louisiana, prompting Entergy and Cleco to cut the lights to 100,000 residents in the New Orleans area amid hot, late-spring temperatures.

Regulators had previously pinned the outages, in part, on the unexpected shutdown of River Bend, a nuclear plant north of Baton Rouge. But Entergy and federal officials said Tuesday that River Bend was shut down because of a leak on May 21. That left the grid operator, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, with several days to plan for the lower supply of electricity.

The timing has raised more questions about why Louisiana was forced into a “load shed” event that caused widespread outages well before peak summer demand for electricity.

Officials are asking Entergy and MISO officials to answer questions publicly about what happened next Tuesday at a City Council meeting and at a Public Service Commission hearing next month, in a bid to figure out how the looming power deficit was not caught earlier. Entergy is also expected to face questions about its long-standing lack of transmission in south Louisiana that has created “load pockets” where it’s difficult to import power.

The River Bend nuclear plant shut down May 21 after operators noticed a leak, which they identified two days later as the result of a faulty valve in the reactor’s cooling system, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Entergy fixed the valve over the weekend before bringing the plant back online Monday.

The plant did not unexpectedly trip offline over the weekend, as has been previously reported, said Victor Dricks, spokesperson for the NRC.

But the Mid-Continent System Operator, a nonprofit that operates the electric grid across a wide swath of the U.S., did not give Entergy or Cleco advance warning that power demand was set to outstrip supply. A New Orleans City Council member said Tuesday that Entergy reported getting only three minutes notice Sunday before being forced to “shed load,” or proactively turn off the lights for tens of thousands of people to avoid catastrophic damage to the electric grid.

If regulators and Entergy had known about the looming power deficit, regulators and advocates say they could have taken steps to prevent forced blackouts. Some industrial plants have contracts that require them to ramp down power during such emergencies, allowing the utility to free up 280 megawatts of capacity in the Entergy system as of 2023. Other customers also could have been required to conserve energy.

Two days after the outages, it remains unclear how other factors might have been at play. Higher than forecast temperatures could have contributed, but Logan Burke, head of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, noted that Entergy and Cleco were required to shed 600 megawatts of power, a huge amount that makes it unlikely bad weather forecasts can totally explain it.

“The question is, what else do we not know about?” Burke said, noting it’s unknown whether non-nuclear power plants or transmission lines were out of service during the event.

“I can imagine MISO missing 100 megawatts,” Burke added. “600 is just hard to fathom where that’s coming from.”

MISO said that “unplanned” outages of generators and transmission structures contributed to the power losses. But neither MISO, nor Entergy and Cleco, have provided more information about which generators and transmission lines were down.

A MISO communication shared with The Times-Picayune shows the grid operator was aware of a “planned outage,” then another unit went down, though the communication does not specify which units. Entergy had a separate nuclear plant, Waterford, that was down for scheduled maintenance, which is normal in the spring.

“Operating conditions over the weekend required us to take our absolute last resort action to maintain reliability in our South Region — a temporary, controlled load shed,” MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said Tuesday. “We will conduct a thorough assessment of the event and provide additional information once complete.”

Entergy had taken its Waterford plant down for scheduled maintenance well ahead of the event so it could fix it up ahead of peak summer demand, spokesperson Brandon Scardigli. He said Entergy had been monitoring warmer than usual temperatures, but its own models did not show the need for load shedding. He said MISO uses a different model with a broader view of system conditions.

And while River Bend was offline, he said Entergy made that outage known to MISO for its modeling several days before.

“While the River Bend generating unit was offline during the event, it had been out for several days before the event, and its outage was accounted for in the generation that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans made available to MISO and in MISO’s own modeling,” Scardigli said.

'Forecasting was off'

Federal energy regulators began encouraging the creation of grid operators like MISO decades ago as a way to make sure the market for wholesale electricity was fair and reliable. MISO was formed as a nonprofit in the late 90s and has grown to operate the grid — and wholesale electric markets — across a wide swath of middle America.

In 2013, under pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice amid its investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices, Entergy joined MISO, creating a new region called MISO South.

Employees in a cavernous facility in Carmel, Indiana, MISO’s headquarters, sit in front of a huge array of screens showing information about the electric grid in its territory. They plan for which power plants dispatch power onto the grid to make sure electricity flows smoothly and at the right levels.

Another grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool, was doing similar work last month when operators identified “instability” on the grid and ordered SWEPCO to shed power, causing blackouts for 30,000 people in the Shreveport area.

Public Service Commissioner Eric Skrmetta, a Republican who is one of five statewide utility regulators in Louisiana, has long opposed Entergy’s participation in MISO, arguing the utility could get a better deal elsewhere.

Skrmetta said he believes there was enough power and transmission in the region when MISO ordered the load shed over the weekend. He said MISO should have known ahead of time that River Bend was down.

“They plan it a day ahead, two days ahead,” Skrmetta said. “There’s absolutely no reason for MISO to call this unless MISO made a mistake.”

Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat representing New Orleans, said he was initially told a plant unexpectedly went offline, leading him to believe River Bend tripping offline was the source of the problem. After NRC’s confirmation that River Bend went down much earlier, Lewis said a “misforecast” along with generators and transmission lines being out appears to be the root of the problem.

Lewis said he remains concerned about how Entergy’s inability to import power using long-range transmission might have played a part.

“The forecasting was off somewhere,” he said.

Councilmember JP Morrell, chair of the City Council’s utility committee, said he expects to get answers from MISO and Entergy during their meeting next week.

Morrell said he’s particularly concerned about the lack of advanced warning from MISO that demand was outstripping supply, as well as who decided which parts of Entergy’s territory would have the lights turned off.

“If we knew as early as Wednesday of last week that generation was gonna be a problem, it would have given regulators the ability to ... curb demand to avoid the brownout,” Morrell said.

He added that while Louisiana is not yet in summer peak electricity demand, lots of power companies do their maintenance this time of year, which can cause supply issues.

Long-standing issues

Entergy has long had issues with some of its nuclear plants, including Grand Gulf, the source of years of litigation over alleged mismanagement. A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists published Tuesday found River Bend was the most problematic nuclear plant in the U.S., when measuring regulatory violations.

Entergy told the NRC, which oversees nuclear plants, that it noticed an unidentified leak in River Bend’s cooling system last week. Nuclear plants have a series of pipes circulating water to cool down the reactor. Entergy identified a faulty valve in one of those systems, and the leak reached a threshold — two gallons per minute over a 24-hour period — that required operators to shut the plant down and fix it.

Entergy welded the valve over the weekend and brought the plant back online Monday. As of Tuesday morning, it was operating at 80% capacity, Dricks said.

Energy advocates in recent days pointed to a long-standing lack of transmission as a potential part of the problem, too. Transmission lines can carry power long distances, but a lack of Entergy lines in south Louisiana creates what experts call “load pockets,” where it’s difficult to import electricity.

Over the weekend, prices for electricity soared in south Louisiana, according to MISO data, while prices in nearby states were low, underscoring Entergy’s lack of ability to import electricity from elsewhere.

Read the report: Embracing Clean Heat: Opportunities for Zero-Emission Industrial Boilers

See the interactive map: National Map of Industrial Boilers

The report provides a detailed overview of the industrial boiler landscape, currently dominated by fuel-combusting units. It introduces a first-of-its-kind national dataset that maps nearly 14,000 combustion boilers across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, offering vital insights into the scale and geographic distribution of pollution emitted by these units.

“A strengthened manufacturing base in the United States can help revitalize communities in our country that have been left behind for too long,” said Andres Restrepo, report co-author and Sierra Club attorney. “However, its promise will be lost if manufacturers remain dependent on the fossil fuels that drive climate change and that pollute our air and water. As our report shows, by embracing clean technologies like heat pumps, policymakers can take a huge step cleaning up industry and paving the way for a healthier, more prosperous future for all.”

Key findings

Boilers are a major source of harmful pollution: Alongside their massive emissions of greenhouse gases, combustion boilers release enormous amounts of conventional pollutants that can impair lung and cardiovascular health, cause cancer, and lead to premature death. For instance, industrial boilers emit more smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) than major industrial sectors like coal-fired power plants, oil refineries, and cement plants.

Boiler pollution disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities: 66 percent of the highest-emitting boilers are located in federally designated disadvantaged communities, where average annual NOx emissions are nearly double the national average. Moreover, 25 percent of boilers are located in areas that already exceed legal air pollution limits.

Boiler populations are heavily concentrated: Nearly 40 percent of boilers in the dataset are located in one of five states: California, Minnesota, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Texas.

Fortunately, clean alternatives for generating industrial heat—such as heat pumps, conventional electric boilers, and thermal energy storage—are already commercially available. These technologies can deliver industrial heat without on-site emissions and can dramatically reduce both greenhouse gas and conventional pollutant emissions, even when accounting for upstream electricity generation.

Despite the significantly higher efficiency—especially in the case of heat pumps, which can reach efficiencies of up to 400 percent—clean alternatives to combustion boilers have yet to gain widespread adoption in the industrial sector. This slow uptake underscores the crucial role that policymakers, particularly at the state and local level, must play in facilitating the transition to zero-emission industrial heat. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the economic landscape surrounding boiler electrification and presents a comprehensive roadmap spanning economic, legal, and policy strategies to accelerate the deployment of clean thermal technology across U.S. manufacturing.

Policy recommendations

State-level clean air standards: States can leverage their existing legal authority to set stricter emissions standards on industrial boilers, going beyond outdated or absent federal regulations. By targeting pollutants like NOx and CO2 pollution at the source, states can protect public health and advance climate goals simultaneously.

Strategic investment in electrification: States can close the cost gap between fossil-fueled and electric boilers through targeted measures such as production tax credits, workforce development programs, and clean heat incentives. These investments will not only accelerate decarbonization, but also create high-quality jobs, especially in disadvantaged and frontline communities.

Utility rate reform: Public utility commissions can modernize industrial rate structures to reward electrification and on-site energy storage, reflecting their benefits for grid flexibility and long-term savings.

In addition to the main report, Evergreen Action and Sierra Club have also provided appendices that include references for further study, real-world case studies of covered technologies, and a comprehensive methodology of the dataset development process, as well as an executive summary of the report.

“Industrial boilers represent a huge opportunity,” said Trevor Dolan, report co-author and Evergreen Action industry and workforce senior policy lead. “By stepping in with supportive policies, states can correct market failures, drive meaningful emissions reductions, and help manufacturers modernize for a more competitive, low-carbon future—while protecting the communities that have long borne the brunt of industrial pollution. This is the moment for states to lead and finally take on one of the dirtiest, most overlooked sources of industrial pollution.”

“Switching from dirty, outdated boilers to clean, modern heat systems is one of the smartest ways to cut pollution and save money in the long run,” said Justine Hackimer, Ohio River Valley Institute (ORVI) industrial decarbonization program manager. “Boiler pollution is a serious problem in Pennsylvania—but the good news is that, as this report shows, we have real solutions. With nearly $400 million available through the state’s RISE PA program, local manufacturers have a great opportunity to lead the way in building a cleaner, healthier future for our communities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-28 11:09:48.951356

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are taking steps to limit the reach of the EPA, including loosening regulations for laws like the Clean Air Act, along with staffing cuts. Watchdogs said new federal cases targeting pollution violators have ground to a halt.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center and a former environmental crimes prosecutor who worked under both Republican and Democratic leadership, said it is unusual.

""The environmental laws require EPA, working with the states, to protect the environment,"" Learner explained. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

States can try to fill gaps but Uhlmann noted history has shown the federal government sets the tone in going after violators. He argued diminished enforcement hurts communities' health and creates a competitive disadvantage for companies complying with federal orders. The agency's new leaders have said overhauls save taxpayers money and align with the President's promise to ""unleash American energy.""

Minnesota is one of six states in the EPA's Region Five, which Uhlmann described as one of the more active parts of the country for enforcement. He pointed out the Great Lakes have come a long way from their reputations as big, polluted waterways in the 1970s.

""Year in and year out, there's more enforcement cases brought in Region 5, and some of the biggest cases are brought in Region 5,"" Uhlmann emphasized.

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

There are more than 20,000 abandoned oil and gas wells scattered across West Virginia, putting communities at risk for water contamination and increased exposure to environmental pollutants.

State lawmakers said a new law will make it easier to fill those wells. Previously, state code required removal of mining infrastructure before wells could be plugged with cement and other materials.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

Indiana's rural communities could lose out under a new federal bill aimed at speeding up clean energy development.

What Republicans are calling the One Big Beautiful Bill, part of President Donald Trump's tax package, includes major changes to how energy and infrastructure projects get environmental approval.

Lawmakers rewrote parts of the National Environmental Policy Act, to shorten timelines and block lawsuits that often delay big builds.

Supporters say the changes will fast-track everything from solar farms to broadband.

But Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, warned that the new rules may push developers to focus on easier, cheaper sites.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing Environmental Protection Agency general counsel, who say that 90% of the details NEPA review are purely there for litigation proofing,"" said Hochman. ""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said.
It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.” Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added.
Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.
Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement.","After Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis toured a battery module manufacturing facility located about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City airport, among open lands and farms in Tooele County, he reflected on an oil embargo in the ’70s that had deep impacts on the country’s economy.

Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.

“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.’”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

Tax bill proposal terminating clean energy credits may increase Utahns’ energy costs

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.

“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.

Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.

“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”

As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world.

For the past year, Rheinmetall ran a field trial with four curb chargers in Germany, and the results are impressive.","Rheinmetall's Curb Charger fits neatly into the sidewalk.

It doesn't have a support structure, meaning pedestrians can still enjoy the full width of the sidewalk.

The Level 2 charger can provide up to 22 kW of power through a 400V three-phase electrical connection.

Curbside electric-vehicle charging is great. It’s very convenient, especially when you need to do stuff for a few hours away from home. The chargers are usually mounted on some sort of pole or support structure—maybe shaped like a parking meter, or even a lamppost itself—but that can take away some space for pedestrians.

Now, though, there’s a solution, and it comes from a rather unusual company. Rheinmetall is Europe’s largest arms maker, but the German company is also knee-deep in the mobility game. And its solution is to simply replace concrete curbs with discrete Level 2 EV chargers.

Photo by: Rheinmetall

The product is called simply the Curb Charger, and it’s exactly that. A 176-pound (80-kilogram) modular lump of stainless steel and aluminum that houses all the necessary equipment to deliver up to 22 kilowatts of power to an electric vehicle.

It has an integrated 4G modem and Ethernet port, as well as an RFID reader and a display. The charger can be controlled via a smartphone app or by scanning an RFID card or QR code. It’s IP68 rated, meaning it can be submerged in water that’s at least 3.2 feet (1.0 meter) deep for at least 30 minutes.

Rheinmetall says the encapsulated electronics can withstand any type of weather and that the enclosure has built-in drains, so that even if it pours, it can still safely deliver power to a connected EV. To make a point, the company has a video where someone pours a bucket of water over the charging cable.

In case the water level rises on the street, there’s a water level sensor that cuts power. There’s also a built-in heating system for when it’s very cold outside, which ensures the charger is always snow- and ice-free.

Speaking of the cable, the charger doesn’t come with one. The enclosure sits flush with the sidewalk, so EV drivers need to have their own Type 2 cable in the trunk—but that’s rarely an issue, especially in Europe, where curbside charging is typically a bring-your-own plug affair that most drivers are already used to.

Charging operators also have it easy after installing the Curb Charger because if something goes wrong with one unit, it can simply be replaced with a fresh one, thanks to a quick-release system that separates the metal enclosure from the electronic module.

For the past year, Rheinmetall ran a field trial with four curb chargers in Germany, and the results are impressive. The chargers had an uptime of over 99% and provided over 2,800 charging sessions over 12 months, in all kinds of weather.

With any luck, innovative charging solutions like this one will catch on in other parts of the world as well.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBqK8b/s1/rheinmetall-curb-charger.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 12:27:56.157351

Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement.","After Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis toured a battery module manufacturing facility located about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City airport, among open lands and farms in Tooele County, he reflected on an oil embargo in the ’70s that had deep impacts on the country’s economy.

Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.

“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.’”

The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.

“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”

Tax bill proposal terminating clean energy credits may increase Utahns’ energy costs

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location.

During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.

The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping.

“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”

“I was teasing in the other room, our governor wants to increase the amount of energy that we produce by double in the next 10 years. And if he were here, I’d put my arm around him and say, ‘governor, I love you. But that is not enough,’” Curtis said about Gov. Spencer Cox’s Operation Gigawatt. “There are demands coming on energy that far exceed doubling in 10 years.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0960-scaled-e1748393887426-2048x1707.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 09:08:20.760419

As part of the announcement, Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte joined President Trump at the White House alongside other industry leaders. The event marked a historic moment in the administration’s effort to secure America’s energy future and unleash American energy dominance.

“These executive orders are about enabling deployment. They show clear alignment around the need to modernize how we license, fuel, and build advanced nuclear power to meet rising demand,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo.

The executive orders direct agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DoD) to operate more effectively as both customers and enablers of new energy technologies. Oklo supports efforts to empower the DOE, DoD, and NRC to use existing authorities more efficiently and to prioritize performance-based, mission-aligned reviews.

Oklo is developing U.S. invented fast fission power plants capable of recycling used nuclear material and converting it into clean, firm power. The company is the only advanced nuclear developer with an active site use permit from the DOE, a fuel award through a competitive DOE and Idaho National Laboratory program, and active regulatory traction with the NRC for its first commercial power plant.

The executive orders also emphasize the importance of using existing feedstock of domestic nuclear fuel feedstock to jump-start early projects and strengthen national energy resilience. Oklo’s fuel award for its first core load is sourced from used nuclear fuel material from the successful Experimental Breeder Reactor II program. This DOE fast reactor demonstration operated for decades and proved the viability of both fast reactor technology and recycling used fuel. The company’s power plants are designed to use either fresh High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium or recycled used nuclear material.

The executive orders reaffirm the United States’ strategic commitment to leading the world in advanced nuclear energy, a vision Oklo is advancing through its demonstrated technology and efforts to enable commercial deployment at scale.

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale; establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes; and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel material from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

Significant progress has been made since the plans were first introduced in 2018, but stronger efforts are needed from Member States to align policies, mobilise private investment, and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies.

NECPs are the cornerstone of EU Member States’ commitments to meet shared climate and energy goals, serving as detailed roadmaps for decarbonisation, energy efficiency, and energy security. EU Member States are required to submit National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), under the Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action.

EU Targets

The EU’s climate targets include a reduction of at least 55% in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and full climate neutrality by 2050. On the energy side, the objectives relate to renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy security. By 2030, at least 42.5% of gross final energy consumption should come from renewable sources, with a 11.7% reduction in energy consumption compared to 2020, and at least 15% of electricity interconnection capacity between Member States.

NECPs include a full overview of national energy and climate targets, describing existing and planned policies with their related impacts as well as the investment needs under different scenarios. They provide information across five energy topics:

decarbonisation covering renewable energy, GHG emissions and removals

energy efficiency

energy security

internal energy markets

research, innovation and competitiveness.

NECPs are a vital tool for meeting EU targets with the European Commission stressing that the NECPs “must evolve into strategic investment plans that foster investment predictability, consumer confidence, innovation and market growth for clean technologies” as stated in its ‘Action Plan for Affordable Energy’. With this, the European Commission is affirming one of the core purposes of the NECPs: to enhance regulatory and investor certainty and to fully exploit opportunities for economic development, investment stimulation, job creation and social cohesion.

This investment-focused approach is essential if plans are to translate into action. As underlined in the EU-wide assessment of the final NECPs released today, unlocking the full potential of these plans requires a sharper alignment with market signals, private capital flows, and industrial policy priorities.

To meet its 2030 climate and energy goals, the EU needs approximately €570 billion in annual investments, which requires a strategic mix of public funding and leveraged private capital. While some Member States have improved investment planning in their NECPs, many still lack clear financing strategies, especially regarding private sector involvement.

The Commission has issued a clear call to these Member States to step up efforts to unlock the investments needed to meet the targets. Member States are urged to better identify investment needs, adopt supportive tax systems, and use EU funding and technical assistance to implement NECPs and build a competitive, resilient clean economy. The Commission aims to support this through initiatives like the Clean Industrial Deal, boosting InvestEU’s risk capacity, and introducing a Clean Energy Investment Strategy. A reformed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will prioritize clean transition funding, with simplified access via tools such as the Competitiveness Fund and Innovation Fund.

Since 2018, when the first NECPs were submitted, Ricardo has been supporting this policymaking process and our sustainability experts have been working with the industrial sector to accelerate decarbonisation in line with EU targets.

One of Ricardo’s renowned energy policy experts, Eugenia Bonifazi, will be sharing key insights and specialist knowledge on the topic at the European Sustainable Energy Week (10-12 June 2025, Brussels) in the policy session “An energy union that delivers: National Energy and Climate Plans”, chaired by the Directorate-General for Energy of the European Commission. The focus of the session will be on the key takeaways that can be drawn from NECPs today, and, looking ahead, how we ensure that they guide the investments needed in the three core areas of the EU’s Competitiveness Compass: innovation, decarbonisation and security. Eugenia will bring her experience as the leader and manager of the consortium assisting the European Commission in the assessment of the draft and final NECPs.

Pick any major city and most aspects look and feel broadly familiar, yet the fundamentals are different. You can’t hail an Uber or use Google Maps to get around, and your hotel TV won’t have Netflix. Instead, there’s always a domestic alternative. One that is likely newer, bigger, quicker, and perhaps even better than what you’re used to back home.

And so to the Chinese car industry, whose latest opportunity to scare the living daylights out of Europe and the US came at the Auto Shanghai motor show. Held at the world’s second-largest exhibition space, the show saw more than 1,400 cars from 26 countries spread across 13 halls. Some 93 vehicles made their world debut in front of 1 million attendees. YouTubers would later upload whole-show walk-throughs with run times longer than Interstellar.

How many world debuts do you suppose took place at the 2024 Geneva International Motor Show? About a dozen. No wonder it was canceled for 2025.

To Western eyes, photos of Auto Shanghai are akin to asking ChatGPT to recreate the glory days of motor shows past. Anyone who strolled the cavernous convention halls of Paris, Frankfurt, Geneva, Detroit, even Birmingham, and gawped at the new and the exciting will recognize the scene. There’s lots of shiny metal and carbon, formed into cars of every conceivable size, shape and social status. But the badges are unfamiliar, model names nonsensical; prices implausibly low, performance claims from another planet.

Admittedly, some cars are dressed in fur like children’s toys, complete with bunny ears and tail, but perhaps that’s just the AI hallucinating. This still largely looks like the sort of auto show Europe and the US hosted every few months in a prepandemic world.

Names like Jetour, Denza, iCar, Changan, Hongqi and Luxeed won’t ring many bells. Keep walking and you’ll catch a reassuring glimpse of Audi, Lotus, Buick, and Volkswagen, but the spark of familiarity they bring is quickly extinguished by a stark realization: They are no longer in Shanghai to show the fledgling locals how it’s done, as beacons of a Western industry riding high on a century of success. They’re surrounded by younger, fitter, and keener rivals with a hunger to put a ding in the universe. And there’s about to be a feeding frenzy.

Award Winners and Oddballs

Highlights of this year’s Shanghai show included the Jetour G900, a range-extended electric SUV with two rear-mounted turbines for use as a boat; an electric Porsche 911 rival from BYD-owned Denza; the award-winning Xpeng M03 Mona; and the Maextro S800, a Maybach-rivaling luxury sedan from Huawei.

Yes, that Huawei. The telecom company oversees the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance (HIMA), which includes car brands like AITO, Stelato, and SAIC, itself another auto group that includes Roewe, Rising Auto, Wuling, and former British sports car maker MG, among others.

There was also Luxeed, a brand related to both Huawei and Chery, the latter of which sold over 2.5 million cars in 2024 and is the parent of Jaecoo, Omoda, Lepas and iCar. Those names might not be familiar to you yet, but they soon will be. Many will land on your radar because of their low prices. Dig a little deeper and you’ll find that the Jaecoo 7, a well-priced hybrid SUV, is already selling over 700 units a month in the UK. A nose-diving Tesla registered just 536 cars there in April.

Auto Shanghai had plenty of oddballs too. Ora followed up on its Funky Cat with the Ballet Cat, which curiously borrows much of its styling from the original VW Beetle. Songsan filled its stand with cars inspired by late-’50s Americana, including a seven-door take on the VW Microbus and a proportionally challenged revival of a first-generation Corvette. A handful of cars appeared to be inexplicably dressed as cuddly toys, one sharing its stand with a giant comb. Another, the Baojun Yep, had a massive ice cream cone dunked on its roof for reasons unclear.

320 Miles in 5 Minutes

Such fever dreams won't give Western brands sleepless nights, but the EV technology coming out of China in 2025 certainly will. BYD used the Shanghai show to reveal a charging system powerful enough to deliver 259 miles of range in five minutes, at a peak speed of 1,000 kW—10 times the charge rate of a Mini Cooper.

Soon after, domestic rival CATL went one better with its 1,300 kW of charging power, enough to deliver 323 miles of range in five minutes. For context, Europe’s fastest-charging EVs, like the Porsche Taycan, fill their batteries at a mere 320 kW.

As well as dazzling tech, Chinese automakers are also majoring on small, low-price cars that appeal to Europe, the UK, and even emerging markets. Perfectly decent EVs—on paper, at least—are soon expected to land below the €20,000 ($22,700) barrier. Established marques like Volkswagen, Fiat, and Renault should soon be there too. But with models like the VW ID.1 not due in showrooms until 2027, cut-price alternatives from China’s Leapmotor, Lepas, and Firefly could quickly sweep up all the drivers wondering whatever happened to the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Up.

Things Sure Have Changed

It wasn’t always this way. Oh, how we once laughed when each year brought a Chinese motor show filled with poor imitations of European bestsellers.

Rewind a decade—just a single generation in car years—and the cream of Europe’s prestigious brands would reveal world-beating hypercars in the convention halls of Geneva and Paris, while China’s auto shows were, to the West, a laughing stock. Glitzy as they may have been, the show floors of Beijing and Shanghai in the mid-2010s featured flagrant knockoffs of British and European cars. Brands like Changan, BYD, Zotye, and Hongqi revealed vehicles unashamedly aping the latest designs of Mercedes, Ford, Land Rover, McLaren, and Porsche.

The most infamous of all the copycats was the Landwind X7, which looked so similar to the Range Rover Evoque that, after four years of legal battles, a Chinese court ruled in favor of JLR, demanding the car be taken off sale and the British company awarded compensation.

Six years on, and with JLR absent from Shanghai 2025, China no longer feels the need to copy the West. Instead, it is the US and Europe being forced to play catch-up. Audi hit the Caps Lock key and used Auto Shanghai to reveal the first car of its China-only sub-brand, called AUDI.

Lowercase Audi said AUDI’s new E5 Sportback “offers the very best qualities of Audi, reimagined for and tailored to customers in China.” The German company claimed its engineering prowess is being blended with China’s own digital ecosystems and innovations, and that the AUDI division, which drops the iconic four-ringed logo, marks the beginning of a new era for the company in the region, “ensuring rapid response to the evolving demands of the Chinese market.” It will be interesting to see if this China-flavored AUDI Audi—reversing the trend of Chinese makers increasingly nailing the Western auto taste—is a success.

Some Western brands might need a rapid-response unit of their own, since not only are their sales falling in China, but the popularity of Chinese upstarts elsewhere is surging. BYD expects to double its overseas sales in a single year, rising from 417,000 vehicles in 2024 to over 800,000 in 2025. With US sales on ice, an increasingly brand-agnostic UK is poised to become a key battleground for BYD, along with Latin America and Southeast Asia.

Elon Musk’s biggest headache has also found success in Australia, where BYD sales hit 40,000 units in 2024 (matching those of a Tesla rapidly heading in the opposite direction), and are on track to double in 2025. Where Tesla has failed to expand its two-vehicle lineup, BYD has grown from one model in Australia in 2022, to six just three years later.

China’s Smart Western Hiring Spree

It’s easy to credit Beijing’s massive investment in China’s nascent auto sector as a prime contributor to its success. But China’s closing of the gap to, and in many cases overtaking, US and European carmakers isn’t due to cash and copying alone. Just as the Japanese and Korean brands did before them, the Chinese have hired smartly.

Luxury sedan maker Hongqi took on Rolls-Royce design head Giles Taylor as its own global vice president of design in 2018. Similarly, Bentley design chief Stefam Sielaff headed to Geely in 2021, while 2024 saw Jozef Kaban—whose pencil gave us the era-defining Bugatti Veyron—swap Audi for MG, a part of Chinese giant SAIC. Stellantis UK managing director Maria Grazia Davino moved to BYD that same year, and JuanMa Lopez, who spent a decade as head of exterior design at Ferrari, moved to Xpeng.

Back to Shanghai, and the hits kept on coming. The Nio ET7 promised 620 miles of range from a battery bigger than that of a Rolls-Royce Spectre. The Huawei AITO M9 SUV has a projector screen for entertaining passengers in the second and third rows. The Chery iCar C23, a small electric off-road with the approach and departure angles of a mountain goat, is priced at the equivalent of $13,000 (and is coming to the UK in 2026, to the delight of Suzuki Jimny fans).

Headed to the Australian market for under $30,000, the Deepal E07 gave the Tesla Cybertruck a lesson in practicality, with the ability to transform its cargo area from the interior of an SUV to the open bed of a truck.

Riding the Wave

And it wasn’t just a show for EVs. Gas-powered cars shared the floor with all manner of hybrids, range-extended EVs that use engines as generators, and even old-school, stick-shift trucks with turbo-diesel engines ready to conquer emerging markets with rock-bottom prices.

At the other end of the market, Hongqi showed off vehicles with the thick carpets, dashboard artwork, and limitless customization normally reserved for Rolls-Royce. Its Guoyue luxury minibus even riffs on Rolls’ headliner filled with twinkling LED stars.

But focusing on what China’s still bunging into the photocopier misses the point. Here is an auto industry that—after substantial government support, it must be reiterated—is booming like no other. And, most worryingly of all, it’s an industry no longer content with serving its own enormous market.

Chinese brands are already making serious inroads across Australia and Europe. In May, it was reported that, for the first time, BYD sold more cars on the continent than Tesla in the previous month. BYD only entered Europe in 2020, and it waited two years before even expanding beyond Norway and the Netherlands.

Tesla’s growth at the start of this decade was equally staggering, but from the US there has been no follow-up act. Faraday Future was a failure, Slate Auto is fun but niche. Cash-hemorrhaging Lucid and Rivian are yet to touch foreign shores, and meanwhile behind BYD the tide has just gone out, and a tsunami is about to hit.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6835ff0c14a5496c30615334/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/shanghai-auto-show-gear-2212245139.jpg",N,,2025-05-28 10:15:42.430838

Hydropower model validation The first validation of the B1hydro model is designed to test the regression model using drop-one-year cross validation.
In this procedure one year of data is dropped and the other years are used to predict the missing generation data.
One outcome of the 9505 assessment is the development of a hydropower dataset that uses a selection of hydrologic models, hydropower models, forcing datasets.28 Here we compare with two hydrology models, Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)29 and VIC, two hydropower models, wmpy-power (WMP) and WRES28, and one forcing dataset, Livneh30.","Hydropower is a critical electricity resource in the United States (U.S.) accounting for an average 6.63% of annual utility scale generation from 2013 to 2023.1 Hydropower can also provide a range of ancillary services such as load factoring, operating reserves, voltage support, and blackstart that are especially valuable as low-cost non-dispatchable resources are added to the grid.2 Despite the importance of hydropower to the grid, there are limited comprehensive datasets available from which to study both historical and future impacts of climate, weather driven energy droughts, and integration of other weather driven generation. In this paper, we present a hydropower generation dataset covering 1,452 hydroelectric plants in the contiguous U.S comprised of both federal and privately owned facilities. The dataset contains monthly and weekly hydropower generation estimates for both historical (1982–2019) and future (2020–2099) periods, the latter containing 4 different climate scenarios.

Power system models such as production cost models (PCMs) represent the power system as an optimization problem where energy demands are met with both dispatchable resources such as natural gas and non-dispatchable resources such as wind and solar. These models often treat hydropower as a dispatchable resource which requires operational constraints such as power targets, minimum generation, maximum generation, and ramping rates which serve as approximations of true hydropower operations. The data presented here includes these operational constraints and so can be readily used to represent nearly all existing conventional U.S. hydropower generation in power system models.

The development of hydropower generation and power constraints requires a series of models and data including meteorology, hydrology, routing, water management, and hydropower (Fig. 1). A distributed hydrology model takes meteorology data as input and computes gridded runoff, based on the calibrated hydrologic parameters. The runoff data is passed to a routing model which develops natural streamflow estimates within a river channel network developed on a uniform 1/8th degree grid. At certain grid cells where dams are present, the routing model must take into account human management, including reservoir operations and water demands. The final model in the chain converts regulated streamflow to hydropower. The following sections describe the models in greater detail.

Meteorology Data

In this study we used perturbed thermodynamics experiments3,4 (https://tgw-data.msdlive.org/) as meteorological forcing. The forcing data is a 1/8th degree dynamically downscaled product which contains both historical data and future projections over the contiguous United States (i.e. lower 48 states), southern Canada, and northern Mexico. The dynamically downscaled data is produced by initializing a WRF5 model using ERA56 boundary conditions. The future projections are developed by replicating the historical period (1980–2019) twice in the future (2020–2059, 2060–2099) while applying a warming signal that is derived from groups of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 6 models.4 The warming scenarios are labeled as rcp45cooler, rcp45hotter, rcp85cooler, and rcp85hotter which represent a range of warming signals derived from climate models using the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 emissions scenarios.

Hydrology Model

For hydrologic modeling we use the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model7,8 (https://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/). VIC is a commonly used model for large scale distributed hydrologic modeling studies. Parameters are obtained from the VICGlobal9 dataset which contains vegetation and soil parameters on a 1/16th degree grid. We calibrate the parameters against the Global Reach-level River Flood Reanalysis data10 which is a global dataset of 1/20th degree runoff. Calibration is conducted for 1981–2000 at 1/16th degree resolution on a grid cell by grid cell basis. For automatic calibration we use the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm11 through the Optimization Software Toolkit for Research Involving Computational Heuristics (OSTRICH) framework12 (https://doi-bor.github.io/ostrich/). The DDS algorithm is designed to provide a reasonably optimal solution within a limited computational budget, here we used 100 iterations of the DDS algorithm as testing indicated that more iterations provided marginal improvement to the objective function value. For the objective function we used the Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metric of monthly observed runoff as it provides a good balance between low and high runoff conditions. The KGE metric is described further in the validation section. Table 1 shows the calibration parameters and the ranges which are selected based on previous hydrologic studies using the VIC model9,10,13,14.

Routing and Water Management Model

Routing is conducted at a 1/8th degree scale by the mosartwmpy model15 (https://mosartwmpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python implementation of the MOSART-WM model,16,17 which is part of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) (https://e3sm.org/). Routing alone produces gridded natural streamflow estimates but water management is required to develop estimates of regulated streamflow, storage, inflow, and outflow for hydropower projects, which mosartwmpy produces through the use of data driven reservoir operation rules18. Hydropower projects were mapped to the 1/8th degree grid as part of the 9505 federal assessment of hydropower19.

Hydropower Model

The final model in the chain takes the regulated streamflow values produced by mosartwmpy and generates weekly and monthly hydropower estimates, which we call B1hydro. At every hydropower plant, B1hydro models the power generation as a linear regression model with the form:

$$\begin{array}{l}{P}_{t}={\beta }_{P,1}{P}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{P,n}{P}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{O,0}{O}_{t}+{\beta }_{P,1}{O}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{O,n}{O}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{I,0}{I}_{t}+{\beta }_{I,1}{I}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{I,n}{I}_{t-n}+\\ \hspace{4.99878pt}\quad {\beta }_{S,0}{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{S,1}{S}_{t-1}+\ldots +{\beta }_{S,n}{S}_{t-n}+{\varepsilon }_{t}\end{array}$$

(1)

where Pt is the power at time t, O denotes the outflow, I denotes the inflow, S denotes the storage, which are outputs from the mosartwmpy model, βi,j are the regression parameters, and εt is the normally distributed error term. The lag parameter n is set to 12 and 52 for the monthly and weekly model respectively to account for annual hydrologic variability.

The data used to calibrate the regression parameters is the HydroWIRES B1 data20,21 (https://github.com/HydroWIRES-PNNL/B1-data), which contains weekly and monthly hydropower estimates that are disaggregated from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) annual data22. The data is available for 2001–2019 which is used as the calibration period to develop both the historical and future hydropower data at every available hydropower plant location. Of the 1492 plants in the HydroWIRES B1 data, 1452 are included in the GODEEEP-hydro dataset, with the 40 plants excluded due to records that were too short (less than 2 years) or containing all zero values (i.e. decommissioned). The entire historical period (1982–2019) is included in the final dataset to provide (1) validation with observations and other derived datasets, (2) an extension the historical record beyond what is available in the HydroWIRES B1 data, and (3) a consistent record of hydropower that is coincident with other datasets derived from the perturbed thermodynamics experiment data (e.g.23).

In addition to total generation over the weekly or monthly period, the B1hydro model provides minimum and maximum power generation of the period and the average daily operational range (ador), which are directly useful in power system models. These values are defined as:

$$\begin{array}{rcl}{P}_{max,t} & = & {P}_{t}+{a}_{max}({P}_{np}-{P}_{t})\\ {P}_{min,t} & = & {a}_{min}{P}_{t}\\ {P}_{ador,t} & = & {a}_{ador}\left({P}_{max,t}-{P}_{min,t}\right)\end{array}$$

(2)

where Pmax,t and Pmin,t are the max and min allowed power generation at time t, Pador,t is average daily operational range at time t, Pt is the average power generation at time t, Pnp is the nameplate capacity of the plant, and amax, amin, and aador are parameters with values between 0 and 1 which can be derived from hourly power generation data.

Hourly hydropower generation is usually proprietary and business sensitive and therefore not publicly available. The Army Corps of Engineers Northwestern Division, which includes the Columbia River Basin, is one exception where historical hourly generation data from most federally-operated hydropower facilities is published on the Dataquery platform (https://www.nwd-wc.usace.army.mil/dd/common/dataquery/www/). The B1hydro model uses this hourly generation data to estimate the min and max power and ador at every hydropower plant in this study by assuming that amax, amin, and aador are equal to the average parameter values from all the hydropower facilities on the Dataquery platform. This approximation allows for reasonable constraints to be developed for power system models given the scarcity of publicly available hourly hydropower data.

Future Simulations

The four future climate scenarios in the TGW data (rcp45cooler, rcp45hotter, rcp85cooler, and rcp85hotter) are used to develop future hydropower simulations from 2020–2099. The calibrated VIC model is used to produce future runoff simulations for each scenario, which are then run through mosartwmpy, and finally the calibrated B1hydro model is used to produce monthly and weekly hydropower generation estimates.

The data is available from Zenodo24 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13776944).

The data is split into 10 data files, weekly and monthly data for each future scenario and the historical period. Each file has the naming convention <scenario>_ <monthly/weekly>.csv where <scenario> can be either “historical”, “rcp45cooler”, “rcp45hotter”, “rcp85cooler”, or “rcp85hotter” and <monthly/weekly> refers to the timestep of the data. Each of the data files has the following columns:

datetime The datetime stamp of the current timestep

eia_id An integer value with the EIA plant code that represents the facility

plant The name of the facility according to the EIA

power_predicted_mwh The total energy generated over the period in MWh, aka the energy target

n_hours The number of hours in the period, useful for converting between power and energy

p_avg Average power generation for the period

p_max Maximum allowable power generation for the period

p_min Minimum allowable power generation for the period

ador Average daily operational range for any given day in the period

scenario The name of the scenario, either “historical”, “rcp45cooler’, “rcp45hotter”, “rcp85cooler”, or “rcp85hotter”

Also included is the metadata file godeeep_hydro_plants.csv which contains metadata for each hydropower plant that is included in the dataset. Each row in this file refers to one hydropower facility. This file has the following columns:

eia_id An integer value with the EIA plant code that represents the facility

plant The name of the facility according to the EIA

mode Either “Storage” or “RoR” indicating if the plant is primarily operated as a storage or run-of-river facility

state Two letter U.S. state name

lat Latitude of the facility

lon Longitude of the facility

nerc_region Four letter code for the NERC region of the facility

ba Balacing authority of the facility

max_param Value of the amax parameter from Equation (2) used to derive p_max

min_param Value of the amin parameter from Equation (2) used to derive p_min

ador_param Value of the aador parameter from Equation (2) used to derive ador

huc2 Two digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) which contains the facility

Hydrology model validation

The VIC hydrology model is calibrated at a monthly timestep for the period 1981–2000, and validated for 2001–2019, with the period 1979–1980 used as spin-up. We use the KGE metric to assess model performance25 on simulating runoff. KGE is a commonly used metric in hydrology where any value greater than −0.41 indicates performance better than the mean26. Figure 2 shows the calibration results for the study region. The calibration results are consistently above −0.41 and frequently much higher. The calibration results align well with previous CONUS-wide calibration efforts,27 with the best performance on the east and west coast and lower performance in the Midwest region east of the Rocky Mountains. The validation period has lower performance than the calibration period, which is to be expected, but overall the periods are similar which is encouraging.

Hydropower model validation

The first validation of the B1hydro model is designed to test the regression model using drop-one-year cross validation. In this procedure one year of data is dropped and the other years are used to predict the missing generation data. Using this approach on every year of data provides a complete record from which to assess the out-of-sample performance. Figure 3 shows a histogram of the KGE of all plant level hydropower models that are part of the B1hydro model. The performance is generally good, with only 2 out of 1,452 plants having performance less than −0.41.

Additionally, we validate the B1hydro model against observed hydropower data in the Columbia River Basin. Figure 4 shows boxplots of the difference in the annual generation between observed annual hydropower and the B1hydro model output. The greatest error of about 200 aMW is seen at Grand Coulee which has the highest hydropower generation of any plant in the region. In general, the error is proportional to the nameplate capacity of the hydropower plant and tends to bracket 0, indicating reasonable annual performance with no annual bias in the B1hydro model.

Validation against 9505 data

The 9505 assessment is the Department of Energy funded assessment of the relationship between climate and hydropower in the U.S. (https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/hydropower-climate-change-assessment). One outcome of the 9505 assessment is the development of a hydropower dataset that uses a selection of hydrologic models, hydropower models, forcing datasets.28 Here we compare with two hydrology models, Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)29 and VIC, two hydropower models, wmpy-power (WMP) and WRES28, and one forcing dataset, Livneh30. To facilitate an accurate comparison, we have only compared the hydropower plants that are simulated by both datasets.

Figure 5 shows the average total monthly generation for each HUC2 in the contiguous U.S. The hydropower estimates from GODEEEP-hydro are generally in line with the 9505 estimates lending confidence to the methodology presented here. Some notable differences occur in the Great Lakes and Ohio basins where GODEEEP-hydro is higher than the 9505 models. This may be due to differences in the representation of hydropower between the U.S. and Canada.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-025-05097-3/MediaObjects/41597_2025_5097_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-05-28 10:14:56.735495

Meanwhile, in its first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen congressionally appropriated funds for clean energy and energy-efficiency incentives.
What is clear, however, is that we need more investment in clean energy, not just for the environment but also for the economy, for our own financial well-being.
To replace what was lost, we need continued federal support for jobs of the future which include clean energy.
Supporting clean energy is supporting what’s good for us, whereas cutting clean energy would hurt our physical and financial well-being and our economy.","In the summer of 2009, I had solar panels installed at my house. Rooftop solar wasn’t as widespread then as it is now, but I took the leap, and I haven’t looked back. I was so happy with my little 2.7 kilowatt solar system that, the next year, I installed a solar-powered hot-water heater to complement it. None of this would have been possible without incentives supported by the federal government, our own commonwealth and Pennsylvania Power & Light (now PPL Electric Corporation). These incentives cut the cost of installation by more than 30%, making solar power more accessible.

But now, affordable clean energy like rooftop solar could go away, as Congress considers cutting cost-saving programs at the expense of everyday people’s pocketbooks. Meanwhile, in its first 100 days, the Trump administration has frozen congressionally appropriated funds for clean energy and energy-efficiency incentives.

Billions of dollars are on the line. If these federal incentives are cut, the pain would be felt across the country. Businesses, nonprofits, school districts and local governments would see their energy costs rise.

We don’t have to wait to see what would happen if these federal resources were cut. We’re getting a preview of the consequences already. Allentown hoped to leverage both state and federal energy-efficiency incentives to cut energy costs and save hundreds of thousands of local taxpayer dollars. The city had prepared a pilot program to save money by replacing aging city vehicles with electric vehicles. Just the eight vehicles in the pilot program would have saved over $19,000 per year in energy and maintenance costs. If this level of savings were applied to the city’s entire fleet of about 600 vehicles, it would add up to over $1 million of savings per year. For a city like Allentown, that’s a significant sum. But now, these programs cannot proceed because of the Trump administration’s federal funding freezes.

This scenario is playing out in cities across the country, and it will play out on an even wider scale if Congress reduces or eliminates more cost-saving federal incentives. Why anyone would want such an outcome remains unclear. If you’re concerned about government efficiency, why make it harder for local governments to save taxpayer dollars? If you’re concerned about lowering the overall cost of living, why cut funding for cost-saving clean-energy programs? Why would you propose these cuts in the midst of a growing global trade war that is already wrecking supply chains, raising prices and causing layoffs? There are no good answers to these questions.

What is clear, however, is that we need more investment in clean energy, not just for the environment but also for the economy, for our own financial well-being. This is something that I can personally speak to. My own solar array isn’t large at all but over 16 years, it has saved me more than $5,400.

Even if you put aside the environmental concerns, even if you care only about your own finances, you should care about these federal clean-energy incentives. You should want Congress to protect and expand these programs, not cut them. Even some members of Congress who are skeptical about climate change agree on this. In a letter to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, 21 Republican members of Congress wrote that getting rid of clean-energy investments “would increase utility bills the very next day.” That’s an outcome that everyone — not just environmentalists — should want to avoid.

Additionally, the job-creating benefits of these programs can’t be ignored. The growth in clean-energy jobs has been a critical part of industrial Pennsylvania’s comeback, and we should want it to continue. Cities with industrial roots, such as Allentown, need more family-sustaining jobs that don’t require a college degree, and we need leaders in Washington to support the incentives that create these jobs. But so far, all we’ve seen is talk, rhetorical nostalgia-pumping about how things were better for everyday workers in the distant past. Words will not revive our old industrial job base. To replace what was lost, we need continued federal support for jobs of the future which include clean energy. With that support, we can create the 21st-century economy that we deserve.

I don’t see this as much of a choice. Supporting clean energy is supporting what’s good for us, whereas cutting clean energy would hurt our physical and financial well-being and our economy. We don’t deserve that. Let’s hope Congress recognizes as much.

Recently, many in the clean energy industry have been bracing for change. Analysts and executives alike have predicted potential policy shifts that could affect renewable energy development.

However, I think history and market realities suggest otherwise. The clean energy industry has endured policy shifts for decades, emerging stronger due to fundamental economic advantages and evolving market dynamics.

Clean energy has become increasingly attractive in recent years for several key reasons. Here are some of the main drivers:

Energy Security

A lesson we’ve learned repeatedly is that energy security is national security. This has been clear since the 1970s energy crises.

The current administration has prioritized energy independence as a pillar of national security. While fossil fuels are often seen as the focus of this effort, renewables are becoming more important due to their role in reducing reliance on foreign energy sources. By diversifying the U.S. energy mix, renewables can help mitigate the risks associated with geopolitical supply disruptions. The ability to generate power domestically from natural resources makes renewables an important part of long-term energy security.

Market Competitiveness And Lower Energy Costs

Renewables are now among the cheapest sources of electricity, making them an attractive choice. The declining cost of solar panels, paired with improvements in efficiency and durability, ensures that market forces drive adoption.

Historically, the biggest argument against renewables was their intermittency. However, recent advancements in battery storage, AI and other breakthrough technologies have enabled the development of advanced hybrid power plants that address these concerns.

Businesses are also increasingly seeking long-term price stability, which renewables can provide more reliably than volatile fossil fuel markets.

Rapid Deployment To Support Grid Reliability And Reindustrialization

The current administration has announced that a major priority is maintaining America’s dominance in artificial intelligence. This could require expansion of the nation’s digital infrastructure as AI demands an enormous amount of affordable, reliable and readily available energy.

The U.S. power grid is already under strain due to rising energy demand from data centers, manufacturing and electrification. And the threat of rolling blackouts is becoming real. This is compounded by the fact that natural gas plants often take four to five years to build, and nuclear plants can take over a decade. Meanwhile, new utility-scale solar plants can often be deployed in 12 to 18 months.

Another solution for rapid, resilient, around-the-clock power is synthetic power systems that combine solar, natural gas and storage—which can power data centers and are usually deployable within two years. The ability to bring power online quickly and at scale is essential for meeting growing energy demand, making renewables a critical component of energy planning.

Job Creation And Rural Economic Revival

For decades, rural communities have borne the brunt of economic downturns and deindustrialization. Today, renewable energy projects are breathing new life into many of these areas—driving job creation and offering struggling communities a new hope.

Beyond jobs, renewables generate tax revenue and fund vital public services, such as K-12 education and professional training. Many farmers are leasing land for clean power projects, generating stable income streams that help sustain agricultural economies and keep land in the family for future generations.

Opportunities In The New Energy Economy

Despite potential policy shifts, numerous opportunities exist for entrepreneurs and businesses to capitalize on the growth of renewable energy, driven by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences and a growing corporate emphasis on sustainability.

Investment in clean power remains strong, and I think the demand for affordable and reliable power will likely increase, especially in regions seeing new manufacturing and data center development.

Companies can consider procuring renewable energy through power purchase agreements (PPAs), investing in on-site clean energy solutions such as solar installations and battery storage, and implementing smart grid technologies to improve energy management. These strategic actions can lower operating costs, reduce exposure to volatile energy prices and enhance long-term business resilience.

Addressing The Challenges

Despite the economic advantages, adopting clean energy isn’t without its challenges. While renewables offer speed-to-deployment advantages over fossil fuels, integrating intermittent sources like solar into a grid not originally designed for them requires significant investment in energy storage, hybrid systems and grid modernization. Additionally, permitting delays and supply chain constraints continue to slow project development.

The energy sector is also likely to face challenges like grid instability stemming from rapid load growth, potential supply chain disruptions and escalating cybersecurity risks.

To navigate these challenges, a best practice for businesses and energy providers is to adopt a diversified strategy. This can include investing in hybrid clean energy systems that combine solar, storage and gas to provide reliable 24/7 power, especially for mission-critical operations. Additionally, cultivating strong relationships with multiple suppliers and power producers can mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, ensuring continuity in operations.

Sustained collaboration with regulators and local governments is necessary to help streamline permitting processes and ensure grid upgrades keep pace with clean power deployment. In a changing energy economy, those who embrace smart, scalable and resilient clean energy strategies could be best positioned for long-term success.

Final Thoughts

Clean power is a mainstream economic force powered by price competitiveness, deployment speed and growing demand for reliable electricity. While fossil fuels will continue to play an important role in America’s energy mix, the rapid deployment of utility-scale clean power is essential for meeting the nation’s energy needs.

Business leaders who view renewable energy as an economic and strategic opportunity—not just an environmental cause—could find themselves positioned well for growth.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634ea7af33fdc6b62ab5c039/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-28 09:08:28.539405

Last week, the City of Cortez was one of seven recipients to learn that on May 16, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded the city a $500,000 Brownfields Grant to clean up three unused buildings at the Cortez Municipal Airport contaminated with asbestos, lead-based paint and petroleum.

Think brown vs. green fields and you get the picture of why the EPA in 1995 established this aptly named program to return brownfields to productive use in both urban and rural communities. The premise is that brownfields funding can help communities clean up impacted sites, reduce environmental and health risks, and bolster economic development and community revitalization efforts. In some areas, former landfills have been redeveloped into community parks, new housing and businesses have been launched.

Kudos to the City of Cortez for seeking and securing this funding. Whether or not future EPA grant funding opportunities will continue to exist is unclear. Since the Trump administration came into office, DOGE has been chainsawing its way through the federal government and much of what we’ve come to expect (and taken for granted) has been thrown into question.

Under Trump, the EPA, founded in 1970 by President Richard Nixon with a charge to protect the environment and human health, is facing up to 55% cuts to its budget. As Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said last week, in a heated exchange with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, “In your view and President Donald Trump’s view, more than half the efforts to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water is just a waste.”

Environmental protection has not always been partisan. The 1970 Clean Air Act and 1972 Clean Water Act were also signed into law by Nixon. The Journal’s editorial board wishes our politicians could and would return to those days, as what is good for the environment and human health is also good for communities and economies.

We’re fortunate that Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-CO), as it applies to adversely affected small businesses and communities, recognizes this fact. In February, with Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Hurd introduced the Gold King Mine Spill Compensation Act to make whole Four Corners communities affected by the 2015 Gold King Mine spill. There is every reason this bill should continue to advance and be approved for funding by Congress. If approved, this funding would come through the EPA.

The editorial board is concerned about the future of the agency, however, as it learns it is poised to cancel another 400 grants to the already 377 that have been canceled. Grants to communities, like Cortez, for things like detecting and preventing lead poisoning in children, flood mitigation, and disaster resilience projects are all at risk. As is our nation's public and environmental health.

There is no way the agency can continue to function with a 55% reduction in budget, a return to funding at 1980s levels, and continue to provide the same protections it has for the past fifty years. We urge Rep. Hurd to fulfill his duty to protect constituents and communities and support the future of the E.P.A.",https://www.the-journal.com/wp-content/themes/durango/images/default_article_image_jor.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:31.346123

Scientific rigor, transparency, Environmental Justice, and deliberation are fundamental to good government and can only be achieved through a robust NEPA process. As the current administration moves to gut the law, at the behest of extractive industries seeking to maximize profits, Congress and the US public must come to its defense.

A simple premise: productive harmony

Despite rhetoric from the oil, gas, and mining industries, NEPA is not complicated. The original statute stands for two basic propositions:

Before a federal agency funds or permits something with significant environmental impacts, it should consider alternatives, including no action at all; and

Before the agency makes the final decision, it should invite input from the people who will have to live with the consequences.

Section 101 of the statute states the aim of the law even more simply: “to create and maintain conditions under which [people] and nature can exist in productive harmony.”

And yet, the idea that potential impacts on people in surrounding communities should be considered before any significant federal action is taken was novel when NEPA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970. Much of US history is marked by unbridled resource extraction and rampant pollution from industrial development, with little or no consideration of the consequences to our air, land, and water.

And if the idea of environmental protection was new, the concepts of government transparency and public input were downright radical. NEPA stands for the proposition that even the most powerful federal agency should have to at least consider the views of average members of the US public before charging ahead.

After complying with NEPA’s requirements, however, that agency can still charge right ahead. The statute dictates a process, not an outcome, and the federal government can decide not to abide by the most environmentally conscious alternative.

As the Supreme Court explained in 1989, “NEPA merely prohibits uninformed–rather than unwise–agency action.”

The NEPA process is intended to take place concurrently with all other aspects of planning and implementation of a project. If project proponents go back to the drawing board a few times, or experience funding delays, or run afoul of the Clean Water Act or Endangered Species Act, that all takes place during the “NEPA process.”

This parallel structure has been manipulated by NEPA critics, who are eager to use anecdotal evidence to erroneously blame NEPA for project delays of years or even decades. Most experts agree that, given the various exemptions adopted over the years, size of the federal regulatory docket, and federal agency’s organized strategies to evade the statute, the allegations that NEPA stifles progress are overblown.

The state of play

Watching NEPA implementation recently has been like watching tennis. The Obama Administration sought to expand NEPA consideration of greenhouse gas emissions, among other changes, but then the first Trump Administration sought to truncate application of the law. The Biden Administration reversed the Trump guidance, but then Congress narrowed the statute somewhat in the 2023. The Biden Administration then worked to implement the changes, along with some improvements to the regulations. Central to efforts to update NEPA by the Obama and Biden Administrations was the seemingly obvious idea that a process designed to assess environmental impacts should account for pollution that would worsen climate change.

Most recently, under the guise of an “energy emergency,” the Trump Administration has sought to repeal existing NEPA regulations and guidance, leaving individual departments and agencies to develop their own requirements for complying with the statute. In March, UCS joined 250 organizations in a comment letter on this action. As the letter made clear, “NEPA’s foundational premise is that full governmental transparency must be coupled with robust public participation to ensure federal agencies fully inform the public, and that agencies, in turn, are fully informed by the public, of a proposed project’s social and environmental costs and benefits.”

Secretary Burgum announced in April that the Interior Department would cap the review period for certain energy leasing applications, including those for oil, gas, coal, and uranium, at less than one month. Apparently, the first project to be fast-tracked will be the reopening of a uranium mine in Utah closed in 1984. Agriculture Secretary Rollins has announced similar plans to truncate NEPA review for federal timber sales. Uranium mining and clear-cutting national forests are exactly the kinds of activities that may provide short-term windfalls to private companies, while leaving local communities with devastating long-term impacts. Projects like these require more deliberation, not less.

“Red tape” is a red herring

One good way to watch tennis is to keep your eye on the ball. “Cutting red tape” or “streamlining” usually means cutting corners and cutting the public out. Deliberation and public participation are central to the NEPA process and any change to the statue or its implementation designed to “speed things up” often come at the expense of these fundamental goals.

NEPA was considered progressive in 1970, but its authors could not have known just how visionary the law really was. There is no better planning tool for coordinating a federal response to the climate crisis, or redressing decades of environmental racism, than NEPA. The goal of productive harmony between people and nature still seems both worthy and remote, particularly as millions of people suffer through yet another climate-fueled Danger Season.

The Trump Administration plan to destroy NEPA is dangerously wrong. Federal agencies need better funding, staffing, and training to engage in NEPA work more effectively; new short-cuts, time-limits, exemptions, or statutes of limitations are not in the public interest.

All infrastructure and energy development in the US since 1970 has occurred pursuant to NEPA. The law is not a barrier to development; it is a shield against reckless and unjust federal action. The only entities who benefit from undermining NEPA are special interests who reap a short-term windfall when federal agencies leap before they look. The only reason to curtail NEPA would be to let those windfalls happen.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blog-Thumbnail-deforestation.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:34.241745

Curtis wants changes to green energy credit cuts in Trump tax bill - Deseret News,"Cami Mondeaux, www.deseret.com, cami-mondeaux",,,,,https://www.deseret.com/politics/2025/05/27/john-curtis-encourages-green-energy-production/,"Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, hinted at changes to the Republican-led tax package, particularly on provisions repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration.
Those provisions have divided Republicans as some have warned against repealing certain credits that boost energy production.
“It very clearly is a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just of clean energy, but of energy” in general, Curtis told the Deseret News at a press conference in Erda, Tooele County, with Fluence, a clean energy company.
While the House-passed budget framework “dramatically curtailed” many of those green energy tax credits, Curtis said there is a desire among some GOP lawmakers to preserve a handful of incentives in the final text.
The Senate will begin consideration next week on the Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s budget framework advancing policies on border, energy, national defense and tax reform.","Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, hinted at changes to the Republican-led tax package, particularly on provisions repealing clean energy tax credits that were passed under the Biden administration.

In the budget resolution passed last week, which seeks to advance President Donald Trump’s agenda on a slew of issues, Republicans approved language to repeal or phase out a number of green energy tax credits previously approved in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those provisions have divided Republicans as some have warned against repealing certain credits that boost energy production.

Curtis returned to Utah this week to expand on that message.

“It very clearly is a problem for the future, and I’ll say not just of clean energy, but of energy” in general, Curtis told the Deseret News at a press conference in Erda, Tooele County, with Fluence, a clean energy company.

While the House-passed budget framework “dramatically curtailed” many of those green energy tax credits, Curtis said there is a desire among some GOP lawmakers to preserve a handful of incentives in the final text.

“My friends in the House kind of called me up to say, ‘Listen, we’re counting on you to fix it,’” Curtis said. “So I think even many of them knew that what they sent over did need some work, and that’s now our job in the Senate to put our stamp on that and have it speak for our will.”

“And I think if I have anything to say about it,” he added, “I’ll make sure that we’re taking into account our energy future.”

The budget proposal, coined as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” would repeal many of the tax credits aimed toward incentivizing businesses to utilize clean energy to address the effects of climate change. That language was tucked into the larger framework by Republicans who lamented that the Inflation Reduction Act was drafted and passed solely by Democrats, demanding it be fully repealed to pave the way for their own party’s agenda.

However, some Republicans have cautioned against a full repeal of Biden’s signature climate bill, warning it could lead to “significant disruptions” and weaken the United States on the global stage.

A group of GOP senators, including Curtis, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., last month to consider “each existing tax credit” for its ability to spur domestic manufacturing, reduce utility costs, and ensure businesses receive “meaningful U.S. investments” based on the current tax structure.

By doing that, they argued, beneficial credits can be protected while cutting costly programs that don’t have substantial support.

Curtis said conversations are ongoing about how to address the clean energy credits, noting many of his GOP colleagues “don’t like it because we weren’t included in it (and) we didn’t get a chance to vote for it.”

But he argued the Inflation Reduction Act contains “a lot of Utah/Republican/conservative principles … that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on.”

Those decisions, he argued, are crucial to Trump’s desire to be energy dominant.

AFP travelled into the Halmahera jungle to see how the sprawling Weda Bay Nickel concession has affected the once-pristine tribal lands that the Hongana Manyawa call home.
With no land titles, the Hongana Manyawa have little chance of asserting their claims to stewardship of forest that overlaps with Weda Bay’s concession.
Indigenous rights NGO Survival International said that was Jakarta’s first acknowledgement of uncontacted, or “isolated”, Hongana Manyawa in the area.
Inside the jungle, a similar story is playing out, said Hongana Manyawa member Ngigoro, who emerged from the uncontacted as a child.","Sitting deep in east Indonesia’s lush jungle, Bokum, one of the country’s last isolated hunter-gatherers, has a simple message for the nickel miners threatening his home: “This is our land.”

He belongs to the Hongana Manyawa Indigenous tribe, which includes around 3,000 “contacted” members like him, and another 500 who reject contact with the modern world.

Their home on Halmahera Island was once a breathtaking kaleidoscope of nature that provided sanctuary and sustenance.

But it is being eaten away by the world’s largest nickel mine, as Indonesia exploits vast reserves of the metal used in everything from electric vehicles to stainless steel.

“I’m worried if they keep destroying the forest,” Bokum told AFP in a clearing in central Halmahera.

“We have no idea how to survive without our home and food.”

The plight of the Hongana Manyawa, or “People of the Forest”, started gaining attention in Indonesia last year after a video widely shared on Facebook showed emaciated, uncontacted members emerging from their rapidly changing forest home to beg for food.

But the remote region — about 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometres) from capital Jakarta — mostly remains far from the public consciousness.

AFP travelled into the Halmahera jungle to see how the sprawling Weda Bay Nickel concession has affected the once-pristine tribal lands that the Hongana Manyawa call home.

During a three-day, 36-kilometre (22-mile) trek across parts of the 45,000-hectare concession, the mining operation’s impacts were starkly clear.

Booms from controlled explosions to expose nickel shook birds from trees, while helicopters buzzing overhead shared the skies with green parrots, Moluccan owls, hornbills and giant bees.

Tree stumps provided evidence of logging, and off-duty mine guards were seen hunting tropical birds with air guns.

Throughout the night, the sound of excavators scratching the topsoil penetrated the thick vegetation, competing with frog calls and the drone of insects.

Mud that locals say is stirred up by mining has stained rivers copper, and the water leaves skin irritated.

In 22 river crossings, only a few fish were visible. Tribe members say they have mostly disappeared.

AFP did not seek to meet uncontacted Hongana Manyawa.

Bokum emerged from isolation earlier in his life, but still has very limited contact with the outside world.

He and his wife Nawate agreed to meet AFP around 45 minutes from his home deeper in the jungle.

But he could not stay long: en route, he spotted miners and wanted to return to ward them off.

“The company workers have been trying to map our territory,” he told AFP, wearing a black cowboy hat, shirt and rolled-up jeans.

“It’s our home and we will not give it to them.”

– ‘Prevent their annihilation’ –

Indonesia’s constitution enshrines Indigenous land rights, and a 2013 Constitutional Court ruling promised to give local communities greater control of their customary forests .

But environmental groups say the law is not well enforced.

With no land titles, the Hongana Manyawa have little chance of asserting their claims to stewardship of forest that overlaps with Weda Bay’s concession.

According to Weda Bay Nickel (WBN), its mine on Indonesia’s Maluku islands accounted for 17 percent of global nickel production in 2023, making it the largest in the world.

WBN is a joint venture of Indonesia’s Antam and Singapore-based Strand Minerals, with shares divided between French mining giant Eramet and Chinese steel major Tsingshan.

WBN told AFP it is “committed to responsible mining and protecting the environment”, and trains employees to “respect local customs and traditions”.

It said there is “no evidence that uncontacted or isolated groups are being impacted by WBN’s operations”.

Eramet told AFP it has requested permission from WBN’s majority shareholders for an independent review of “engagement protocols” with Hongana Manyawa, expected this year.

Further review of how the tribe uses the area’s forests and rivers is also underway, it added, though it said there was currently “no evidence” of members living in isolation in its concession.

The Indonesian government, which acknowledges most of the concession was previously protected forest, told AFP otherwise.

There is “recognition of evidence of the existence of isolated tribes around Weda Bay”, said the directorate general of coal and minerals at Indonesia’s energy ministry.

It said it was committed to “protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples and ensuring that mining activities do not damage their lives and environment”.

Indigenous rights NGO Survival International said that was Jakarta’s first acknowledgement of uncontacted, or “isolated”, Hongana Manyawa in the area.

It called the admission a “hammer blow” to Eramet’s claims and said a no-go area to protect the tribe was “the only way to prevent their annihilation”.

Both WBN and Eramet said they work to minimise impact on the environment. Eramet’s new CEO will be in Indonesia this week, seeking permission to expand the mine’s capacity.

Tsingshan and Antam did not respond to AFP requests for comment.

Bokum said mining has driven away the wild pigs, deer and fish he once caught for food. Now, he looks for shrimp and frogs in less-affected smaller streams.

“Since the company destroyed our home, our forest, we’ve been struggling to hunt, to find clean water,” he said in the Indigenous Tobelo language.

“If they keep destroying our forest we cannot drink clean water again.”

– ‘Go away’ –

Nickel is central to Indonesia’s growth strategy. It banned ore exports in 2020 to capture more of the value chain.

The country is both the world’s largest producer, and home to the biggest-known reserves.

Mining — dominated by coal and nickel — represented nearly nine percent of its GDP in the first quarter of 2025, government data shows.

Nickel mined in the Halmahera concession is processed at the Weda Bay Industrial Park.

Since operations began in 2019, the area has transformed rapidly, into what some call a “Wild West”.

At a checkpoint near the industrial park, men stopped AFP to demand cash and forced their vehicle to move elsewhere, before a local government official intervened.

The towns on the mine edge — Lelilef Sawai, Gemaf and Sagea — form a chaotic frontier.

Employees in hard hats crisscross muddy roads that back up with rush-hour traffic.

Shops catering to labourers line the roadside, along with prostitutes looking for business in front of bed bug-infested hostels.

The mining workforce has more than doubled since 2020 to nearly 30,000 people.

Locals say these are mostly outsiders whose arrival has sparked tensions and coincided with rising cases of respiratory illness and HIV/AIDS.

Smelter towers belch a manmade cloud visible from kilometres away.

“Mining companies have not implemented good practices, have violated human rights and there is rarely any evaluation,” said Adlun Fiqri, spokesman for the Save Sagea campaign group.

Inside the jungle, a similar story is playing out, said Hongana Manyawa member Ngigoro, who emerged from the uncontacted as a child.

“Long before the mining, it was really quiet and good to live in the forest,” said the 62-year-old, as he marked his route by slicing pock-marks into trees with his machete.

He remains at ease in the forest, using reeds for shade and bamboo shoots to boil water.

“There was no destruction. They were not afraid of anything,” he said.

He climbed nimbly down a steep slope by clinging to tree roots before crossing a riverbed peppered with garnierite — green nickel ore.

“This land belongs to the Hongana Manyawa,” he said.

“They existed living in the rainforest before even the state existed. So go away.”

That sentiment echoes elsewhere on Halmahera.

At least 11 Indigenous people were recently arrested for protesting mining activity in the island’s east, Amnesty International said Monday.

– ‘We will not give our consent’ –

Despite their “contacted” status, Bokum and Nawate have rarely met outsiders.

They approached haltingly, with Nawate refusing to speak at all, instead surveying her visitors with a cautious smile.

Bokum described moving at least six times to outrun encroaching miners.

NGOs fear the mine operation risks wiping out the tribe.

“They rely entirely on what nature provides for them to survive and as their rainforest is being devastated so too are they,” said Callum Russell, Asia research and advocacy officer at Survival International.

“Any contact with workers in the forest runs the risk of exposing them to deadly diseases to which they have little to no immunity.”

The government told AFP it has “conducted documentation” to understand isolated tribes near Weda Bay, and involved them “in the decision-making process”.

Activists say this is impossible given most of the group do not use modern technology and limit contact with outsiders.

Amid growing scrutiny, there have been rumblings of support for the tribe, including from some senior politicians.

Tesla, which has signed deals to invest in Indonesian nickel, has mooted no-go zones to protect Indigenous peoples.

And Swedish EV company Polestar last year said it would seek to avoid compromising “uncontacted tribes” in its supply chain.

For Bokum however, the problem is already on his doorstep.

A 2.5-kilometre-long (1.5 miles) open pit lies just over the hill from a plot where he grows pineapple and cassava.

Bokum and Nawate received mobile phones from mine workers — in an unsuccessful attempt to convince them to approve mining operations.

They and other tribe members use numerical codes to identify contacts and make calls.

They must approach the concession to pick up signal, but when mine workers near his home, Bokum wields his machete to scare them off.

“This is our land. Our home,” he said.

“We will not give our consent to destroy it.”

By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says.
Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change.
Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world.
For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","The fastest-growing car brand in the U.K. is BYD, the Chinese automaker behind electric cars like the new £16,000 ($21,600) Surf. Last month, the brand outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time.

BYD is also the fastest-growing car brand in Brazil, where EV sales jumped up 85% last year. In the capital city of Brasilia, BYD now outsells all other cars, whether they’re gas or electric. In Nepal, where seven out of every 10 cars imported last year was an EV, BYD’s electric models vie with those from Tata, an Indian brand. In Thailand, another Chinese company called Changan is quickly gaining market share with its electric cars.

The world is going electric: The International Energy Agency recently projected that one in four cars sold this year will be an EV. But the U.S. is lagging behind, and the Trump administration’s assault on EVs will slow down the industry more. That doesn’t bode well for the future of American automakers.

“Probably the most dire scenario is that the U.S. becomes somewhat isolated in an idiosyncratic market, with lots of big pickups and SUVs that don’t sell in any other market, and that are still predominantly fossil fuel,” says John Paul MacDuffie, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “And we’re not exposed to competition from some of the new manufacturers or some of the new technologies—not only electric but autonomous and connected.”

China already had a long head start

Even before Trump—who has said that Biden’s support for EVs was a “Marxist hoax”—American car companies were behind their Chinese counterparts on the path to electrification. One factor was China’s continuous support, which started more than 15 years ago. “There were changes to the policy and subsidies, but generally it [was clear] that the government thinks this is good technology,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a bipartisan think tank. “So if you’re going to buy an electric vehicle, it’s not like in two years things are going to change dramatically.”

Before China started pouring billions into the sector and made EV competitiveness a national priority, BYD was already innovative and lobbying for government support. The company, which had been founded in 1995 as a battery manufacturer, was “entrepreneurial and ready to take up the challenge,” Mazzocco says.

Electric cars also got early support in the U.S.—Tesla got a $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy in 2009, benefitted from EV tax credits for consumers, and got a major boost from California’s zero-emission vehicle credits. But China’s support went farther and faster. Around 60% of new car models sold in China are now electric, five times more than what’s available in the U.S., according to the IEA.

From the beginning, Chinese automakers were laser-focused on the cost of EVs. By 2023, around 60% of electric cars in China were cheaper than their gas equivalents without subsidies, the IEA says. In many cases, the technology is more advanced than EV tech from some Western automakers, as Chinese companies race to improve batteries and software.

Chinese companies are 30% faster than legacy automakers at developing new EV models, according to one analysis. Ford CEO Jim Farley admitted last year that he’d been driving an electric car from Xiaomi—a Chinese smartphone manufacturer that started making EVs—and said he “doesn’t want to give it up.”

“There’s no doubt” the future is electric

Still, American automakers know that their future is electric. “There’s no doubt about it,” says Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, the former chief economist at Ford. Companies have already spent billions on the transition. But right now, the legacy automakers face cost challenges. Engineering new batteries and new vehicles obviously has a steep capital cost, versus the depreciated capital costs for continuing to make internal combustion engine cars. And although EV sales grew faster last year than gas car sales, they aren’t growing as quickly as automakers hoped.

“I’ve done the math,” Hughes-Cromwick says. “It’s not great right now for our domestic manufacturers, because they’ve got low volume but high fixed costs on the new technology, and low capital costs and high volume on the old tech.”

As more EVs sell, companies can get to cost and pricing parity. Policies could help make the transition easier, she says, such as keeping tax credits in place for EVs. Instead, the federal government is pushing hard in the other direction.

Trump froze billions in spending on EV charging infrastructure, and blocked subsidies for factories making batteries, despite the fact that those factories were creating American jobs. Congress is trying to get rid of the consumer tax credit and add a new annual fee for EV owners (though the fee is meant to replace the gas tax, the total cost would be higher than drivers with gas cars currently spend on it). Congress is also trying to block California’s plans to transition to zero-emissions vehicles. Tariffs have added to the economic pressure.

Despite all of this, the long-term strategy for U.S. automakers isn’t likely to change. “The time horizon for product cycles, facility planning, and supply chain planning is very long,” says MacDuffie. “They’re global companies, so they’re not just planning for the U.S. market. I have been predicting that U.S. companies will continues to pursue a long-term strategy which is premised on electrification hitting most markets and most products. I think it would take years of a hostile economic and policy environment for them to back away from that in a big way.”

It’s too early to count out American automakers, Hughes-Cromwick says, noting that they could pull forward on software, for example. But as Trump pushes for anti-EV policy, companies are slowing some electric investments, and are likely to keep falling behind as Chinese companies race forward. A year ago, the IEA predicted that EVs would hit 50% of car sales in the U.S. by 2030; the agency has now revised that to 20%.

With steep tariffs keeping cheap Chinese EVs out of the U.S., there’s less incentive for American automakers to innovate as quickly on electric vehicles. The current tax bill also reduces support for EV battery makers and slashes funding for research and development of new battery tech through the Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, Chinese EVs are spreading around the rest of the world. Last year, BYD surpassed Tesla in global vehicle sales. BYD’s stock price has climbed around 59% on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since the beginning of 2025, while Tesla’s has declined around 11% on the Nasdaq, despite some recovery in recent weeks. In Brazil, BYD is now rebuilding a former Ford factory, on a street that a local politician wants to rename from Henry Ford Avenue to BYD Avenue.

“Once consumers have access to these vehicles, they’re really interested,” says Mazzocco. For a growing middle class in emerging countries, “their first car might be a Chinese electric vehicle.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/05/p-1-91341030-us-lagging-on-evs.jpg",N,,2025-05-28 07:04:05.959566

This time of year reminds us that while one season ends, another begins. Although the 2025 Regular Session concluded in March, back in Frankfort, the work on behalf of Kentuckians does not pause. The way the legislature proceeds will look quite different.

Since adjourning the session, it has been a particularly busy time in the district—from graduations, to agriculture events, to groundbreakings, from finalizing long-awaited projects to celebrating new investments in our district. Several notable events occurred across the district over the past month, including two exciting ribbon cuttings, spotlighting the value of local partnerships and public investment in our schools.

At Cannonsburg Elementary, students, educators, families, and local leaders gathered to celebrate the reopening of the school following a two-year, $11.8 million renovation. With expanded classrooms, a new cafeteria and library, upgraded safety infrastructure, and long-overdue facility improvements, this project marks a significant step forward for education in the region. The majority of the funding—over $7 million—was awarded through state investment, reinforcing the importance of our shared commitment to public education. When students took the stage to thank us, it was a powerful reminder of why this work matters.

That same day, I joined community leaders at Boyd County High School for the ribbon cutting of the new Career and Technical Center, which is another critical investment in our region’s future. This facility will offer students hands-on training and career preparation in a range of fields, equipping them with the tools they need to pursue opportunities right here at home. I was proud to support this project alongside Boyd County Schools and local government partners. Together, these efforts reflect our determination to invest in infrastructure that uplifts students, strengthens families, and builds the foundation for long-term economic growth throughout the district.

Looking toward June, legislators will soon return to Frankfort as we enter what is known as the Interim Joint Session. This phase of the legislative calendar is not a break from duty. It is a period of deeper focus before the next session commences. This is when lawmakers review past legislation, examine pressing issues, and study the policy decisions that shape everyday life across the Commonwealth.

For me, this interim is a time to listen, ask better questions, and prepare. With a 60-day budget session on the horizon in 2026, the work we do over the next several months will influence how we invest in education, health care, public safety, and rural economic opportunity. This is where the foundation is built. I plan to take an active role in that process.

During the regular session, the General Assembly debates and votes on bills. The pace is fast and decisions move quickly. The interim slows that pace down. It gives us time to look closely at the effects of laws already passed and to gather information about the challenges ahead.

Interim committees meet jointly with members of both the House and Senate. They hear from experts, review data, and consider testimony from Kentuckians affected by state policy. This is when ideas are refined. This is when better policy begins to take shape.

I serve on five Interim Joint Committees. These are not ceremonial roles. Each committee meets regularly to consider real issues that affect families, workers, and communities across the Commonwealth. Below is a summary of the work ahead.

Interim Joint Committee on Agriculture

In our part of the state, agriculture is more than a job. It is a way of life. This committee focuses on farm safety, conservation programs, food systems, and rural economic development. We also review policies involving crop insurance, disease control, and livestock health. I will be watching closely how recent changes in funding affect access to grants and loans that support small and family-owned farms. This includes attention to the administration of the Tobacco Master Settlement funds and the role of the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy. Rural prosperity begins with smart investment in agriculture, and I will continue to advocate for that.

Interim Joint Committee on Appropriations and Revenue

This committee reviews how Kentucky raises and spends public dollars. We examine budget forecasts, tax structures, and state investments in infrastructure, education, and health services. Every policy depends on how the budget is constructed. This interim will be critical in shaping the next biennial budget. I will continue pushing for equitable funding across regions and fairness in state resource distribution. The needs of rural communities deserve full consideration.

Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary

The justice system involves real people and serious decisions. This subcommittee reviews funding for the courts, public defenders, corrections, and law enforcement. I will focus on access to justice in rural areas. That includes ensuring our courthouses are funded, our victims are supported, and our mental health services for justice-involved individuals are not overlooked. Budgeting for justice requires more than numbers. It requires a commitment to fairness and dignity.

Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children

This committee focuses on services that help Kentuckians meet their basic needs. That includes support for children and adults in crisis, nutrition programs, foster care, and child protection. These services are essential in rural areas where access can be limited by geography, staffing shortages, or weak infrastructure. I will work to ensure federal dollars are used effectively and that state policies meet the real-world needs of families in my district.

Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy

Kentucky’s future depends on responsible management of our natural resources. This committee reviews issues tied to water systems, utilities, environmental protections, and energy development. I continue to support a balanced approach. We must protect our land and water while also recognizing the role of energy and natural resource jobs. Flood mitigation and water infrastructure investment will be key issues in this interim. I will be a strong voice for smarter, forward-looking policy in these areas.

In addition to interim joint committees, I serve on several statutory committees established under Kentucky law or authorized as permanent subcommittees of the Legislative Research Commission. These committees meet regularly to review complex financial, infrastructure, and agricultural matters. Their proceedings are open to the public and the press.

Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee

This committee is tasked with reviewing how state dollars are spent on capital construction and public infrastructure. That includes oversight of emergency repair accounts, the leasing or purchase of state-owned properties, and bond issuances for both state government and local school districts. I will continue to monitor how capital investments are allocated and whether they are serving the long-term needs of our communities.

2026–2028 Budget Preparation and Submission Committee

As Kentucky prepares for the biennial budget, this committee plays an important role in setting the framework for how agencies draft and submit their spending plans. The committee provides guidance on budget instructions, formats, and requirements, ensuring consistency and accountability across government. This work will help shape the foundation of the 2026 budget session, and I intend to approach it with the seriousness it deserves.

Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee

This committee reviews the use of Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds, with a focus on agricultural development, public health, and early childhood investments. We evaluate grants and loans issued by the Agricultural Development Board and examine how those resources are being used to diversify farm income, support rural communities, and advance long-term planning for Kentucky agriculture. I remain committed to preserving the original intent of these funds and ensuring they reach the people and programs they were designed to help.

The legislative process works best when people are involved. Interim Joint Committee meetings are open to the public. They are also streamed online and archived for review. Anyone can watch, read, or participate.

Over the next few months, these issues will be a focus, and listening to constituents to hear what is working and what is not, is vital to how we move forward on them. That feedback shapes how I serve. Being a public servant means showing up, following through, and carrying local voices into every conversation in Frankfort. Whether we are talking about roads, rivers, classrooms, or courtrooms, the goal is good policies that serve the people where they live.

The interim session may not make the headlines, but it is where thoughtful work begins. I look forward to continuing that work with care and with the same commitment I brought to the regular session.

The Mountain and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub, or MAP EJ Grants Hub, planned to distribute $40 million funding throughout EPA Region 8.","A climate resilience center in southwest Denver. A tree-planting project along Interstate 70. A constellation of urban gardens.

Those are just some of the Colorado projects on life support after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated federal grants to support environmental justice programs.

Since President Trump returned to office, his administration has targeted federal support for initiatives seeking to address the disproportionate impact of toxic pollution and climate change in less-white and less-affluent communities. Multiple studies have linked concentrated environmental impacts to poor health outcomes.

The approach marks a swift reversal from the Biden administration, which made rectifying environmental inequality a core piece of its climate strategy. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for example, earmarked nearly $3 billion to support environmental justice projects and established an environmental justice office within the EPA to distribute the funding.

Those federal grants began arriving in Colorado in late 2024. KC Becker, who oversaw the Mountain West region as the former EPA Region 8 administrator, said her team recognized political support for environmental justice would likely evaporate under a future Trump administration.

“We knew the grants were at risk, and we worked to finalize as much as we could,” Becker said.

Turns out Becker was right to worry. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has called environmental justice “an excuse to fund left-wing activists” rather than fix actual environmental issues. Besides putting all employees within its environmental justice office on leave, the EPA is now seeking to cancel 781 grants meant to bolster clean energy and environmental projects, according to an April court filing. Almost all of the impacted grant programs focus on environmental justice.

It’s unclear how many of those grants would fund projects in Colorado or the Mountain West. A separate list released by several Democratic senators in March identified 13 Colorado-based environmental justice grants targeted for termination, which would have sent nearly $25 million to communities, nonprofits and tribal nations.

Cyrus Western, the new EPA Region 8 administrator, said in a written statement that the agency has vetted grants to determine if they’re an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and align with Trump administration priorities. “Grants that do not support the Administration’s agenda have been terminated,” Western said.

Here are some examples of community and nonprofit projects grappling with uncertainty due to grant terminations or federal funding freezes. A spokesperson with EPA Region 8 confirmed it has terminated funding for each project listed below.

A new climate resilience center in southwest Denver

Organization: Commún

Total grant: $20,000,000

A week before President Trump’s second inauguration, Commún, a Denver-based nonprofit, received a $20,000,000 EPA grant to establish a resilience and community center in southwest Denver.

The center would usually serve as a gathering space in the heart of the Loeretto Heights campus, a former Catholic boarding school, developers are now reshaping into a neighborhood and culture hub. The project would transform Machebeuf Hall, a former cafeteria and student union built in the 1950s, into a multipurpose facility with a grocery store, food stalls, a mental health center and a laundry facility.

It was also meant to serve as a disaster refuge in moments of crisis. In the event of a grid failure, for example, backup batteries and solar panels would help keep the center’s lights on. Air filtration would also help protect occupants from wildfire smoke or other air pollution threats.

Margaret Brugger, the executive director of Commún, said the grant would have allowed her group to start construction in March. It put those plans on hold after the EPA froze the grant shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, and the group received a termination letter ending the grant funding in mid-May. The nonprofit is now working to appeal the decision and exploring ways to move forward with pieces of the estimated $30 million project.

“Obviously, it’s disappointing, but I will always keep hope,” Brugger said.

Trees and shrubs along Interstate 70 in Globeville

Organization: National Wildlife Federation and the Green Dot Coalition

Total grant: $500,000

In 2023, the National Wildlife Federation won a $500,000 EPA environmental justice grant to plant trees and vegetation along Interstate 70 in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood, an area with well-documented air pollution issues compounded by traffic and major factories.

The nonprofit applied for the grant in partnership with Green Dot Coalition, a far smaller organization working to establish green spaces in historically disadvantaged urban communities. The project aims to improve barren concrete planters lining 10 blocks on either side of the highway.

On a recent visit, Jevon Taylor, the executive director of Green Dot Coalition, said almost all vegetation died more than a decade ago due to neglect and a faulty irrigation system. The only exception is a single tree clinging to the edge of one planter, which he said local residents don’t want cut down.

“It represents the neighborhood. It represents Globeville and Elyria and how resilient they are,” Taylor said.

The National Wildlife Federation said the EPA terminated its grant at the end of March. Before then, Taylor said his group managed to spend $175,000 to pay an irrigation contractor and secure supplies. As a result, it will proceed with plans to paint a mural and plant containers on one side of the highway this summer. He’s not sure if or when the group can proceed with plans to improve the north side of the highway.

Fruit trees and vegetable gardens in west Denver

Organization: Denver Urban Gardens

Total grant: $500,000

Denver Urban Gardens received a $500,000 EPA grant in November 2023. It also received an additional $350,000 through a United States Department of Agriculture project to support urban agriculture projects and innovation around the same time.

Linda Appel Lipsius, the nonprofit’s executive director, said the funding would have helped her group install six new community gardens and nine “food forests” in west Denver. She said those projects would have supported issues identified by a recent city planning initiative, which found the area lacks grocery stores and green infrastructure to guard against rising urban temperatures.

Lipsisus said since President Trump took office, the federal government has terminated access to both awards. Denver Urban Gardens is now only moving forward with two gardens and up to four or five food forests.

“It’s just heartbreaking,” Appel Lipsius said. “It just seems like this is such simple, straightforward, foundational, apolitical work, and that this is getting caught up in all this just feels confusing and misguided.""

A major hub for future grants

Organization: Mountains and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub

Total grant: $48 million

Beside cutting off access to previously awarded grants, the EPA has also ended funding for another program designed to help rural governments and small organizations access federal resources.

In February, the Trump administration terminated $177 million in federal funding for technical assistance centers to help rural communities and tribal nations apply for federal funding. The cut ended a $10 million center at Montana State University to assist rural communities and tribal nations in the Mountain West.

Then, in early May, the EPA also terminated its companion initiative: the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, a $600 million initiative to hand out small grants worth up to $350,000 through 11 regional hubs around the country. The Mountain and Plains Environmental Justice Grants Hub, or MAP EJ Grants Hub, planned to distribute $40 million funding throughout EPA Region 8.

The Biden administration selected JSI Research and Training Institute, a Denver-based public health and education nonprofit, to operate the MAP EJ Grants Hub.

Alexandra Witonsky joined as a grant manager for the new program in August 2024. In an interview with CPR News, she said the initiative had committed about $20 million to fund 96 projects before the Trump administration terminated its funding in early May. She also lost her position with JSI following the funding cuts.

Michelle Gabrieloff-Parish leads FLOWS, a Boulder-based climate justice group that earned $250,000 from the MAP EJ Grants Hub, but the funding wasn’t finalized before the Trump administration terminated the program.

Gabrieloff-Parish said the grant would have supported projects to replace turf with native plants at affordable housing projects and help a mobile home community fight for clean drinking water. If the Biden administration was serious about environmental justice, she said it should have distributed the funding faster.

“These funds were always meant to support frontline communities. We were just last in line, we got them last, and they got cut,” Gabrieloff-Parish said.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky?
Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars.
The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency.","A sudden blackout across Spain and Portugal earlier this month left 50 million people without electricity. While the cause of the outage is unclear, a leading culprit appears to be poorly integrated wind and solar resources. What’s clear is that, in an increasingly digital age, ensuring affordable and reliable power is more critical than ever.

The Spain-Portugal blackout came as U.S. power regulation authorities sounded an alarm about the safety of America’s electric grid and power supply. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) — the nation’s grid reliability regulator — warned that parts of America’s power grid could fail during a heatwave this summer.

Why is America’s power grid looking so shaky? And could Spain’s massive blackout happen here?

Each summer, U.S. electricity demand soars. And when Americans crank up their air conditioners amid scorching summer heat, regional utilities must meet that hefty additional demand.

The problem is that there might not be enough electricity to go around.

The United States is suddenly using a lot more electricity than before. Electric vehicles, new manufacturing plants, and an exponentially growing array of data centers — which support the digital needs of cell phones, web browsers and AI systems — are gobbling up power. Power demand is growing so fast that, in the past year, NERC found America’s peak electricity needs grew by a staggering 10 gigawatts. That’s more than double the growth seen between 2023 and 2024.

Surging demand is also colliding with the remnants of a regulatory agenda that aimed to wipe out America’s coal power plant fleet and make it impossible to build coal and natural gas power plants. While the Trump administration has worked to undo this misguided regulatory blitz, grid operators have lost essential dispatchable power plants that work on demand. They’re now increasingly reliant on renewable power systems subject to the weather’s whims.

Because of this, NERC says that grid operators “face challenges in meeting higher demand this summer with a resource mix that, in general, has less flexibility and more variability.”

The greatest threat to grids nationwide will be heat waves when demand spikes. Windless, scorching summer days — and evenings when solar power disappears — could leave grids alarmingly short of supply.

The nation’s energy regulators recognize there’s a power supply emergency. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie has observed that America is now “losing dispatchable generation at a pace that is not sustainable, and we are not adding sufficient equivalent generation capacity.”

A power supply operating on the margins is a recipe for disaster. The Iberian blackout was a timely reminder of the risks we face. It’s time to heed the warnings of our grid operators and reliability regulators and rebuild solid, long-term electricity generation while there’s still time.

Evan Halper and Maxine Joselow report for The Washington Post.

In short:

The proposed tax bill would eliminate $522 billion in clean energy subsidies established under the Inflation Reduction Act, jeopardizing projects in states like North Carolina and Texas that have seen massive investments.

Republican senators are facing pressure as these subsidies have created thousands of jobs and attracted major infrastructure investments in their home states.

Analysts warn that repealing the incentives would not only damage local economies but also raise household electricity bills and weaken U.S. competitiveness in global energy and AI markets.

Key quote:

“If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

— Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association

Why this matters:

The fight over clean energy subsidies is about more than politics. These incentives have transformed America’s energy landscape, pumping money and jobs into regions once dominated by fossil fuels. In places like North Carolina, billions in private investment have flowed toward building battery factories and solar infrastructure, offering stable employment and diversifying local economies. But with the proposed rollback of these programs, many of these projects face collapse, and the U.S. risks falling behind in the global race for clean energy dominance. Fossil fuel development alone won’t meet the rising demand for electricity driven by AI, electrified transportation, and data infrastructure. Experts warn that eliminating subsidies could stymie innovation, raise utility costs, and leave the power grid more vulnerable to disruption. For many small business owners, the uncertainty could derail growth plans and trigger layoffs, raising concerns about long-term economic resilience and environmental stability.

Any 30 senators can force a CRA resolution onto the floor, with a required ten hours of debate time.
This means that Democrats can tie up the Senate floor for upwards of ten hours with any single CRA resolution.
Importantly, Senate Democrats already know this.
And given the high stakes of the budget bill—soaring inequality as benefits for the poor are slashed to finance tax cuts for the rich—every tool at Senate Democrats’ disposal should be employed.","It’s refreshing in a way that we no longer have to spend much time thinking about the Senate parliamentarian, the shadowy figure whose rulings supposedly decide what the chamber can and cannot do. Republicans put that to bed last week by overruling the parliamentarian over whether a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution could nullify the Environmental Protection Agency’s waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards on vehicles.

California was given authority in a carve-out to the Clean Air Act in 1970 to set higher emissions standards than the national rules, with the EPA subsequently granting waivers more than 100 times. The state was prepared to use its latest waiver to effectively ban gas-powered auto sales by 2035. But the Senate voted 51-to-44 last week to cancel that waiver, as well as two other waivers to tighten emission rules on diesel trucks and allow zero-emission trucks on the road. The House had already voted for the resolution, so it can now be signed by President Trump.

Only executive branch agency rules can be overturned by a CRA resolution, and only within 60 legislative days after being presented to Congress, in an up-or-down vote that avoids the Senate filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian, joining the auditors at the Government Accountability Office, said that the EPA waivers were not “rules” as defined by the CRA, and therefore couldn’t be put into a resolution. Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), in a communication he sent last Congress about these very EPA waivers, agreed that the “federal preemption waivers cannot be reviewed under the Congressional Review Act.”

Yet Senate Republicans said, “Tough, we’re doing it anyway.” And Lee voted with them.

More from David Dayen

California has already announced that it will sue to maintain its waiver, charging that the Senate had no authority to overturn it. But the Senate operates largely on precedent, and now that the parliamentarian has been disregarded on this point, virtually any action the executive branch takes could be construed as a rule, and therefore subject to fast-track congressional review.

For this reason, Democrats could subject the Senate to time-consuming resolution votes repeatedly, to such a degree that the Senate would not have time to do anything else for the rest of this session of Congress. In other words, Democrats could respond to the waiver vote by paralyzing the Senate, and stopping the giant Trump tax bill from ever reaching the floor.

Georgia State University assistant professor and former House Oversight Committee staffer Todd Phillips laid this out in a Prospect piece earlier this month. Any 30 senators can force a CRA resolution onto the floor, with a required ten hours of debate time. These resolutions would need the president’s signature, and nearly all of them wouldn’t even get the Republican votes necessary to pass the Senate. But according to Senate procedure, they have to be dealt with if enough senators force them onto the floor. They must be debated and voted upon ahead of other Senate business if brought up for consideration. This means that Democrats can tie up the Senate floor for upwards of ten hours with any single CRA resolution.

Democrats could go back in time to invalidate prior agency actions.

The deregulatory Trump administration isn’t writing a whole lot of rules, limiting the raw material for these kinds of votes. But the Republican vote on EPA waivers just widely expanded the options for a CRA resolution. If the Department of Health and Human Services grants a state waiver for changes to its Medicaid program, or if the U.S. Department of Agriculture does the same for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Democrats could write resolutions to overturn such waivers. If the Federal Communications Commission issues a broadcast license, or the Justice Department approves a merger, or if the Securities and Exchange Commission decides to defer a prosecution in an investor protection case, Senate Democrats could challenge it. If the Department of Defense inks a contract for a new weapons system or any other item for procurement, they could challenge that, too. Any decision to redirect funds, change the terms of grants, or make practically any decision at all could, under the theory just enshrined into the Senate rulebook by Republicans, lead to a CRA resolution and ten hours of debate.

Democrats could also go back in time to invalidate prior agency actions. The structure of the CRA is that the 60-legislative-day clock for disapproving of a rule starts only when it is submitted to Congress. Waivers haven’t typically been submitted under CRA procedures, because they weren’t considered rules. (This is why the EPA waivers were available for a vote, despite the 60-day legislative clock expiring on May 8.) So there are all kinds of other waivers and agency decisions that never got sent to Congress, and therefore could be put up for a CRA resolution.

The bottom line is this: If you found something like 1,000 current or former agency actions—a reasonable number considering all the work executive branch agencies do—you would probably have enough to keep the Senate debating and voting on CRA resolutions through the duration of this Congress.

That means the Senate would never have the ability to take up executive branch or judicial nominations, or legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that recently passed the House. Senate Democrats could put the chamber into permanent gridlock, and thereby save 14 million people from losing their Medicaid coverage, save millions more from loss of SNAP benefits, while also forcing the 2017 Trump tax cuts to expire. That’s the level of hardball that can be played here.

You don’t even have to introduce 1,000 CRA resolutions. Just a handful deployed at strategic moments would get the point across. And the prospect of more could be used by Democrats as leverage to get legislative changes or prevent other legislative harms, particularly in the budget mega-bill.

Importantly, Senate Democrats already know this. In a letter sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) before the EPA waiver vote, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and several others made this very point: “If the current Senate Majority were to open this door, the CRA could be weaponized to retroactively invalidate decades of agency actions, and effectively hijack the Senate floor.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) underscored this after the Senate vote, saying that when Democrats regain control of the Senate, “every agency action that Democrats don’t like—whether it’s a rule or not—will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.” But he’s wrong that Democrats have to wait. As they need the support of only 30 senators, they can force these votes from the minority.

In those ten-hour debates such actions would force, Senate Republicans should be put on the record on whether they agree with Trump’s restructuring of the federal government. If Robert F. Kennedy Jr. decides to change the vaccination schedules recommended for children, Senate Republicans should have to go on the record about whether they agree. Republicans have escaped accountability for these kinds of harmful activities, and by forcing the Senate to weigh such actions, Democrats wouldn’t have to continue to let them off the hook.

I asked Phillips on Monday whether he had gotten any feedback from Democrats in Washington about his idea. He hadn’t. But we know they’re aware of it; they have said it out loud. They could start the campaign any day now.

The sanctity of Senate procedure doesn’t mean much to me. Using a majority vote for killing the EPA waivers certainly erodes the minority veto that is the filibuster. But I’m fine with a Senate majority having more power than the parliamentarian; that’s far more accountable than our current, disjointed reality, and ultimately will be good for Democrats when they return to full control of the government.

The likely outcome of weaponizing the Republican decision and twisting Senate procedure to make the chamber nonfunctional is that it would compel some détente to step away from mutually assured destruction. That would be a better situation than the “filibuster everything” mentality we have today.

And given the high stakes of the budget bill—soaring inequality as benefits for the poor are slashed to finance tax cuts for the rich—every tool at Senate Democrats’ disposal should be employed.

Pacific Energy’s focus on hybridised solar PV assets

The organisation has utilised hybridised renewable energy generation assets, specifically solar-plus-storage, in the country. Indeed, the group recently completed a 61MW project in Western Australia to power a gold mining operation.

Last year, Pacific Energy penned a deal with mining company Gold Fields to deliver a 35MW solar PV power plant at the St Ives mine site, located around 80km south of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia’s Eastern Goldfields region.

The company also secured a 20-year power purchase agreement with Horizon Power, Western Australia’s energy provider, that would see Exmouth run on 80% solar PV-derived renewable energy in the Gascoyne region.

As part of this project, a new hybrid system comprising a 9.6MW solar PV power plant, a 49.6MWh battery energy storage system and a 7MW gas power station would be developed.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pacific-Energy_Tropicana-Renewables-Expansion-Project.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 11:10:02.670489

Some of the announced investments in Kentucky have yet to come to fruition, and without tax credits, companies may pull back.

Companies and clean energy advocates have cautioned lawmakers against the cuts, which they say would complicate efforts to bolster domestic manufacturing and clean energy supply chains.

In Kentucky, more than 11,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic development hang in the balance as Congress considers axing clean energy tax credits approved in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, according to an analysis from Rhodium Group and MIT — threatening a key pillar of what's widely considered the most comprehensive climate legislation in U.S. history.

Dozens of projects are still pending or under construction around the state, from battery manufacturing to solar facilities and more, the analysis found. If Congress decides to slash tax incentives for these industries, the companies behind the incomplete projects could scale back plans for investment.

Modifying or repealing the tax credits “is a huge risk,” said Hannah Hess, an associate director at Rhodium Group who worked on the analysis — and is piling on uncertainty for companies already facing tariffs and other macroeconomic headwinds.

Kentucky has more operational jobs at stake in these projects than almost any other state, according to the analysis, excluding construction jobs. Nearly 2% of Kentucky’s economy was made up of the ""clean investments"" tracked in the analysis in the past year — tied for the largest portion of any state east of the Mississippi River.

In the early hours of May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a version of a bill experts said would cripple or eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The cuts would impact key credits for manufacturers, but also those for consumers looking to buy electric vehicles, heat pumps and more. This could flatten demand for clean technologies, in turn impeding plans for new factories, like those coming to Kentucky.

The bill passed the House by a one-vote margin, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to face further resistance and revision.

Following the vote, Gov. Andy Beshear encouraged the Senate to reverse the House’s cuts to the clean energy tax credits, ""if not for the original reasons that it was passed, but for the fact that it’s really good for our economy.""

Beshear has voiced his support of several large manufacturing projects in Kentucky poised to benefit from federal tax credits, including the $5.8 billion BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County, which is only partially constructed but is expected to offer 5,000 jobs when complete.

Other potentially vulnerable Kentucky projects with outstanding investments include battery manufacturing facilities in Shelbyville and Bowling Green, and another project near Hopkinsville — which had already announced plans to partially scale back its investment in February, citing ""changing market conditions.""

""The credits worked. They worked. And whether you like a green job because it’s better for the environment, or because it provides a really good living for people, it was working,"" Beshear said at a press briefing. ""It was pushing unemployment down, and it was really helping families.""

Republicans divided on clean energy credits

In Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District, an estimated $2.7 billion in outstanding investment is on the line, the analysis found — the most in the state. The district contains the incomplete BlueOval SK project, in addition to some solar developments and the AESC battery project near Bowling Green.

Republican Brett Guthrie represents the district in Congress, and chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. In a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed, Guthrie lauded his committee’s efforts to curb what he called ""Green New Deal-style waste,"" and said the proposed legislation would ""reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds.""

Guthrie's office did not respond to a request for comment.

In April, a group of companies with major clean energy investments in Kentucky, including Ford Motor Co., Ascend Elements, BrightNight Power and others, wrote a letter to Guthrie ""to emphasize the importance of preserving tax credits that are energizing advanced energy production and manufacturing in our state.""

""We have seen firsthand the benefits that these tax credits are bringing to our communities: providing investment certainty for our manufacturing economy, creating opportunities for our workers, and maintaining our pre-eminent role in providing the energy that powers a dominant American economy,"" the letter said.

Republicans in both chambers of Congress have been divided on various pieces of President Donald Trump’s sprawling tax and policy proposal, including whether to preserve key tax credits for clean energy investments. In the Senate, four Republicans wrote a letter cautioning ""against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.""

A sizeable majority of the clean energy investments that stand to benefit from the embattled IRA tax credits are in Republican congressional districts. Kentucky's five Republican-represented districts have seen nearly $16 billion in planned investment tied to these projects; more than $9 billion has been spent so far, the MIT and Rhodium Group analysis estimates.

""These districts have been awarded billions for economic development projects that provide exactly the energy transition investments needed to advance renewables and storage at a pace that is more in line with national trends,"" Lane Boldman, executive director of the Kentucky Conservation Committee, said in an email. ""These outstanding investment dollars would not only diversify and modernize our energy portfolio, but have the added benefit of bringing on cleaner energy technologies that are proven and available right now.""

In recent years, some Kentucky Republicans have been dubious about the rush of ""green"" investment in the commonwealth. But the thousands of new jobs have been hard to ignore.

Although some projects have faced setbacks or are still in construction, Kentucky has already seen the creation of more than 14,000 clean energy jobs, spanning ""battery manufacturing, automotive, grid infrastructure, critical minerals, and clean energy industries,"" according to the companies' letter to Guthrie.

In some cases, these jobs offer relief to communities that have suffered from a contraction in domestic manufacturing or other industries, like coal mining.

The gargantuan Toyota Motor plant in Georgetown, for one, has announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in electric vehicle manufacturing. As the plant has geared up for the expansion, it has made a point of hiring former coal workers, the area's former state senator previously told The Courier Journal.

The Republican supermajority in Kentucky's state legislature has approved generous incentives for electric vehicle battery manufacturing and other major clean energy investments, even as the party has criticized the federal programs upholding those investments.

Several of the companies with large outstanding investments in Kentucky, including BlueOval SK, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ascend Elements, which has plans to produce materials for battery manufacturing near Hopkinsville, was among the companies calling for sustained federal support, and cited estimates of its project having ""a positive $4.4 billion economic impact on southwest Kentucky over 10 years.""

""We believe it’s critical for the United States to build a domestic critical minerals and lithium-ion battery manufacturing infrastructure in North America,"" a company spokesperson said in a statement. ""Beyond creating jobs in Kentucky, it’s a matter of national security and energy independence.""

Bridging 'the valley of death'

Businesses are facing significant uncertainty in clean tech investments, and there are some indicators in the data around the country.

""Since the IRA was passed, we’ve seen a huge amount, dollar-wise, of companies announcing projects in the vein of these advanced new technologies,"" Hess said. ""In the first quarter of last year, there was $16 billion worth of projects announced that fit into this emerging climate technologies category,"" and billions of dollars more were announced as recently as late 2024.

But in the first quarter of this year, ""that really fell off a cliff,"" she said.

About $79 million was announced nationally — a 99% drop.

""That's the pipeline of how much is going to be invested in the future,"" Hess said. ""It points to, potentially, a big slowdown in these kinds of advanced technologies.""

Many of the projects that stood to benefit from IRA tax credits were relatively cutting-edge, or at least not yet mainstream in the U.S. — battery factories of unprecedented scale, or mass decarbonization of manufacturing in emissions-intensive industries.

These large capital investments were ""de-risked by federal incentives,"" as companies put it in the letter to Guthrie.

""Decarbonizing those processes like aluminum, clean cement, clean steel ... that's a really gnarly thing to figure out how you're going to get reduced emissions from those,"" Hess said.

Incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, now under siege by Congress, included tax credits for ""advanced manufacturing production,"" which applied to components for solar, wind and batteries, in addition to critical minerals. Other credits bolstered grid modernization or energy generation.

These incentives were designed, in part, to help the U.S. clean energy industry compete with China, where costs are far lower. And the U.S. fossil fuel industry has received federal tax breaks for more than a century. In recent years, the coal, petroleum and natural gas industries have collectively benefited from billions of dollars in subsidies, according to accounting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

By offering various subsidies to the clean technology projects, Hess said, the federal government was attempting to bridge what venture capitalists call the ""valley of death"" — the early period of startups or other new business endeavors, before a positive cash flow is achieved.

And the clean energy sector has found some success. U.S. electric vehicle sales have generally increased over time, and last year, renewable energy made up more than 90% of new power capacity in the grid.

Kentuckians have taken part in these trends. Since the beginning of last year, consumers and businesses in the state have spent about $1 billion on electric vehicles, heat pumps, and ""distributed electricity and storage,"" such as rooftop solar systems, according to MIT and Rhodium Group estimates.

Tax credit cuts could also stymy projects eyeing Kentucky, but yet to be announced — like Century Aluminum's planned ""green aluminum"" smelter. The company has described Eastern Kentucky as a preferred location for the smelter, but has not confirmed a site and is considering other states.

If brought to fruition, the project would create 1,000 permanent, union jobs, and would single-handedly double domestic production of primary aluminum, powered primarily by renewable energy. Century has previously praised the IRA's advanced manufacturing production tax credit for its benefits to U.S. aluminum producers.

If the U.S. Senate preserves the House's cuts to such credits, plans set in motion by the previous administration to decarbonize the U.S. economy and create domestic supply chains for EVs, clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing could be further slowed.

""It's really concerning, if you care about climate,"" Hess said, ""to see these kinds of projects kind of circling the drain.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/presto/2022/04/13/PLOU/902cb6b7-b1e3-41a4-a1f5-53eb0cf3ece8-EnvisionGigafactory_1.jpg?crop=4161,2341,x0,y233&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-28 06:02:45.638231

The facility, which will be the largest such plant in the world, could be operational as soon as August, according to one of Panasonic's construction suppliers. The plant will be the company's second U.S.-based manufacturing plant, following one embedded within the Tesla Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada, that builds cells and battery packs for the automaker's Cybertruck and Model X vehicles.

The Plant Was Anticipated To Open In March

When the second factory was announced, Panasonic anticipated it would open in March 2025, but several different delays conspired to render that goal unattainable. Speaking to Nikkei Asia, one of Panasonic's construction suppliers called the schedule extremely difficult to meet, in part citing America's more ""relaxed"" approach to work. For example, the unnamed supplier claimed that local construction workers were less likely to work overtime and more likely to point to workplace irregularities as a safety risk. The entity, which is a contractor for Panasonic and not the electronics giant itself, also said that the local workforce was less reliable than anticipated. Furthermore, variable weather proved challenging; the construction site experienced heavy flooding as a result of a severe winter storm, delaying operations further.

In addition to the weather and workforce concerns, Nikkei Asia reported that Panasonic was approaching its U.S. plant with some trepidation due to the volatile economic situation stemming from the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods. Although the batteries coming from the plant itself would be manufactured in Kansas, the machines used to build them come from Japan, which was hit with a 24 percent reciprocal tariff, making import duties on manufacturing implements more expensive. Panasonic has delayed outfitting its factory with those machines until some of the political dust settles; the governments of Japan and the US are still negotiating the terms of the tariff, 14 percent of which has been paused until July per Nikkei.

August 2025 Is The New Goal

The aforementioned construction supplier said that the De Soto, Kansas–based facility was on track for a production start in August, although Panasonic itself wouldn't commit to a specific date. The Japanese company did acknowledge that it expected the plant to begin mass production during the first half of fiscal-year 2026, which would mean before September at the latest. However, once it gets the new factory up and running, Panasonic may take a more conservative approach to American. operations.

The company intended to build a third manufacturing plant in the U.S., but those plans have been paused for the time being. Panasonic's leadership have expressed skepticism about America's EV-friendliness, citing sporadic charging infrastructure investments and slower-than-expected EV adoption among consumers. The massive Panasonic factory is still expected to bring EV manufacturing costs – and therefore sticker prices – down, so maybe the electronics juggernaut will change its tune if Americans get excited about cheaper electric cars.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/panasonic-energy-office-building.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 10:15:50.448991

This leaves me with some questions: Is the elimination of those renewable energy tax credits worth the slowdown in those high-wage manufacturing jobs?
Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?","President Donald Trump wants to boost American manufacturing, a goal that has eluded other presidents in the so-called “post-industrial” era but a laudatory one nonetheless.

However, many of the manufacturing jobs that he and other administration officials talk most prominently about are likely minimum-wage or other low-wage positions. Meanwhile, the “big, beautiful” bill now moving through Congress would likely slow the growth of one fast-growing manufacturing sector where the average annual income is $81,600. Furthermore, those jobs are concentrated in places that voted for Trump in 2024, meaning that some Republican members of Congress are finding themselves in the position of potentially slowing manufacturing growth in their own districts.

What we have here is a conflict between political ideology that is often quite clear and economic realities that are more complicated and don’t fit easily into standard left-right political alignments. Some of this conflict is playing out in Virginia, most notably in Pittsylvania and Pulaski counties. Let’s walk through what’s going on here.

Manufacturing jobs in the United States started falling in 1979, then fell dramatically after 2000 (which coincides with both the North American Free Trade Agreement and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization) and bottomed out in 2010. Since then, their numbers have grown sluggishly, no matter which president or which party was in power. There are lots of factors at play, but generally speaking, many jobs have gone overseas to lower-wage countries and many others have been automated.

Trump’s solution to this 21st-century problem is to bring back a tax most popular in the 19th century: tariffs, or taxes on imports. The theory is that if imported goods cost more, companies will be encouraged to reshore their manufacturing to the United States so they don’t lose customers.

Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple’s iPhones if they’re not manufactured in the United States. This is not the first time those devices — and other consumer technology — have been singled out. Earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick declared: “The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones — that kind of thing is going to come to America.”

If they did, though, that iPhone would cost a whole lot more than it does now. Workers at one assembly plant in China make $244 a month, or $2,928 a year. Let’s assume Apple opened an assembly line in the United States and paid workers at the same rate that I see being advertised for some convenience store employees — $15 an hour. That’s $31,200 a year, or more than 10 times what those China iPhone assemblers are making. It is simply unrealistic to expect American consumers to pay that much more for their cherished phones, and unrealistic to expect Apple shareholders to make do with lower dividends. American consumers demand inexpensive products and American investors demand a return, which is why low-skilled manufacturing has gone overseas and will stay there. The economics just don’t work otherwise. Americans don’t get paid enough money to afford the prices that companies would have to charge if they made their products with American labor.

The manufacturing that can — and is — growing in the United States involves more high-skilled work. Conveniently, we have some — but some of the provisions in the Republican tax bill put those jobs in jeopardy.

The bill sets out to roll back certain tax credits for renewable energy that were enacted under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which was really more of a climate bill than an anti-inflation bill. Both the politics and the economics seem simple: Republicans have never been as keen on renewable energy as Democrats have been, and they want to get rid of those tax credits to make it easier to cut spending elsewhere. Here’s where things get complicated for them and interesting to those of us who follow politics: Those tax credits have created green manufacturing jobs in red states and red districts. The stereotype of an electric vehicle driver might be a Democrat, but those vehicles — and especially their batteries — are being built by Republicans. A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Denver-based research firm, the Rhodium Group, found that since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed, the U.S. has seen $662 billion invested in clean energy projects, with $115 billion of that in manufacturing. Of that, almost 82% of those projects have been in Republican congressional districts. In terms of jobs, CNBC reports that about 86,700 clean energy manufacturing jobs are in Republican districts, nearly triple the 30,400 in Democratic districts; that’s 74% of clean tech manufacturing jobs going to Republican districts.

Furthermore, the manufacturing news website Manufacturing Dive reports that in 2024 clean energy was one of the three biggest drivers of manufacturing investment in the U.S. — the others were semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Of those three, clean energy manufacturing appears to have added the most new jobs. At a time when overall manufacturing growth is sluggish (and actually declined in 2024), these are the growth areas that you’d think the federal government would want to encourage further.

In politics, this is called cross-pressure, where an officeholder is pulled two different ways — the desire to cut renewable energy credits versus the desire to grow manufacturing jobs.

Some more numbers:

1. Under the overall umbrella of clean energy technology, battery manufacturing has been a particularly strong growth sector, and about 90% of that growth has been due to electric vehicles, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. About 84% of the investment in electric vehicle-related facilities (and electric vehicles are basically big batteries on wheels) has come in 10 states. Last year, all but one of them voted for Trump. The one exception was Illinois. In all, the battery-related jobs in those 10 states account for 72,500 jobs. Lead-acid batteries account for about 60% of the market; the average wage at those jobs is $81,600, according to the Battery Council.

2. Over the past two years, solar panel manufacturers have announced more than 44,000 jobs in the United States. Of the 10 states with the most solar jobs, six voted for Trump, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Solar manufacturing jobs average about $60,000 a year, according to Indeed.com.

3. The single fastest-growing job in the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is that of wind turbine technician, for which the median pay is about $62,000 a year. Of the eight states with the biggest demand, six voted for Trump.

Republicans would not dare call this the Green New Deal, but this is the Green New Deal — the premise that the transition to renewable energy can and will create jobs. The catch, of course, is that it’s not creating those jobs in the same places where fossil fuel jobs are going away, such as Appalachia, but that’s a topic I’ve harped on before. Nonetheless, renewable energy is creating manufacturing jobs and doing so mostly in Republican areas, largely because Republicans govern the states in the Sunbelt where manufacturing of all types is growing fastest (a topic for a future column), although in the case of wind, it’s because the windiest states are Republican ones in the Midwest.

Republicans may not like the economics involved — they may prefer to see a more free-market approach without any tax credits to goose a particular sector — but as a practical matter, a bill they didn’t like is helping to create jobs for their constituents. You can see why some Republican senators are now starting to raise questions about the House bill, with a particular focus on the phaseout of many of these renewable energy credits. In the coming weeks, as these details get debated, we’re not going to hear about carbon emissions or melting ice caps or rising sea levels, we’re going to hear about investment dollars and job counts, which makes for a very different discussion.

Last week, Virginia’s Commission on Electric Utility Regulation — known by the unflattering acronym of CEUR, pronounced “sewer” — heard from Ben Norris of the Solar Energy Industries Association. He warned that the U.S. House bill would cripple further growth of solar energy. That might seem good news for those in rural areas who think solar “farms” are an ugly, industrial blight on the landscape but not such good news for those who want the lights to come on: Norris spelled out how much solar wouldn’t be developed — enough to supply the entire state of Pennsylvania is how he measured it. That might bother those who wonder how we’re going to meet rising power demands but might not bother those who think we should just power the grid with natural gas and coal, anyway.

However, Norris also said doing away with the tax credit would eliminate more than 300,000 solar-related jobs over the next three years, with 86,000 of those in manufacturing and more than 200,000 in construction. While doing away with those credits may satisfy one set of Republican goals, they seem to run directly counter to other Republican goals — specifically creating manufacturing jobs, particularly good-paying ones (and good-paying ones in rural areas). As William Shakespeare once observed, “aye, there’s the rub.”

The Rhodium Group recently came up with a data set of all the energy-related jobs eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and organized that data set by congressional district. Here’s what it shows for Virginia, with congressional districts ranked by order of investment announced:

Whether you go by investment already in the ground, or investment promised, the two districts with the most investment, and four of the top five, are Republican districts. The bottom five districts, including three with zero IRA-eligible districts, are all Democratic districts. Going simply by that, you’d think these tax credits were a Republican invention, not a Democratic one.

Personally, I’m not especially moved by these investment numbers. The 2nd District ranks so high because of Dominion Energy’s offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.) The 5th District ranks next highest because of all the solar development across Southside. In the case of solar, there is a lot of investment across Southside, but, after construction is completed, those solar farms don’t create many jobs. That’s why I’m much more interested in the jobs analysis:

The order of the districts is different here, but the pattern is the same: The top two districts, and five of the top six, are all Republican districts. Southside’s 5th District represented by John McGuire has more than twice as many IRA-eligible jobs as the next biggest district, the 9th District represented by Morgan Griffith.

Why is this, since I just said all those solar farms don’t create many jobs? Now we’re into the details, but we need to understand these details if we want to understand what’s going on. One of the more interesting energy policy debates is on the left, between those who think nuclear energy is dangerous and dirty and those who think it may be the only way to retire a lot of fossil fuel sources. The Biden administration was pro-nuclear, so the Inflation Reduction Act has a lot of incentives for nuclear energy. That’s why the 5th District ranks so high — all those nuclear-related jobs with BWX Technologies and Framatone in Lynchburg, plus Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear plant in Louisa County. Some might look at these rankings and think, wow, the 5th District has a lot of green energy; others who know more about the district will look at these rankings and say there sure are a lot of nuclear jobs there.

The Republicans who want to strip out the tax credits for renewables want to keep the incentives for nuclear, so the number of jobs in the district potentially at risk if the lack of tax credits dries up the renewable energy sector isn’t nearly that high. Alas, the data doesn’t give further breakdowns, so consider those 5th District numbers with an asterisk beside them to account for all the nuclear-related jobs that aren’t endangered.

However, even if we take out nuclear, the 5th District still has at least 2,000-plus jobs potentially at risk — the jobs that Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced last year would be coming to Pittsylvania County in the form of a Microporous battery plant. Virginia, for multiple reasons, had fallen just outside the so-called “battery belt” that has arisen in the Southeast — until that Microporous announcement. The company hasn’t commented, but that firm has been counting on growth in the battery sector. If the end of these renewable energy tax credits slows that growth, well, you can do the math. Furthermore, the Trump administration has yet to deliver a $100 million grant to Microporous that was promised by the Biden administration. In Virginia, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax County, last week posted a New York Times story that reported the Republican tax bill “would gut subsidies for battery manufacturing.” Surovell’s comment on X, formerly known as Twitter: “Why does the GOP hate Pittsylvania County?” I don’t think they hate Pittsylvania County, but they hate the tax credits that Pittylvania might benefit from.

It is curious that after a Republican-voting locality, and a Republican governor, worked so hard to lure a major employer whose arrival would be transformative for the region, a Republican Congress and a Republican president might undo all that economic development. The same is true for some other places. Volvo Trucks in Pulaski County and Mack Trucks in Roanoke County now produce a lot of electric vehicles; they also were promised grants that the Trump administration hasn’t followed through on. The Microporous plant in Pittsylvania has yet to come, but Volvo and Mack are already here; the green economy is very real to the shift workers there.

Here’s where we start to tie all this together.

Microporous said the average wage for those jobs would be $60,000, above the county’s median household income of $54,115.

Trump’s basic instincts aren’t wrong on this one: The United States could do with more manufacturing jobs. However, why is he focused on people turning “little screws” for low wages when we already have a one manufacturing sector that’s not only growing but is growing high-wage jobs? Shouldn’t that one be the one we try to grow even more? This leaves me with some questions:

Is the elimination of those renewable energy tax credits worth the slowdown in those high-wage manufacturing jobs? Or, put another way, is philosophy more important than practicality?

Is there a way to spur that job growth in clean energy manufacturing without those tax credits?

Given how most congressional districts are either strongly Republican or strongly Democratic, would there be any political price to be paid if that clean energy manufacturing job growth in Republican districts slows down or comes to a halt?

Is this even a sector we want to grow? If you believe that renewable energy isn’t something we need, then perhaps not, even if it is producing high-paying manufacturing jobs.

Notice that none of this has to do with how you feel about carbon emissions and “saving the planet,” but everything to do with creating high-wage manufacturing jobs and building a new economy in many rural areas. Pittsylvania County may be ground zero for this debate, with Pulaski County a close second.

Elon Musk has voiced his disapproval of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" citing concerns over its potential to increase the federal deficit and hinder government efficiency efforts. The proposed legislation, backed by President Trump, includes tax cuts, stricter Medicaid rules, and reduced clean energy incentives.

Elon Musk has expressed disappointment over a sweeping domestic policy bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed by House Republicans last week. He warned that it could worsen the federal deficit and undermine efforts to improve government efficiency.

Dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” by Trump, the legislation includes an extension of his hallmark 2017 tax cuts, stricter Medicaid work requirements, increased border security funding, and a proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits.

It now moves to the Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain.

“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk told CBS Sunday Morning in an interview airing June 1. He was referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which the billionaire recently stepped back from.

Musk’s comments also highlight a broader philosophical split. As the former head of the DOGE, Musk once led a sweeping push to trim federal spending. The current bill’s deficit-heavy profile contradicts DOGE’s original mission.

“I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,” he added. “But I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion.”

According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation would add $3.8 trillion to the federal deficit by 2034, an outcome at odds with Musk’s stated goal of improving fiscal discipline in Washington.

Tesla could suffer from clean energy cuts

Although Musk did not mention Tesla directly, the proposed rollback of clean energy tax credits has raised concerns for the company. Tesla and other clean technology firms currently benefit from incentives that reduce the cost of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar installations for consumers.

According to a Bloomberg report, under the Inflation Reduction Act, EV buyers are eligible for up to $7,500 in tax credits. Solar systems qualify for a 30% investment tax credit. Reducing or eliminating these incentives could affect both pricing and consumer demand across the clean energy sector.

Tesla, General Motors, and other EV manufacturers, as well as their customers, could be among the hardest hit. Former President Biden’s climate law expanded the $7,500 credit to include new, used, and commercial EVs.

As per the report, the Republican plan would scale back or repeal the consumer EV credit by the end of 2025. Beginning in 2026, only manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs by the end of this year would remain eligible. Tesla and GM have already surpassed that threshold. The bill would also eliminate credits for used and commercial EVs. Congressional estimates suggest the total rollback would save the government more than $190 billion over the next decade.

These changes could reduce demand for Tesla’s popular models such as the Model Y and Cybertruck. They may also weaken the appeal of EVs more broadly. Tesla’s volume-led growth strategy could suffer, along with its competitive edge, especially as traditional carmakers and Chinese rivals continue to benefit from local incentives.

Musk has not yet publicly addressed how these proposed changes could impact Tesla’s business.

Solar incentives also at risk

The bill also targets clean energy tax breaks that support Tesla’s solar and energy storage divisions, along with the wider green technology sector.

Bloomberg reported that homeowners would no longer be eligible for a 30% tax credit on solar panel installations and other clean energy systems after this year. This change would be a setback for consumers planning to invest in sustainable energy solutions.

The rollback would affect not only Tesla’s products like the Powerwall and Megapack, but also companies such as Enphase Energy and SolarEdge Technologies. The measure is expected to save the government $77 billion over a ten-year period, as per the report.

Musk’s remarks also point to growing distance between him and Trump, despite their earlier cooperation. The bill faces significant opposition in the Senate, where its final form remains uncertain.

“We are so far away from an acceptable bill, it’s hard to say,” said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, according to Bloomberg.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.
Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.
“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.
“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.","Japanese insurer Tokio Marine has set up a unit to insure activities linked to the low-carbon transition such as green hydrogen, shipping and cement and is targeting $1 billion in revenues by the end of the decade, its chair told Reuters.

The new unit, Tokio Marine GX (TMGX), will provide advisory and risk transfer services to companies across a range of sectors looking to decarbonise, and build on the existing work of its GCube renewable energy team, Fraser McLachlan said.

TMGX will offer up to $500 million in cover on any single risk and is targeting at least a 10% share of the global premium income market in 2030, estimated at around $10 billion, he said.

While some peers had already begun to write more transition-linked business, most had done so using existing sectoral teams rather than creating a dedicated unit, he said.

“We’re going to rip up the rule-card a little bit here,” McLachlan said.

“We’re going to look at some new technologies, we’re going to look at more sophisticated ways of being able to risk transfer business,” such as offering insurance for tax credits and surety guarantees.

Launching with existing GCube headcount of around 50 and revenue of around $200 million, both would likely double over the next couple of years, he said. Parent Tokio Marine is the largest property and casualty insurer in Japan with a market value of around $70 billion.

Among the new technologies TMGX would look to cover include small and middle market nuclear, hydrogen, fuel cells, new solar technologies including floating solar and electric vehicles, he said.

“There’s a lot of sectors that really haven’t been served by the insurance space,” McLachlan said.

Another area ripe for extra help was the market for tax credit insurance, where businesses get cover in case they are unable to access the credits as planned, thereby lowering their risk to bank lenders and the interest rate on borrowing.

“It’s a win-win. Lenders love it as it transfers their risk; we like it, we’re getting a premium for a risk we’re comfortable with; and it allows the project to be financed at more equitable terms.”

The company could also look to strike deals with managing general agents, intermediaries given authority by the insurer to write business in their name, saving them the time and expense of building out a team.

“It’s a pretty quick win… it allows you instant access to a market,” McLachlan said.

Finding more innovative ways to finance the risks associated with the transition was critical if the world is to hit its climate goals.

“Unless people start coming to the table with more creative insurance solutions … we’re going to see a lot of these projects stall,” he said.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general.
The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.
Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean.
In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.","Li-Cycle once seemed like a leader among the startups trying to recycle electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. Now it’s mired in bankruptcy proceedings.

The company’s board replaced the CEO and CFO in a decision announced May 1, when Li-Cycle publicized that it was looking for buyers. A potential deal with mining giant and lead creditor Glencore evidently had not come to fruition: Two weeks later, a Canadian bankruptcy court appointed Alvarez & Marsal Canada Securities to oversee a sale of Li-Cycle’s assets. A Li-Cycle spokesperson referred Canary Media to the company’s public bankruptcy announcements.

Prospective buyers for the partially completed recycling empire can state their intent by early June. In the meantime, Glencore has loaned $10.5 million to keep things going during the proceedings. Glencore also entered a ​“stalking horse” offer of $40 million for most of Li-Cycle’s holdings, setting a floor for bidding (if any other investors want a piece of the action). Glencore could emerge with a real deal on its hands, but it won’t be recouping the $275 million it previously invested in Li-Cycle.

“The Company represents a compelling investment opportunity, uniquely positioned to benefit from rapid growth in the battery materials and [lithium-ion battery] recycling market, amid increasing global focus on sustainability and critical raw material supply chain resilience,” Alvarez & Marsal pitch in a flyer for the sale.

That ​“compelling” opportunity amounts to five battery shredding plants, a massive unfinished recycling center in Western New York, and a business predicated on the growth of a nascent North American EV supply chain that currently faces far-reaching disruption from the Trump administration. A buyer would not be able to fully recycle any batteries without spending a few hundred million dollars more, and even then, it’s not clear they would make any money doing so.

The startup’s collapse underscores the struggles of the fledgling battery recycling industry in general. A few years ago, the sector was flush with venture capital and charting out rapid timelines for commercializing breakthrough technologies that would enable the transition to EVs while minimizing mining. The sector was also seen as a way to achieve the bipartisan goal of reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global battery supply chain.

Li-Cycle was founded in Canada in 2016 and went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC (generally a red flag for early-stage cleantech companies). Its engineers developed a technique for shredding whole lithium-ion battery packs while they’re submerged in liquid; this prevented fires and saved considerable effort compared with painstakingly discharging and dismantling the packs for processing.

Li-Cycle successfully built five ​“spoke” facilities to collect and shred whole electric vehicle battery packs, turning them into the powdery mixture known as black mass. The spoke operations have paused in Arizona, Alabama, New York, and Ontario, while a German outpost continues to function during bankruptcy proceedings. Collectively, these facilities can break down up to 40 kilotons of batteries a year.

The spokes were supposed to feed their black mass to Li-Cycle’s hub in Rochester, New York, which would refine it and isolate useful battery materials to reintroduce into the supply chain. This never came to pass because Li-Cycle halted construction in fall 2023, citing runaway costs. It became clear that Li-Cycle needed to find a lot more cash to complete the nearly 2-million-square-foot site.

The company hoped for a lifeline from the Biden-era Department of Energy: In November, its Loan Programs Office finalized a $475 million loan for Li-Cycle to complete the recycling hub. But Li-Cycle never drew on that federal money because it couldn’t secure additional private funding to hold in reserve, as stipulated in the loan terms.

Li-Cycle is not the only battery recycling firm in a tough spot. Since last year, a number of challenges have beset the industry.

The adjacent U.S. EV sector has seen slower growth than expected, which has in turn reduced the urgency of building out a North American battery supply chain. Core battery materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt have plummeted in price, lessening the value of whatever recyclers might glean. And battery makers have increasingly turned to lithium iron phosphate, a cheaper alternative to nickel- and cobalt-based chemistries, further reducing the value of recycling these batteries.

In the past year, a fire destroyed the largest battery shredding plant in the U.S., Interco’s Critical Mineral Recovery site in Missouri. Reno, Nevada–based Aqua Metals ran low on funds and laid off staff while it searched for financing to build a commercial-scale recycling line. Ascend Elements delayed construction of its flagship recycling plant in Kentucky, citing a customer’s decision to postpone buying the recycled materials. In March, Ascend canceled plans to make cathode active materials in Kentucky to focus on precursor materials and lithium carbonate.

Redwood Materials is the rare bright spot. The venture by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel raised a couple billion dollars and has been building out a major compound in the desert outside Reno, not far from Tesla’s factory there. In 2024, Redwood Materials broke down 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries and earned $200 million in revenue from recycled materials.

The industry’s challenges come as the Trump administration says it aims to expand U.S. mineral supplies. Paradoxically, the administration has taken steps to undermine the fledgling U.S. EV and battery industries, which are the big drivers of demand growth for rare earth metals. The budget bill passed by the House last week would strip tax incentives for EV purchases and battery installations, weakening demand for the domestic supply chain that recyclers like Li-Cycle hoped to serve — and making the tough road for recycling firms even tougher.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Operations-Page-Resize-1.webp?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=8d94a574e5bf3ec0fe0d4d0f9871c125,N,,2025-05-28 07:04:39.234451

“LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs.
In response to NRDC's win challenging a separate LNG terminal, FERC voluntarily rescinded its approval for CP2 for additional consideration.
In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) granted conditional authorization for the terminal to export LNG to non–free trade agreement countries.
The CP2 LNG project is the fourth permitted major LNG facility for Arlington, Virginia-based Venture Global.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Committee (FERC) re-approved the Calcasieu Pass 2 (CP2) liquefied natural gas export terminal on Friday, essentially greenlighting the polluting project.

In September 2024, NRDC and partners at the Sierra Club and the Southern Environmental Law Center challenged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the CP2 LNG terminal and the CP Express Pipeline in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

“Moving forward with CP2 is bad news for the American public and for our climate,” said Gillian Giannetti, senior attorney at NRDC. “LNG extraction and export contaminates our water, spews toxic pollution into our communities, releases climate-warming emissions, and drives up U.S. energy costs. FERC once again greenlighting CP2 is throwing the health of our communities and the public interest out the window just to line the pockets of fossil-fuel-industry billionaires. NRDC remains dedicated to protecting Gulf communities affected by this dangerous proposal.”

“This decision is both unlawful and morally indefensible,” said Megan Gibson, Senior Attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “FERC is once again rubber-stamping fossil fuel infrastructure that will permanently displace fishermen, effectively eradicate their way of life, bulldoze fragile coastal wetlands, and lock in decades of pollution for export. There is no public benefit here—only private gain for a company aiming to export U.S. gas overseas.”

Background:

In June 2024, FERC approved Venture Global LNG, LLC's application to construct and operate the CP2 LNG export terminal located in the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. It also approved the CP Express Pipeline, an 85.4-mile pipeline that would feed up to 4.4 million dekatherms of gas per day from eastern Texas to the CP2 facility for the sole purpose of exporting LNG overseas.

In September 2024, NRDC and our partners challenged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval of the CP2 LNG terminal and the CP Express Pipeline in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. NRDC argued that FERC violated the law by not taking the adverse environmental, economic, and socioeconomic impacts seriously when it approved this project. In response to NRDC's win challenging a separate LNG terminal, FERC voluntarily rescinded its approval for CP2 for additional consideration. In March 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) granted conditional authorization for the terminal to export LNG to non–free trade agreement countries.

The CP2 LNG project is the fourth permitted major LNG facility for Arlington, Virginia-based Venture Global. It is estimated that this CP2 alone will emit greenhouse gas amounts that are equivalent to putting more than 1.85 million additional gas-fueled automobiles on the road. FERC also predicts that the ambient air quality around the project will exceed the national air quality standards for multiple air pollutants.

NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council) is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists. Established in 1970, NRDC uses science, policy, law and people power to confront the climate crisis, protect public health and safeguard nature.

The European Commission expects emissions to fall by 54 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, very close to its 55 percent target, it said, after analysing member states' energy and climate plans for the coming years.

The EU, however, faces a tough balancing act.

It is seeking to boost European industry confronted by fierce competition in the United States and China, ramp up its defenses faced with Russia, and tackle climate change that is wreaking havoc at an alarming pace with wildfires and floods.

""The world is in a full geopolitical winter. But despite everything that is going on today, we do feel we have good news, and we're pleased to say that the EU is well on track to achieve its 2030 target,"" climate chief Wopke Hoekstra, said.

""It is also fair to say that the ambition on paper needs to be matched by ambition in the real world,"" Hoekstra told reporters in Brussels.

The bloc has already cut emissions by 37 percent compared to 1990, including an eight-percent drop in 2023, the commission said.

Brussels said most member states were now aligned with the target of reaching a share of renewable energy in total consumption of 42.5 percent by 2030.

The commission, however, pointed to disparities between member states on cutting emissions and highlighted the problems of protecting forests and carbon storage.

It singled out Belgium, Estonia and Poland, which have not submitted their energy and climate plans, urging them to ""do so without delay"".

""We have reasons to be proud, although we cannot be satisfied. We've come a long way, but we're not where we need to be yet,"" said energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

- Flexibility -

Climate Action Network Europe's Giulia Nardi said the 2030 targets were achievable ""but without effective national policies and credible financing -- both of which are largely lacking in the updated plans -- implementation will fall short.""

The EU has set a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and Brussels wants to agree on an interim target for 2040 -- with the commission seeking to cut emissions by 90 percent compared to 1990 levels.

""A clear target for 2040 and giving predictability, in our view, is important,"" Hoekstra said.

But negotiations are stalling between EU countries on the 2040 target, and the commission has shied away from formally proposing the 90-percent cut to member states.

For some countries like the Czech Republic and Italy, the target is unrealistic.

The commission is considering greater flexibility in its calculations for 2040, including through the purchase of carbon credits on international markets.

The EU's executive arm insists it will submit a formal proposal before the summer and stresses that the bloc will be ready for the next UN COP30 climate conference, which will be held in November in the Amazonian city of Belem in Brazil.

- Cutting red tape -

The delays have raised concerns among environmental groups, which have urged Europe to take the lead on fighting climate change -- US President Donald Trump having withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement after his return to the White House in January.

Environment defenders are also fearful of a wholesale unravelling of the European Green Deal, a landmark package of measures that defined commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term in office but has since come increasingly under fire.

Von der Leyen's commission has slashed red tape within months of taking office as the political sphere has also changed with right-wing gains across Europe.

Brussels has taken the axe to environmental rules affecting businesses -- with France and Germany going further in demanding they be scrapped -- and also delayed its anti-deforestation law.

The Illinois Senate unanimously approved the legislation in April.

The legislation, SB 1723, aims to prevent “carbon sequestration activity within a sequestration facility that overlies, underlies, or passes through a sole source aquifer.”

The bill specifically targets CCS activities near the Mohomet Aquifer, a groundwater source that serves as the sole source of drinking water for central Illinois residents. Bill language specifies that the CCS activities would continue to be allowed in other areas of the state. In addition, the legislation creates a study commission that would investigate the safety of allowing CCS projects near the Mohomet Aquifer.

In its first quarter earnings call, held May 7, Alto Ingredients President and CEO Bryan McGregor briefly referenced SB 1723, noting the bill was complicating plans to add CCS capabilities at the company’s campus in Pekin, Illinois. At that time, McGregor indicated the company was working with elected officials to minimize the potential legal impact of the legislation on its CCS initiative. He also said Alto is also working to develop options to ensure the company can optimize the value of its CO2 production no matter what the outcome of the legislation, including plans to relocate the proposed CO2 storage location.

[53] U.S. Department of Energy, “TESLA,” 2024, https://www.energy.gov/lpo/tesla.","In 2025, federal workforce reductions disrupted several core agencies under the Department of Energy (DOE), igniting renewed concerns over the resilience of the United States’ energy systems and the integrity of national security protocols. These cuts, enacted under the broader reorganization agenda of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), were promoted as necessary cost-saving measures within Donald Trump’s fiscal reform campaign.1 However, the nature and scope of the reductions have raised questions about the federal government’s ability to maintain stable energy governance, respond to emerging threats, and support the nation’s long-term transition toward a more secure and sustainable energy future.

As a central pillar of U.S. energy and security policy, the DOE is tasked with safeguarding nuclear materials, guiding clean energy innovation, and ensuring the reliability of the national power grid. The sudden contraction of its workforce has disrupted these functions, exposing serious vulnerabilities in operational capacity, regulatory oversight, and interagency coordination.2 Agencies deemed essential to national interest have also faced institutional uncertainty, prompting concerns about how strategic energy functions can continue under diminished staffing. While the administration’s rationale emphasizes efficiency, the uneven application of these cuts, particularly their concentration in departments linked to climate and energy policy, suggests a deeper politicization of bureaucratic restructuring. These developments highlight a growing disconnect between fiscal ideology and functional governance, demanding closer scrutiny of how workforce decisions shape the future of U.S. energy security.

This paper evaluates the impact of the 2025 federal workforce reductions, measuring the extent of weakened U.S. energy infrastructure. In analyzing the potential for nuclear oversight, regional grid instability, and the undermining of long-term clean energy initiatives, these developments could present a disconnect between the pursuit of administrative efficiency and the functional imperatives of national energy security. From a stability standpoint, the reductions in workforce affect institutional coherence while leaving essential agencies unprepared for emerging challenges. Addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for the federal government’s role in energy governance and policy frameworks to safeguard public safety, energy sovereignty, and long-term environmental resilience.

Undermining of Nuclear Security

To streamline federal operations, the U.S. has restructured key oversight mechanisms in its energy sector, most notably in governing nuclear infrastructure. The 2025 wave of federal workforce reductions, introduced under the pretext of administrative efficiency and fiscal responsibility, has impacted the oversight mechanisms for safeguarding nuclear energy systems, suggesting a misalignment between governance efficiency and the federal responsibility to uphold energy sovereignty and public safety.3 Of particular concern are the cuts to the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency under the DOE tasked with ensuring the safety, security, and effectiveness of the nation’s civilian nuclear energy systems and nuclear materials management.4 The loss of personnel within this agency, particularly at high-level energy research institutions including Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, signals not merely administrative downsizing but a substantive degradation of national energy security capacity and institutional operational readiness.5

The layoffs have affected both long-term federal employees and probationary staff, including nuclear safety engineers, emergency energy response planners, and compliance auditors whose roles were central to protecting nuclear materials, enforcing regulatory standards, and managing energy-related emergencies. Their abrupt removal has disrupted essential regulatory timelines and left critical facilities without adequate personnel to ensure compliance, monitoring, and emergency response. Furthermore, around 2,000 DOE employees, with some working for the NNSA, were removed from their positions.6 Although Trump reversed the layoffs, the agency was unable to contact former employees who needed to be rehired.7

The impact is already visible in the Pacific Northwest region, where layoffs at the Hanford nuclear site and the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) have delayed critical infrastructure projects, safety audits, and radioactive waste management protocols. Hanford now operates under reduced regulatory supervision, exacerbating risks tied to unresolved nuclear waste storage issues.8 Meanwhile, Bonneville’s role in stabilizing the grid and integrating nuclear generation sources has been undercut by personnel losses, increasing the likelihood of operational disruptions during periods of peak electricity demand or cyber intrusions targeting nuclear-grid interdependencies.9 Given the challenges surrounding nuclear systems, ensuring safety requires skilled personnel and real-time judgment, factors that automation alone cannot substitute. As demonstrated by the 2012 Y-12 breach, over-reliance on automated systems can compromise even the most secure energy sites.10 This dynamic parallels key lessons from the 2011 Fukushima disaster, where institutional paralysis and delayed decision-making were more consequential than the physical damage itself in escalating the crisis.11 According to DOE-affiliated workforce data, the reductions have interrupted energy costs while impacting energy security.12 Emergency preparedness has also been affected, with workforce reductions impacting interagency energy response drills, including simulations of large-scale nuclear grid failures or targeted attacks on power plants.13 Budget constraints and staffing shortages led to the cancellation of vital contingency exercises in 2025, leaving the nation exposed in the event of a real crisis.14 Analysts warn that this lack of coordinated practice risks a dangerous false sense of readiness.

Institutionally, layoffs have disrupted oversight and research programs central to nuclear energy innovation, including nonproliferation, medical isotope production, and safety training. The suspension of contracts at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations highlights the breakdown of linkages between energy innovation and oversight.15 These offices not only advanced clean nuclear technologies but also ensured compliance with projects funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The U.S. Government Accountability Office highlights a broader constitutional dilemma, arguing that the executive branch’s impoundment of appropriated clean energy funds may constitute a violation of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974.16 If deemed unlawful, the policy decisions driving workforce reductions could be challenged for undermining statutory energy objectives.

From a national security perspective, the strategic cost of dismantling federal nuclear energy capacity outweighs any short-term fiscal gains. Energy securitization theory underscores that energy systems, especially those tied to nuclear governance, are not just technical infrastructures but existential assets requiring state protection.17 In this light, the erosion of staffing and oversight at critical agencies compromises the state’s ability to treat energy as a matter of national survival, diminishing both resilience and global credibility in the energy domain.

While appeals to bureaucratic efficiency may satisfy short-term budgetary priorities, the resultant degradation of nuclear oversight institutions has exposed critical vulnerabilities in national energy governance. The resulting institutional thinning at the NNSA and affiliated DOE bodies has not only delayed key regulatory functions but also fractured long-term policy frameworks, eroding the federal government’s capacity to uphold its obligations under clean energy legislation and nuclear safety mandates.18 At a time of intensifying geopolitical threats and growing energy demand, the attrition of nuclear oversight capacity signals not only bureaucratic miscalculation but also a structural failure to integrate resilience, continuity, and security into national energy governance.

Threats to Power Grid Reliability and Regional Infrastructure

The U.S. energy transition, while strategically essential, now faces mounting operational risks as federal workforce reductions undermine the centralized institutions historically responsible for grid oversight and national energy coherence. Recent large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, executed under the Trump administration’s DOGE, have imposed a shift on the institutions historically tasked with sustaining and modernizing America’s energy infrastructure.19 This disruption has weakened BPA’s ability to manage the Pacific Northwest grid, particularly in high-voltage transmission and outage response.20

Figure 2: Federal Workforce Reductions

Roughly 420 workers were terminated from BPA alone, accounting for 13% of 3,100 managing the Pacific Northwest’s electricity supply.21 Such reductions are not limited to BPA; over 2,000 employees in the Department of the Interior, including those in the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, both of which are instrumental in issuing permits and maintaining power generation infrastructure, have also been dismissed.22 Nationwide, more than 60,000 federal workers have been laid off since February 2025, with an additional 75,000 taking buyouts.23 This unprecedented downsizing threatens the federal government’s ability to uphold energy security mandates, maintain infrastructure continuity, and coordinate the integration of clean energy technologies. While advocates of a leaner government argue that states and private firms can compensate for federal pullback, the consequences suggest delayed energy integration, increased cyber vulnerabilities, and administrative bottlenecks across critical grid infrastructure.24 Particularly at risk are regionally integrated energy systems that rely on interjurisdictional coordination, which only the federal government is positioned to provide, highlighting a growing disconnect between administrative retrenchment and the functional imperatives of energy governance.

The operational challenges facing the BPA exemplify these broader systemic vulnerabilities. Operating over 15,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, BPA’s efficient performance depends on skilled staff capable of real-time grid monitoring, outage response, and long-term infrastructure planning.25 With a drastically reduced workforce, routine maintenance is being delayed, grid modernization initiatives are stalling, and project backlogs are swelling. These challenges reduce grid stability today and compromise future upgrades needed for a decarbonized economy.

Federal workforce reductions have also hindered progress in renewable energy integration, a cornerstone of the nation’s decarbonization strategy. The pause in disbursements under the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), mandated by Section 7 of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, has paralyzed projects designed to expand grid capacity through the integration of utility-scale solar arrays.26 These federal investments were foundational to many state and local efforts, especially in areas that lack the capital or regulatory capacity to deploy such technologies independently.27 As a result, energy transition timelines are slipping, and states that once stood at the forefront of clean energy leadership are now scrambling to reconfigure their development plans.

Moreover, the BPA and other regional transmission organizations are facing a compounding crisis in cybersecurity. The attrition of federal cybersecurity personnel and reduced funding for grid resilience initiatives have resulted in delayed software patching, limited breach response capacity, and increased exposure to SCADA system vulnerabilities across smart grid platforms.28 These cybersecurity vulnerabilities are emerging amid escalating geopolitical tensions and documented cyber intrusions by state-linked actors, including those affiliated with Russia, Iran, and China. A diminished federal presence hampers not just detection and mitigation, but also the ability to coordinate across jurisdictions in response to a breach. Without cohesive governance from agencies like the DOE and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, America’s grid grows more fragmented and less prepared for coordinated attacks or natural disasters.

Critics of the federal workforce model have argued that state governments and private actors can fill the operational vacuum. However, this perspective neglects the integrative function federal agencies perform in coordinating across state boundaries and ensuring standardization in disaster response. For instance, interstate electricity transmission projects, particularly high-voltage direct current lines, require unified oversight to align environmental reviews, synchronize technical standards, and allocate costs.29 Additionally, many states simply lack the technical workforce, regulatory infrastructure, or financial resources to absorb the sudden departure of thousands of experienced federal workers. This is particularly evident in rural and tribal communities, such as those in Alaska and New Mexico, where energy permitting and mineral extraction are not just economic drivers but essential to public service delivery.30 New Mexico’s federal land offices, which oversee drilling on federal land, contributing over one-third of the state’s general fund, are experiencing permitting delays.31 More than 22 tribes and nonprofits from Alaska to the Midwest, having around $350 million in federal funding, were impacted by frozen infrastructure projects.32 Furthermore, the BLM office in Utah has lost over 55 employees, including engineers, park rangers, and geologists since early 2025 due to mass resignations, firings, and rescinded job offers under federal workforce reductions.33 This bureaucratic inertia jeopardizes everything from clean energy projects and transmission upgrades to environmental safeguards and Indigenous land rights.

From a macroeconomic lens, the federal government’s role in sustaining local energy economies cannot be overstated. According to recent findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, approximately 86% of U.S. jobs are in sectors vulnerable to disruptions from the energy transition, with carbon-intensive communities exhibiting disproportionately high employment vulnerability.34 The concept of an Employment Carbon Footprint reveals that even regions not traditionally associated with fossil fuel extraction, such as manufacturing-heavy counties in the Great Plains, may suffer job losses due to federal divestment from energy and environmental services.35 Workforce reductions at agencies like the DOE risk compounding these vulnerabilities, especially in communities already excluded from just transition protections under the IRA.

There is also a profound distributive justice dimension to this problem. According to the Center for American Progress, every congressional district in the U.S. employs over 3,000 federal workers, the vast majority of whom are embedded within their local economies.36 These jobs support families, fund schools through income taxes, and sustain small businesses through consumption. Consequently, the dismissal of federal employees involved in grid oversight, regulatory review, and environmental enforcement has triggered economic contractions in local economies, particularly in rural regions. Moreover, the loss of institutional knowledge, particularly among senior civil servants and specialized engineers, cannot be easily or quickly replaced.

The erosion of institutional capacity in the energy sector compromises not only the domestic resilience but also the U.S. geopolitical credibility in advancing clean energy leadership. This institutional degradation risks impeding innovation in renewable integration and diminishing U.S. strategic competitiveness vis-à-vis global leaders, such as China and the European Union, in clean energy deployment and export capacity. Furthermore, a degraded federal apparatus limits America’s ability to respond effectively to climate-related disasters, such as wildfires, heatwaves, or hurricanes that increasingly threaten energy infrastructure in regions like the Gulf Coast and the Southwest.

Impact on Clean Energy Initiatives

The scale and speed of federal workforce reductions enacted in early 2025 under the “Workforce Optimization Initiative” have significantly impaired the operational capacity of several critical U.S. agencies, with particularly acute effects on the Loan Programs Office (LPO).37 Although publicly justified as efforts to streamline bureaucracy and limit regulatory capture, the reductions have materially constrained the federal government’s capacity to administer and implement clean energy. At the center of the disruption is the erosion of institutional oversight, particularly in the financing, administration, and monitoring of renewable energy projects that constitute a core component of the nation’s long-term strategy for energy independence and economic resilience.38

The LPO has historically played a pivotal role in catalyzing clean energy innovation, having facilitated over $35 billion in financing for projects across the solar, wind, nuclear, and hydrogen sectors.39 This core mandate has been structurally weakened, diminishing the LPO’s ability to evaluate proposals, manage disbursements, and conduct performance reviews across clean energy portfolios. Layoffs implemented in February 2025 reportedly resulted in the termination of approximately 45 employees from the LPO, an agency already operating with limited staff capacity.40 The effects of these reductions have been both immediate and structurally consequential, delaying the disbursement of IRA and IIJA funds and weakening the federal apparatus essential to maintaining the energy infrastructure. These delays disrupt the capital deployment timeline for renewable projects, disproportionately affecting rural and underserved regions where private-sector financing is contingent on federal loan guarantees. In parallel, the diminished capacity for program monitoring and oversight raises the risk of financial mismanagement, cost overruns, and inadequate compliance enforcement, thereby weakening public trust and policy effectiveness.41

Effective clean energy transitions depend on stable federal coordination, particularly during foundational stages of infrastructure deployment, interagency governance, and regulatory oversight, functions now affected by workforce instability. The loss of federal institutional capacity impairs the coordination mechanisms, due diligence processes, and co-financing structures necessary for effective public-private collaboration in clean energy deployment. From the standpoint of liberal institutionalism, which emphasizes the necessity of transparent and stable governance mechanisms,42 this institutional attrition constitutes a significant barrier to coherent climate governance while undermining the state’s ability to align national energy planning with long-term economic modernization strategies.

The stated rationale for the reductions, outlined in the 26 February 2025 memorandum issued by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), was to eliminate non-statutory functions and prioritize the removal of positions not legally required.43 While the LPO is not a standalone statutory agency, its role is grounded in legislative mandates under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.44 Despite this, the LPO was not granted any exemptions under the new policy. The decision to target the agency as “non-essential” during funding lapses disregarded its strategic importance to national energy goals. As of mid-February 2025, approximately 1,000 probationary employees had been dismissed, more than 300 from the NNSA.45 Despite the partial reinstatement of staff in other DOE branches, more than 2,700 employees have applied for buyouts under the department’s deferred resignation program.46 These reductions coincided with the Department’s initial efforts to implement over $500 billion in clean energy investments authorized under the IRA.47 With limited personnel, the LPO now faces mounting bottlenecks in the approval and disbursement of funds for utility-scale solar farms, green hydrogen hubs, and advanced nuclear reactor projects. Prolonged project financing delays not only undermine investor confidence and emissions goals but also erode the strategic foundations of U.S. energy sovereignty and its credibility as a global leader in climate and energy diplomacy.

One such example is the DOE’s Hydrogen Hub program, designed to stimulate regional hydrogen economies. Due to staffing constraints at the LPO, project selection and fund disbursement have been delayed in key states such as Texas, Ohio, and Louisiana, regions where hydrogen infrastructure is critical to decarbonizing industrial sectors.48 Furthermore, the layoffs have significantly stalled review and approval processes within the DOE’s conditional loan portfolio, which includes over $200 billion in pending applications.49 Despite progress under the IRA, current projections indicate that the United States will fall 23% to 37% short of its 2030 emissions reduction target, undermining both national climate commitments and the credibility of its international leadership on climate action.50

The LPO’s role in de-risking early-stage clean energy technologies by providing critical financial guarantees that catalyze private sector investment has also been significantly weakened. With the dismissal of technical reviewers, legal experts, and environmental compliance officers, the agency is now less able to assess whether funded projects are meeting benchmarks for emissions reductions, economic development, and technological advancement. This institutional erosion is especially concerning given the historical lessons of prior clean energy cycles, where lack of oversight capacity, such as the Solyndra case, resulted in political backlash, diminished public trust, and weakened regulatory integrity.51 During the loan guarantee cycle under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2008-2012, high-profile project failures, most notably Solyndra, were attributed to insufficient due diligence.52 In response, the LPO instituted multiple layers of risk assessment and accountability mechanisms. These safeguards are now at risk of being dismantled, exposing both federal funds and taxpayer confidence to renewed uncertainty.

The potential consequences of diminished LPO capacity can also be illustrated by its past success stories. A prominent example is the LPO’s 2010 loan to Tesla Motors, which enabled the company to scale its electric vehicle production during a financially precarious period.53 This underscores how federal support for nascent technologies can yield transformative outcomes, a dynamic now threatened by the erosion of institutional capability. A further complication is the loss of institutional knowledge. Numerous reports confirm that the affected employees included mid-career specialists with extensive experience navigating the technical, legal, and regulatory complexities of the clean energy sector. The hiring constraints imposed by the January 2025 Presidential Memorandum, restricting recruitment to one position per four departures, have structurally impeded the agency’s ability to regenerate lost institutional capacity.54 President Donald Trump has extended the ongoing federal hiring freeze through mid-July, preventing agencies from filling vacant positions or establishing new roles for three months. 55

The broader policy implications extend beyond federal agencies. The National Governors Association has publicly raised concerns over the erosion of intergovernmental coordination frameworks, emphasizing the resultant delays in multi-level energy governance and implementation.56 Internationally, the workforce reductions may also impair the U.S. standing in global climate diplomacy. Whereas the previous administration had positioned green infrastructure as a cornerstone of foreign policy, the retrenchment under the current administration marks a strategic retrenchment that weakens the U.S. negotiating position at international climate forums and undermines its normative influence in multilateral climate finance structures. At forums such as COP29, the loss of federal momentum weakens the credibility of U.S. climate commitments and risks emboldening other major emitters to delay their own energy transitions. Undermining this model through domestic retrenchment compromises U.S. influence in shaping global finance norms and limits efforts to mobilize private capital for global decarbonization.

Critics, including energy policy experts, bipartisan stakeholders, and environmental NGOs, have argued that the decision to target the LPO was not merely a cost-saving measure but one rooted in ideological opposition to clean energy. This framing disregards the cross-partisan support historically enjoyed by clean energy programs, which are widely recognized for their contributions to national security, technological leadership, and economic growth. In response to growing legal challenges, multiple federal judges have issued rulings declaring aspects of the reduction-in-force (RIF) process unlawful, particularly in cases involving probationary employees.57 However, these decisions have not mandated full reinstatement of affected personnel, and future rounds of layoffs remain possible. Agency leaders now face legal uncertainty and mounting responsibilities without the staff fulfilling them. Congressional staff briefings obtained by the Congressional Research Service further suggest that applying RIF procedures to statutorily grounded agencies may have overstepped executive authority, raising legal and constitutional concerns regarding the balance between fiscal control and governance.58

Conclusion

The 2025 federal workforce reductions have revealed a profound misalignment between administrative efficiency initiatives and the structural imperatives of U.S. energy governance. While framed as a necessary response to fiscal constraints, the scale and concentration of these reductions in critical energy agencies have produced destabilizing effects across nuclear oversight, power grid reliability, and clean energy program implementation. The disruption to agencies such as the NNSA, the BPA and the LPO has not only weakened operational capacity but also affected the institutional continuity required to manage the evolving demands of energy security, infrastructure modernization, and climate resilience.

The consequences extend beyond administrative inefficiency. The reductions have delayed infrastructure projects, hampered emergency preparedness, introduced cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and undermined the disbursement of funding under the IRA and IIJA. The federal government’s reduced presence is particularly acute in rural, tribal, and economically vulnerable communities, where federal coordination plays a critical role in ensuring access to energy resources, permitting, and long-term investment planning. Additionally, the loss of specialized personnel has eroded institutional memory and technical capacity, further limiting the federal government’s ability to carry out legally mandated energy functions.

Considering the United States’ role in clean energy deployment and climate diplomacy, the erosion of federal institutional capacity poses strategic risks. The inability to meet domestic emissions targets weakens the credibility of international commitments and threatens to reduce the influence of the United States in shaping global climate governance frameworks. As the energy transition accelerates worldwide, the U.S. risks falling behind in technological competitiveness, regulatory innovation, and the global energy export market.

To restore resilience, the federal government must urgently reinvest in its energy workforce, uphold statutory obligations, and align budgetary decisions with national energy priorities. Stabilizing institutional capacity across agencies is essential to safeguarding national security, accelerating decarbonization, and preserving U.S. credibility on the international stage. Future policymaking must recognize that administrative streamlining, if disregarded from strategic imperatives, can undermine the very functions it seeks to optimize.

""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said.
Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.
Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs.
""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said.","PHOENIX — Candidate Daniel Hernandez says the next member of Congress needs to be someone who pays less attention to environmental concerns and more to the jobs that sometimes-controversial projects will create.

Whether that reflects who Democrats want to be their standard bearer in the special election this summer to replace ardent environmental advocate Raúl Grijalva remains to be seen, after voters elected Grijalva to 11 terms in the U.S. House. He died in March of complications from cancer treatments at age 77 while holding the Congressional District 7 seat.

""When people are struggling to make ends meet, they need someone who will stand up to make sure they have good wages, protections for their families, and make sure that they have a job to be able to go to,'' said Hernandez, a former state lawmaker, during a debate Tuesday hosted by KAET-TV, the Phoenix PBS affiliate.

He is one of five Democratic candidates running in the special July 15 primary, who all took part in the debate.

Whoever survives will face off on Sept. 23 against the winner of the Republican primary. But the Democratic nominee will start off with a huge advantage. The district has about 176,000 registered Democrats, compared with fewer than 93,000 Republicans. It stretches from Douglas through Nogales into parts of Pinal and Maricopa counties and west to Yuma.

Hernandez made it clear he supports projects such as the plan by South32 to extract critical minerals in the Patagonia Mountains; a massive copper mine planned by Hudbay in the Santa Rita Mountains; and a proposal to build a new Interstate 11, including a stretch that would run through environmentally sensitive portions of Pima County.

That brought him into sharp contrast with one of the other contenders: Adelita Grijalva, who is not only a former Pima County supervisor, but also Raúl's daughter. She made it clear she does not see the claimed benefits to Arizona from the projects. The profits from digging out the ore will be shipped elsewhere, she said.

""And what's left in the aftermath is an environmental destruction,'' Grijalva said. She specifically criticized the plans for a new copper mine at Oak Flat near Superior, a project that survived a challenge when the U.S. Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider concerns of the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others that the land is necessary for their ceremonies.

And if the message about what voters could expect wasn't crystal clear, Grijalva said she will follow in her father's footsteps.

""I am going to be another Grijalva,'' she said. ""I don't think you can be too progressive when you're on the right side of history.''

Hernandez found himself in the minority among the Democratic contenders on the issue of jobs versus environmental concerns.

Candidate Jose Malvido, whose father was a union organizer at Phelps Dodge in Ajo when miners went on strike in 1983, said much has been lost as environmental concerns were brushed aside in the name of economic development.

""I grew up in a copper mining town where sacred sites were reduced into a giant mine pit,'' Malvido said. ""It put food on the table, but at what cost?''

Candidate Patrick Harris, an inventor and former business owner, acknowledged that projects like new mines do create jobs. At the same time, he said, they destroy the environment.

But for him, the question is a bit different: Where do the profits go?

""Those are short-term jobs,'' Harris said. ""That profit is being siphoned out of the district. There are (other) good-paying jobs that can be brought into the district.''

And candidate Deja Foxx said that from her perspective — she is 25 — not enough has been done to protect the environment that should have been preserved for her generation.

""Every year we see summers get hotter here in Arizona, get longer because of the inaction of older generations,'' she said.

""Climate change is not theoretical to my generation,'' Foxx continued. ""We will have to live through your plans for 2050 and beyond.''

But Grijalva did find herself on the defensive on another issue: taxes.

The contenders each were asked about the wisdom of Republicans in Washington who say that reducing taxes is good for the economy and should also be considered by Democrats, who have found themselves losing ground politically.

Hernandez responded that the difference is Democrats believe in cutting taxes for working-class families. Or ""most Democrats,"" he said.

""The reality is people like Adelita tried to raise taxes just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Tucson,'' Hernandez said, referring to a plan on the ballot to increase the sales tax by half a cent. ""When we are in the height of inflation and people are hurting, the height of being out of touch was trying to raise people's taxes.''

It failed by a margin of more than 2-1.

""What we have is a problem where out-of-touch politicians who spent almost two decades in office forget what it's like to be able to buy groceries at the grocery store, and know what it's like to have to put something back,'' Hernandez said.

Grijalva was unapologetic for backing the proposed levy, saying that not just Tucson but Pima County have had to absorb more costs to provide government services even as the Republican-controlled Legislature was imposing a flat 2.5% income tax. Local governments get a piece of that levy.

""So the needs continue but the revenue decreased,'' Grijalva said, saying that the cost of these local needs must be shared by federal and state governments.

""You're still trying to raise people's taxes in the height of inflation,'' Hernandez responded.

Foxx took her own shots at Grijalva, describing her fight years ago with the Tucson Unified School District board, on which Grijalva served, over its sex education curriculum. Foxx said it had not been updated in decades, was medically inaccurate, and never mentioned things like consent.

Grijalva said afterwards that the board already had been looking at making changes when Foxx made her complaints, but could not do anything until state law was changed.

If there was a central theme to the debate — aside from the obligatory criticism by each contender of Republican President Donald Trump — it was the question of why Democrats recently fared poorly among voters. Foxx said part of that is due to Democrats who have failed to stand up and fight.

""We require activists,'' Foxx said.

""They don't know how to fight,'' Harris said of Democrats. ""They don't have a strategy.''

Malvido agreed that Democrats are not fighting back hard enough against Trump.

""We need to have the courage to really address issues and not worry about the big money people that also fund the Democratic campaigns,'' he said.

""A lot of Democrats, career politicians, all they really want to do is get elected,'' Malvido said. ""So they're not really going to address the issues and have the courage to fight in the way we need them to fight, especially now.''

Hernandez said the issue for voters goes beyond whether the Democrats are fighting hard enough.

""It's that we're not delivering results,'' he said.

""You elect people time and time again and yet they come back every two years and they say, 'We weren't able to do that because that other person was in charge, but elect us and we'll do it again next time,' '' Hernandez said. ""People are tired of empty promises.''

One position that did stand out was Harris' proposal for what he called ""capitated capitalism.''

In essence, it would cap individual wealth at $1 billion. Anyone whose assets exceeded that at the end of any year would have to spend the excess on things like investing in research.

All that spending, he said, would help stimulate the economy.

""I'm the only one with an economic plan to fund our shared priorities,'' Harris said.

The three Republicans hoping to clinch their own party's nomination in the July special election will debate at KAET on Thursday. They are Daniel Butierez, Jorge Rivas and Jimmy Rodriguez.

“Building these homes is an opportunity to support industries and jobs here at home, but it is far from Canada’s only growing economic opportunity.
Canada has trade agreements with 60% of the global economy, making us well positioned to lessen our reliance on U.S. markets.","“Today’s Throne Speech hit on a number of familiar points for this new government, but we believe a common theme has emerged underneath this new vision for Canada: that it is a time for change, not status quo thinking.

“Change means rethinking our trade relationships, investing in new and growing industries, building faster and more efficiently, and ensuring that affordability and sustainability are written into the DNA of all of these efforts from day one. It is clear, as mentioned in the Throne Speech, that Canada can and should action an industrial strategy that will both make us more globally competitive and combat climate change. These are not distinct but complementary objectives.

“Multiple studies, from the International Energy Agency to modelling done in Canada, find that household energy bills will shrink as we near net zero. Our research at Clean Energy Canada has similarly found that, already, switching to clean energy saves families money—even when you factor in upfront costs.

“It is also the case that building with low-carbon construction materials does not need to add cost to building, but it can seriously lower emissions. In both cases, what is required is foresight. And a recognition that we must not only build homes affordably—but homes that are affordable to live in month to month.

“Building these homes is an opportunity to support industries and jobs here at home, but it is far from Canada’s only growing economic opportunity. Canada has trade agreements with 60% of the global economy, making us well positioned to lessen our reliance on U.S. markets. And as recent Clean Energy Canada analysis shows, among our 10 largest non-U.S. trade partners, all of them have net-zero commitments and carbon pricing systems, and roughly half apply carbon border adjustments on imports and have domestic EV requirements reshaping their car markets.

“The potential for Canada’s critical minerals, innovative clean technologies, and low-carbon industrial products is huge, ongoing, and an opportunity whose future we can be certain of.

Entering its third model year, the EV9 remains largely consistent with its original form but introduces a slate of meaningful refinements aimed at elevating both style and performance.

The headline addition is the new Nightfall Edition, an appearance-focused package now available on the Land AWD trim. With a commanding aesthetic defined by exclusive 20-inch gloss black alloy wheels, darkened Kia badging, and high-gloss black exterior elements, the Nightfall Edition introduces a fresh visual edge to the EV9’s sophisticated design. Inside, drivers will find distinctive seat stitching, bespoke interior trim, and subtle yet impactful design flourishes that separate it from other trims. It is available in both 6- and 7-passenger configurations, offering flexibility for families without additional cost.

Kia’s pricing for the 2026 EV9 lineup is as follows (excluding the $1,495 destination fee):

EV9 Light Standard Range – $54,900

EV9 Light Long Range – $57,900

EV9 Wind – $63,900

EV9 Land – $68,900

EV9 GT-Line – $71,900

A Sharpened Identity, A Longer Road Ahead

Beyond the Nightfall Edition, Kia’s 2026 EV9 lineup benefits from increased electric driving range on select trims. The Light Long Range model now offers an estimated 305 miles of range (Kia estimate), giving it the longest range in the lineup. The Wind and Land trims are now expected to achieve approximately 283 miles, while the sportier GT-Line is rated at an estimated 280 miles on a full charge. While these numbers remain manufacturer estimates and are subject to variation based on driving conditions, they reflect Kia’s continued refinement of battery and software efficiency.

Also new across all all-wheel drive variants is the addition of a Terrain Mode system—replacing the outgoing 4WD configuration—which enables driver-selectable modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand, enhancing off-road capability and traction across diverse terrain.

The EV9 retains its foundation as a modular, rear-biased electric platform (E-GMP) vehicle, supporting ultra-fast DC fast charging thanks to its 800-volt architecture. According to Kia, the EV9 can recoup up to 155 miles of range in approximately 15 minutes under optimal charging conditions. The long-range trims feature a 99.8 kWh battery, while the base Standard Range trim is equipped with a smaller 76.1 kWh pack.

Subtle Refinements in Color and Character

A refreshed exterior color palette brings a new sense of visual depth to the 2026 model year. The GT-Line now offers two new dual-tone colorways: Glacial White Pearl and Wolf Gray, each paired with a contrasting Ebony Black roof. The Nightfall Edition introduces a rich new exterior finish dubbed Roadrider Brown, alongside its exclusive interior detailing. These refinements add nuance to a vehicle already recognized for its bold silhouette and tech-forward design.

Inside the Cabin: Technology Meets Comfort

The EV9’s cabin remains one of the most spacious and advanced in the segment. A sweeping panoramic display integrates a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, and a dedicated 5.0-inch climate control panel. Kia’s latest Connected Car Navigation Cockpit (ccNC) system powers the user experience, now featuring over-the-air update capability and support for a growing suite of digital services.

Advanced driver-assist systems remain standard across most trims, including Highway Driving Assist 2, Blind-Spot View Monitor, and Remote Smart Parking Assist 2, depending on configuration. The interior also offers tri-zone climate control, available premium relaxation seats with leg rests, and multiple USB-C charging ports in all three rows.

A Sustainable Brand in an Evolving Market

Kia continues to solidify its position among the most sustainability-conscious automakers. The EV9’s design incorporates recycled and bio-based materials throughout the cabin, and several trims—including the EV9 and the EV6—are assembled in the United States using both domestic and global components.

All pricing figures exclude taxes, licensing, and dealer fees. Estimated electric ranges are preliminary and not EPA-certified. Vehicle availability may vary by market. Always consult a retailer for the latest information.

As of May 2025, the Kia EV9 is eligible for the full $7,500 federal EV tax credit starting with the 2026 model year.

The eligibility for the 2026 EV9 is due to Kia’s production of this model in Georgia, meeting the North American assembly requirement. Additionally, the 2026 EV9 complies with battery component and critical mineral sourcing criteria necessary for the tax credit. However, early production units intended for fleet allocation and the GT trim, which is built in South Korea, are exceptions and do not qualify for the credit.

For the 2025 model year, the EV9 does not meet the federal tax credit requirements, even if assembled in the U.S., due to non-compliance with battery sourcing rules.

It’s important to note that the federal EV tax credit program is subject to potential legislative changes. A bill introduced by the House Ways and Means Committee proposes to eliminate key EV tax credits by the end of 2026, which could affect future eligibility.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-28 06:02:50.656165

On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.
While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports.
This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks and reports electricity generation in the country through different methods, leading to data that may not always match. EIA publishes electricity net generation data from two main perspectives. One is a detailed monthly summary of every power plant connected to the grid in the United States that has at least 1 megawatt (MW) of nameplate capacity. This information is shared in the Electric Power Monthly, Electric Power Annual, and related data files. The second is hourly net generation data reported by local and regional balancing authorities, specifically for the Lower 48 states, which is available in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor.

These two types of data reports often show different results because they do not reflect the same sets of generating units. As a result, if someone adds up the hourly generation data over a month or a year from the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, the total will not match the figures reported in the Electric Power Monthly or Electric Power Annual. This is mainly because the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor only includes generating units that are visible or metered by balancing authorities. A balancing authority is responsible for managing the balance of electricity supply and demand in a specific region. These authorities can include large organizations like CAISO in California or the Southwest Power Pool, as well as smaller local entities.

However, balancing authorities usually do not track generation from distributed energy systems such as rooftop solar panels or from certain small-scale units. As a result, those distributed sources often do not appear in the hourly data. On the other hand, the Electric Power Monthly and Electric Power Annual provide a more complete picture of U.S. electricity generation since they include all grid-connected power plants of 1 MW or larger capacity.

To help users understand what is included in each set of data, EIA has published lists of electric generators. The Electric Power Monthly and Annual datasets have long included a list of the generators they track. Recently, EIA also published a new list for the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, which only includes generators that are metered by balancing authorities based on responses to a new survey launched last year.

While the Electric Power Monthly and Annual give a fuller view of generation inside the United States, the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor can sometimes include generation not covered in the other reports. For instance, CAISO includes in its reports the generation from four power plants located in Mexico because it meters those plants. This electricity appears in the Hourly Electric Grid Monitor, but since those plants are outside the U.S., their generation is not included in the Electric Power Monthly or Annual reports.

Despite these differences, analysts can still reconcile the two sets of data by using the EIA plant codes and generator IDs. These identifiers appear across multiple EIA datasets, including the Annual Electric Generator Report and Power Plant Operations Report, allowing researchers to trace and compare generation details at the individual plant level.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-918986.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 04:01:59.741720

A new fuel cell could enable electric airplanes that produce zero carbon emissions, according to a study.

Scientists say the devices could pack three times as much energy per pound as today’s best EV batteries - offering a lightweight option for powering planes, lorries or ships.

Batteries are currently nearing their limits in terms of how much power they can store for a given weight.

Researchers explained that it is a serious problem for energy innovation and the search for new ways to power airplanes, trains and ships.

Now, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have come up with a solution that could help electrify transportation systems.

Instead of a battery, the new concept is a kind of fuel cell - which is similar to a battery but can be quickly refuelled rather than recharged.

In the new system, the fuel is liquid sodium metal - an inexpensive and widely available commodity.

The other side of the cell is just ordinary air, which serves as a source of oxygen atoms.

In between, a layer of solid ceramic material serves as the electrolyte, allowing sodium ions to pass freely through, and a porous air-facing electrode helps the sodium to chemically react with oxygen and produce electricity.

The research team showed in a series of experiments with a prototype device that the cell could carry more than three times as much energy per unit of weight as the lithium-ion batteries used in virtually all electric vehicles today.

Professor Yet-Ming Chiang said, “We expect people to think that this is a totally crazy idea.

""If they didn’t, I’d be a bit disappointed because if people don’t think something is totally crazy at first, it probably isn’t going to be that revolutionary.”

He says the technology does appear to have the potential to be quite revolutionary, particularly for aviation, where weight is especially crucial.

The researchers believe such an improvement in energy density could be the breakthrough that finally makes electrically powered flight practical at a significant scale.

Chiang said: “The threshold that you really need for realistic electric aviation is about 1,000 watt-hours per kilogram.

""Today’s electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries top out at about 300 watt-hours per kilogram — nowhere near what’s needed.""

Even at 1,000 watt-hours per kilo, he says, that wouldn’t be enough to enable transcontinental or trans-Atlantic flights.

That’s still beyond reach for any known battery chemistry, but Chiang says that getting to 1,000 watts per kilo would be an enabling technology for regional electric aviation, which accounts for about 80% of domestic flights and 30% of the emissions from aviation.

The technology could be an enabler for other sectors as well - including marine and rail transportation, according to the study published in the journal Joule.

Chiang said: “They all require very high energy density, and they all require low cost.

“And that’s what attracted us to sodium metal.

“People have been aware of the energy density you could get with metal-air batteries for a very long time, and it’s been hugely attractive, but it’s just never been realized in practice.""

He said tests using an air stream with a carefully controlled humidity level produced a level of nearly 1,700 watt-hours per kilo at the level of an individual “stack” - which would translate to over 1,000 watt-hours at the full system level.

The researchers envision that to use this system in an aircraft, fuel packs containing stacks of cells, like racks of food trays in a cafeteria, would be inserted into the fuel cells.

The sodium metal inside the packs gets chemically transformed as it provides the power.

A stream of its chemical by-product is given off, and in the case of aircraft, it would be emitted out the back, not unlike the exhaust from a jet engine.

However, there would be no carbon dioxide emissions.

Instead, the emissions, consisting of sodium oxide, would actually soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The researchers say the compound would quickly combine with moisture in the air to make sodium hydroxide - a material commonly used as a drain cleaner - which readily combines with carbon dioxide to form a solid material, sodium carbonate, which in turn forms sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda.

Chiang added: “There’s this natural cascade of reactions that happens when you start with sodium metal.

“It’s all spontaneous. We don’t have to do anything to make it happen, we just have to fly the airplane.”

He said that, as an added benefit, if the final product, the sodium bicarbonate, ends up in the ocean, it could help to de-acidify the water, countering another of the damaging effects of greenhouse gases.

Chiang also emphasized that the new fuel cell is ""inherently safer"" than many other batteries.

He explained that sodium metal is extremely reactive and must be well-protected.

As with lithium batteries, sodium can spontaneously ignite if exposed to moisture.

Chiang said: “Whenever you have a very high energy density battery, safety is always a concern, because if there’s a rupture of the membrane that separates the two reactants, you can have a runaway reaction.

""But in this fuel cell, one side is just air, which is dilute and limited.

""So you don’t have two concentrated reactants right next to each other. If you’re pushing for really, really high energy density, you’d rather have a fuel cell than a battery for safety reasons.”

While the device so far exists only as a small, single-cell prototype, Chiang says the system should be ""quite straightforward"" to scale up to practical sizes for commercialization.

Members of the research team have already formed a company, Propel Aero, to develop the technology.

The system they envisage would use a refillable cartridge, which would be filled with liquid sodium metal and sealed.

When it’s depleted, it would be returned to a refilling station and loaded with fresh sodium.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hazard-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/5a/55ae4bf6-97c2-5c91-9c47-c564b52ccb92/6835e8d46be98.image.png?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-28 12:28:48.261295

According to our Manufacturing Sector Trends report, one third (34 per cent) of manufacturers already believe their organisation will invest in ‘green’ or ‘clean’ technology. For some, this will look like securing funding for onsite generation; for others it will involve entering a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a long-term contract to draw power from a renewable energy generator.

Skyrocketing energy bills, government tax cuts for green investment and the moral imperative are just some of the factors pushing manufacturers towards finding cheaper, clean power sources. However, another pressing reason to prioritise clean energy is improving your employer brand: the way you are perceived as an employer, and therefore your ability to attract and retain talent. With the modern workforce increasingly demonstrating concern about environmental issues, join the dots between sustainability and your skills strategy.

Passion for sustainability

As the climate crisis dominates the news cycle, workers are beginning to choose and reject jobs based on environmental concerns. 37% of UK working adults say they would avoid working for a company with poor green credentials, and in the younger generations this is only set to continue, with one-third of young people rejecting job offers based on businesses’ sustainability stances. Attracting Gen Z and Alpha to manufacturing requires cultural evolution, as we have already explored in a previous blog, and investing in clean energy is one way to make your organisation more attractive to the next wave of talent. Some companies have already fallen victim to employee action, with Shell workers addressing their CEO publicly to express deep concern about a lack of investment in renewables. Leaders underestimate their workforce’s passion for sustainability at their own risk.

In a sector faced with a significant skills shortage, failing to invest in clean energy sources could result in your business losing out on top talent to greener competitors. The Royal Mint, for example, launched its own green energy centre in July 2023, to power its 38-acre manufacturing site, and builds sustainability clearly into its employer messaging, with sustainability strategy falling under its Great Place to Work branding. To cater to an eco-conscious jobs market, manufacturers must both work towards green goals and communicate them effectively.

Authentic change

However, a commitment to sustainability should not be viewed as a quick win for employer branding. Instead, it must be a long-term cultural shift with myriad benefits, of which favourable positioning on the job market is just one. Those leading the move towards clean energy must avoid greenwashing, where companies make unsubstantiated claims about sustainability credentials or enact only surface level change, without real impact. Nearly 43% of employees believe their company is guilty of greenwashing, with this number increasing to 56% among 18- to 24-year-olds.

Whereas other sustainability initiatives, such as publishing aspirational targets or purchasing carbon offsets, could be seen as avoiding tackling the problem head-on, investing in clean energy sources is proof of a long-term commitment. Organisations can also avoid accusations of greenwashing by taking their team with them for the journey, with 9 in 10 global employees claiming that easier-to-understand sustainability reporting would help them build trust in their company’s achievements.

International Day of Clean Energy is the perfect opportunity to educate employees and prospective new team members about the investments in sustainable power sources that your company is already making, ensuring that your efforts regarding sustainability can be fully maximised for attraction and retention purposes.

Clean Air Task Force Executive Director Armond Cohen said:

“Nuclear energy has a potentially large role to play in meeting rising energy demand with emissions-free, reliable and scalable power – and the United States indeed has much to gain by advancing projects domestically and, through exports, globally. But it will take a suite of supportive policies that derisk the first wave of nuclear investments and incentivize private sector participation to scale promising new technologies.

While it is encouraging to see a focus on building a series of large reactors of existing designs and uprates, as well as smaller newer designs, the U.S. will struggle to deploy and build new projects at the scale necessary to tackle energy security and leadership in nuclear technology. In particular, the orders do not highlight or even call for policies to share the financial risk and provide revenue certainty for early large standardized ‘orderbook’ reactor deployment – essential elements for future deployment.

This gap is all the more troubling because they appeared in the same week the House voted to diminish crucial tax credits that reduce the costs of new plants by up to 40% and restrict the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is essential to finance the first wave of new plants and is called upon by one of the president’s executive orders to help deploy 10 GWs of new, large reactors. Congress must oppose these measures if the U.S. is to have any hope of achieving the goal set by the executive orders to quadruple American nuclear energy capacity and safely export American advanced nuclear energy technologies worldwide.

CATF shares the administration’s goal of unlocking advanced nuclear energy and will continue to advocate for strong government leadership to deliver safe, clean, and reliable nuclear energy at an affordable cost. But to accomplish this, a bolder and more cohesive strategy will be required.”

Environmental advocates worry Illinois may delay the retirement of coal plants to help meet its rising electricity demand, largely caused by new data centers and AI. Meanwhile, renewable energy projects in Illinois are in limbo as they wait to get permission from the state’s grid operators PJM and MISO. The act hopes to address these issues, while helping the state meet its renewable energy targets.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act is the successor to the 2021 Clean and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), which expanded the Illinois Solar for All program from $30 million to $70 million per year, unlocking the benefits of affordable renewable energy for families across the state. CEJA also set a target to get Illinois to 40% renewable energy by 2030 and 50% renewable energy by 2040.

Solar Bill of Rights

The bill creates a Solar Bill of Rights, which aims to establish fair, transparent rules for solar energy across all utility territories within Illinois.

The Solar Bill of Rights requires incentives to be offered to low-income customers, non-profits and public facilities, either directly or through developers, to increase these groups’ participation in community solar.

The bill says the program’s goal is to allocate a minimum of 25% of the program’s incentives to community solar projects in environmental justice communities. It directs the agency to reserve a portion of the program for projects that promote “energy sovereignty” through ownership of projects by low-income households, not-for-profit organizations providing services to low-income households, affordable housing owners, or community-based limited liability companies providing services to low-income households.

The bill also requires the Illinois Power Agency to direct up to 5% of the funds available under the Illinois Solar for All program to community-based groups and other qualifying organizations to assist in community-driven education efforts, such as general energy education and job training program outreach efforts. The Solar Bill of Rights also puts a cap on high insurance requirements for installing rooftop solar.

In Illinois, community solar projects are compensated at the same price that utilities pay to procure and deliver power to their end-use customers. By allowing distributed solar and storage to participate in existing wholesale markets, Illinois’ community solar program lowers costs for ratepayers by adding more options to an already competitive energy supply marketplace. This also enables a more efficient use of ratepayer funds to supplement distributed generation project revenues via capacity-based and renewable energy credit incentives.

Illinois introduced a community solar offering under the Illinois Shines program in 2019. In 2023, ComEd opened enrollment to its first community solar project. As of Q4 2024, Illinois was ranked fourth for its community solar operating capacity and fifth per capita, according to the Institute on Local Self Reliance. Nineteen states and D.C. allow community solar, although legislation is underway in some states that, if successful, would increase that number.

More information about Illinois Bill of Rights can be found in the bill beginning on page 293.

Illinois Storage for All

The act creates the Illinois Storage for All program, which requires the agency to direct up to 25% of the funds toward grants, rebates or incentives designed to encourage renewable energy storage paired with solar distributed renewable energy generation. Illinois Storage for All would be available to current and future participants of low-income customers, nonprofits and public facilities.

Illinois Storage for All would be designed to support community energy resilience, disaster preparedness and energy bill reductions, particularly for low-income and environmental justice communities.

More information about Illinois Storage for All can be found in the bill beginning on page 87.

Virtual power plant (VPP) program

According to Department of Energy estimates noted in the legislation, the United States could deploy 80 GW to 150 GW of VPPs by 2030 (a tripling of current levels) to support the rapid electrification of homes and vehicles, saving ratepayers $10 billion per year.

The legislation requires utilities with more than 300,000 customers to develop VPP programs through a standard offer, open-access tariff for distributed energy resources to provide system peak load reduction and other grid services.

More information about the VPP program’s provisions can be found in the bill beginning on page 505.

Time-of-use pricing

The bill establishes opt-in time-of-use rates to “reduce the need for ramping resources and increase the grid’s ability to cost-effectively integrate greater quantities of variable renewable energy and distributed energy resources.”

ComEd currently offers two time-of-use rate programs: Hourly Pricing, which fluctuates based on the actual market rate of electricity at any given hour, and Time-of-Day, which lets customers know a day in advance how much electricity will be during three different periods: off-peak, peak and super peak. For those that don’t require a lot of electricity consumption during peak demand periods, these programs can provide significant savings for participants, along with relief to the grid. For example, as a ComEd customer enrolled in its Hourly Pricing program, the author of this article has saved $290.34 since enrolling in the program 26 months ago.

(See also: Keeping electricity both reliable and affordable while meeting load demand)

At this time, it is unclear how the time-of-use pricing would differ from the programs already offered by ComEd. The Illinois Commerce Commission told pv magazine USA, “Presently, talks at the Capitol are ongoing and fluid. It would be premature and inappropriate for the ICC to comment on bill impacts on language not fully formed or filed as legislation.”

More information about the time-of-use pricing can be found in the bill beginning on page 499.

Data Centers

Recent analysis from Synapse Energy Economics projected that if the retirement of coal plants are delayed so that more data centers can be powered up, CO2 pollution in Northern Illinois will increase by at least 64%.

The bill directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid. The bill also directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to propose environmental standards for large data centers.

Additional measures

Among other provisions, the bill:

Works to improve infrastructure by increasing transmission and fixing interconnection issues to deploy renewable energy more quickly;

Upgrades resource adequacy studies under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act to examine multiple clean energy options and select the least-cost pathway toward meeting the state’s renewable energy goals while ensuring adequate resources and electric system reliability;

Requires “munis and coops” (electric providers other than ComEd and Ameren) to use industry best practices to forecast and plan for future electricity needs; and

Directs utilities to propose rules for new large-scale data centers to protect other electric consumers and ensure the facilities have plans to develop clean energy resources to reduce strain on the power grid.

The bill makes tweaks to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy Resource Fund and Illinois Solar for All program. For example, the bill would also direct the resource fund to also fund rebates, along with the purchasing of renewable energy credits currently in place.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/4405879284_2bd7ab8a78_o-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 02:00:47.383171

Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in your analysis of the upcoming legislative changes and other clean energy tax incentive matters.","On May 22, 2025, the House passed the legislation entitled “The One Big Beautiful Bill” (the “BBB”)1 that would, if enacted into law, severely restrict clean energy tax incentives. This client update addresses the BBB’s phase-outs, restrictions, and repeal of transferability with respect to certain clean energy tax credits enacted or extended under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). For our separate discussion of the provisions of the BBB that affect general business, international, and individual taxation, click here.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate under a process called reconciliation. While the reconciliation process requires only a simple majority of Senate members to approve the BBB, Senate Republicans are not yet aligned on the BBB and significant modifications are expected before it is in agreed form.

Clean Electricity Investment and Production Tax Credits (Sections 48E and 45Y)

Accelerated Termination

The BBB would terminate the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (the “ITC”) under Code Section 48E and the Clean Electricity Production Credit (the “PTC”) under Section 45Y for facilities that either —

begin construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB; or

are placed in service after December 31, 2028.2

Under current law, the ITC and PTC gradually phase out for facilities beginning construction after 2032 or, if later, the year in which the United States achieves certain greenhouse gas emissions targets. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed an accelerated phase-out of the credits, however, in a last-minute change before passage of the BBB, the phase-out was changed to complete termination by imposition of deadlines for beginning construction and placement in service. We expect the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC in the BBB to be a focal point for further negotiations when the BBB reaches the Senate.

The addition of an absolute deadline for placing a facility in service will mean that a facility that timely begins construction but encounters unexpected construction delays pushing its placement in service beyond the deadline will be exposed to complete loss of the credits that the facility’s developers anticipated. This risk of complete credit loss will make project financing extremely difficult if the BBB is enacted into law.

Restrictions on Certain Foreign Connections

The BBB imposes restrictions on the ability of entities with certain connections to a “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) to claim the ITC or PTC. These restrictions are sometimes referred to as “FEOC” rules, after an existing statute targeting “Foreign Entities of Concern” that partially inspired these restrictions.

The BBB creates several new defined terms for purposes of these restrictions:

A PFE is either of a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a foreign-influenced entity (“FIE”);

An SFE is an entity designated as a bad actor under the authority of a variety of existing statutes (including the FEOC rules) or a “foreign controlled entity” (“FCE”);

An FCE is (i) the government of a covered nation, (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs;

A “covered nation” is China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea;

An FIE is an entity that (i) may have a board member, executive officer or similar person appointed by, (ii) has a specified percentage of its debt or equity held by, or (iii) in the preceding year made more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to, one or more SFEs;

“Material assistance” from a PFE is any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral (as defined in Section 45X) that is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a PFE; any design of such property based on any copyright or patent held by a PFE; or any know-how or trade secret provided by a PFE. The definition excludes parts or materials that are (i) not uniquely designed or formulated for use in property that will generate credits under Sections 45Y, 48E, or 45X, and (ii) are not exclusively or predominantly produced by PFEs.

The restrictions imposed by the BBB include:

An SFE is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning after enactment of the BBB;

An FIE or an entity that in the current year makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to one or more PFEs is not eligible to claim the ITC or PTC in tax years beginning two years after enactment of the BBB;

For any facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025, the ITC and PTC is entirely disallowed if construction of the facility includes any “material assistance” from a PFE; and

An entity that claims the ITC during a tax year beginning two years after enactment of the BBB is subject to 100% recapture of such ITC if, during any of the 10 years following placement in service of the property generating the ITC, it makes more than a specified portion of its total payments of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items to PFEs.

The restriction on material assistance from a PFE will have no impact if the BBB is enacted by November 1, 2025 and includes the accelerated termination of the ITC and PTC. In such case, no facility that begins construction after December 31, 2025 (which would be 60 days after enactment) will be eligible for the ITC or PTC, let alone subject to the material assistance restriction. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, the material assistance restriction will be especially disruptive to ITC and PTC eligibility for any facility that sources unique parts or materials from China or any other covered nation.

No Transferability Restrictions

While the BBB proposes to restrict the transferability (sale) of most clean energy credits, making investment in the underlying clean energy projects less attractive, the BBB makes no changes to the transferability of the ITC and PTC under Section 6418. Earlier versions of the BBB had proposed a sunset of ITC and PTC transferability for any facility beginning construction more than two years after the date of enactment, but the BBB as passed by the House does not include any such sunset for these credits, since any such facility would not be eligible for the ITC or PTC under the accelerated termination. If the accelerated termination is removed in any future version of the BBB, it is possible that the transferability sunset will be reintroduced for the ITC and PTC.

Note Regarding Legacy ITC and Legacy PTC

The BBB makes no changes with respect to the production tax credit under Section 45 (the “Legacy PTC”) and impacts the investment tax credit under Section 48 (the “Legacy ITC”) only with respect to geothermal heat pump property. Accordingly, any wind, solar, or energy storage technology (among other technologies) that began construction for tax purposes on or before December 31, 2024 may be eligible for the Legacy ITC or Legacy PTC and in such case can avoid altogether the adverse tax consequences proposed under the BBB (including limitations on transferability).

Restrictions on Certain Leased Property Used at Residences (Such as Rooftop Solar)

The BBB disallows the ITC and PTC for certain solar and wind property (but not storage property) (i) of a type that qualifies for the Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D, (ii) that is leased or rented to a third party, and (iii) with respect to which the lessee would be eligible for a credit under Section 25D if the lessee owned the property. If enacted, this restriction may be disruptive to the residential rooftop solar industry, as residential rooftop systems are regularly leased to customers. However, since the BBB would repeal the Section 25D credit for property placed in service after 2025, it is not clear whether this provision would have any practical impact absent changes in the effective dates of the provisions.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z receives unique treatment as the only IRA tax credit to have its availability extended under the BBB. The BBB extends the availability of the credit for transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2031, from the current cutoff date of December 31, 2027. However, the BBB also limits the availability of the credit to sales of transportation fuel exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Additionally, the BBB modifies the determination of emissions rates for purposes of the credit by excluding any emissions attributed to indirect changes to land use and calling for additional Treasury guidance regarding transportation fuels derived from animal manure.

The BBB also makes changes to the Section 45Z credit consistent with changes to other tax credits. The BBB disallows the Section 45Z credit for tax years beginning after enactment for SFEs and for tax years beginning two years after enactment for FIEs. Finally, the BBB repeals transferability of the Section 45Z credit for fuel produced after December 31, 2027.

Other Credits

The BBB includes significant modifications to several other IRA credits:

Carbon Capture -- Section 45Q: The Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit under Section 45Q is largely unchanged by the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Transferability of the credit is repealed for credits derived from the capture of carbon using carbon capture equipment that begins construction more than two years after enactment.

Nuclear -- Section 45U: The Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit under Section 45U is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. Termination of the credit is accelerated by one year, with the credit unavailable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2031.

Hydrogen -- Section 45V: The Credit for Production of Clean Hydrogen under Section 45V applies only to facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026, instead of the current deadline of January 1, 2033. Current law also offers an ITC for hydrogen storage property. Any taxpayer claiming the ITC for hydrogen storage property would be subject to the same restrictions on the ITC described above, including accelerated termination of the ITC for any hydrogen storage property that begins construction more than 60 days after the enactment of the BBB or is placed in service after December 31, 2028, and FEOC-type restrictions on certain foreign connections.

Manufacturing -- Section 45X: The Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X is generally phased out for components sold after December 31, 2031, instead of the current cutoff of December 31, 2032. However, no credit is allowed with respect to wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027. The credit for the production of critical minerals, which does not phase out under current law, is also phased out after December 31, 2031 under the BBB. The credit is disallowed for SFEs for tax years beginning after enactment, and for FIEs for tax years beginning two years after enactment. The credit is also disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for any component that includes material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity or is produced subject to a licensing agreement with a PFE which has a value greater than $1,000,000. Additionally, the credit is disallowed for tax years beginning two years after enactment for taxpayers that make payments to PFEs of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, or similar items that are related to the production of eligible components, and which represent more than a specified portion of a taxpayer’s total payment of such items. Transferability of the credit is repealed for components sold after December 31, 2027.

Several other green energy tax credits are, subject to certain narrow exceptions, terminated for tax years after 2025 or for property acquired after December 31, 2025. These include:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit under Section 25C,

The Residential Clean Energy Credit under Section 25D,

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit under Section 45L,

The Credit for Previously Owned Clean Vehicles under Section 25E,

The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit under Section 30C,

The Clean Vehicle Credit under Section 30D, and

The Credit for Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles under Section 45W.

Exceptions exist for credits under Section 45L for homes that began construction before May 12, 2025, Section 45W for vehicles acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025, and Section 30D for vehicles placed in service during 2026 if certain criteria are met.

The BBB will face further negotiation and likely modifications in the Senate before being returned to the House and then sent to the President for approval, at which point it would be expected to become law.

Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison is part of a multi-state coalition of AGs suing the Trump administration over the move.","AILSA CHANG, HOST:

At the same time that the Trump administration is moving to reverse electric vehicle promises made by the Biden administration, some states, even those led by Democrats, might be doing some of the same as they face budget shortfalls. Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters went to see how that's playing out at a dealership in the Twin Cities area.

CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: Rob Powell walks through one of his Cornerstone Auto dealerships. He stops by the inventory desk and asks for the keys to an electric vehicle.

ROB POWELL: We don't have one, wow - not used or new, didn't expect that.

MASTERS: Powell says Cornerstone has around 500 new cars across the Twin Cities. Just seven of those are EVs. Now, that could mean EVs are especially popular. But to Powell...

POWELL: There's just not as many of them as there probably should be or used to be.

MASTERS: Every good public radio story starts with stepping inside a car and going for a ride, but we can't do that today.

POWELL: No.

MASTERS: So what should that tell me?

POWELL: I think it's partially through demand, through our ordering process.

MASTERS: And part, he says, it's about the number of cars manufacturers think they can sell in this market. And that number might soon tumble lower. Two years ago in Minnesota, lawmakers tried to encourage drivers to purchase electric vehicles by offering big rebates. This year, those rebates are gone, and in their place, a hike on the surcharges on those same cars.

CAROLYN BERNINGER: You know, we're coming off of Minnesota having its electric vehicle rebate program, which was very popular, but only funded for one year.

MASTERS: Carolyn Berninger is with Drive Electric Minnesota, a trade group looking to accelerate the adoption of EVs.

BERNINGER: And now we're kind of seeing the state go in the opposite direction.

MASTERS: That rebate program offered up to $2,500 for new EVs and $600 for purchases of used ones. But Berninger points out EV adoption in Minnesota is still very low. She's concerned customers won't want to go with an EV when they see that annual surcharge triple, from $75 to $200 starting next year.

BERNINGER: Hiking up fees, and particularly this $200 fee, would require electric vehicle owners to pay more in the electric vehicle fee than a lot of gas car owners pay through the gas tax.

MASTERS: Other states are also rolling EV incentives back. Colorado reduced its tax credit from $5,000 to 3,500. At the federal level, Congress voted to undo federal waivers for California. The White House wants to cancel funding for a $5 billion EV charging station grant program. Minnesota's Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison is part of a multi-state coalition of AGs suing the Trump administration over the move.

KEITH ELLISON: The thing that's happening in the legislature I disagree with, but I can't claim it's unconstitutional. What the president is doing is unconstitutional and illegal, and that's why we're suing him for it.

MASTERS: At the Capitol in St. Paul, Democratic governor and former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz seems ready to pass the surcharge bill.

TIM WALZ: The gas tax is what - how we fund our roads. And the argument is is that EVs use our roads. They add to the maintenance of it. They should pay their fair share on that. And I think most EV owners agree with that.

MASTERS: The House here is tied between Republicans and Democrats this year. Democratic Representative Larry Kraft says he's disappointed lawmakers can't do more to curb climate change.

LARRY KRAFT: The climate doesn't give us a pause. The climate doesn't care about our politics. So the fact that we weren't able to make more progress, yes, I'm very disappointed, and I have renewed emphasis to work on it.

MASTERS: So at the same time that the Trump administration continues to disincentivize EV adoption, lawmakers, even Democrats, may charge Minnesotans a little more to keep their EV registrations up to date. For NPR News, I'm Clay Masters in St. Paul.

EPA analysis shows that planned climate policies and measures, if fully implemented, could deliver up to 23 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 2018, down from the 29 per cent reduction projected last year.
All methodologies are detailed in Ireland’s National Inventory Document 2025 and summarised in Ireland's Final Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 report.
EU Targets EU greenhouse gas emission targets and reduction obligations for Ireland are split into two broad categories.
The following are key underlying data that underpin this year’s greenhouse gas emissions projections: Energy-related emissions projections are based on updated energy projections provided to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in Q1 2025.","Ireland is projected to achieve a reduction of up to 23 per cent in total greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to a National target of 51 per cent.

To achieve a reductionof 23 per cent would require full implementation of a wide range of policies and plans across all sectors and for these to deliver the anticipated carbon savings.

The first carbon budget and second carbon budget are projected to be exceeded with almost all sectors on a trajectory to exceed their national sectoral emissions ceilings for 2030.

Ireland will not meet its EU Effort Sharing Regulation target of 42 per cent reduction by 2030, instead a maximum reduction of 22% is projected.

Total emissions from the Land Sector are projected to increase by up to 95% and Ireland is unlikely to meet our European commitments in this area.

28th May 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its greenhouse gas emissions projections for the period 2024-2055.

EPA analysis shows that planned climate policies and measures, if fully implemented, could deliver up to 23 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 2018, down from the 29 per cent reduction projected last year. This widening gap to the emissions reduction target of 51 per cent in Ireland’s Climate Act is driven by updated information provided by Governmental bodies.

The first Carbon Budget (2021-2025) of 295 Mt CO2eq is now projected to be exceeded by between 8 to 12 Mt CO2eq. The second budget is now projected to be exceeded by a significant margin of 77 to 114 Mt CO2eq, including carryover from the first Carbon Budget.

Transport, Industry and the Buildings (Residential) sectors are projected to be the furthest from their sectoral emission ceilings in 2030, with emission reductions of up to 21%, 12% and 22% respectively. Agriculture emissions are projected to reduce by up to 16%. A direct comparison of the Agriculture sector against its Sectoral Emission Ceiling is no longer viable due to the impact of updated science underpinning the estimated agriculture greenhouse gas emissions.

Laura Burke, Director General, EPA said:

“The EPA’s projections show that full delivery of all climate action plans and policies could deliver a 23 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Although emissions trends are going in the right direction, the gaps to our European and National emission reduction targets are now projected to be larger than last year. This highlights the economy-wide effort needed to decarbonise our society and the focus must shift from policy aspiration to practical implementation.”

Ms Burke added:

“As we get closer to 2030 and receive more information on the impact of agreed policies and measures, it is concerning to see projected reductions and lack of progress in the delivery of actions to reduce emissions including in the electrification of our transport sector and the expansion of renewable electricity powering our homes and businesses and the implementation of carbon reduction measures in agriculture. Momentum is building for Ireland's low carbon society, but we need to accelerate it and scale up the transition.”

Agriculture

Depending on the level of implementation of measures outlined in Climate Action Plans, AgClimatise and Teagasc MACC, total emissions from the Agriculture sector will range from a 1 per cent increase to a 16 per cent decrease over the period of 2018 to 2030. Savings are projected from a variety of measures including limits on nitrogen fertiliser usage, switching to different fertilisers and bovine feed additives.

Transport

Emissions from the sector are projected to reduce up to 21 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 if the measures set out in plans and policies are implemented. These include over 640,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030, increased biofuel blend rates and measures to support more sustainable transport. Road freight is projected to be the biggest source of road transport greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Residential Emissions

Emissions from the sector arise from fuel combustion for domestic space and hot water heating. These are projected to decrease by up to 22 per cent by 2030. Emission reduction measures in this sector include 571,000 domestic heat pumps are projected to be installed by 2030.

Industry

Fuel combustion in manufacturing is the primary source of emissions in this sector; process emissions from mineral, chemical, and metal industries contribute the next largest portion. Emissions from this sector are projected to reduce by 12 per cent over the period 2018 to 2030 with full implementation of measures including the accelerated uptake of carbon-neutral heating technologies for low and high temperature heating, and increased use of biomethane.

Energy

Driven by a reduction in fossil fuel usage and increased net importation of electricity from interconnectors, there was a marked drop of over 21 per cent in emissions from electricity generation between 2022 and 2023. In combination with planned increases in renewable energy generation from wind and solar, energy sector emissions are projected to reduce by up to 68 per cent (over the period 2018 to 2030) and are projected to achieve over 68 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2030.

Land use

Emissions from this sector are projected to increase between 39 per cent to 95 per cent over the period of 2018 to 2030 as our forestry reaches harvesting age and changes from a carbon sink to a carbon source. Planned policies and measures for the sector, such as increased afforestation, water table management on agricultural organic soils and peatland rehabilitation are projected to reduce the extent of the emissions increase.

Commenting, Mary Frances Rochford, Programme Manager said:

“The Agriculture sector has made some progress in reducing emissions through the successful rollout of actions on nitrogen fertilisers, low emission spreading technologies and national liming programmes. In parallel, in line with new research, the EPA refined the information underpinning the agricultural figures which has led to a reduction in the overall agriculture emission estimates. It is imperative that this new research and information is incorporated into updated carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings to ensure that they reflect latest science, data and knowledge on greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland and alignment with the national reduction target for the sector of 25%.”

For further detail on these figures, see the EPA report Greenhouse Gas Emission Projections 2024 to 2055 and EPA Greenhouse Gas web resource on the EPA website.

Notes to Editor

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the national body with responsibility to develop, prepare and publish projections of greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland. The EPA produces national greenhouse gas emission projections on an annual basis. These projections are compiled in accordance with, and to meet, EU reporting obligations. At a national level this report informs policy and monitors and reports Ireland’s climate action performance to Government under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act (Amendment) 2021 and to the public as outlined in Climate Action Plans.

It is an obligation under the Climate Act that, where the total greenhouse gas emissions for a preceding budget period exceed the carbon budget for that period, the excess greenhouse gas emissions from the preceding budget period is carried forward to the next period. The carbon budget for the next period is then decreased by the amount carried forward.

The EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Emission projection is an estimate of what emission levels are likely to be in the future. They are based on key assumptions such as economic growth, fuel prices and Government policy.

This is the fourth set of projections prepared following the enactment of the Climate Act and the 51 per cent target contained therein. The policies and measures contained in the Climate Action Plan 2024 and previous Plans are included in the projections with a number of exceptions including:

Onshore wind of 7.1 GW, offshore wind of 2.7 GW and 6.3 GW of solar PV was required to achieve 68 per cent share of renewable electricity by 2030. This compares with 9 GW onshore wind, 5 GW offshore wind and 8 GW of solar PV stated for the 80 per cent target in the Climate Action Plan 2024;

The full CAP 2024 ambition of 945,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2030 is not modelled. Instead, a total of 640,750 electric vehicles is modelled in the WAM scenario, based on updated information from the Department of Transport;

The full 2 GW target for new flexible gas fired generation is not modelled. However, Eirgrid data was used to produce an adjusted trajectory yielding new gas fired generation of 1.4 GW by 2030;

Climate Action Plan 2023 introduced an Avoid/Shift policy with multiple measures to achieve an abatement of 2.09 Mt CO2 eq by 2030 in transport relative to 2018, which was applied again in the Climate Action Plan 2024. One of these modelled measures relating to price increases in petrol and diesel out to 2030 has no supporting policy and is not modelled;

Measures aimed at achieving emissions savings from a decrease in embodied carbon in construction materials (1.0 Mt CO2 abatement by 2030) aren’t currently modelled;

Emissions reductions associated with Carbon Capture and Storage are not currently modelled;

The Climate Action Plan 2024 target of a 70-75 per cent share in renewable heat in industry is not specifically modelled. Instead, current Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) grant rates are modelled to 2055;

Diversification measures in Agriculture with annual savings by 2030 of 1.5 Mt CO2 eq is not currently modelled;

Unallocated savings of 5.25 Mt CO2 eq per annum 2026-2030 (or 26.25 Mt CO2 eq cumulatively by 2030) as stated in the Climate Action Plan 2024 are not modelled.

New scientific research has led to a reduction in emissions from the Agriculture sector in the 1990 to 2023 national greenhouse gas inventory upon which these projections are based. Estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions associated with non-dairy cattle and sheep categories have been updated.

With respect to non-dairy cattle, models now include additional disaggregation of production systems within the herd and linked to detailed output from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) databases. This approach allows for more detailed estimates of a larger number of production system cohorts from birth to slaughter, revised live weight and average daily weight gain incorporated at more refined levels, and tracks the changes in slaughter age.

With respect to sheep, a Tier 2 approach to estimating emissions from the national flock developed by Teagasc has been implemented. In comparison to the previous approach, which was based on default IPCC Guideline assumptions, country specific parameters associated with sheep production in Ireland are used including parameters such as feed characteristics, fecundity, lambing patterns, mortality, liveweights and liveweight gains.

All methodologies are detailed in Ireland’s National Inventory Document 2025 and summarised in Ireland's Final Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1990-2023 report.

EU Targets

EU greenhouse gas emission targets and reduction obligations for Ireland are split into two broad categories. The first category covers the large energy and power (i.e. energy intensive) industry which are controlled under the EU Emissions Trading System. The second category deals with the non- EU Emissions Trading System sectors such as agriculture, transport, residential, commercial, waste and non-energy intensive industry.

The Environmental Protection Agency produces greenhouse gas emissions projections on an annual basis for all sectors of the economy in collaboration with relevant State and other bodies. The following are key underlying data that underpin this year’s greenhouse gas emissions projections:

Energy-related emissions projections are based on updated energy projections provided to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in Q1 2025.

The energy projections were prepared in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute who produced energy demand projections using the I3E model (Ireland Environment, Energy and Economy model).

Agriculture emissions projections are based on data from Teagasc which was provided to the Environmental Protection Agency in February 2025.

On 14th May 2018, the European Council adopted a regulation (EU 2018/842 – the Effort Sharing Regulation) on greenhouse gas emission reductions. The regulation sets out binding emission reduction targets for member states in sectors falling outside the scope of the EU emissions trading system for the period 2021-2030. In April 2023 the Effort Sharing Regulation was amended (EU 2023/857) and Ireland’s new 2030 target under the Effort Sharing Regulation is to limit its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 42 per cent by 2030.

Annual emission limits out to 2025 for the 42 per cent reduction were set by the EU in 2023, with limits out to 2030 to be set later in 2025. Under the Effort Sharing Regulation two flexibilities may be utilised to allow for a fair and cost-efficient achievement of the target. These flexibilities are the use of EU Emissions Trading System allowances and credit from action undertaken in the Land use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector.

Flexibilities under the Effort Sharing Regulation include the allowance by eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions with EU ETS allowances which would normally have been auctioned. EU-wide, this cannot be more than a combined total of 100 million tonnes CO2 over the period 2021-2030. The ETS flexibility allows Ireland to transfer emissions of up to 4 per cent of 2005 levels per annum, or 19.1 Mt CO2 eq from the non-ETS to ETS sector, reducing the mitigation requirement in the non-ETS sector while cancelling the corresponding ETS allowances.

Also, to stimulate additional action in the land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, Member States can use up to a combined (EU-wide) total of 262 million credits over the entire period 2021-2030 to comply with their national targets. The LULUCF flexibility allows for Ireland to account for greenhouse gas removals of up to 26.8 Mt CO2 eq over two compliance periods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030.

Hawaii’s move is also being closely watched by other states considering similar taxes to fight climate-related damage.

Hawaii’s new climate tax targets tourists

Why you should care:

Hawaii Gov. Josh Green on Tuesday signed legislation that increases the state’s tax on short-term accommodations like hotel rooms and vacation rentals, aiming to raise funds for climate resilience and wildfire prevention.

The new law will boost the daily room rate tax by 0.75%, bringing the total state tax to 11%. That doesn’t include additional state and county taxes, which will push the total levy on accommodations close to 19%—among the highest in the U.S.

The law also introduces a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills starting in July 2026. That tax will be prorated based on how many days a ship is docked in Hawaii.

How the money will be used

What they're saying:

Officials say the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually, which will go toward:

Replenishing eroding beaches like Waikiki

Clearing invasive grasses that increase wildfire risk

Installing hurricane clips to help secure rooftops

Building firebreaks to stop wildfires

Supporting a new state fire marshal role

Green emphasized that the state must take bold steps after the devastating 2023 Lahaina wildfire that killed 102 people and nearly leveled the historic town.

""This is about protecting Hawaii and creating a model for the rest of the country,"" Green said.

Big picture view:

This marks the first tax in the U.S. specifically aimed at funding a state’s climate response. Hawaii’s unique vulnerability to climate impacts—rising seas, stronger storms, and wildfire risk—makes it a testing ground for how tourism dollars might help foot the bill.

Hotels and resorts ultimately supported the measure, arguing that protecting Hawaii’s environment is essential for maintaining its status as a top destination.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/05/1280/720/gettyimages-2160501570.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-05-28 07:04:13.972757

As the digital economy accelerates and generative AI becomes more deeply embedded in business and daily life, the physical infrastructure supporting these technologies is undergoing a transformative explosion.

In this graphic, we use data from McKinsey to show current and projected energy demand from data centers in the United States. Data is from October 2023.

U.S. Data Centers Could Quadruple Power Demand by 2030

Today, data centers account for roughly 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. But by 2030, that share is projected to rise to 12%, driven by unprecedented growth in computing power, storage needs, and AI model training.

In absolute terms, U.S. data center energy demand is set to jump from 224 terawatt-hours in 2025 to 606 terawatt-hours in 2030.

YearConsumption (TWh)% of Total Power Demand 20231474% 20241784% 20252245% 20262927% 20273718% 20284509% 202951310% 203060612%

Meeting this projected demand could require $500 billion in new data center infrastructure, along with a vast expansion of electricity generation, grid capacity, and water-cooling systems. Generative AI alone could require 50–60 GW of additional infrastructure.

This massive investment would also depend on upgrades in permitting, land use, and supply chain logistics. For example, the lead time to power new data centers in large markets such as Northern Virginia can exceed three years. In some cases, lead times for electrical equipment are two years or more.

A Strain on the U.S. Grid

The U.S. has experienced relatively flat power demand since 2007. Models suggest that this stability could be disrupted in the coming years. Data center growth alone could account for 30–40% of all net-new electricity demand through 2030.

Unlike typical power loads, data center demand is constant, dense, and growing exponentially. Facilities often operate 24/7, with little downtime and minimal flexibility to reduce usage.

After the signing of an executive order allowing the United States to take steps toward commercially mining the seafloor, the critical minerals located within the proximity of the islands have proven to be a significant opportunity for economic growth. Nickel and cobalt are two of the most valuable resources on the ocean floor and are used to create useful technology, such as batteries and superalloys. According to US Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, “Critical minerals are fundamental to strengthening our nation’s resilience and safeguarding our national interests.”

In international affairs, this move from the Trump Administration is unprecedented, mainly as this move flies in the face of the International Seabed Authority, which was established in 1982 to regulate the underwater mining industry in international waters. Although the US never signed the convention establishing this global organization, they have often promoted and overseen many developments throughout the ISA’s subsequent development. Leticia Reis de Carvalho, secretary-general of the International Seabed Authority, has written, “No state has the right to unilaterally exploit the mineral resources of the area outside the legal framework established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea… It is common understanding that this prohibition is binding on all States, including those that have not ratified UNCLOS.”

While the US Department of the Interior is seeking input from American Samoan communities and mining experts, many believe that the potential for commercial seafloor mining is exploitative and damaging to the biodiversity of these habitats. The World Wildlife Fund has officially stated that “Deep-sea mining could exacerbate [environmental] pressures further, causing irreversible biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, sediment plumes, and the release of toxins and stored carbon.”

""You see this, for example, in the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS). This technology is essential for achieving climate targets, but it is still barely off the ground. Industry wants government subsidies, the government says there is no public support for this, and society wants to see industry take responsibility first. But then you're stuck in a vicious circle.""

No market value, but essential

The climate debate is currently often framed from a techno-economic perspective, explains De Gooyert. ""Every solution must have direct market value. If that is lacking, no one is willing to take the first step. But a solution such as CCS has no direct market value. In addition to technology, regulations and subsidies, you really need that support, because a policy without support mainly results in resistance.""

De Gooyert collaborated with colleagues Senni Määttä, Sandrino Smeets and Heleen de Coninck on the article. Their recommendations are based, among other things, on extensive experience with discussions between government, business, citizens and other stakeholders on climate issues. They work with environmental organisations, industry and governments in European countries including Finland, Sweden, Spain and Belgium.

Trust

""What keeps coming back is that policy only works if there is mutual trust. People often think that if we explain it well, support will come naturally. But then you mainly have one-way communication, and research shows that this can be counterproductive. What you end up with is people thinking: there go those arrogant policymakers again, telling us what's good for us, and if we don't agree, they'll push it through anyway.""

De Gooyert and his colleagues advocate the use of independent, scientific advisory councils, but also initiatives such as citizens' councils. ""Citizens must be able to form an informed opinion independently, and there must be room for complexity and nuance. We must be honest with each other in such sessions: there are difficult choices to be made, but people must be given openness about the options and the consequences. Citizens deserve a say in their environment. To offer comfort to local residents, governments and businesses will also have to make sacrifices. We won't get there with the current method. Then we'll remain in the situation we're in now: no one willing to take big steps on climate policy, while time is running out.""",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,N,,2025-05-27 22:04:15.935498

The Congressional Biofuels Caucus advocates for policies that reflect the capacity of American biofuels producers to meet the demand for reliable and affordable liquid fuels while growing rural economies, high-paying jobs, and value-added markets for agricultural commodities. The caucus also recognizes biofuels are key to American energy independence and responsible stewardship of U.S. resources.

“American biofuel producers have an untapped ability to power the future of liquid fuels, whether ethanol blends, biodiesel, or sustainable aviation fuel,” Smith said. “Advancing sound policy can unlock billions of dollars in savings at the pump and hundreds of thousands of added jobs for the American people. I thank Co-chairs Craig and Pocan and congratulate Co-chairs Hinson, Fedorchak, and Budzinski for joining me to strengthen this bipartisan caucus and continue working to inform our colleagues in the House of the value of biofuels for American energy abundance.”

“Increasing the production and availability of homegrown biofuels is a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to the all-of-the-above energy policy we need to stay ahead,” Craig said. “I’m proud to be relaunching the Biofuels Caucus alongside my bipartisan colleagues this Congress so we can continue our work to lower prices at the pump, create opportunities for local producers and strengthen our energy security.”

This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""
Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050.
Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees.
China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations.","On Friday, President Donald Trump issued four executive orders aimed at bolstering nuclear power production by addressing supply chain constraints, reforming advanced reactor testing at federal research facilities, and increasing nuclear reactor use on military bases.

One of the most substantive orders calls for a ""wholesale revision"" of regulations governing nuclear power. Specifically, it directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish guidelines that would issue final decisions on all new construction and operation applications within 18 months—a process that currently takes years.

Under the order, the NRC will work with the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to draft these rules, which are due next year. Under an executive order issued in February, executive and independent agencies are required to submit draft and final rules to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (an office within the OMB) for review and approval.

This added layer of federal scrutiny could end up slowing down reactor approvals and make the NRC less efficient. It could also run contrary to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which established the NRC and its guidelines.

""The NRC is designed to be an independent agency,"" Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute, tells Reason. ""The President has control by appointing Commissioners and has the authority to remove Commissioners for cause."" However, the Atomic Energy Act says that the commission shall execute the provisions of the law, ""not the Commissioners in conjunction with other parts of the Executive branch,"" he says.

Congress has also begun to address permitting delays at the NRC. In 2024, federal lawmakers passed the ADVANCE Act which, among other things, directs the NRC to establish a quicker permitting process for already-approved technologies (18 months to finish safety evaluations and environmental reviews and 25 months to issue a final decision). The agency is expected to issue these guidelines by September, according to the NRC website.

However, the legislation stipulates that these guidelines be enforced to ""the maximum extent possible."" Jack Spencer, a senior energy researcher at The Heritage Foundation, thinks Trump's order could ""bring additional accountability to the process.""

""Any big bureaucracy is going to be resistant to change,"" he says. ""Legislation that basically puts it in their hands to achieve that reform, I think, will often fall short of the sorts of reform that are possible."" Spencer thinks that subjecting the proposed reforms to another set of eyes ""that will ask hard questions will be helpful in ensuring that real reform ultimately takes hold.""

This executive order also directs the NRC to reconsider its radiation standards for nuclear power plants and ""adopt science-based radiation limits.""

Federal radiation regulations mandate nuclear power plants to emit levels of radiation that are ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) and are based on the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that no level of radiation risk is safe to the public. This framework is not scientific (humans are exposed to natural levels of radiation that are higher than those that nuclear power plants emit) and has pushed up costs for power plant operators for no public safety benefit.

Spencer argues that fixing this rule is critical for reducing the nuclear industry's regulatory burden. ""You can make the NRC the most efficient regulatory agency that has ever existed. And if the basis of its regulatory actions is not grounded in science, then who cares?""

""That doesn't mean that you're reducing safety standards. It means that you're making safety standards in line with actual risks,"" he adds.

This directive could face legal scrutiny.

Stein, who has been critical of these standards, says ""safety standards are almost never implemented through executive order. They usually require the agency to review and 'reconsider' if the standards are appropriate."" With the NRC recently reaffirming its model for radiation standards in 2021, there ""would need to be new scientific evidence to justify a change now that wouldn't be viewed as arbitrary by a court."" Instead of rewriting ALARA standards, Stein suggests that the NRC could adopt radiation thresholds at nuclear power facilities that are defined in the Clean Air Act.

Spencer recognizes these standards can't be changed through an executive order. ""But it gets the conversation going. And it makes it more OK to talk about it, and it subjects the whole issue to daylight and makes people address it.""

Trump's order also sets a goal to effectively quadruple America's nuclear energy capacity and build 400 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2050. Stein says this goal ""can be a helpful signal to the market,"" but stating a goal does not ""will it into existence.""

Juliann Edwards, chief development officer at The Nuclear Company, a startup aiming to streamline the deployment of nuclear power plants, agrees. ""It's obtainable if you have the right leadership and you have the right behaviors and you're removing a lot of bureaucratic, unnecessary red tape, whether that be the federal level or the state level or through some regulatory regime.""

America's fleet of commercial nuclear power plants, while still safe and effective, is aging. Most of the reactors were built between 1967 and 1990—although two came online in 2023 and 2024, seven years delayed and $16 billion over budget.

As the U.S. halted its construction, China's has accelerated. From 2014 to April 2024, the nation has added over 34 gigawatts of nuclear capacity to its grid. ""Nearly every Chinese nuclear project that has entered service since 2010 has achieved construction in 7 years or less,"" notes the Breakthrough Institute. China currently has 30 nuclear reactors under construction and is exporting its nuclear energy technology to developing nations. Nearly half of the world's nuclear power plant constructions are happening in China.

While several factors have played into America's pivot away from nuclear power, including market structures, state bans on the energy source, and the introduction of cheap natural gas, the impact of federal regulations cannot be overstated.

""Without doing a refresh and making sure [that] regulations are still applicable, you can get into a point, which we're seeing now, where it's extremely difficult to even cite and permit a piece of land,"" says Edwards. In the past 20 years, regulations have become so onerous that it takes five to seven years and close to $1 billion just to permit and cite a plot of land for nuclear energy development, according to Edwards. Streamlining the licensing process isn't a safety hazard but rather ""a natural iteration that should be a part of our standard process with regulations.""

Regulations have long inhibited American nuclear energy. While Trump's order is well-intentioned to fix this issue, it is sure to face legal challenges—as many of the president's orders have.

Still, the orders may be enough to get a more substantial conversation going. ""I think anything that creates pressure toward reform is good,"" says Spencer.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/5-27-25-v1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 21:01:21.780605

DETROIT (Reuters) -General Motors is investing $888 million at a New York propulsion plant to increase engine production and build a next-generation V8, the company said on Tuesday.

The investment at the Tonawanda propulsion plant in Buffalo, New York, first reported by Reuters, is a shift from a previously announced $300 million commitment to make electric-vehicle drive units at the plant.

The move is likely another sign of automakers adapting to slower-than-expected market demand for EVs and comes after the Detroit automaker aggressively lobbied Congress to rescind California electric-vehicle rules.

GM said the investment will support the sixth generation of GM’s V-8 engines, used in full-size trucks and SUVs expected to be more fuel-efficient.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the project will support 870 jobs at Tonawanda Propulsion, including 177 jobs deemed at risk. The state plans to provide up to $16.96 million in tax credits in return for investment commitments.

New York said last week it would pause penalties associated with any shortfalls of EV sales for two years.

GM has been more adamant in staying the course on its move to EVs than other automakers, but has also pulled back on some of its previously announced EV investments, including selling its stake in a battery cell plant to battery partner LG Energy.

GM CEO Mary Barra has said the automaker has a plan to sell only electric light-duty vehicles by 2035 but has said it will ""be responsive to where the customer is.""

Executives have more recently positioned the company to be focused on adapting to customer demand for EVs, but the automaker has also continued launching the vehicles. It now has about a dozen EVs available in the United States.

GM committed to a $300 million investment for drive unit production at the Tonawanda plant during the 2023 negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. Production of the drive units had not been launched there.

Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.
The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth.
Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade.
According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers.","Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed what's been dubbed the “big, beautiful bill”, with the legislation designed to leverage deep cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) credits to pay for tax cuts, immigration enforcement and extra spending on defense. The contentious bill is now headed for the Senate, where it faces its final test, with all Democrats but only a handful of GOP lawmakers critical of the huge increase it will bring to the national debt. According to a recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, the bill, coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%.

According to the report, doing away with the IRA would eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted if the bill were to become law. Under normal circumstances, this fact alone would be enough to galvanize GOP lawmakers in those states to oppose the bill; however, just two Republican House reps joined the Democrats in voting against the bill, portending a similar fate for the bill in the Senate. Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.”

According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs. Similarly, Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) did a 180 and supported the bill, having previously said that he will vote to preserve 45X and 30D tax credits. Overall, virtually all of the 21 GOP House representatives who previously defended clean energy tax credits under the IRA voted for the bill.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face a massive setback under Trump’s bill. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest-growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

The tax bill would kill off two key tax credits that have been responsible for most of that growth. In effect, the bill would terminate both investment and production credits for renewable energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after it becomes law or those that enter service after 2028. Ben Smith, associate director at Rhodium Group, estimates that this could lead to up to a 72% decline in clean energy additions to the grid over the next decade. Further, clean energy projects will be ineligible to claim the tax credits if they source basic materials such as cobalt and lithium for batteries, as well as glass for solar panels, from prohibited foreign entities such as China. According to Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha, the tax bill will be “disastrous” for the rooftop solar industry because it will terminate tax credits for companies that lease solar equipment to customers. OSHA estimates that ~70% of the residential solar industry employs lease arrangements.

Among the bill’s other key highlights are a proposal to cut the Environmental Protection Agency's budget to $4.2B from $9.1B, the EPA’s smallest budget in nearly 40 years. The Union of Concerned Scientists has warned that shuttering the EPA's scientific arm would essentially turn the EPA into a purely political agency. If passed, the U.S. will record a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1 billion metric tons annually over the next decade and U.S. household energy costs by ~$415 per household per year. The bill will also kill off the budding clean hydrogen, CO2 management, and even the nuclear power sectors.

While the Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom.

His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.
Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy.","When the Senate returns from recess next week, it will have Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” to contend with. There’s no doubt the chamber will try to make changes to the omnibus plan to extend and expand Trump’s tax cuts that passed the House last week. The president even told reporters over the weekend that senators should “make the changes they want to make,” and that some of the changes “maybe are something I’d agree with, to be honest.”

Whether those changes include salvaging the nation’s clean energy tax credits will likely depend on a small group of Republican senators who have criticized the House’s near-total gutting of the subsidies and how much they are willing to fight to undo it.

The bill that passed the House would outright eliminate consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and both energy efficiency renovations and new energy-efficient homes. It would also kill the clean hydrogen tax credit at the end of this year and give most zero-carbon power plants, including wind, solar, and geothermal, an end-of-year deadline to start construction, among many other damaging provisions.

To date, at least eight Senate Republicans have spoken out against at least some of these changes, but none of them have tied their vote to the issue. The pressure to stick with your party is “enormous” when your vote is the difference between a bill’s success or failure, Josh Freed, the senior vice president for climate and energy at Third Way, told me. “As we saw in the House, the biggest question is whether any Republican Senator, when push comes to shove, has any willingness to try to stop this bill in order to defend energy tax credits.”

Pay attention to what they say over the next few weeks — and when they say it. It’s one thing to speak out when everything’s still up in the air. It’s quite another to keep talking when votes are on the line.

The Letter Writers

When the budget fight was first heating up in April, four senators led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sent a letter to Majority Leader John Thune warning that repealing the tax credits “would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.” The three co-authors were Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and Jerry Moran of Kansas.

Last week, after the House modified its proposal to phase out the tax credits more aggressively, Murkowski told Politico the Senate was “obviously going to be looking at” the provisions “as well as the final product, and kind of seeing where we start our conversation.” The moderate Republican has a history of supporting environmental policy, and has already broken with her party on at least one vote this year. In February, she was the only Republican who voted in favor of a Democrat-led effort to reinstate 5,500 federal public lands employees that had been fired by the Department of Government Efficiency. (The legislation failed.) Murkowski has also gone her own way to support more efficient energy codes, loans for electric vehicle manufacturers, and the impeachment of President Trump over the January 6 insurrection. But she did not vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and if you look at her overall voting record, these occasions of deviating from the party line have been rare.

Tillis, who is a member of the Finance Committee and will therefore be directly involved in writing the tax credit portion of the bill, has made more specific comments. He said he would push to wind down the tax credits more slowly to give businesses more time to prepare. “We have a lot of work that we need to do on the timeline and scope of the production and investment tax credits,” he told Politico in the same article.

While Tillis does not have the same kind of track record as Murkowski, he’s up for re-election next year, and his state has a lot to lose. Some 34 clean energy projects worth $20 billion in investment and tied to more than 17,000 jobs came to North Carolina because of the tax credits, according to the advocacy group Climate Power. Toyota invested in an EV battery manufacturing plant and just started production last month. Several EV charger manufacturers are setting up shop in the state. Siemens Energy is building a factory to make large power transformers, equipment that is essential to expanding the grid and is currently in very tight supply.

Susan Collins is also running again next year. While the Inflation Reduction Act hasn’t spurred much manufacturing in Maine, it has driven a clean energy boom. The Maine Climate Labor Council, a coalition of unions, estimates there are 145 utility-scale clean energy projects that are either operating or in development that could be eligible for the tax credits. The state has also made a big energy efficiency push in recent years, with the tax credits supporting the expansion of efficiency jobs.

Although Collins did not ultimately vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, she was the only Republican to vote against an amendment proposed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah that would have cut funding for the law’s energy efficiency rebate programs.

The Come-Latelies

When it became clear that the House was considering changes that would effectively repeal the clean energy tax credits in the IRA, Senators Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven of North Dakota, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia chimed in to voice their concerns. Cramer criticized new deadlines the House proposed for ending the tax credits, telling Politico that “it’s too short for truly new technologies. We’ll have to change that. I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology.”

After the bill passed the House, Jon Husted of Ohio decided it was time to speak up. “You have companies that have already made investments, made commitments,” he told the outlet NOTUS. “Supply chains have been built around them, and we need to phase that out more slowly. I think that they deserve to have at least five years of that credit.” Like Tillis, Husted has an election coming up — and 35 clean energy projects in his state to protect.

The Wild Cards

The D.C. insiders I spoke to mentioned a few other powerful senators who could play a role in the debate who’ve been mum on the IRA so far. Thune, of South Dakota, has a history of being friendly toward tax credits for wind energy, and was honored by the American Council on Renewable Energy for his support for renewable energy in 2019. Lindsey Graham, chair of the Budget Committee, has also long been a sometimes-ally for climate action in the Senate. His home state of South Carolina has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the tax credits, with some 43 projects and 22,000 jobs at risk.

Then there are the potential spoilers. Republicans can only afford to lose three votes on the bill in order to send it back to the House and ultimately to the President’s desk, and the party has already split into a number of factions looking for various tweaks. Some, like Josh Hawley of Missouri, oppose the legislation’s deep cuts to Medicaid. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives like Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have said they will push to reduce spending even more.

In the House, defenders of the tax credits ultimately cared more about raising the limit on the state and local tax deduction than fighting for clean energy subsidies. We could see a similar dynamic play out in the Senate, where Murkowski and Collins have also expressed concern about cuts to Medicaid. The Senate also can’t afford to change the bill so much that it will lose support in the House, so any changes will have to be surgical. The calculation will be, “What is the smallest thing that the authors of the bill can give these folks to fall back into line so that it is relatively easy to both pass the Senate and then get back through the House?” Freed explained.

Cramer, for his part, is not coming to the rescue for wind and solar, but he may be able to revive support for other forms of clean energy. The North Dakota Senator wrote a letter to Republican leaders in early May railing against the “indefinite entitlement” given to energy sources that depend on the wind and sun, and arguing that the tax credits should prioritize electricity generators on the basis of “reliability,” so as to encourage “geothermal, hydropower, coal and natural gas with carbon capture, and nuclear without excluding wind and solar.”

Capito has barely made a fuss about the energy credits, but she and Cramer will be the ones to watch to see how the Senate deals with the bill’s provision to repeal the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas limits for vehicles, as both sit on the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which Capito is the chair. The repeal may not be allowed under the Senate’s rules for budget reconciliation, as it doesn’t have a direct effect on the federal budget. The Senate Parliamentarian hasn’t yet weighed in, but a negative ruling did not stop the two Republicans from leading the fight to revoke waivers granted to California that allowed it to set pollution limits on cars and trucks.

In the end, if any of these Senators wants to take a stand for big changes to the tax credits, they are going to need at least three colleagues to stick it out with them. A more likely outcome, Freed told me, is for them to attempt some smaller adjustments.

“Hopefully they can make it better, but they’re also under enormous pressure to not deviate too significantly from what the House wrote,” he said. “We just need to go in clear-eyed that it's going to be difficult.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMyODQxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjUwNjk0OX0.pFEmdhqvdhuc8AnllM_I2iiJKWEUSmxdOJG2nF51SRA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C200,N,,2025-05-27 20:05:01.223539

However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt.","EGLE hosts tour during Mackinac Policy Conference to showcase the impact of water infrastructure investments

MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich.—Today, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) Director Phil Roos joined state and local leaders during the Mackinac Policy Conference to highlight the $78.7 million Mackinac Island Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Improvement Project. The event featured a tour of the plant and an update on construction progress, emphasizing how the state’s continued investment in water infrastructure benefits communities, creates jobs and protects Michigan’s world-class water resources.

Originally constructed in 1970, the Mackinac Island WWTP has undergone significant upgrades to accommodate the island's growing population and tourism demands. The WWTP, which serves a population ranging from 492 in the winter to over 20,000 in the summer, previously struggled to meet environmental and capacity standards. The upgraded plant will provide better wastewater treatment, expand capacity and improve water quality on the island, ultimately supporting sustainable growth.

""Investing in water infrastructure is critical to ensuring the health and safety of Michigan’s communities,"" said Director Roos. ""This project is a shining example of how strategic investments in our water systems provide long-term benefits for both residents and visitors, while also contributing to Michigan’s ongoing efforts to improve water quality.""

The WWTP Improvement Project aims to expand and modernize the wastewater treatment plant, with major upgrades like automated screening, grit removal and advanced treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors and UV disinfection. Expanded capacity will allow the plant to handle seasonal surges in wastewater, while new pumps, blowers and controls will improve water quality and stormwater management. Collaboration between EGLE, Mackinac Island and the Mackinac State Historic Parks was essential to securing additional property for expanding the WWTP footprint.

""We appreciate the support the community has received from the EGLE State Revolving fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations for our new Wastewater Treatment Plant,"" said Mackinac Island Mayor Margaret Doud. ""The project is a critical need for the Island’s infrastructure. This will be a great improvement to the Mackinac Island Community that all will greatly benefit from. We would like to thank everyone involved for supporting our beautiful Island, a true Gem, which is enjoyed by many and will be for generations to come.""

The Mackinac Island WWTP upgrade was made possible through a combination of funding sources, including a $24 million Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) loan, a $15 million American Rescue Plan (ARP) grant and a $39.7 million state appropriation grant in 2023. These funds will allow the facility to implement wastewater treatment processes and ensure more efficient and environmentally responsible operations.

""Infrastructure projects on Mackinac Island are not cheap, nor are they easy. However, these services are critical in serving both the seasonal and year-round Mackinac Island communities, the State Park, and the numerous guests our community serves,"" said Mackinac Island Director of Public Works Allen Burt. ""Without the assistance of EGLE State Revolving Fund loans, ARP grants, and additional State appropriations, the residents of the City of Mackinac Island would be unable to support these much-needed system updates. I thank everyone who has come together to support Mackinac Island as the special place it is not only to our local community, but to the entire State of Michigan.""

Governor Whitmer’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2026 Executive Recommendation Budget continues to build on these investments, providing $50 million in one-time funds to support lead service line replacement and upgrades to water systems. Additionally, $30 million in annual funding will be directed to support lead service line replacements, stormwater management and wastewater infrastructure improvements. Another $5.95 million is dedicated to strengthening the implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act to ensure safe water for all Michigan families.

""There is immense public value in making low-interest loans available for local communities to upgrade their water systems,"" said State Representative Parker Fairbairn, R-Harbor Springs. ""The Clean Water State Revolving Fund helps to protect our lakes, rivers, and streams and thereby safeguards public health. This program allows them the resources to make critical and sometimes overdue updates to their infrastructure. The Revolving Fund gives communities the flexibility to make these necessary investments without having to pay much higher interest rates of commercially available loans.""

Since 2019, the Whitmer-Gilchrist administration has invested more than $5.3 billion in water infrastructure projects, including lead service line replacement and water quality improvements. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to ensure all Michigan communities have access to safe, clean drinking water.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/EGLE-Logos/Social.jpg?rev=fa9af8ebc6cc48f4ab7777c144d928b5&hash=AD089C78988ABC2E4DD23E2D36B9B8E6,N,,2025-05-28 01:02:15.042451

""Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,"" BlackRock wrote.
BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.
""But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.""","US clean energy might seem an early victim of policy shifts and funding cuts, but BlackRock says its still a key source of power and an area of the stock market that could rise.

Even with renewable power facing heightened scrutiny from the Trump administration, coupled with the erosion of tax benefits in the congressional reconciliation bill, two things should keep investors interested in the space.

First, energy demand isn't ebbing, and clean energy will be needed more than ever.

""The US likely needs more of all kinds of energy to meet AI's needs,"" BlackRock wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""Industry projections see US data center electricity consumption rising between 50% and 200% by 2030 — a big jump after 15 years of flat national power demand.""

In other words, Washington can't afford to slash a leading source of electricity if the US is to maintain its artificial intelligence leadership. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar is projected to lead US power generation growth through 2026. Together with wind, solar overtook coal in the nation's energy mix for the first time in 2024.

Second, BlackRock says industry headwinds are priced into renewable power stocks.

""Longer term, we see clean energy stocks positioned for strong growth,"" BlackRock wrote. ""Renewables are quick to build and valuations are attractive: the factors that contributed to their slump — like high rates and tariffs — are now priced in, we think.""

BlackRock also suggested that investors keep tabs on nuclear stocks, with the Trump administration's focus on nuclear making the sector poised for growth.

""Last week, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at expediting nuclear power reactor deployment, and the most recent revisions to the House bill preserved the existing tax credits allotted to nuclear project developers,"" BlackRock wrote. ""But given how long it takes to build nuclear power plants, we see natural gas and renewables benefiting sooner.""",https://i.insider.com/6835ed53c6ad288d1481f335?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 23:01:35.431419

Gamechanger for Micromobility

The Fiat Tris is a three-wheel electric vehicle designed by engineers at the Stellantis brand’s design studio in Turin, Italy. Initially introduced in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region, the compact EV has a range of just above 55 miles per charge and can be recharged by any standard domestic socket.

The company believes the ultra-light commercial vehicle can be a game-changer for micromobility, and it’s available in three different configurations: chassis-cabin, flatbed, and pick-up to suit applications such as urban logistics, last-mile delivery, mobile businesses, and essential transportation services.

Fiat’s First 3-Wheel Design

The Tris is the first three-wheel vehicle Fiat has brought to market. It has an integrated charging system as well as a 220-V plug to simplify recharging. Using a standard domestic plug, the Tris can be charged from 0% to 80% in 3.5 hours, or completely recharged in 4 hours and 40 minutes. According to the company, professionals can recharge the vehicle overnight or between shifts.

The Tris is 10.4 feet long and has a tight 10-foot turning radius. The vehicle is designed to navigate narrow city streets. The cargo area has 2.25 square meters of load space and can accommodate a standard 1,200 mm x 800 mm euro pallet. The Tris weighs about 2,200 pounds and has a payload capacity that maxes out at 1,190 pounds.

Future Expansion

Olivier Francois, FIAT CEO and Stellantis Global CMO, says the Tris will give independent workers, small businesses, and underserved communities a cost-effective, zero-emissions tool to move forward. Francois says the vehicle could ""transform last-mile mobility” in the MEA region and even teased that the Tris could be introduced next to the European market.

Fiat expects to manufacture the Tris in Morocco, where the brand has a significant manufacturing footprint.

According to the Times’ reporting, the EPA claims greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning power plants, “aren’t contributing significantly to dangerous pollution”.

Big changes could come to the power industry.

“This is something that has gone back and forth for over a decade at this point,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

The New York Times said that the EPA is proposing a regulation that would eliminate limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

According to the Times’ reporting, the EPA claims greenhouse gases from fossil fuel burning power plants, “aren’t contributing significantly to dangerous pollution”.

“The idea that ... power plants don’t make up a significant enough portion of global warming causing pollutants is astounding and just downright wrong,” Gary said.

The EPA said electric power is the second largest human source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. In Kentucky, the power industry is the number one human source of greenhouse gases, according to the EPA.

“Kentucky, because it is more reliance on fossil fuels for its generation of power than most other states, it does rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

rank a little bit higher percentage wise here than certain other states,” Gary said.

Biden era regulations, that went into effect in 2024, said existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants must control 90% of their carbon pollution over the next few years. Dependable Power First Kentucky, a coalition concerned about Kentucky’s energy grid, said those regulations aren’t realistic.

“It would have raised all the consumers’ prices. The price everyone paid to turn on the lights would have went up; but also, it’s not just that, it’s the reliability. We just don’t have the energy infrastructure to do that, and the lights just wouldn’t have come on at times,” said Corey Elder, acting executive director for Dependable Power First Kentucky.

Elder said the EPA’s new proposal is a relief for Kentucky power plants.

“Our top priority is just ensuring that the American people have reliable electricity and what this rule does is it gives our power producers more time to get there,” Elder said.

But moving away from fossil fuels altogether, the Kentucky Resources Council said, would help with the negative effects of climate change.

“It will also be more affordable and sustainable for Kentuckians. We’re just kicking the can down the road by not tackling this problem now,” Gary said.

The EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency will make sure all Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy.

Spectrum News 1 reached out to the EPA to see what exactly it’s proposing.

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

The Golden State boasts that nearly 30% of new car sales are electric, compared to under 10% in New York. “They’ve met their transportation goals several years in advance,” said Michael Lerner from the nonprofit Energy Vision research group. “They met their most recent target three years early.”

In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said. But despite 96 Assembly cosponsors, the legislation has stalled in the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, Woerner acknowledged.

“There are some environmental groups that are really convinced that eliminating internal combustion engines is the only path to achieving our climate goals,” Woerner said.",https://www.cnyhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/05/GettyImages-954558336-e1715959219184_79f904.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-27 21:01:33.416191

The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts lithium demand could surge up to 42 times by 2040, driven by unprecedented demand for clean technologies. But with supply bottlenecks and limited global extraction sites, companies with early-stage discoveries like Elektros Inc. are positioned for long-term impact and success.

Benzinga highlights several lithium-related stocks as high-growth investments, and Elektros Inc.'s recent breakthrough in Sierra Leone places it firmly on the radar of institutional and retail investors alike. The company's ability to deliver high-grade, ethically sourced lithium aligns with both market needs and environmental priorities.

With the world at a tipping point between fossil fuel dependency and clean energy dominance, lithium remains not just a commodity, but a global catalyst for innovation and transformation.

According to Reuters, ""Lithium is the irreplaceable element powering the electric vehicle boom and the clean energy revolution. Its strategic importance has made it one of the most sought-after minerals in the world, drawing major investment and global competition.""

It blames the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the sharp decline in nuclear plant construction after 1978, following the Three Mile Island accident. Safety standards tightened, regulatory delays increased, and regulatory uncertainty grew, as nuclear construction slowed essentially to a halt. But tighter regulation is not the only reason for this: nuclear plants became increasingly expensive and higher risk, with massive cost over-runs and delays, with many expensive new designs competing for a shrinking market.

The EO claims that “Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks.” And there is certainly some truth to that. Over time, the regulatory process has focused more narrowly on a set of specific safety checklists, and that hinders innovation.

Regulatory costs are also an issue. Congress imposes stringent cost recovery on NRC applicants, requiring that they pay NRC staff time on an hourly basis, which is especially burdensome on smaller (and more innovative) companies.

The NRC also manages the safety of nuclear plants after designs are approved, monitoring and assessing their construction and operations. It has, especially since TMI, focused tightly on safety as its primary mission. For example, the NRC has, as the EO states, consistently required very low radiation exposure in licensing: “The NRC utilizes safety models that posit there is no safe threshold of radiation exposure and that harm is directly proportional to the amount of exposure.” Alternative approaches, however, argue that there is a threshold below which radiation exposure is safe, but these have been ignored.

Against this background, the EO calls for the following policies (EO, Section 2):

To reestablish the United States as the global leader in nuclear energy;

To facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry;

To facilitate the expansion of American nuclear energy capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050;

To employ emerging technologies to safely accelerate the modeling, simulation, testing, and approval of new reactor designs;

To support the continued operation of, and facilitate appropriate operational extensions for, the current nuclear fleet, as well as the reactivation of prematurely shuttered or partially completed nuclear facilities; and

To maintain the United States’ leading reputation for nuclear safety.

The basic thrust of the order is relatively simple: reform the NRC to ease regulatory burdens, incorporate industry development into its mission, reduce licensing uncertainty, shorten approval timelines, and limit duplication by elevating DOD and DOE roles.

These are largely worthy objectives. They follow on fairly directly from previous congressional efforts to reform the NRC through the NEIMA and the ADVANCE Act. However, while further NRC reform is necessary, the changes proposed in the EO won’t be nearly enough to transform the industry.

The United States doesn’t have hundreds of new nuclear plants largely because nuclear power plants are highly capital intensive, so the cost of the energy produced is also very high and hence uncompetitive with fossil fuels and (increasingly) solar and wind. Those capital costs also make investment in nuclear energy very risky: a shift in interest rates, an unexpected delay, problems in the supply chain—they can all cause devastating financial difficulties for a nuclear investment. So private investors are reluctant to engage.

The EO attacks one dimension of the problem: the delays and uncertainty caused by existing NRC regulation, although the EO ignores the recent efficient approval of innovative new designs through the NRC’s waiver process, as well as a major proposed rulemaking published by the NRC in late 2024 that will implement a risk-informed technology neutral regulatory framework (largely in line with EO objectives). Still, more reform will be needed, for example, to support the iteration of designs, which is a normal part of the innovation process but is hard to address within existing pathways. However, the EO also supports a reduction in staffing at the NRC. Given that some of the proposed timelines for action are extremely aggressive even with existing staffing, staff reductions will make any acceleration much more difficult. Meeting target deadlines will likely require more staff, not fewer.

More importantly, the EO does not address other critical elements of nuclear development.

R&D: Nuclear badly needs new designs and new approaches, as the existing technology is not price competitive, and – we believe – will not be price competitive regardless of whether the United States builds a handful of big new reactors. But DOE funding for nuclear R&D is slashed by 24 percent under the Administration’s proposed 2025 budget.

Development: The gap between a nuclear prototype and a commercially viable product is huge, expensive, and not well funded by private investors. TerraPower’s technology has been under development for almost 20 years, and it plans to deploy its first reactor 5 years from now. Congress previously addressed this gap through supportive funding via the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), but that function will apparently be broken into pieces and funding eliminated. Key new players like TerraPower, Kairos, NuScale, and X-energy have all received substantial funding. Without that support, essential new nuclear designs won’t reach the market.

Scale-up: Small modular reactors have more promise than existing large reactors because they can be scaled up and at least in part can benefit from factory production to reach scale, which is the key to sustained cost reductions that could make SMRs competitive. But that still takes a decade or more even after commercial launch, so private investors see promising technology but also a long runway of high up-front costs, massive risks, and uncertain demand. The Loan Program Office, if suitably reformed to focus only on scaleup, could help reduce the risks and encourage private investment at no significant cost to the government, since the support would come in the form of loans rather than grants. Nuclear will need it.

As nuclear scales up, international markets and standards will also become much more important; a slimmed down NRC might well not have the staff to address this in the face of more urgent short-term needs. And as we argued in a previous paper, the Administration must develop and operate a functional strategy that covers all stages of industry development, until the market is ready to take the technology and run with it.

So the EO’s focus on regulation is important and useful, especially in the highly regulated nuclear power sector, but it’s just a small piece of building a competitive nuclear industry in the United States. Unfortunately, on all other fronts, nuclear policy seems poised to move quickly into reverse.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/03hnmfyj/production/9a378ee57e3a1e5a6d7530bd3eba94cf0de9f789-1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 19:06:53.834446

SACRAMENTO — The California Energy Commission (CEC) will hold a public meeting on the proposed Compass Energy Storage Project in San Juan Capistrano. The purpose of the meeting is for the applicant to explain the project, the CEC to explain the Opt-In Certification process, and for the public to learn more details about how to participate in the CEC proceeding and share their comments about the project. This will be a hybrid meeting with an in-person location as noted below, Zoom access online or by phone and via livestream on the CEC’s YouTube Channel.

The project developer, Compass Energy LLC, submitted an application to the CEC on April 11, 2024, to seek certification through the CEC’s Opt-In Certification program for a 250-megawatt (MW) battery energy storage system capable of storing up to 1,000 MW-hours.

The CEC reviewed the application and deemed it complete on April 30, which started a 270-day certification process. The next step is for the CEC to hold a public meeting about the application and process. After that, a staff assessment, including an environmental impact report, will be published, followed by a public meeting and 60-day public comment period. A decision by the CEC on whether to approve the project will follow the completion of the environmental review and public comment process later in the year.

Meeting Details:

Safe development and operation of battery energy storage systems (BESS) has been and remains a top priority for California energy agencies. CEC is part of a cross-agency collaborative convened by Governor Gavin Newsom to find opportunities to improve safety as technology continues evolving. Key initiatives include an update to the California Fire Code happening this year, expected to include enhanced BESS safety standards. The California Public Utilities Commission in March voted to require new safety protocols for the maintenance and operation of BESS facilities. These and other ongoing efforts are based on the latest studies and consultation with experts to keep California at the forefront of safe and reliable battery storage technology deployment.

To obtain certification, a BESS would be required to meet strict safety and environmental standards. Possible mitigation requirements include:

Compliance with top-tier safety measures such as the California Fire Code and National Fire Protection Association standards (NFPA 855).

Ongoing collaboration with the local fire department so local first responders are fully equipped to handle potential incidents.

A dedicated command and control center outside the battery energy storage system facility for safe incident management.

Real-time environmental monitoring of air and water quality in the event of an emergency.

Deflagration panels to safely vent gases and minimize fire hazards.

Thermal infrared cameras for real-time monitoring and early detection of potential fire events.

About Opt-In Certification

In 2022, Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 205 as part of his build more, faster agenda(link is external) which is focused on delivering critical infrastructure upgrades throughout California. The bill created an alternative certification option for certain clean energy projects through the CEC's Opt-In Certification program. This program is designed to accelerate the development of clean energy in California and support the retirement of fossil-fuel-based resources.

Under the Opt-In Certification program, the CEC serves as the lead agency for the California Environmental Quality Act and will hold public meetings at or near proposed project locations to gather input on the proposed projects. Except for specific circumstances, the environmental review must be completed within 270 days after the application is deemed complete.

The CEC will invite consultation with California Native American tribes, conduct public meetings in the local area, and facilitate and consider public comment throughout the process. If the CEC approves the project, the issuance of a certificate, in most instances, replaces the need for any permits, certificates, or similar documents required by state, local, regional, or federal agencies to the extent permitted by federal law. If certified, the CEC would monitor construction and operation of the project throughout its lifetime pursuant to established conditions of certification, including enforcement of any violations and decommissioning when appropriate.

“That’s why New Jersey is not going to walk away from this fight.”","The U.S. Senate last week voted 51-44 to repeal a rule allowing California to ban sales of gas-powered cars by 2035, creating a ripple effect across the country. Eleven other states, including New Jersey, were set to follow in California’s footsteps, representing roughly 40% of the U.S. auto market in all.

How much the bill if enacted would impact New Jersey specifically is up for debate. Following California’s lead, Gov. Phil Murphy had called for half of all new car sales to be electric by 2027 as part of a larger effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. But if President Trump was to sign the latest bill once it lands on his desk, New Jersey’s electric vehicle rule could be dead before it fully gets off the ground.

NJ Spotlight News spoke with Doug O’Malley, director of Environment New Jersey, about the Senate bill and its potential consequences for New Jersey.

“The key thing to know is that regardless of what happens in Washington, New Jersey’s been a clean-car leader for more than two decades, and this was no surprise whether it was a congressional vote or a regulation or through litigation,” he said.

“The fact is … we have a constituency of more than 200,000 New Jersey residents that are driving EV’s right now.”

The Murphy administration signed on to a multi-state effort known as the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition to roll out a series of “clean vehicle programs.” Participating states include California, Colorado, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.

“It’s to basically say, we’re not going away,” O’Malley said of the coalition. “New Jersey is obviously one of those states, and the investments we’ve made are starting to pay off.”

“I think there will need to be a shift just acknowledging the fact that the feds are obviously not where they were last year,” he said. “That’s why New Jersey is not going to walk away from this fight.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/05/20250527_OMalley_INTV_WEB.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 18:09:06.576911

Time to hit rewind on that. According to a report from the New York Times, the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has drafted a plan that would eliminate all caps on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants.

The proposal, which comes under the leadership of new EPA chief, and longtime climate change skeptic, Lee Zeldin suggests that the emissions generated by power plants from burning fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution”—a statement that seems to imply the existence of good pollution, but that’s a whole other thing.

Per the Times, the agency’s repeal would apply to all greenhouse gas emissions standards that are currently applied to fossil fuel-fired power plants. That would effectively undo much of the work of the Biden administration to clean up the energy sector, including rolling back requirements for coal plants to capture carbon pollution before it leaves its smokestacks and store it, and rules that require gas plants to use newer technologies that produce fewer emissions.

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Zeldin said in a statement to the Times.

The US power sector continues to be one of the country’s largest sources of greenhouse gas—second overall, just behind the transportation industry—and is responsible for one-quarter of all carbon emissions. Under the Biden administration’s standards, new power plants were significantly cleaner than the existing infrastructure. According to a report from Cleanview, 96% of new power plants built in 2024 were carbon-free. Per the EPA during the Biden era, its standards required existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants to control 90% of their carbon pollution, finding ways to capture or offset the emissions.

Forgetting History While Ignoring Cost and Safety

This past week we saw a flurry of rushed decisions around nuclear power, first with TVA submitting a construction permit for their GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 Small Modular Reactor design near Oak Ridge, Tennessee followed late Friday afternoon, May 23, 2025 with four Trump Executive Orders apparently attempting to restructure the regulatory framework of nuclear power oversight and accelerating deployment of more unproven nuclear power designs. We have known that TVA was exploring the SMR technology, but had understood it was not cost-effective and that a decision to move forward had not been made; this action would indicate otherwise.

The Executive Orders raise more questions than they answer, but appear to push the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to short-circuit their safety and review process and even allow the Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense (DOD) to rush forward with nuclear power plants outside of the regulatory process. Congress separated the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1974 with the Energy Reorganization Act, which created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to handle nuclear safety regulation. The Department of Energy (DOE) was created later in 1977 through the Department of Energy Organization Act, which took over the AEC’s nuclear weapons and energy development functions along with energy programs from other agencies.

The separation was designed to address conflicts of interest that had developed within the AEC, which had been both promoting nuclear technology and regulating its safety since 1946. The 1974 reorganization split these functions, giving the NRC independent regulatory authority over civilian nuclear power while transferring the promotional and weapons-related activities to what would become the DOE.

Executive Order Concerns

According to Peter Behr’s Politico Energy Wire story, former nuclear regulators and industry experts are raising serious alarms about Trump’s executive orders potentially undermining decades of independent nuclear safety oversight. Former NRC chairs Allison Macfarlane and Stephen Burns warn that political interference in the historically independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission will “crater” essential public confidence in nuclear power and damage public trust. The orders mandate staff reductions at the NRC while simultaneously requiring the agency to complete a “wholesale revision” of safety regulations within months, leading Senator Ed Markey to warn that “it will be impossible for NRC to maintain a commitment to safety and oversight with staffing levels slashed and expertise gone.”

Technical Challenges Remain Complex

The advanced reactor technologies that Trump is counting on for his nuclear “renaissance” present unprecedented safety review challenges that cannot be rushed without significant risk. According to a 2023 National Academies study, most advanced reactors use unfamiliar cooling systems like liquid sodium, helium gas, or molten salt instead of traditional water cooling, requiring extensive testing and safety analysis. Former NRC Chair Richard Meserve emphasized that “there is no way to cut corners on ensuring that these new features are carefully analyzed,” while industry veteran Amir Afzali noted that sodium-cooled reactors face “significant fire risk, as sodium ignites explosively on contact with air,” requiring rigorous testing and monitoring that increases costs.

Will We Ever Learn

Critics point to recent nuclear project failures as evidence that regulatory shortcuts won’t solve the industry’s fundamental cost problems. The Georgia Power Vogtle expansion, which used NRC-approved reactor designs, still ended up costing $35 billion and running seven years late — problems that stemmed from construction and financing issues rather than regulatory delays. As Afzali observed, “the NRC can’t be blamed for the issues Vogtle faced,” and history across industries shows that “weakening oversight and blurring the lines between promotion and regulation” leads to “serious consequences.” The orders risk repeating past mistakes by prioritizing speed over safety in an industry where public trust and technical precision are paramount.

Small Modular Reactors: Big Promises, Bigger Price Tags

TVA Dreaming

TVA has been dreaming about having an SMR for years. Submitting a request for an Early Site Permit at the Clinch River Nuclear Site in 2016 and receiving the permit in 2019. Recruiting partners and submitting an application for $800 million in taxpayer funds to be a “first mover” in SMR technology.

This dream has been hyped by many Tennessee politicians and the Oak Ridge community who have never met a nuclear project they did not like. As with many dreams they can take a turn for the worse when not grounded in reality. The missing reality in this dream, as with so many nuclear proponents’ dreams, is price and schedule. TVA’s C-suite executives dreams can easily become Tennessee Valley ratepayers’ worst nightmare when fuzzy math and hype prevail over facts and prudence. Below are the facts that beg for more prudence.

BWRX-300 and other SMRs pose significant financial risks to ratepayers

In the race to decarbonize our electricity system, small modular reactors (SMRs) have been touted as the nuclear industry’s silver bullet – smaller, faster to build, and more affordable than their larger predecessors. Among the leading designs is GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which has attracted interest from utilities across North America. But recent expert testimony before the Colorado Public Utilities Commission by energy analyst David Schlissel raises serious questions about whether these reactors can deliver on their promises or will instead burden ratepayers with massive costs.

The rising price tag of the BWRX-300

While GE Hitachi has kept many of the BWRX-300’s financial details under wraps, what we do know is concerning. According to Schlissel’s testimony, TVA’s recent filings reveal an estimated overnight cost for the BWRX-300 of $17,949 per kilowatt in 2024 dollars. This figure only covers the base construction costs – it doesn’t include financing costs or inflation during the years of construction.

When all costs are factored in, the final price per kilowatt will be substantially higher. For comparison, that base cost is already nearly twice as high as what GE Hitachi initially suggested the reactor might cost.

“The estimated all-in cost of the project must be much higher than shown,” Schlissel testified, noting that overnight costs exclude escalation and financing costs that typically add substantial amounts to nuclear projects.

The pattern of ballooning costs

The BWRX-300 isn’t unique in facing cost increases. Every SMR design on the market has seen dramatic cost escalation before a single reactor has been built in the United States:

NuScale’s SMR project saw costs nearly triple from $6,833/kW in 2015 to $20,130/kW by 2023 before being canceled

X-Energy’s reactor cost estimates jumped 72% in just three years (2021-2024)

TerraPower’s Natrium reactor, initially touted as potentially costing $11,594/kW, is now estimated at $28,986/kW according to recent admissions by Bill Gates, the company’s founder

“It is extremely likely that any future SMRs or large reactors will cost far more and take far longer to build than the nuclear industry and its supporters now claim,” Schlissel concluded. “That has been the long history of nuclear power in the United States, and I see no evidence that leads me to believe it will change anytime in the foreseeable future.”

The international experience is no better

Supporters of the BWRX-300 and other SMR designs often suggest we should ignore the U.S. nuclear industry’s troubled history of cost overruns. But the international experience with SMRs tells the same story:

China’s Shidao Bay SMR cost tripled from its original estimate

Russia’s floating SMRs saw costs quadruple

Argentina’s CAREM 25 SMR has had cost increases of over 600% and is still under construction

Just as troubling, these projects all faced years-long schedule delays. China’s SMR took 11 years instead of 4 to complete, while Russia’s took 13 years instead of 3. Argentina’s is still under construction after 10 years, with at least 3 more years to go.

For the BWRX-300, which has yet to begin construction anywhere, these patterns suggest ratepayers should be extremely skeptical of current cost and schedule projections.

Factory fabrication: An empty promise?

A central claim made about the BWRX-300 and other SMRs is that they will be less expensive because modules will be manufactured in factories and assembled on site. However, as Schlissel points out, none of the SMR vendors marketing designs in the U.S. currently have factories where their reactor modules are being built.

“One of the key claims by supporters of SMRs is that the reactors will be less expensive to build because key reactor modules will be manufactured in factories and assembled on site. Yet, to my knowledge, no SMR vendor has yet opened a single factory,” Schlissel testified.

This same promise was made for the AP1000 reactors built at Georgia’s Plant Vogtle, which were supposed to utilize modular construction techniques to reduce costs and construction time. Instead, the project experienced a 157% cost overrun and a 6 to 7 year schedule delay – hardly a promising precedent for the BWRX-300.

No evidence of a learning curve

GE Hitachi and other SMR vendors claim that building multiple copies of the same design will lead to cost declines over time. But Schlissel’s analysis found no evidence of such a “positive learning curve” in nuclear construction:

“Even the French nuclear program, which relied on a high degree of standardization in the design of its 58 reactors built between 1974 and 1990, failed to achieve a positive learning curve. Instead, costs continued to increase over time despite the program’s design standardization.”

His analysis of construction schedules for recent reactor designs shows no meaningful reduction in construction time for subsequent builds of the same design.

Still too expensive, even with subsidies

Even with the Inflation Reduction Act’s generous 50% Investment Tax Credit for new nuclear plants built in communities that have had now-retired fossil plants, Schlissel’s analysis found that the cost of electricity from SMRs like the BWRX-300 would still be far higher than renewable alternatives.

Using NREL’s Annual Technical Baseline data, Schlissel demonstrated that SMR power would cost $115-251/MWh in 2035, compared to much lower costs for wind, solar PV, and storage. It’s worth noting that while tax credits reduce costs to ratepayers, they simply shift the burden to taxpayers – who are the very same people.

Too slow to address climate change

The climate crisis demands rapid action. Yet even by optimistic projections, the first BWRX-300 won’t be operational until the 2030s. Given the patterns of delay seen in every nuclear project to date, the timeline could easily stretch into the 2040s.

Meanwhile, renewable energy and storage systems can be deployed in months or a few years, making them far more effective tools for near-term carbon reduction.

The flexibility factor

Perhaps most concerning for ratepayers is that investing in expensive nuclear projects like the BWRX-300 locks utilities into very long-term financial commitments when future electricity demand is uncertain. If the dramatic increases in demand currently forecast don’t materialize, or if they materialize differently than expected, ratepayers could be stuck paying for expensive overcapacity.

As Schlissel notes: “A renewable energy park would give the Company valuable flexibility in its resource planning… New resources could be added in a relatively shorter number of years if demand grows at a higher rate than now expected. This flexibility is vital in today’s dynamic energy transition.”

Conclusion: A risky bet for ratepayers

The BWRX-300 and other SMRs represent a massive financial gamble for utilities and their ratepayers. While the technology sounds promising, the evidence suggests these reactors will follow the same pattern of massive cost overruns and delays that have plagued nuclear projects for decades.

Before committing billions of ratepayer dollars to these unproven technologies, utilities and regulators should carefully consider the overwhelming evidence that SMRs like the BWRX-300 are unlikely to deliver on their promises of affordable, timely carbon-free power.

As expert David Schlissel recommends, a more prudent approach would be to invest in proven renewable energy and battery storage technologies that can be deployed quickly, scaled flexibly, and have consistently demonstrated falling costs over time.",http://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/14492253878_5bdacf7b37_4k-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 18:08:48.830129

It is a multi-million project that is being carried out by the motoring company, with the purpose of leading the revolution and the electric global market in the automotive sector.

Located in Stanton, Tennessee, it is a city with a futuristic design, which will host factories, assembly lines, technical training and storage space for batteries. This huge project will benefit the people of Stanton, generating a large number of jobs and infrastructure improvements. Ford is committed to clean energy and electric cars and has decided to do it big.

The Blue Oval City

Ford has decided to throw caution to the wind and has come up with this idea of a futuristic city, focused solely on the world of electric motors. With an expansion of 3,600 acres, this is a complex located in Stanton, Tennessee.

Its main purpose is to become the state and world reference in terms of electric energy, as well as promoting the use of cleaner energies. In addition to the assembly lines, there are factories, technical training, battery installations and also a recycle center for all products.

Is it really useful?

The company Ford, founded in 1903, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers. But that is not its only advantage. It has also been a pioneer in betting on cleaner and sustainable energies and continues to do so today. It has taken another step further, creating a working environment that also seeks to be sustainable, so the supply of energy vehicles will increase. As expected, mass production has to reduce costs, so we could benefit from a greater number of vehicles at more affordable prices.

Positive or negative impacts on the region?

This is an issue that must be addressed jointly between Ford and the community. The construction of this complex began three years ago, and already then its impact could be appreciated. The city of Staton benefited from the increase in jobs, something that will also happen in the future with the opening of the same, after its construction is finished. In addition, improvements will have to be made to the city’s infrastructures, as more roads and an increase in public service will be needed.

However, it must also be borne in mind that this increase could lead to an higher volume of the population, which would have repercussions on the price of housing and life in general, making them more expensive.

EV´s future

One of the products already being designed by the company is the launch of a second generation of the classic Ford F-150 EV model in the Blue Oval City. An offer that will reach even greater number of consumers since the production will be on a large scale. Ford has opted for a path that is still uncertain, but one that promises a better future. A commitment to the development and research of the electrical sector, advocating the use of clean energy and care for the environment, offering an increase in cost-benefit ratio.

In short, we are facing one of the most innovative and risky bets in the automotive sector. To make an investment of this magnitude and direct it towards clean energy, adding the purpose to offer products of good quality, respectful with the environment and above all more affordable for the consumer, require a blind confidence in the project.

It will be a matter of time to see how other brands launch similar initiatives, but we will have to see if they are of the same magnitude in terms of investment, confidence and size.",https://pedirayudas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ford-logo-1800-x-1200-wallpaper-9aaksmtk072ewndr.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 20:05:17.481565

The recent battery fires at the Vistra Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility on the California coast are a tragedy.

A large regional energy source was ruined, nearby residents evacuated and already there are lawsuits and questions about toxins released into the environment.

Battery energy storage system, or BESS, facilities are essential for leveraging renewable energy resources like solar, since they capture daytime electricity production and supply it to the grid after sundown when demand remains high. But communities may become more hesitant about hosting these facilities.

So it’s a tragedy because society desperately needs more renewable energy, more grid storage and more BESS facilities — and this could slow things down. (Lest we forget: Non-renewable energy production is not free from fire risk, as residents of Martinez, California, can attest.)

The saddest thing is that BESS fires like Vistra’s are entirely preventable. It all comes down to how batteries are made.

Understanding batteries

I don’t want to minimize this catastrophic fire, but let’s be clear: Lithium-ion batteries are incredibly safe. There are literally billions of them in use every day around the world, functioning reliably and without incident. But changing the way they are manufactured will make them even safer and virtually eliminate the possibility of fires.

Lithium batteries need no air to burn. Above a certain temperature, a battery fire is self-sustaining — it can’t be “choked off” with traditional firefighting techniques. It would probably burn on the moon! All firefighters can safely do is wait for it to burn out and keep it from spreading.

As with nearly all lithium-ion batteries, BESS batteries are made of thin layers of anode and cathode materials interdigitated together and encased in aluminum and copper. A small manufacturing flaw in one cell may cause an internal short that produces heat. And due to the design of the layers and the mixed metal conductors, all the cell’s energy discharges within seconds. Those failures are catastrophic. It gets so hot, so fast, that it ignites nearby batteries, and eventually everything around them, burning so intensely that fire suppression systems can’t stop it. There are some approaches to mitigate this risk, like using lower energy LFP batteries. But even with those, a short still causes failure and can generate enough heat for fire.

There is a way to avoid these fire risks altogether.

Lithium-ion battery cells made with composite conductive materials — or polymeric current collectors, PCC — are built with a different architecture. When there is a short, they continue to function. Energy eventually dissipates, but it happens gradually over the course of hours. There is no catastrophic heat production, ignition, or “thermal event” (fire).

If a PCC battery fails, it’s a warranty issue. No one needs to call the fire department.

Making safer batteries

A PCC cell is a series-connected battery, not a parallel-connected or interdigitated battery like those now used in BESS facilities. It’s still made layer by layer, but the layers are connected directly, one on top of the other, and current moves from one layer to the next over the entire surface of each layer. There’s no need for aluminum or copper. Instead, a thin conductive polymer film loaded with a little bit of carbon is used, and current flows vertically up a chain of sealed layers. It cannot produce fire.

This is not a “new” lithium-ion battery architecture. Plenty of people are familiar with it and companies as formidable as Apple have explored it for safer batteries. But one of the reasons they and others could never move forward with PCC batteries is that there was no way to mass produce them.

In standard battery manufacturing, all the cell layers are interleaved together, the electrolyte floods over them, and everything is packaged with a single seal. Worldwide, this “wet process” is how lithium-ion batteries have been made for over 30 years!

To build a PCC battery, every single layer within it functions as its own individually sealed battery — you can’t flood the whole thing with an electrolyte because that would short out the battery. It won’t catch fire, but it also won’t work. You could construct the individual cells “by hand” separate from the standard fabrication process, but then you would be manufacturing a battery exponentially more expensive than everything else on the market — and no one is going to pay that much for a battery no matter how safe it is.

But upgrading the standard equipment in existing battery manufacturing plants lets you use a multimaterial “dry process” to produce batteries with a sealing material right around every layer individually. Dry electrode technology makes PCC batteries imminently feasible. And to make a long story short: Yes, we now have that technology; Yes, we have systems capable of mass production; No, it won’t increase the cost of making the battery — if anything, it should make it cheaper.

And, of course, they don’t catch fire.

The Vistra fire represents a safety issue that only exists because 20th century manufacturing equipment doesn’t produce 21st century batteries.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/pycAa1JlVFECWjLtiGpQgrRrE7d4d8NnxV76w85zOkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTI2MjI3OTQ4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-27 18:08:54.012072

With demand for electric vehicles and energy storage skyrocketing worldwide, Nexus Power has the potential to make waves globally.
Nexus Power has used Autodesk Fusion and AutoCAD software to create detailed battery designs, run simulation tests, and create prototypes.
3D printing material is also lightweight, but it provides all the strength and support of metal fabrication.”","As a country, India is famous for the early adoption of technology and is home to revolutions in programming and green tech. India has a history of working toward greener transportation solutions through forward-thinking policies and programs at the state level. As India accelerates towards electric vehicle adoption, the need for environmentally responsible battery solutions has become urgent. Enter identical twin sisters Nishita and Nikita Baliarsingh, founders of Nexus Power, a startup that’s taking on the problem of sustainable battery manufacturing.

The duo first became interested in quantitative sustainability metrics like ESG matrix frameworks while studying at university. They were looking for ways to reverse environmental problems from industrialization and human activity in general, and a confluence of events put them on the path of creating an exciting new battery technology.

The first of these events was an auto show in Delhi, where Nikita Baliarsingh says they realized how many electrical components of modern cars end up as e-waste. They decided to focus on one of the most damaging and wasteful elements in the process: batteries. “We started doing research in materials which are electrochemically charged and can therefore work as batteries, but aren’t as harmful as lithium,” Baliarsingh says.

The breakthrough came from a line in a research paper, suggesting certain proteins could serve as effective battery electrolytes. Their first efforts were homemade, built during COVID lockdowns out of chickpeas and kidney beans, producing outputs of up to five volts—an impressive result from something “so raw and so basic and so abundantly available in Indian households,” Baliarsingh says. “We collected some crop residue, extracted our proteins out of it and then made a new generation of batteries very successfully.”

What began as a curiosity evolved into a scalable solution. At the time, news reports began focusing on deteriorating air quality due to the widescale practice of burning crop stubble on farms. When crops are harvested, plants are almost always cut off low to the ground rather than uprooted entirely. This leaves fields full of cut-off vegetation (stubble) that needs to be cleared before the next planting, and burning is one of the most common methods used across the developing world.

But in the most populous country on Earth, crop stubble means one thing to Nexus Power: a virtually endless source of raw material. “As far as our calculations go, it’s something that’s never going to be out of stock,” Baliarsingh says. India’s vast crop stubble could be converted into high-performance battery materials. This not only reduces harmful emissions but also creates a sustainable input loop.

If agricultural waste can be used to produce biomaterials for batteries, it’s possible to save millions of tons from being burnt, funneling it instead into a new sustainable product cycle. This process is also transportable—research or production units can be set up wherever the protein-rich raw input is available, which is almost everywhere.

More importantly, it doesn’t change the way batteries are made. “The layering and crimping is the same. We synthesize the proteins and then build the entire anode and cathode slurry. That slurry then goes into existing machines or equipment and it’s fabricated using the normal process. Everything else remains the same,” Baliarsingh says.

Being able to transpose protein-based inputs into existing or entrenched battery manufacturing infrastructure is crucial for environmental and business sustainability—businesses are unwilling to spend large sums to completely retool a manufacturing process, nor would consumers pay orders of magnitude more for the resulting batteries.

The Baliarsingh sisters also relied on the ability to use existing infrastructure to help them craft a compelling business case for partners. “Being a startup, you don’t have a lot of funds to set up new manufacturing units,” Baliarsingh says. “So we had to adjust to the available infrastructure.”

In addition to being made from waste materials, Nexus Power’s batteries are completely biodegradable: when the cathode/anode/mixture structure is out of charge, it’s still essentially just old leaf and plant matter. Once separated from the plastic casing or metal wiring, it can simply be thrown in the compost.

Baliarsingh adds that Nexus Power’s batteries are performing better than the lead-acid, lithium ion, or even alternative chemistries that are becoming more widespread. Because the energy density of the agricultural slurry is higher, she says it performs up to 25% better than comparably sized batteries of other types—and at a lower price, thanks to the plentiful and inexpensive input material.

Though Nexus Power has the means to lead the field on performance and cost, the Baliarsinghs believe the focus on sustainability is the biggest selling point and what makes the company unique.

With demand for electric vehicles and energy storage skyrocketing worldwide, Nexus Power has the potential to make waves globally. Many tools that have become ubiquitous in daily life contain batteries, from EVs and drones to laptops, phones, and other consumer electronics. Even power system grid storage runs on them. “EVs are sunrise industries,” Baliarsingh says, “so changing components or elements in these industries is easier to do through trials and tests.”

Nexus Power received initial support from KIIT-Technology Business Incubator (KIIT-TBI), a non-profit incubator at KIIT University in Odisha that has helped over 450 startups in electronics, AR/VR, biotechnology, and medical technology. “The TBI believed in our idea early on and supports young women entrepreneurs like us with the right infrastructure,” Baliarsingh says. KIIT-TBI facilitated government grants for Nexus and provided material synthesis machines, electrochemical testing, and 3D modeling and printing access.

After several years of research and development funded by grants from the government of India and equity investors, Nexus Power is now preparing for a commercial rollout within a year. The company is running large-scale trials to align its technology and product roadmap with the target Mobility and Stationery markets. The results of these trials will inform a pilot manufacturing plant with a capacity of approximately 100 MWh to support broader test deployment in EVs, drones, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. Over six months, Nexus will conduct rigorous testing and begin certifications, aiming to scale production to 1 GWh within 10–12 months.

“We’re trying to build the thesis and the market’s conviction about the product,” Baliarsingh says. “It’s going to be a transition from available infrastructure to batteries with a different chemistry, so the plan is to have enough pedigree to make sure buyers are readily available and open to accepting the change.”

Autodesk has been a critical partner for the company throughout its growth. Nexus Power has used Autodesk Fusion and AutoCAD software to create detailed battery designs, run simulation tests, and create prototypes. “We 3D printed all our initial prototypes, a workflow that was managed through Fusion,” Baliarsingh says. Fusion’s integration of CAD and CAM made it possible to develop designs, test layering options, and prepare files for printing in one software environment. “Using 3D printing really informed all the layers and cuts of our designs. The software became our most trusted tool in designing an entire battery pack.”

The Nexus Power team opted to 3D print the prototypes for three reasons. First, the cell types and shapes they wanted to use for initial testing weren’t available, and they didn’t have access to the traditional machine milling needed to fabricate them. Second, the non-profit incubator KIIT-TBI had a 3D printer workflow set up and available for the company’s use.

Last was the speed and agility. “3D printing helps build multiple prototypes really fast,” Baliarsingh says. “It took us maybe two or three days to build one entire battery pack—if we had to use metal fabrication, it would take a lot longer. 3D printing material is also lightweight, but it provides all the strength and support of metal fabrication.”",https://images.ctfassets.net/v7wr16nrr0mz/5RL1OIFrENrSPpCTJpzlTd/0d515fefe22a75c3b254cb65bdc423b6/nexus-power-sustainable-battery-manufacturing-banner-1920x1080.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 17:09:12.236346

HOW WE CAN HELP – The Morgan Lewis Nuclear Advantage Morgan Lewis’s dedicated nuclear energy practice has been ranked for more than a decade in Band 1 by Chambers USA for Energy: Nuclear (Regulatory & Litigation): Nationwide.","The US president on May 23, 2025 signed four executive orders focused on promoting economic and national security by expanding and accelerating the development and use of nuclear energy in the United States to address rising electric demand from data centers, manufacturing, and other critical industries. The executive orders aim to quadruple nuclear electricity production by 2050 by enhancing domestic nuclear fuel production, revamping and streamlining the regulatory process for new reactor approvals and restarting shuttered ones, establishing a pilot program for advanced reactors, and authorizing the construction of nuclear reactors on federal lands.

This Lawflash offers a high-level overview, summarizing the core provisions within each of the four executive orders and highlighting their primary aims and key directives.

REINVIGORATING THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRIAL BASE

The first executive order (EO) addresses the critical need for a reliable and secure domestic supply of nuclear fuel. By leveraging Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, the EO seeks to reduce dependence on foreign sources of enriched uranium and strengthen national security through a robust domestic nuclear fuel infrastructure.

Section 3 of the EO directs, among other actions, the following actions from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to bolster the domestic nuclear fuel cycle:

Within 240 days (January 18, 2026), the DOE secretary must submit a report recommending a national policy for managing spent nuclear fuel and for developing advanced fuel cycle capabilities, including reprocessing/recycling of spent nuclear fuel.

Within 120 days (September 20, 2025), the secretary, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), must develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capabilities.

The secretary must prioritize contracting for fuel fabrication facilities that can supply fuel for test/pilot program reactors within three years of such applications. The secretary can also seek voluntary agreements with domestic nuclear companies for the cooperative procurement of low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU).

Section 4 directs actions for funding of advanced nuclear technologies:

Federal loans and loan guarantees will prioritize projects that support nuclear energy, including restarting closed nuclear plants, increasing the power output of existing plants, and completing construction of nuclear reactors whose development was previously suspended.

Within 180 days (November 19, 2025), the secretary, in coordination with the Small Business Administration, must prioritize funding (grants, loans, investment capital, and other federal support) for advanced nuclear technologies, subject to the availability of appropriations.

DOE will facilitate five gigawatts of power uprates at existing nuclear reactors and aim for 10 new large reactors with complete designs under construction by 2030.

Section 5 aims to expand the workforce by directing the secretaries of the US Departments of Labor and Education to increase participation in nuclear energy-related Registered Apprenticeships and Career and Technical Education programs within 120 days (September 20, 2025). Also within 120 days, all executive departments and agencies that provide education grants shall consider nuclear engineering and nuclear energy-related careers as a priority for investment.

REFORMING THE NRC

The second EO aims to restructure and reform the NRC to accelerate the licensing and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors.

Section 3 reinforces the mission statement update in Section 501 of the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024 (ADVANCE Act) by requiring the NRC to also “consider the benefits of increased availability of, and innovation in, nuclear power to economic and national security” in licensing actions, along with safety, health, and the environment.

Section 4 directs the NRC, in consultation with the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and OMB, to reorganize its structure to expedite processing of license applications. The order also calls for reductions in force, but recognizes that some functions, including new reactor licensing, may increase in size to support the reactor licensing initiative. The EO also directs that the personnel and functions of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) be reduced to the minimum necessary to fulfill statutory obligations, narrowing the scope of ACRS to issues that are “truly novel or noteworthy.”

Section 5 outlines directives to revise and modernize NRC’s licensing regulations. The EO directs the NRC to “undertake a wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents” and issue notice(s) of proposed rulemaking within nine months and final rules and guidance within 18 months. The revision must establish mandatory fixed deadlines for licensing decisions, which will be enforced by fixed caps on NRC’s recovery of hourly fees. The deadlines include: (1) no more than 18 months for a final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type and (2) no more than one year for applications to continue a renewed license for an existing reactor. These deadlines are not designed to be tolled except for applicant failure.

The EO also directs the NRC to reconsider reliance on the linear no-threshold (LNT) model for radiation exposure and the “as low as reasonably achievable” standard and instead consider adopting determinate radiation limits in consultation with DOE, the US Department of Defense (DOD), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Other provisions of section 5 include revising regulations governing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, establishing processes for high-volume licensing of microreactors and modular reactors with standardized approvals and potential general licenses and setting stringent thresholds for demanding design changes during construction. Furthermore, it mandates revising the Reactor Oversight Process and reactor security rules, adopting data-backed thresholds for safety assessments, reconsidering and potentially extending renewed license periods, and streamlining the public hearing process.

MODERNIZING DOE REACTOR TESTING

The third EO focuses on enhancing DOE’s capabilities and processes for testing nuclear reactors.

Section 3 sets the stage by finding that the advanced reactors overseen by DOE should include research as well as demonstrating the suitability for commercial application of a reactor.

Section 4 directs reforms to the reactor testing processes within DOE’s National Laboratories. Within 60 days (July 22, 2025), the secretary shall issue guidance regarding what counts as a qualified test reactor for purposes of the EO and help ensure expeditious processing of a qualified test reactor application. Within 90 days (August 21, 2025), the secretary shall take steps to revise the regulations, guidance, and procedures to “significantly expedite the review, approval, and deployment of advanced reactors under [DOE’s] jurisdiction.”

Section 5 directs the secretary to establish a pilot program outside the National Laboratories, but still under sufficient DOE control, to construct and operate at least three test reactors, with the goal of achieving criticality by July 4, 2026.

Section 6 addresses streamlining environmental reviews by directing the secretary, in consultation with the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), to begin reforming DOE’s NEPA compliance regulations by June 30, 2025, consistent with EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy. This includes exploring the use of existing statutory authorities, such as categorical exclusions, to eliminate or expedite DOE’s environmental reviews for certain activities, including authorizations, permits, approvals, and leases.

DEPLOYING ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTOR TECHNOLOGIES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

The fourth EO focuses on leveraging advanced nuclear reactor technologies for various national security objectives, including for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and other national security installations.

Section 3 directs the DOD secretary, through the secretary of the US Army, to establish a program for using nuclear energy for installation and operational needs and begin operating an Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic military base or installation by September 30, 2028. Additionally, within 240 days (January 18, 2026), the DOD secretary, collaborating with the DOE secretary, OMB director, and secretaries of the military departments, must submit legislative and regulatory recommendations concerning advanced nuclear reactors and spent fuel at military installations.

Section 4 directs the DOE secretary to designate AI data centers located at or operated with DOE facilities as critical defense facilities. The necessary electrical infrastructure, nuclear and non-nuclear, shall be deemed defense critical electric infrastructure. The DOE secretary shall also designate one or more DOE-owned or controlled sites for advanced nuclear reactor deployment within 90 days (August 21, 2025) and use all existing authorities to approve privately funded reactors at such sites for AI infrastructure and other critical, national security, or supply chain needs.

Section 5 directs the DOE secretary, within 90 days (August 21, 2025), to identify all DOE-owned uranium and plutonium suitable for recycling or fuel use in US reactors. At least 20 metric tons of HALEU shall be made available from DOE stockpiles for authorized private-sector projects on DOE-controlled sites supporting AI and other infrastructure, while preserving reserves for national security needs, including tritium production, naval propulsion, and nuclear weapons. The DOE secretary shall also ensure a long-term domestic supply of enriched uranium. The DOE and DOD secretaries shall use all existing authorities to site and approve privately funded nuclear fuel facilities at DOE and/or DOD-controlled sites for national security, commercial, and research reactor use.

Section 6 directs the DOE and DOD secretaries to use their respective authorities to enter into contracts or agreements to support implementing this EO, including DOE technical support at DOD sites for all phases of advanced reactor development and deployment.

Section 7 directs the DOD and DOE secretaries to leverage existing and new NEPA categorical exclusions, use expedited permitting processes, and develop alternative compliance measures for the construction of advanced nuclear reactor technologies on federal sites.

Section 8 focuses on increasing nuclear exports. It directs the Secretary of State to negotiate at least 20 new agreements by January 3, 2029, for peaceful nuclear cooperation with other countries under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and to renegotiate agreements set to expire within the next decade. The DOE secretary also shall expeditiously review and decide on export authorization requests within 30 days of receipt of a complete application and DOE analysis, although the timeline does not include interagency reviews or the time it takes to request and receive foreign government nonproliferation and retransfer assurances.

Although the EO does not mention these export regulations by name, they are clearly those required for export of non-public, unclassified nuclear reactor and fuel cycle technology under 10 CFR Part 810. Within 90 days (August 21, 2025), the federal government will develop strategies to expand financing for US nuclear projects and trade and provide financial and technical support to promote the global adoption of nuclear energy. Finally, Section 8 instructs the secretary of state, within 90 days (August 21, 2025), to implement a program aimed at boosting the global competitiveness of US nuclear companies by expediting agreements and reducing barriers to US exports.

Section 9 of the order directs the DOD secretary to prioritize the issuance of the appropriate clearances to support the rapid distribution and use of nuclear energy and fuel cycle technologies.

CONCLUSION

The four EOs mark a strategic push to revitalize the US nuclear energy industry, consistent with President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy EO (summarized here) to prioritize domestic energy dominance and security. The directives signal a clear expectation for federal agencies to reform their operations, modernize regulations, and accelerate both civilian and national security nuclear deployment.

The mercurial leader runs Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and the social media website, X. He's also been spending more than his share of time in Washington, D.C., where he heads the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an organization within President Trump's administration focused on cost cuts.

Musk's busy schedule has earned him equal praise and criticism from fans and foes.

His supporters applaud his seemingly golden touch in building companies, while detractors say his lack of focus has contributed to failed Tesla model launches, declining sales, and X service disruptions.

The matter has come to a particular head this year as Musk's political activism has accelerated. He spent hundreds of millions of dollars supporting President Trump's election in 2024, and his role at DOGE has arguably turned off many once-loyal Tesla customers.

The impact has taken Tesla's stock on a wild ride. Shares rallied after President Trump's election on hopes that he would leverage his close relationship to benefit Tesla, only to fall sharply earlier this year when it became clear that Tesla wouldn't sidestep Trump's tariff policy, and sales had dropped because of DOGE.

Tesla's stock price has performed much better since Musk said on Tesla's earnings conference call that he would refocus energy on the company. His latest message to investors is similarly sending shares soaring today.

Tesla's big advantage fades

Tesla's (TSLA) became a major success because Elon Musk decided early on to focus the car company on the performance of its electric vehicles rather than solely on their environmentally friendly nature.

As a result, Tesla's cars competed with and often outperformed luxury rivals like Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Porsche. Celebrities and speed enthusiasts coveted Tesla's aspirational vehicles, leaving competitors like Ford, General Motors, and others in the dust.

The high-performance moat, however, has largely disappeared.

Almost every car company, including Detroit's Big Three, has spent heavily to build and market high-end EVs. These competing vehicles often deliver similar performance and possibly better fit-and-finish than Tesla.

As a result, Tesla's electric vehicle market share has slipped, and this year, this problem worsened due to Musk's often polarizing political positions, particularly in key markets like Europe and California.

Tesla's sales in Europe dropped 49% year-over-year in April to 7,261 vehicles, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile, total EV sales in the region rose 34%. So far, Tesla's Europe unit volume is down nearly 40% through the first four months of this year.

The trends are similar in California, where Tesla registrations fell 21.5% year-over-year in the first quarter. Non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) registrations were up 14%.

Elon Musk promises more time at Tesla

Musk appears to have heard his shareholders' complaints loud and clear.

""There's been some blowback for the time that I've been spending in government with the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE,"" said Musk on Tesla's Q1 conference call on April 22. ""I think starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly... I'll be allocating probably more of my time to Tesla and now that the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency is done.""

The reassuring words have sent Tesla shares rocketing 38% since. Yet, worries that Musk is distracted have persisted, including in the wake of a recent increase in outages at X, and amid renewed tariff debate last week following President Trump's threat to place a 50% tariff on the EU.

Over the weekend, the concerns prompted Musk to reiterate his commitment to his businesses, including Tesla.

""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" wrote Musk in a post on X on May 24. ""I must be super focused on X/Xai and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.""

The words emboldened investors yet again, given Tesla's key programs underway, including its much-hyped autonomous driving robotaxi program. Musk has promised that full-self-driving vehicles will be on the road in Austin in June.

""Not only is FSD Supervised safer than a human driver, but it is also improving the lives of individuals who experience it,"" said Musk in April.

Why It Matters

Trump reignited the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra during his 2024 campaign, declaring a national energy emergency and rolling back environmental regulations to boost U.S. oil and gas production.

Musk is a close ally of the president, with the billionaire Tesla owner spearheading efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to reduce government spending.

What To Know

Musk's post featured a clip from the DER Task Force podcast, which included an interview with Jesse Peltan, co-founder and CTO of HODL Ranch, a developer of Bitcoin mining projects in Texas.

""China's still growing exponentially on their solar deployments,"" Peltan said in the clip.

""The targets for what their solar and battery manufacturing capacity...what that could do, if you take two terawatts of solar, and about eight terawatt-hours of storage, that's an entire U.S. worth of electricity generation.""

""That's 4,000 terawatt-hours a year of 24/7 solar power. They're going to be able to make that every single year...by like 2030,"" Peltan added.

Upon reentering office, Trump signed executive orders to expand fossil fuel development, including lifting a pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.

""We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it,"" Trump said in his inaugural address.

The administration's policies led to the cancellation, closing, or downsizing of $8 billion worth of clean energy projects in the first quarter of 2025, according to a study by the nonpartisan group E2 published in April.

Trump has also urged U.S. allies to increase oil extraction and reduce their reliance on green energy. He urged British Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week to abandon its ""costly and unsightly windmills"" in favor of increased oil drilling in the North Sea.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump claimed that tapping into the North Sea's oil reserves could significantly reduce Britain's energy costs, suggesting Aberdeen as a central hub for drilling operations.

""Our negotiated deal with the United Kingdom is working out well for all. I strongly recommend to them, however, that in order to get their energy costs down, they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills, and incentivize modernized drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken. A century of drilling left, with Aberdeen as the hub,"" he wrote.

""The old fashioned tax system disincentivizes drilling, rather than the opposite. U.K.'s Energy Costs would go WAY DOWN, and fast!""

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump, in his inaugural address: ""America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have—the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth—and we are going to use it. We'll use it.""

At its height, Kentucky commanded approximately 20% of the United States’ computing power dedicated to Bitcoin mining, with facilities rapidly establishing themselves across the region, often repurposing abandoned coal mines in the process.

THE CRYPTOCURRENCY COLLAPSE

According to a recent WIRED investigation, what began as a heralded economic savior for the region in 2021 has now largely dissipated. Many Bitcoin mining operations have either shut down completely or significantly scaled back their activities, creating yet another economic void in an area that has historically struggled with sustainable development.

Anna Whites, a lawyer who provided legal representation for several cryptocurrency mining ventures in the state, observed that many operations suffered from fundamentally unsustainable business models. The pattern became familiar: companies would quickly establish operations, lease property, and then abruptly cease activities, leaving behind a trail of unpaid obligations and unfulfilled promises to local communities.

A CASE STUDY IN BROKEN PROMISES

One operation that initially appeared to buck this trend was Mohawk Energy, co-founded by Kentucky State Senator Brandon Smith. In 2022, Mohawk acquired a substantial 41,000-square-foot facility in Jenkins, Kentucky, much of which was leased to a Chinese cryptocurrency mining firm. The venture had ambitious goals beyond just mining Bitcoin; it aimed to provide training for former coal miners and veterans in electronics repair and maintenance of Bitcoin mining equipment.

The early signs were promising, with twenty-eight families securing stable employment through the operation and additional jobs created in the surrounding area. However, within just 18 months, the partnership deteriorated rapidly. As reported by Lexington News, the Chinese partner initiated legal action against Mohawk alleging contract violations, which Mohawk countered with litigation of its own. The promised profits that were intended to fund local training programs never materialized, and many workers lost their newly acquired jobs.

SHIFTING TO AI: THE NEXT DIGITAL FRONTIER

As the Bitcoin mining dream crumbles, attention in Kentucky is pivoting toward a potentially more sustainable digital infrastructure: data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence. These facilities are crucial for powering sophisticated AI applications like Siri and ChatGPT, utilizing enormous computing capabilities for machine learning and data processing.

Wes Hamilton, a local entrepreneur with experience in the mining sector, sees AI technologies as offering more solid and enduring opportunities compared to the volatility of Bitcoin mining. This perspective aligns with recent actions by Kentucky’s state government, which in March 2025 enacted the “Bitcoin Rights Act,” establishing the right to use digital assets while creating a regulatory environment conducive to various forms of digital economy, including AI-focused data centers.

CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AMID LINGERING CONCERNS

Despite the enthusiasm from certain quarters about this technological pivot, many Kentucky residents remain cautious and skeptical. Nina McCoy, a Kentucky citizen cited by Cryptonomist, expresses concern about potential ecological problems similar to those caused by previous extractive industries, such as water pollution resulting from coal waste spills.

For McCoy and others like her, there’s apprehension that new AI data centers might replicate familiar patterns of environmental and social exploitation, particularly given their substantial energy requirements and water needs for cooling advanced technological infrastructure. This cautious stance reflects a broader wariness born from historical experiences with boom-and-bust economic cycles in the region.

THE LESSONS OF ECONOMIC TRANSITION

Kentucky’s experience with cryptocurrency mining may serve as a cautionary tale for other regions pursuing similar operations as economic development strategies without adequately accounting for their inherent instability. As reported by GetCoai, the cryptocurrency mining retreat in Kentucky mirrors historical boom-bust cycles in Appalachian communities, raising fundamental questions about sustainable economic development in regions transitioning away from traditional industries.

The swift rise and subsequent decline of Kentucky’s Bitcoin mining sector highlights the challenges of building sustainable economic alternatives in regions historically dependent on resource extraction. Whether AI data centers represent a more stable path forward remains to be seen, but the lessons from the Bitcoin mining experience suggest that careful planning, robust regulatory frameworks, and attention to environmental impacts will be essential for any technology-based economic development strategy in the region.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/xai-tmp-imgen-437dd117-80fc-4c5a-805c-19f5d1db449a.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 17:10:10.071567

The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025 (S.1343A / A.472), which was introduced by State Sen. Kevin S. Parker and Asm. Woerner, will reduce on-road transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate New York’s shift to clean energy, and help build a more affordable and equitable future for all New Yorkers. The legislation will not only reduce emissions and support working families but will also serve as a key driver of New York’s electric vehicle (EV) transition by incentivizing investments in EV charging infrastructure.

“The importance of advancing a Clean Fuel Standard in New York rests on our commitment to improving air quality and decreasing fossil fuel pollutants at a time when the federal government is stepping back from its role in overseeing environmental protections—so it really is up to us,” said Sen. Harckham. “The fact that we will be creating thousands of new good paying jobs each year while moving to low-carbon fuels and growing our renewable energy sector makes the argument for enacting this legislation even stronger.”

“As other states and Canada have demonstrated, adopting a Clean Fuel Standard can have a marked and immediate impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation,” said Asm Woerner. “Further, California has shown that zero emission vehicles and the infrastructure to support them have grown in adoption over the years that a Clean Fuel Standard has been in place. This is a practical and proven tool that could and should be in New York’s decarbonization toolbox. I am happy to join Senators Harckham and Parker, along with the League of Conservation Voters and others in calling for passage of the Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, so that New York can accelerate the decarbonization of its transportation sector.”

“We’re here to send a clear message: the Clean Fuel Standard is essential to building a more affordable New York,” said Sen. Parker. “By diversifying our transportation fuel mix and supporting cleaner, locally produced alternatives, we can stabilize energy costs, protect public health, and create quality jobs in the clean energy economy. The Clean Fuel Standard is a practical, proven strategy for cutting emissions while promoting innovation. It supports local industries, attracts private investment, and reduces our dependence on fossil fuels without burdening taxpayers.”

Assemblymember Chris Burdick said, “With the transportation sector being a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to reduce toxic diesel emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by lowering their carbon intensity. This long-range plan will provide ample time for compliance and help New York meet its commitments under the 15-state action plan to cut these emissions. Now more than ever, New York must do its part to combat the climate crisis and protect our environment.”

The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025 will require fuel providers to reduce the carbon intensity of their transportation fuels by at least 20% by 2030. This would create a performance-based credit market that rewards the use of lower-carbon fuels like electricity and renewable biofuels while penalizing high-emission fuels.

With transportation accounting for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions in New York, the CFS offers a cost-effective strategy to meet the goals of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) and drive innovation across the state’s transportation sector.

Critically, the CFS will create new revenue streams and market incentives to expand New York’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Utilities, transit agencies, and private companies will be eligible to generate clean fuel credits by supplying electricity as transportation fuel. Those credits can then be reinvested in building out EV charging stations, modernizing grid infrastructure, and supporting clean fleet upgrades across the state.

At least 40% of credit value from utilities or government entities under the CFS must be reinvested in disadvantaged communities, those most impacted by vehicle pollution and environmental neglect. This ensures the clean energy transition benefits everyone, not just those who can already afford EVs or live in well-resourced areas.

If passed, New York will join California, Oregon, and Washington with successful clean fuel programs that have reduced emissions, supported innovation, and driven billions in private clean energy investment. The Clean Fuel Standard complements New York’s broader climate strategy without raising fuel taxes or imposing burdensome mandates on consumers.

Julie Tighe, President of the New York League of Conservation Voters, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard would cut greenhouse gas emissions and deliver much-needed relief to communities suffering from toxic diesel pollution on Day One, and it will also accelerate our transition to electric vehicles, which is critical at a time when federal clean car standards are under attack. This is exactly the kind of bold action we need to fight climate change, protect public health, and drive forward a zero-emissions future. We urge the State Senate and Assembly to pass this measure before the end of session so all New Yorkers can breathe a little easier.”

Stephen Dodge, Director of State Regulatory Affairs, Clean Fuels Alliance America, said, “New York has a critical opportunity to lead on climate by adopting a Clean Fuels Standard that supports low-carbon solutions like biodiesel and renewable diesel. California’s success shows what’s possible—these fuels now make up almost 79% of the state’s transportation diesel pool under its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, with no adverse impact on consumers. By following this proven path, New York can cut emissions, improve air quality, support local jobs, and deliver cleaner, affordable fuel options for consumers.”

Deb Peck Kelleher, Deputy Director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE NY), said, “The Clean Fuel Standard is the jumpstart legislation our state needs to help New Yorkers breathe cleaner air. It is time for New York to unleash the power of the marketplace to reduce our climate emissions and increase funding towards our electric school bus transition. This effort will improve the health outcomes for our school kids and all New Yorkers. We must take steps to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of fuels and build a domestic energy supply chain. This legislation furthers those goals.”

Matt Tomich, President, Energy Vision, said, “New York’s transportation sector is its second largest greenhouse gas emitter and a major source of toxic air pollution. Diesel truck exhaust contributes to smog and acid rain, harms health, and kills 3,000 New Yorkers annually. By far the worst offenders are thousands of heavy-duty diesel trucks built before 2013 still on our roads. A CFS would enable replacing them with cleaner fuel trucks.”

Cyn S French, Co-Founder and EVP Feedstock of LF Bioenergy, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard program is critical to opening markets for New York's agricultural and dairy economies, meeting consumer demands and farmers' needs with locally produced food and locally produced cleaner energy. Both benefit the state today with an RNG estimated value of $4.8B, providing 38,500 jobs while the dairy industry contributes $13.8B in wages, $50B in economic impact and 180,000 jobs. We put Farmers First in New York!”

Anthony Willingham, Government Affairs & Public Policy Lead – State Government for Electrify America, said, “A Clean Fuel Standard is one of the most powerful tools New York has to cut emissions, accelerate transportation electrification, and meet its climate goals. By incentivizing cleaner fuels without burdening taxpayers or drivers, it creates a sustainable funding source for clean energy investments. Amid economic and political uncertainty, passing this measure would affirm New York’s leadership in climate action and signal to the clean fuels industry—especially EV charging providers—that the state is a premier market for investment.”

Lewis Dubuque, Vice President of Chapter Management at the National Waste & Recycling Association, said, “The National Waste and Recycling Association (NWRA) supports the effort to enact the Clean Fuel Standard bill before the end of the legislative session. Such a standard will create more jobs in New York State with the production of renewable fuels while reducing emissions NWRA has supported similar bills in other states like California, where they have been enacted into law. We urge the State Legislature to pass the bill and add New York to the list of states that are working hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector.”

Emily Kelly, Director of US Public Policy at ChargePoint, said, “Clean Fuel Standard is an established policy that has proven to help accelerate the transition to electric mobility by establishing a reliable and self-sustaining investment signal for electric vehicle charger deployment. This policy will increase the number of chargers across the state, providing more New York drivers with access to clean and lower cost fueling options.”",https://www.nysenate.gov/sites/default/files/2025/05/27/clean-fuels-crop-5-27-25.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 19:06:47.283371

They last twenty years, if they aren't damaged by a tornado or something. There weren't a huge number of solar panels out there twenty years go.

Solar panels contain silver. The solar industry used about 700 million ounces of silver in 2024. That's a scrap value of $23 billion for panels produced in one year. To say nothing of the scrap value of copper, aluminum, and tin, which is a decent revenue stream when silver is paying the cost of recycling.

Even solar glass has recycling value. Household glass is often just downcycled as concrete fill, because the value of the material is lower than the cost of transport. Solar glass is low in iron, it is significantly more transparent and more expensive, it is worth recycling. (Iron gives regular glass a green tint which is visible in thick sections, it also blocks near IR). The sticking point is that there are different types of glass in use, including some that contain antimony, which has to be kept out of recycling streams for food packaging.

Wind + solar outproduced coal + nuclear In Q1 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 19% of the US total, up from 17% year-over-year.
During Q1 2025, wind + solar provided 6.8% more electricity than coal and 6% more than US nuclear power plants.
In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31%, respectively.
EIA forecast strong growth for renewables The growth of solar, wind, and other renewables is consistent with several forecasts issued by EIA during the past five months.","All renewable energy sources, including wind + solar, produced more than a quarter of US electrical generation in Q1 2025 and provided nearly a third of total US electrical generation in March alone, according to US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign.

Solar set a new record in Q1 2025

In EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through March 31, 2025), the data confirmed that solar continues to be the fastest-growing source of electricity.

Utility-scale (>1 megawatt (MW)) solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 43.9% while “estimated” small-scale (rooftop) solar PV increased by 11.1% during Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 33.7% and was almost 6.8% of total US electrical generation for January to March, up from 5.3% a year earlier. As a consequence, solar-generated electricity surpassed the output of US hydropower plants (5.7%).

In March alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar increased by 45.6% while that from small-scale systems rose by 13%. Combined, they provided 9.1% of US electrical output during the month.

Wind had a strong first quarter

Wind turbines across the US produced 9.5% more electricity in Q1 2025 than they did a year before.

That output was nearly one-eighth (12.2%) of total US electrical generation and more than double that produced by US hydropower plants.

In March alone, wind-generated electricity increased by 11.1% and provided 14.8% of the US electricity supply.

Wind + solar outproduced coal + nuclear

In Q1 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 19% of the US total, up from 17% year-over-year. In just the month of March, solar + wind accounted for 23.9% of U electrical output.

During Q1 2025, wind + solar provided 6.8% more electricity than coal and 6% more than US nuclear power plants. In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31%, respectively.

Renewables’ electrical output is closing in on natural gas

The mix of all renewables – wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, geothermal – produced 10.5% more electricity in Q1 2025 than they did a year ago (12.5% more in March alone) and provided 26.1% of total US electricity production compared to 24.8% year-over-year.

Electrical generation by all renewables combined in March alone reached a new record and provided 31.9% of total US electrical generation. For the first time, it nipped at the heels of natural gas (34.8%), which saw a drop in electrical output of 8.9%.

For perspective, five years ago (May 2020), the mix of renewables provided 21.9% of total electrical generation while natural gas accounted for 41.9%. A decade ago (May 2015), renewables provided 15.1% of total generation while natural gas provided 30.5%; most of the balance was accounted for by coal (33.5%), and nuclear power provided 19.9%.

The renewables mix has strengthened its position as the second largest source of electrical generation, behind only natural gas, with the gap closing rapidly.

EIA forecast strong growth for renewables

The growth of solar, wind, and other renewables is consistent with several forecasts issued by EIA during the past five months.

In its “Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory” report issued in late December 2024, EIA forecast 32.5 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity to be added to the grid in 2025, along with 7.7 GW of new wind capacity and 18.2 GW of utility-scale battery storage.

Similarly, in early spring, EIA released its “Annual Energy Outlook 2025” report that explores potential longer-term US energy trends. In it, the agency foresees a nearly 50% increase in installed solar capacity during the Trump administration’s term. Moreover, electrical generation by grid-connected PV solar during that time would more than double from 201.1 billion kilowatt-hours (bKWh) to 420.1 bKWh. Onshore wind generation would rise from 153.4 bKWh to 175.4 bKWh while offshore wind could increase from 0.2 bKWh to 18.7 bKWh.

Finally, in its “Short-Term Energy Outlook” report issued in early May, EIA projected 26.3% growth in solar installations in 2025, increasing from 121 GW of installed capacity at the end of 2024 to 153 GW by the end of this year. It expects another 19.5% growth in cumulative capacity next year, reaching 182 GW by the end of 2026. During that period, actual generation would grow from 0.217 trillion kilowatt-hours (tKWh) to 0.343 tKWh. Wind would expand from 0.453 tKWh to 0.494 tKWh.

“Renewable energy sources, led by solar and wind, are clearly outpacing fossil fuels and nuclear power,” said the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “It therefore defies logic that the Trump administration and the Republican Congress would be trying to curtail that growth in favor of dirtier and more expensive technologies.”

Detroit is modeling how to co-create clean energy solutions with communities by combining urban revitalization efforts with sustainability goals. The Motor City’s climate goals are ambitious: by 2034, Detroit aims to power 100% of its municipal buildings with clean energy and source 50% of its electricity from clean sources in the next three years. Along the way, the city is advancing a range of co-benefits, including improved public health, more energy efficiency and affordability, and quality jobs and opportunities.

As part of this strategy, Detroit‘s Office of Sustainability and Department of Neighborhoods are teaming up to implement the city’s Neighborhood Solar Initiative, which will build solar arrays on vacant land surrounded by communities that benefit from the repurposed space. Five neighborhoods were selected based on resident interest, and a total of 167 acres of land are being fitted with solar fields, raised gardening beds and other landscaping enhancements. Spearheaded by Mayor Mike Duggan and informed by input from thousands of Detroiters, the effort is one of the first steps to achieving the city’s larger climate goals. By providing clean energy and engaging residents and local nonprofits, Solar Neighborhoods will make new use of vacant areas and offer money-saving energy efficiency upgrades for surrounding homes.

I spoke with Tepfirah Rushdan, Detroit’s Director of Sustainability, to learn more about the city’s Solar Neighborhoods, how communities have been involved during every step of the process and her advice for other local leaders looking to build more sustainable futures for their cities.

How does the Solar Neighborhoods project fit into Detroit’s larger climate and energy strategy?

The Solar Neighborhoods project is one of several strategies the City of Detroit is employing to address climate change and the one that has the most direct resident impact. By generating enough clean energy to power 127 city municipal buildings, we can offset that amount of fossil fuel usage. Unlike other cities, which build solar hundreds of miles away, Detroit is taking mostly vacant land in its own neighborhoods and putting it back to an important use that benefits the surrounding neighborhoods specifically, and the entire city more generally.

As a city, we also are investing significantly in conversion of our vehicle fleet to fully electric, hybrid and in some cases, hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles. As part of our Climate Strategy, we are working to reduce the carbon footprint of our own facilities and will be requiring our larger privately owned buildings to take similar steps through Energy and Water Benchmarking ordinance.

We also are proud of our partnership with American Forest and others to plant 75,000 new trees in Detroit to help rebuild our tree canopy.

Why is community input important with this project?

Simply put, community input is what has driven this project from the beginning. Mayor Mike Duggan made it clear from the outset that solar fields would be placed only in neighborhoods that actively sought the opportunity and had overwhelming support from residents living there. This is contrary to how solar projects often are sited in other cities and states against the expressed wishes of nearby residents.

Most important to us is that every one of the remaining homeowner occupants living inside the planned solar array footprint voluntarily chose to accept offers to purchase their homes and to assist with relocation to a new home.

For the few that did not wish to leave, we simply redrew the boundary of the solar array to carve them out of it. Not only did this mean they would stay in their longtime home, but this change also put them in the community benefits area of the neighborhood, entitling them to thousands of dollars of energy efficiency upgrades to their home at no cost to them.

How are you ensuring communities’ desires and concerns are properly heard? How often – and in what ways – are you involving members of the community with this project?

Through our Department of Neighborhoods and Office of Sustainability, we conducted extensive community engagement process, to make sure every resident living in each of the solar neighborhoods fully understood the proposal and their options. We held numerous community meetings and also went door-to-door to make sure we reached each resident.

Our approach was to take as much time as necessary to make sure everyone’s questions were answered so they could make the decision that was best for them, their families and their neighborhood.

How has the input from community members shaped the different solar array lots? What will the final lots look like?

Community input has played a huge role in this project. It was community feedback that set us in the direction of creating a community benefits program for homeowners living in the solar neighborhood, but outside of the actual arrays. That was one of the biggest factors for generating neighborhood-wide support for the project.

Not only did neighbors decide for themselves if a solar array made sense for their neighborhood, they also drove the process on how they will look. Residents came together to design the appearance of the grounds inside and outside of the arrays.

They chose from decorative fencing options, perennials and ornamental trees to serve as attractive visual buffers, as well as flower meadows and/or agrivoltaics inside the arrays, and the results are stunning.

These graphics show the variety of the solar fields, with communities working with the developers to select the layouts that best met their needs, down to the types of plants and fencing that will be installed.

What other benefits will communities receive from the Solar Neighborhoods project?

The most obvious benefit of the Solar Neighborhoods initiative is the blight removal and putting large tracts of vacant land that had become an attractive nuisance for illegal dumping and other undesirable activity back to an attractive, productive and purposeful use. This alone, was important to residents in these neighborhoods who often felt they had been forgotten.

The more personal benefit will be felt by owner occupied homes in each Solar Neighborhood who stayed and live just outside of the arrays. Depending on the number of acres each neighborhood is producing in solar, each homeowner occupant will receive between $15,000 and $25,000 in energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to help reduce energy usage and help lower their energy costs. These upgrades recently began in our Phase One neighborhoods, where homeowners picked from a list of upgrades including new windows or a new roof, energy efficient furnaces and water heaters, or even their own solar panels.

What advice do you have for other local officials looking to build clean energy projects in their cities or towns?

Listen to residents because they are the ones who will be living with the result. We firmly believe that Detroit’s Solar Neighborhoods project was so enthusiastically supported because we let neighbors decide whether they wanted a solar array in their neighborhood and we took the time to understand and address their concerns.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//54503788998_676291100d_c.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 17:09:19.739882

The 19th

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th. Meet Jessica and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.

The Trump administration wants to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a little-known piece of the social safety net that helps low-income people pay their utility bills.

Congress created the program in 1981, initially to help people pay for heating in the winter. The program — which has had broad bipartisan support — has increasingly been used to pay for cooling as summers grow hotter and more dangerous to human health due to climate change.

At a recent budget hearing, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the program a “lifesaver” for residents in Alaska when questioning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about its future.

Kennedy acknowledged the importance of the program but also said Trump’s proposal to eliminate the funding was based on the expectation of lower future energy prices. Yet according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential energy prices are expected to go up in much of the country at least through 2026.

Murkowski and lawmakers from across the aisle have been pressuring the administration to commit to funding the program, which provided $4.1 billion to states, territories and tribal nations in fiscal 2025. But the administration has not only called to defund the program in its entirety, but also has put the staff that administer the program at Health and Human Services (HHS) on leave.

Advocates say the end of the program could be disastrous for households who rely on other government benefits that are also under threat, like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, which are both facing deep cuts.

As the funding of LIHEAP continues to be debated on the national level, here’s an explanation of what the program does and who it helps:

What does the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program do?

LIHEAP helps about 6 million households pay their heating- and cooling-related utility bills annually and prevents disconnections through an emergency assistance fund. The payments typically go directly to the utility companies.

States tailor the program to best fit the needs of residents. For example, in places like Arizona, where extreme heat kills hundreds of people a year, a higher allocation of funding goes to cooling assistance. In some states, funds can be used to repair furnaces or air conditioning units.

States are required to account for both a household’s income and its energy burden, or the percentage of a family’s income that goes to pay utility bills, to target those most at risk for utility disconnections.

Low-income households typically have higher energy burdens, often due to homes with poor insulation or drafty windows and doors.

Who does it help?

The LIHEAP program targets households with family members who are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. In fiscal 2023, the program reached 2.1 million households where a resident had a disability; nearly 1 million households that had small children; and 2.4 million households that housed an elderly person.

Both children and the elderly are more sensitive to extreme temperatures because they are physiologically less able to regulate their body temperature. People with complex medical needs also shoulder higher energy costs, due to electricity-dependent medical equipment.

Single parents, who are disproportionately women, are more likely to be energy insecure, as are rural residents, Black, Indigenous and Latinx households.

And the people who utilize the program are usually on the brink of an emergency — either already disconnected from their utility or on the verge of it. “By the time they’re reaching out for help, it’s that their situation has escalated,” said Diana Hernandez, an associate professor and sociologist at Columbia University who studies energy insecurity.

Only about 17 percent of eligible households receive LIHEAP assistance, said Hernandez, who has been pushing to increase funding for the program.

“The money always runs out,” she said.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state officials to implement LIHEAP, said electricity costs are going up at a higher rate than inflation and that rising temperatures are also leading to a greater need for cooling.

“In Southwestern states the length of the [heat waves are] getting longer,” Wolfe said. “The bills are going up, and a lot of housing is just poorly built … so the costs are going up faster than expected,” he said.

Why is it important?

LIHEAP has multiple benefits that all center on keeping people safe and healthy in their homes, advocates say.

While in many states residents have some protection from a utility disconnecting their electricity, without energy assistance programs like LIHEAP more households would likely keep their homes at dangerous temperatures to keep their bills down.

In a Census Household Pulse Survey from 2024, nearly 23 percent of households reported keeping their homes at unsafe temperatures over the previous 12 months due to rising energy costs.

But doing so is risky in places like Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. While there is a moratorium on electricity shutoffs during the summer, in 2024, 138 people died indoors of a heat-related cause, with 18 percent of those deaths in a home where the AC was functioning but not turned on. Seventy percent did not have a working AC unit in a place where average summer temperatures are over 100 degrees.

These deaths occurred in a state where over 20,000 households received LIHEAP assistance in fiscal 2023, according to the National Energy Utility Affordability Coalition, which tracks state use of funds.

Without the program, “we’ll be having more and more of these unnecessary deaths,” Wolfe said.

Helping to pay energy bills has also been shown to help keep families more food secure. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 20 percent of U.S. households said they skipped meals and medicines to pay for electricity bills in 2020, a time when households were under additional stress due to the pandemic. And in a 2019 survey of LIHEAP recipients, 36 percent said that before they began to receive energy assistance, they went without food for at least a day to pay utility bills.

It’s called the “heat or eat” phenomenon.

“Just because the bill gets paid, people should not assume that that’s not at great cost,” said Olivia Wein, senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. But with multiple social welfare programs facing deep cuts, “it’s going to be harder and harder for people to do that, to juggle enough to get the bills paid on time,” she said.

Wein points out that people’s housing security could also be impacted. Maintaining a utility connection is a condition on many housing leases, and without LIHEAP, more people could face evictions, Wein fears.

She’s also worried children could be taken from their parents. “Not having heat in the winter could result in Child Protective Services getting involved because your home is not habitable,” she said. “So there are all of these ripple effects from unaffordable energy that we will unfortunately see on the grand scale without a strong LIHEAP program.”

Where does the program stand now?

For fiscal 2025, all of the program’s funding has already been released, so residents won’t see an impact until fiscal 2026, which starts in September. But even if the program is funded, Wein says there will be issues with disbursement because of the federal layoffs.

While each state develops individual programs, they still have to run their plans by the federal agency every year to determine state allocations, Wein said. This plan is also accompanied by a complicated formula that happens each time funding is released. Right now only four people are managing the LIHEAP program on the federal level; after the entire office was laid off in April. Wein predicts this will delay funding being sent to the states.

HHS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Additionally, community action agencies, places around the country where people go to apply for benefits like LIHEAP, could be shut down, due to a separate move to defund the Community Services Block Grant. This would make it harder for residents to apply to the program. “We need that funding as part of our whole ecosystem,” Wein said.

Trump also sought to zero out LIHEAP funding in his first term, but Congress ultimately is in charge of approving a budget. But Wein said the precarity of the program feels different this time around. “Congress is really looking at cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting. … Things that you would never imagine being cut like entitlement programs are in live discussion right now. So that’s the unknown.”

Advocates say that there really isn’t any other comparable safety net for residents seeking energy assistance if LIHEAP ends up being cut. Though alternatives like charitable giving and religious organizations can help pay for energy costs, it doesn’t come close to meeting the needs of 6 million people who were previously reached by the program, Wein said.

“There is no easy fix and there is no comprehensive fix to losing LIHEAP,” she said. “Every state is going to be devastated with the loss of this funding.”

Borrowing computer modeling concepts that have been used to study the oceans, the researchers refined them to work with the Great Lakes.

Drew Gronewold is an associate professor at UM’s School of Environment and Sustainability. He said when we talk about heat waves on land, people understand.

“So this paper is taking that idea that we’re very familiar with on land and applying it to temperatures in the lakes.”

The problem to overcome was that we don’t have all the data needed across eight decades to look at water temperatures during the most extreme heat waves or cold periods.

“There are periods in time or locations on the lake either at the surface or at depth that we just don’t have a measurement for. So, this is where developing high-powered computer models comes in. And that’s a huge part of this study,” said Gronewold.

Lead author of the study, postdoctoral research fellow Hazem Abdelhady, said the study analyzed how extremes have affected the lakes over the last 80 years and found they’ve intensified sharply in their strength, more than doubling.

That is in keeping with climate change predictions.

The findings are not just about colder colds and hotter heat waves. They have real world consequences.

“Stronger extremes can disrupt ecosystems, threaten fisheries, degrade water quality, and stress coastal infrastructure like drinking water intakes and nuclear power plant cooling systems,” Abdelhady said.

Past studies have shown that of the large lakes in the world, Lake Superior was among those warming fastest.

“Lake Superior continues to warm rapidly and, based on our findings, now shows the largest increase in heatwave intensity among all the Great Lakes,” Abdelhady said.

That does not mean Lake Superior is the warmest lake; it means it is warming the most quickly.

The research was published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment.

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it's unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada.

MISO's forecast says there should be enough electricity in the region this summer though ""there is the potential for elevated risk during extreme weather.""

Consumers Energy is planning to close Campbell as part of a transition to cleaner energy. The power plant opened in 1962 in western Michigan's Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people, the utility said.

“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday.

The utility said it will comply with the order, which expires Aug. 21.

""Yes, the plant will stay on and produce electricity,"" spokesperson Brian Wheeler said Tuesday.

An environmental group, the Sierra Club, panned the government order.

“Coal is expensive, outdated and deadly. ... Consumers Energy is right to finally retire this hugely expensive plant that is costing Michiganders their lives,” attorney Greg Wannier said, referring to the health effects of coal emissions.

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.

In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

No other details were released, and HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about how the decision was made.

Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing.

“There's no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.

The idea of changing the recommendations is not completely out of the blue. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.

A CDC advisory panel is set to meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.

But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel's review. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision.

Some physicians and public health leaders expressed concern that HHS officials disregarded a scientific review process that has been in place for decades, in which experts — in public meetings — review current medical evidence and hash out the pros and cons of policy changes.

“It's a dangerous precedent. If you can start doing that with this vaccine, you can start doing that with any vaccine you want — including mumps-measles-rubella,” said Osterholm, referring to another vaccine that Kennedy has voiced doubts about.

He and others said the announcement raises an array of questions, including whether health insurance companies will keep covering COVID-19 vaccinations and how hard it will be now for people who want the shots to get them.

“The reason we give vaccines to healthy people is to keep them safe,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.

More than 1.2 million people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19, most of them elderly. But children haven't been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Battacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.

Earlier this year, during the nomination process, Kennedy gave assurances to wavering Republicans that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule.

But since then, Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees have made big changes to the system for approval and use of vaccines.

They added restrictions to a recent vaccine approval. Last week, the FDA announced routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.

Among the confusion created by Tuesday's announcement, experts said, was the implication that the coronavirus isn't dangerous to pregnant women.

During the height of the pandemic, deaths of women during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth soared to their highest level in 50 years. Indeed, pregnancy was on the list of health conditions that would qualify someone for a COVID-19 vaccination under FDA’s new guidance “framework” announced last week.

Vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it's a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections.

“To say that they are not at any risk is simply incorrect,” said Dr. Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: “The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”

Amid the ongoing tariff tensions between the US and China, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., better known as CATL, is set to start trading in Hong Kong after raising $4.6 billion in the secondary listing.

In April, a congressional committee called for withdrawal from a deal by two US banks working on the listing, Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The committee cited a Pentagon blacklist which included CATL and several other prominent Chinese firms with alleged links to the Chinese military. The blacklist carries no specific sanctions and CATL denies the allegations. Both banks decided to move forward with the deal, while CATL opted to pursue a Regulation S offering, which excludes sales to US onshore investors and exempts the issuer from certain US regulatory filing obligations.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports and desires to cut funding for US green projects threaten battery makers. A Republican budget blueprint to save $560 billion on clean energy tax credits over 10 years, would end them for EVs after next year and for homes after this year. A proposal to disqualify companies from claiming key tax credits if they use components or critical minerals imported from certain countries, including China, would effectively kill the credits even sooner.

After a tough year in 2024 as battery prices declined, analysts see revenue from CATL’s power battery systems topping $68 billion by 2029, a steep increase from the $35 billion it reported in 2024. In the same period its energy storage battery revenue may grow from $8 billion to $22 billion. CATL, which controls 35% of the global EV battery market, was ahead of rivals with an operating margin of 15% and R&D spending of $2.58 billion in 2024. It also maintained better debt to equity ratios and free cash flow.

CATL’s Hong Kong listing is designed to help fund a battery plant in Hungary, adding to a facility in Germany and a planned factory in Spain. Trade tensions with the US and Republican efforts to sunset clean energy initiatives have led CATL to try to shield itself by licensing its technology, increasing research and development, and sourcing materials from more neutral regions. First-quarter R&D expenses increased 11%.

CATL will need to keep innovating to stay on the cutting edge and maintain market dominance.

The Republicans are so deeply in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry that they probably are choking on lint. So, the fact that they’re discussing something as radical in its denial as this should surprise approximately nobody. From :

The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times. In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

This is, of course, nonsense.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

EPA boss Lee Zeldin—whose qualifications for the job include being a career politician who lost a campaign for governor of New York—had a rough time of it in front of congressional committees last week. (He and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, had a heated exchange during the senator’s time to question him.) But these proposed changes are a perfect example of the administration’s blasé hand-waving of the climate crisis and of why Zeldin is the perfect huckster to sell the country on bad air and rising seas.

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies. The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

Challenges and Opportunities: The changing trade policies and tariffs have created a significant level of uncertainty within the energy sector.

This dynamic environment presents both challenges and opportunities for investors, compelling them to navigate a complex web of trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical shifts.

Challenges and Opportunities: The changing trade policies and tariffs have created a significant level of uncertainty within the energy sector. This has led to a cautious approach toward M&A activities. While new energy deal kickoffs on Datasite, an M&A platform that facilitates around 19,000 new deals annually, remained flat in the first four months of this year compared to the previous year, hold rates increased by two percentage points, and deal closure rates jumped by nine percentage points.

COMMENTARY

This trend mirrors global activity, where new deal kickoffs, especially in asset sales and mergers, on Datasite rose 4% year-over-year (YoY), during the first four months of the year. Similarly, deal hold rates on Datasite increased by four percentage points during the same period.

However, the impact of tariffs has been palpable. Global deal starts on Datasite dropped by 15% YoY in April, following an 11% surge in the first quarter. This drop coincided with the first major U.S. tariff announcement on April 2. Consequently, deal completion odds also declined, sinking to 44%, down from 49% YoY.

Effects on Oil and Gas M&A: The uncertainty induced by tariffs has notably affected the oil and gas M&A market. Many deals have been pulled back or put on hold as global buyers conduct more thorough due diligence. The use of virtual data rooms, where buyers interrogate deal information using question and answer tools, has become increasingly common. Tariff risk analysis is now a critical component of every valuation model.

Counterbalancing Factors: Despite the challenges, there are factors driving deal activity within the energy sector. Technological innovation, cost reductions, and rising demand for zero-carbon solutions are creating opportunities for M&A. These developments provide a measure of counterbalance to the negative impact of tariffs and trade uncertainties.

For example, with demand and energy consumption by data centers, especially those powering artificial intelligence, projected to grow by 10% to 15% annually through 2030, companies are racing to secure resources and infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centers, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence (AI) could more than double by 2026, reaching more than 1,000 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually, roughly equivalent to Japan’s total electricity consumption.

Much of this growth is driven by AI models requiring intensive computing resources, particularly large language models and generative AI applications that depend on vast server farms. This trend is prompting renewed interest in nuclear power as a stable, carbon-neutral energy source capable of supporting around-the-clock operations without the intermittency challenges of solar or wind. However, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions on critical materials like enriched uranium and advanced reactor components could slow progress. As a result, businesses must carefully account for these regulatory, logistical, and supply chain variables when evaluating potential investments in the evolving energy landscape.

Navigating Unpredictability: The volatility in the trade environment necessitates vigilance among dealmakers. Policy changes can either accelerate or delay deal timelines, and preparation is key. Anticipating increased levels of review and longer review processes is crucial. Leveraging technology, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), can expedite the due diligence process and enhance efficiency.

The Role of AI in M&A: AI is already transforming the M&A landscape by identifying potential targets, automating due diligence, and using predictive analytics to improve accuracy. Currently, one in five dealmakers employs generative AI in the M&A process, and many rank AI adoption as their top operational priority this year.

Strategies for Success: To thrive in this evolving landscape, dealmakers must strengthen their due diligence processes, strategically use AI, anticipate regulatory scrutiny, and stay ahead of geopolitical shifts. Proactive strategies, including prioritizing deal readiness and leveraging technology to mitigate risks, will be essential for success.

While the global tariff war has introduced significant challenges for European energy M&A, it has also underscored the importance of adaptability and innovation.

David Uhlmann, a former EPA official and environmental law attorney, stressed in the webinar the need to take politics out of environmental protection.","There are more than 20,000 abandoned oil and gas wells scattered across West Virginia, putting communities at risk for water contamination and increased exposure to environmental pollutants.

State lawmakers said a new law will make it easier to fill those wells. Previously, state code required removal of mining infrastructure before wells could be plugged with cement and other materials.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

Indiana's rural communities could lose out under a new federal bill aimed at speeding up clean energy development.

What Republicans are calling the One Big Beautiful Bill, part of President Donald Trump's tax package, includes major changes to how energy and infrastructure projects get environmental approval.

Lawmakers rewrote parts of the National Environmental Policy Act, to shorten timelines and block lawsuits that often delay big builds.

Supporters say the changes will fast-track everything from solar farms to broadband.

But Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, warned that the new rules may push developers to focus on easier, cheaper sites.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing Environmental Protection Agency general counsel, who say that 90% of the details NEPA review are purely there for litigation proofing,"" said Hochman. ""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

As the Environmental Protection Agency scales back enforcement because of staff shortages and new federal rollbacks, concerns are growing in Michigan and across the country about who will hold polluters accountable.

Michigan, with more than 11,000 inland lakes and access to four Great Lakes holding 90% of the nation's freshwater, faces challenges as EPA budget cuts reduce enforcement by nearly 20% and eliminate more than 200 staff.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a recent webinar that his organization commissions polling and focus groups every two years on clean-water issues in the Great Lakes.

""And it's an 85% issue. It's almost as if, when you push people and you say, 'How much should we do to protect the Great Lakes and restore them?' he asked, ""It's like, whatever it costs, you do it.""

Supporters of EPA cuts, especially in energy, manufacturing and agriculture, contend strict environmental rules are too costly for businesses. In late 2024, more than 100 industry groups urged then-President-elect Donald Trump to roll back regulations they said were ""strangling"" the economy.

Partisanship continues to shape the debate over environmental laws, with lawmakers often split along party lines when it comes to regulations.

David Uhlmann, a former EPA official and environmental law attorney, stressed in the webinar the need to take politics out of environmental protection.

""The environmental laws require EPA working with the state to promote clean air, healthy rivers and streams, to make sure that we're living in communities free of toxic waste,"" he said. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

In Fiscal Year 2024, the EPA's enacted budget was more than $9 billion, with a workforce of more than 15,000 employees.

U.S. consumer demand for renewable energy continues to grow, with more solar panel capacity installed in 2024 than in 2023, which saw more than in 2022. But U.S. trade policy is in flux, and high tariffs have been imposed on imported solar panels, which may cause shortages.

I am a scholar who studies the Sun, as well as an entrepreneur who is working to harness its power here on Earth by creating new designs for generating solar electricity. As part of that effort, I’ve studied market trends and manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and abroad. Right now, U.S. manufacturers do not produce enough solar panels to meet the nation’s demand, but industry investments and federal tax incentives have been making progress, though recent federal moves have created uncertainty.

In 2024, U.S. installers put up enough solar panels to generate 50 gigawatts of electricity – enough to power New York City for a year.

U.S. manufacturers made only a small fraction of that – 4.2 GW of solar modules in the first half of 2024. That was a big boost, though – a 75% increase compared with the same period in 2023. And the prices were roughly three times the cost of imports.

A look at recent imports

In 2024, the U.S. imported far more panels than the country needed, suggesting developers may be stockpiling panels for future projects.

Most of those imported panels were made in Asia, particularly Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand. In fact, nearly all of the U.S.-made panels used at least some components from overseas. China currently makes about 97% of the world’s supply of photovoltaic wafers, which are building blocks of solar panels.

The effects of proposed U.S. trade policies on the solar industry remain unclear. Through 2024, manufacturing continued a yearslong ramp-up to take advantage of government policies favoring domestic manufacturing. And imported panels seem slated to suffer from ever-increasing tariffs, which drive up costs.

Domestic production rises

Since 2010, U.S. solar panel production has increased about eightfold. But U.S.-made panels are more expensive than imported alternatives. In 2024, U.S.-made panels typically cost 31 cents per watt, but imported panels, even including tariffs that existed before President Donald Trump’s second term, cost about one-third of that: 11 cents per watt.

But domestic manufacturers are bringing costs down by ramping up production while relying on the government to maintain or increase tariffs on imports, which may make U.S. panels more competitive domestically in the future.

Reliance on overseas sources

Despite that increase in domestic production, U.S. demand for solar panels has grown even faster. To meet demand, the U.S. imports a substantial portion of its solar photovoltaic modules.

Tariffs, including a 30% tariff on solar cells and solar panels starting in 2018, aimed to boost domestic manufacturing.

But those tariffs and falling global prices made solar installations more costly in the U.S. than in the rest of the world. The average global cost of installed solar systems dropped from $1.15 per watt in 2012 to $0.72 per watt in 2016, nearly half that of U.S. installations.

The 2018 tariffs, as well as earlier rounds in 2012 and 2014, have shifted the source of U.S. imports of solar panels – from China and Taiwan to Malaysia and South Korea. Manufacturers are also building solar panels in Singapore and Germany to maintain access to the U.S. market. And Chinese companies are even investing in U.S. solar manufacturers to take advantage of federal incentives and avoid tariffs.

New tariffs emerge

Trump’s proposal for new tariffs on foreign-made solar goods, including panels and components, particularly target Chinese-owned companies in Southeast Asia.

They could include a potential 375% tariff on Thai products – nearly quadrupling prices – and a 3,500% tariff on products from Cambodia.

In contrast, U.S.-made solar panels will be cheaper. But a reduced supply of solar panels will raise prices even of domestic-made panels, at least until U.S. manufacturing can catch up with the demand. Some developers have begun to delay or cancel solar installations to address rising costs.

Domestic investment

Due in large part to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022, the U.S. solar panel industry has seen significant investments.

Since the law’s enactment, more than 95 GW of manufacturing capability have been added across the solar supply chain in the U.S., including new facilities that in a year can construct enough solar panels to produce nearly 42 GW, beyond existing manufacturing levels. This growth in manufacturing capabilities is largely located in Texas and Georgia.

Still, the new administration’s shifting priorities and trade policies make the landscape uncertain. Before Trump began discussing various solar-related trade policies, the industry projected it would install an average of 45 GW of solar panels every year for the next decade.

We need to build more affordable homes and the infrastructure that surrounds them. And, wherever possible, we should be building them with Canadian materials.

But if there’s another thing that the majority of Canadians agree on, it’s that more housing should not come at the cost of meeting our climate goals. We talk a lot about the need to heat, cool and power our homes with renewable energy to reduce emissions. But what’s talked about less are the emissions caused by building those homes in the first place.

Producing construction materials like concrete, steel, drywall and insulation causes significant industrial emissions. Before you get the keys to your new home, it has already locked in 20 to 120 tonnes of emissions. At the high end, that’s equivalent to 30 years of driving the average gas-powered car. For the housing build-out we need to see by 2030, that would mean more than a year’s worth of Canada’s total emissions from the entire economy.

In short, we cannot ignore the climate consequences of the housing debate. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s housing plan promises that low-emissions materials will be prioritized in the build-out, but in a housing crisis, there may be worries about a trade-off between green and affordable, or between green and fast.

Thankfully, cleaner options are already available, and they do not need to cost more. A new report by Clean Energy Canada shows that low-emissions alternatives for concrete, steel, insulation and drywall are available at no or negligible-cost premiums.

Drywall and insulation alternatives that cut emissions in half or even reduce emissions by as much as 98 per cent are already available at standard market rates. Even high-emissions steel and concrete can be replaced with cleaner alternatives, usually without paying extra.

Where slight cost increases were found for projects built with cleaner materials, in most cases these added up to no more than $2,000 to $3,000 per material, less than cents on the dollar for multi-million-dollar projects that deal with larger cost variations every day.

What’s more, preferring clean materials gives Canadian producers an edge, as our relatively clean electricity grid and innovation in clean material industries have made Canadian construction materials on average cleaner than those imported.

Governments can support domestic industry by adopting a “Buy Clean” approach, requiring government-funded buildings and infrastructure to use cleaner materials and meet whole-building emissions reduction targets. At no extra cost, that means Canadian housing and infrastructure dollars are spent on clean, often Canadian, materials. Investing in clean manufacturing will also help Canadian industry be competitive in export markets like the EU, which is adopting an emissions-based import tax on a range of industrial products, including steel.

In addition to cleaner materials, construction projects can cut cost and carbon through more efficient design. Simplifying existing designs and not overbuilding can already save time, dollars, and emissions. Taking this a step further and rethinking how a building can provide the same function with less material, builders can achieve emission reductions as large as 40 per cent. Building parkades and basements underground are examples of particularly carbon-intensive structures, not to forget flood risks. Thinking about the climate, as well as cost, early on can lead to big savings.

If the new federal government is looking for ways to tie the housing crisis to the tariff war, a common solution can be found in building efficiently with clean, made-in-Canada materials.

Burning gasoline and diesel fuel releases many dangerous chemicals into the air including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which cause the creation of ground level ozone. Switching to zero-emissions vehicles and getting the most polluting cars off the road is one of the best ways to reduce air pollution. But many families believe that they can’t afford this switch. The truth is that in addition to making the air cleaner, switching to a zero-emissions vehicle can actually save you money. Read on to find out how one local program is making a big difference for drivers and the air they breathe.

Zero-Emission Vehicles are Important for Health

The Lung Association’s own “Zeroing In on Healthy Air” report series found that a nationwide switch to zero-emission vehicles, coupled with clean electricity, would have enormous benefits for health. That transition would save 110,000 lives by 2050 – and amount to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits from avoided health harms.

Another report, called Cleaner Cars, Cleaner Air, looked to California as a case study. It found that despite comprising only 19% of the state's vehicles, pre-2004 gasoline and diesel-powered cars and trucks are responsible for a significant share of harmful emissions, including 55% of nitrogen oxides and 64% of reactive organic gases from passenger vehicles. Additionally, the study highlights that pollution from these older vehicles disproportionately affects Black and Latino Americans, low-income households, and communities designated as disadvantaged.

Valley Clean Air Now (Vally CAN), located in San Joaquin Valley, the region with the worst air quality in the U.S., is responding to this need. “Here in California, we have the largest older fleet in the U.S.,” Tom Knox, executive director of Valley CAN, explains. “Old gas guzzlers are very dirty, and those older vehicles are concentrated inland where the air quality is worst.” Committed to reducing air emissions by helping everyone own a cleaner car, regardless of their economic status, Valley CAN offers programs that assist these disproportionately affected drivers in a variety of ways.

Tune In, Tune Up

In the San Joaquin Valley, like in many places nationwide, cars need to pass periodic emissions tests. Emissions testing – or “smog tests,” as they’re called in California – is one of the most tried and tested tools to help reduce unhealthy levels of air pollution in the area.

When a car is new, the smog system is rarely an issue and is exempted from emissions testing requirements for the first eight years. But once a car gets over 100,000 miles and is on its third owner, the emissions system is likely to degrade. Unfortunately, many of these owners tend to be on a tight budget, meaning upkeep and maintenance costs can be an ongoing challenge. Having to test and update their emissions system can cost over $800 to get up to code. “It is almost inevitable that a low-income driver is going to run into this problem. These are people who have to move farther out to get affordable housing, so they have to drive farther to get good paying jobs,” Tom Knox explained. “There are about 3% of vehicles that are emitting 40% of emissions in California because the people who own those cars can’t afford smog repairs.”

As cars and car repairs get more expensive, it gets harder for low-income people to keep these vehicles compliant. This is where Valley CAN steps in. For the past 20 years, the Tune In & Tune Up smog repair program has offered free vehicle emissions testing at events held all over the region. If a vehicle fails the emissions test, drivers are given a voucher for free emission-related repairs at a local STAR-certified smog shop. The program has been extremely successful, with over 70,000 low-income, disadvantaged community residents attending the events throughout the region, resulting in repairs to over 30,000 high-emitting vehicles.

Vehicle Replacement Program

In 2013, impressed by the success of Tune In & Tune Up, California Senator Fran Pavley authored a bill that added the option for a vehicle replacement program that would become Clean Cars 4 All. Starting in 2015, Vally CAN began offering income-qualified customers the opportunity to trade in their gas-guzzling vehicle for a car that required little or no gasoline. Since its inception, this program has had a very positive response in the community.

“Gas costs are a big burden for this community so the opportunity to cut that cost was a big motivator for them,” said Tom Knox. “The money earned during the first two days of work, for many families, all goes toward filling the tank. The more you drive to work the more you have to pay for gas; it is a vicious cycle. When we eliminate this expense, it is totally transformative. They love their plug-in vehicles.""

The program has replaced over 8,000 cars, with more than 80% of them going to residents of disadvantaged communities. Currently, the program offers up to $12,000 and continues to evolve as more used plug-in vehicles become available and continue to be more desirable and affordable than used gas-powered vehicles. ""We are solving the problem, which reduces stress in these people’s lives. You improve quality of life, and you improve air quality. It’s a win-win situation,” Tom exclaimed.

LRM battery chemistry, on the other hand, can help GM make its future EVs more affordable.
According to GM, the lower cost LRM prismatic cell batteries will primarily be used to expand customer choice in the electric truck and full-size SUV markets.
Pre-production of LRM battery cells is expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.
The batteries will also be validated at an unnamed LG Energy Solution facility before series production begins.","Dive Brief:

Battery engineers at General Motors and its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution have developed an improved lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cell design for the company’s future electric vehicles, the automaker announced in a May 13 press release.

The LRM battery chemistry uses a higher percentage of lower-cost manganese to replace Cobalt, a critical raw material for EV batteries, making them less costly to produce while still delivering high energy density.

GM aims to be the first major automaker to deploy LMR batteries in EVs. Its Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy plans to start commercial production of the battery cells in the U.S. by 2028 for full-size electric trucks and SUVs.

Dive Insight:

GM’s current EV models use nickel manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) batteries, which contributes to improving driving range, but are costlier manufacture. LRM battery chemistry, on the other hand, can help GM make its future EVs more affordable.

A high nickel battery cell typically consists of roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt, according to GM. But LMR cells contain around 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and “virtually no cobalt,” which can significantly reduce costs.

In addition, GM says its LMR prismatic battery cell design has 33% higher energy density compared to the best-performing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) or manganese cobalt aluminum oxide (NMCA) cells used in many EVs on the road today, and at a comparable cost.

The new LRM battery cells are not intended to replace GM’s current batteries. Rather they will be used for some electric models along with high-nickel and iron-phosphate cells for others. According to GM, the lower cost LRM prismatic cell batteries will primarily be used to expand customer choice in the electric truck and full-size SUV markets.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” said Kurt Kelty, VP of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, in the release. “As we look to engineer the ideal battery for each vehicle in our diverse EV portfolio, LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions.”

GM is targeting driving ranges of over 400 miles for its full-size electric trucks and SUVs equipped with LRM batteries, while achieving significant cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel battery cells the automaker is currently using.

The automaker said it began researching LRM battery cells a decade ago, which included prototyping cells at its Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan. The automaker accelerated its research in 2020 as its engineers collaborated with partners including LG Energy to achieve advancements in battery cathode materials, electrolytes, additives, form factors and assembly processes.

GM said researchers overcame LMR’s limitations in performance and durability that made them impractical for commercial use, according to the company.

“We’ve worked with our suppliers to optimize the materials in our LMR cells, adding proprietary dopants and coatings, along with particle engineering, process innovations, to achieve the right energy density and arrangement of battery materials inside the cell to keep them stable,” said Kushal Narayanaswamy, director of advanced battery cell engineering at GM, in a May 13 blog post.

By the end of 2024, GM said its researchers coated roughly one metric ton of LMR cathode material at the company’s Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, which included testing hundreds of large format prismatic cells in 18 different prototypes and three cell dimensions. In total, the tests were equivalent to 1.4 million miles of EV driving, according to GM.

Unlike the 4680 cylindrical cell format used by Tesla for the Model Y, prismatic cells can be stacked closer together inside an EV’s battery pack. Their flat design uses less space compared to cylindrical cell batteries, leading to higher energy density, as more cells can fit into each EV battery pack. The cells can also better dissipate heat for improved cooling performance with an outer case typically made of aluminum.

“That makes them substantially more efficient to package in full-scale trucks and SUVs,” Narayanaswamy said.

Prismatic cells also require fewer components to assemble battery packs, which contributes to lower costs. The design can reduce battery module components by 75% and total pack components by 50%, according to GM.

Pre-production of LRM battery cells is expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027. The final cell design will be validated at GM's new Battery Cell Development Center in Warren, Michigan, that’s expected to be operational by 2027. The batteries will also be validated at an unnamed LG Energy Solution facility before series production begins.

“We’re excited to introduce the first-ever LMR prismatic cells for EVs, the culmination of our decades-long research and investment in the technology,” said Wonjoon Suh, executive VP and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution, in the release. “GM’s future trucks powered by this new chemistry are a strong example of our shared commitment to offering diverse EV options to consumers.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/w7RnjI24r0x0m_t5tzUG6n6cpNXLPkzWJVcuKDLku0Q/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9MUk0tYmF0dGVyeS1HTS5qcGVn.webp,N,,2025-05-27 16:09:01.972843

“Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”","Advocates for speeding the nation’s transition to electric vehicles have joined the list of groups and individuals criticizing the massive budget reconciliation bill that was narrowly approved by U.S. House Republicans last week. In a news release distributed Tuesday, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition said the bill “takes a sledgehammer” to North Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry and would undo EV tax credits that have led to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state.

Among the provisions in current law that would be eliminated by the legislation:

a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new EV

a 30% tax credit up to $100,000 per single item or $1,000 for eligible home refueling infrastructure

a credit that supports a portion of the cost of producing certain technologies

a credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible commercial EVs under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 pounds

a credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used EV.

The bill “would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Prochazka said in the statement. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

The legislation also would implement a new car tax, which would levy an annual tax of $250 on owners of electric vehicles and $100 for owners of hybrid vehicles.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka said. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ev-charger1748369096.jpg?h=c9f93661&itok=1GzaJX57,N,,2025-05-27 15:15:09.893858

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average.
The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring.
Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023.
Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.","After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.

Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.

Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.

Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.

But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.

Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.

In Oregon, the hydroelectricity sector is estimated to have lost more than $1.5 billion in revenue over those 18 years.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/columbiagale_01-1-1024x6831748368168.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=mCeeC9O9,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:41.468163

In the new acquisition, we’ve already identified another gigawatt of possible upgrades of [smaller] peakers (gas-fired peaker power plants) to [larger] CCGTs (combined-cycle gas turbine plants).
Both the Rockland deals and the TEF (Texas Energy Fund) projects are similar strategically to what we did with LS.
The amount of power for those in Texas is about the same as the amount of Texas power we got in LS.","“When you’ve been in a world where there’s been no [U.S. power] growth for 20-plus years, soaring is 2% to 3%. Some of the [bigger] numbers that are out there, even we don’t believe. We tend to talk investors down sometimes.”

You’re making a big bet on soaring domestic energy demand, including data centers. How is that going to play out and what’s NRG’s role?

Soaring has a lot of meaning, so let me drill down if I can. There are all kinds of numbers out there. When you’ve been in a world where there’s been no [U.S. power] growth for 20-plus years, soaring is 2% to 3%. Some of the [bigger] numbers that are out there, even we don’t believe. We tend to talk investors down sometimes. Two to 3% would be enormous when you think about the amount of capital needed to get this done. So, it’s a bet, but it’s a bet that we’ve made very conservatively by buying it in a very attractive price. It’s right in our lane. This is what we’ve been doing every day for a very, very, very long time.

Our assumptions are pretty conservative, and yet we’re still looking at 40% higher earnings per share per annum growth on a compound basis. If we get soaring demand growth, that would be even better, but we don’t need soaring demand growth. We’re betting on a normal tightening of the market, but we didn’t even put tightening of the market in the numbers to get the 40% growth, just to be super clear.

I do believe that this is a demand super cycle. I get that from talking to our customers. We have the second-largest C&I (commercial and industrial) electricity book; we’re the largest residential provider in Texas; we are the largest C&I provider of natural gas. So, we have customers we talk to every day about what they’re using and what they need. We base our thoughts on demand and what really drove this acquisition was their needs.

You just talked about being conservative, but I’ll still play devil’s advocate a little bit. What if the so-called data center boom underwhelms, whether it’s from AI becoming much more energy efficient more quickly, or from just AI utilization rolling out more slowly than anticipated?

When you look at our numbers that we projected, we have put in zero for data centers. I don’t believe that’s what’s going to happen, but we’re showing compound growth per annum on an EPS (earnings per share) basis going from 10% to 14% with no data centers or other significant large load additions. I believe data centers are real, but they’re going to be on top of all the growth that we’re achieving in our core business. I think that’s really important. I’m a big believer, and we have a great data center strategy, and I think it will drive markets and tightening even further. But we don’t need it to achieve the kind of growth that we’re talking about.

Could you elaborate a bit on that data center strategy and how you see it playing out in terms of growth?

Data centers are going to be integral to U.S. economic growth, and we need to be there to power the economic growth. We already serve most of the people who are building these data centers, the hyperscalers in our C&I business. But there’s a few ways we can serve them. If you have a data center, we can sell you power for a long-term period. With this new acquisition, we have a lot more flexibility to create products for data centers that they want longer term. How much price risk do you want? Second, we have a series of sites, 21 that we have now, and another 15 that will come with the new acquisition, that have the potential either for new power plants, or new data centers, or some colocation combination of the two.

The third leg of our stool is additionality. There’s a lot of concern the data centers are going to take power off the grid. We have an agreement with GE Vernova and Kiewit for over 5 gigawatts of turbines and construction, of which we already have reserve slots for 2.4 gigs. In the new acquisition, we’ve already identified another gigawatt of possible upgrades of [smaller] peakers (gas-fired peaker power plants) to [larger] CCGTs (combined-cycle gas turbine plants). We think we have that great three-legged stool to really provide a great menu for the data center builders and users of the world.

Homing in on the LS deal more, why is it so important right now to scale up, especially in gas-fired power generation?

I think this is probably the last big fleet that was available, certainly in the competitive markets where we want to be, in particular PJM (regional transmission organization in the Midwest and Northeast) and Texas. We think those are the two most attractive markets in the country. We’re doubling our generation fleet, we’re modernizing it because the LS fleet is younger than ours, and we’re acquiring it at roughly 50% of what it would cost to build it new. Then you talk about all the upside opportunities that I mentioned with tightening prices, upgrading of the new capacity on those CCGTs. It’s very exciting. Interestingly also, it enhances our credit profiles. Rating agencies are a lot more comfortable when you have iron. The last thing is, and not to bury the lead, it was a super accretive transaction.

Did you have LS in mind for a while? How did it play out over time?

We talk to everybody all the time. Aa lot of these plants are in funds that are long lived. As you know, private equity funds have finishing days. Yes, they can extend them, but I think LS Power was looking to return capital to their investors but also have some way of playing in future benefits and growth. They all looked at IPOs, but the IPO market has been super volatile. This is a way for them to have their cake and eat it too. They’re very, very happy. We had a lot of discussions about the power of the combination, and it really fits like a glove in Texas and PJM. They will own 11% of us, which will be their largest equity investment. Eventually, we said, “We need to do this,” and we did.

Please touch on the importance of LS’ CPower component of the deal and maybe explain how the virtual power plants (VPP) work and factor into NRG?

CPower is the leading demand-response platform in the country. Demand response is really the ability to get people to turn down or turn off their power usage at peak times, rather than having to generate additional power. You’re paying them, obviously, to do that. It can be more economical to pay someone to shut down than it can be to build an extra power plant and then have to turn it on, especially if you’re talking about a limited number of hours a year. It’s kind of the same function as a peaker plant. You’re going to only get to run it a few percentage points of the number of hours in a year, but it can be super important in those times of crisis where maybe it’s 115 degrees or its 0 degrees. It’s a small part of the economics of the deal today, but, as markets tighten, we view it as something that will be more and more valuable. We have our own C&I demand-response business but, frankly, we think theirs is a better platform, and we look forward to working synergistically with them on that.

Here in Texas, we just rolled out a residential virtual power plant, which will do the same thing by people agreeing to let us work with their thermostats for short periods of time in their home, which will also be a significant help for Texas in times of particular heat and cold or other high-peak use.

Switching gears a little bit, obviously, natural gas is going to be by far the largest part of the generation portfolio. Right now, it’s closer to equal between gas and coal. What’s your take on the coal portfolio and the future of coal for NRG and maybe for the coal industry as a whole?

Coal plants are still very, very economical. and more so in a tightening market. We’re not going to build any new coal plants. I don’t know if anyone is, and I don’t know of any of that are planned. It’s also grid stability. If we shut down those plants tomorrow, there would not be enough power in Texas. It would be both grid instability and inadequate capacity. Those are two really bad things. They’re an integral part of the system, and I think they’ll remain so for the foreseeable part of the future. But I don’t see us in any way, shape, or form expanding in coal. You’re correct that our percentage of gas will be 75% to 85% [after the LS deal], depending on how you want them measure. That’s a very comfortable place to be. We can’t build a grid without gas-fired capacity today. Whatever your political persuasion is—and I did my first solar deal in 1983, so I’ve seen all the cycles—until we have some long-duration affordable storage, you can’t have an all-renewable grid even if you want one. I try to speak the truth.

Why are Texas and PJM the spots you want to continue to grow and focus?

They’re competitive markets where being a well-run company with some of the most amazing people in the industry actually makes a difference. In a regulated market, you offer one product. This is what the product is, this is what the price is, and everybody’s a taker. And we can’t compete. The ability for us to offer customized, tailored solutions of various durations to all of our customers, that’s possible in PJM and Texas, in particular. That’s why we want to be there. I’m a big believer in competitive markets, I always have been, and those are the two best competitive markets by far in the United States.

Could you discuss the smaller Rockland Capital deal (Texas gas-fired power plants acquired for $560 million in March) and, longer-term, the brownfield construction projects over the next few years (new plants built in part through loans with the Texas Energy Fund)?

We have a lot of customers in Texas. We’re the biggest retail provider here and a lot of C&I. Both the Rockland deals and the TEF (Texas Energy Fund) projects are similar strategically to what we did with LS. LS is just bigger. Rockland and those TEM projects are 2 gigs. The amount of power for those in Texas is about the same as the amount of Texas power we got in LS. Adding those 4 gigs total in Texas gives us tremendous flexibility with our generation, and it enables us—if we want—to supply our entire retail load from our own generation, which we could not do before. It gives us more and more optionality in competitive markets, which we love. All of that generation is very flexible. When there’s cheap solar and wind, we’re happy to turn off our gas plants, buy that, and resell it to our customers, instead of running our plants. The TEF program is really designed to bring more gas—non-intermittent power—online. We think it’s a great program. We have those three projects in there, and we anticipate all of them will get to close and get built.

What about the integrated generation and electric strategy? How is the home retail business going with your Reliant, Green Mountain, Direct Energy, and other brands?

We’ve been doing super well, partly because one of the things we’ve been working on is integrating our Vivint smart home business with those brands. The residential VPP I talked about is the best example, but we’ve rolled out a product called Home Essentials. If you sign up for Reliant for a certain period of time, we’ll actually give you a Vivint [security] camera and [smart] thermostat. They’re upgrading their smart home systems, so we’re expanding our horizontal share of people’s wallets.

We’re really trying to make everything energy in your home easier rather than what I would say we were doing five years ago, which is sell you electricity. There’s a big difference between selling you something you actually want and are happy to have rather than, “OK, my lights went on.” It’s a strategic rollout, first in Texas and then in other parts of the world. Unlike most companies in our space, we start with the customer and work backwards. I don’t care if you’re a homeowner or you’re a hyperscaler, we want to serve you in the most optimal way possible.

I’m going back in time a little bit, and word this probably a little poorly. So that’s my fun setup. You mentioned the success of Vivint, but it was the acquisition of Vivint in part that drew Elliot back in and led to the ouster of your predecessor, Mauricio Gutierrez, and put you in the CEO role. Could you take me through that evolution from then to now?

I think Vivint is a great company and was a very good acquisition. I think it took people a while to figure that out. We could spend hours over a drink talking about why it is, but people didn’t understand it and how we got it strategically. It was also part of a big pivot of ours towards being customer centric. And you don’t hear any more about what a terrible acquisition Vivint is. People look at the growth numbers and go, “Wow, what a great deal.” The public market sometimes wants to judge everything in a month rather than taking the time to learn it. If you look at any of the stats or growth, Vivint is killing it. And, so, Elliott made a lot of money. They are [now] out of the stock, but they made a lot of money. They were out a little bit before the [LS] acquisition, but I think they would tell you they were happy shareholders. They have a way of doing business and they make a ton of money doing it. So, I can’t really argue with them. What we have done by putting our focus on operations, by creating all of these new products, by integrating Vivint in our retail business, we’ve created a powerful platform to serve everyone.

You’ve been on the board since 2003 but, when you took over the interim CEO role, the initial expectation was eventually for an external hire.

That was certainly mine (laughing).

Obviously, things have gone well since you took over. I wanted to get your take on why you ended up in the position more permanently.

You remember The Godfather Part III, when he says, [“Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.”]. I was trying to get out, but they sucked me back in. Look, I think we started to create a real momentum of success here. There were some cultural changes. I talked about going on offense instead of defense here because, when you have an activist, it’s too easy to kind of go into a shell because you think they’re going to attack whatever you do. We started making progress and the board, after going through its process, came back to me and said, “We’d like you to finish what you started here if you’re willing to do that.” And here I am. My only goal for 2023 was to go on Medicare. I succeeded, but then I ended up with this job too. But I’m thrilled to be here and, obviously, if I didn’t love what we were doing and love the potential that we have and didn’t want to finish that journey, I would have said no. And it’s now 18 months later, and here I am.

The other thing I wanted to ask about the past is because you’ve been on the board since 2003. Prior to Gutierrez, the CEO was David Crane and his big push for renewables and green energy. That led to his ouster, and Elliot’s first involvement with the spinoff of the NRG Yield renewables business. From your board perspective, how did that play out and why was the result maybe the best thing for NRG?

I don’t think the issue was being green. I think the issue at the end of the day was economic performance. When your stock falls precipitously and stays there for an extended period of time as a CEO, you must be very convincing to your investors that you have a plan to fix that. And, for better or for worse, that wasn’t the case for David. I know everyone thought it was a rejection of all things renewable, but I think it was a rejection of things unprofitable. I think we did a lot of really good things for a while and the next iteration under Mauricio, and then kind of hit another snag period. I think this has been the most interesting time to be at NRG because of the plethora of opportunities and the desire to play offense.

Getting back to the present, how do you see geopolitics with the tariffs, but also the emphasis on American energy dominance and where things stand today?

As opposed to yesterday or tomorrow? The problem is the instability. As a CEO, I can manage into any sort of criteria you give me. The hard thing is when you change it every day. From the power industry point of view, it’s a very strange time because we’re a very defensive stock. People still use power, and they actually spend more on smart homes and security when times are uncertain. And, yet, we have enormous growth potential. That’s a very rare thing to be a defensive stock with great growth potential. It’s usually one or the other. At the end of the day, I always believe that markets will determine what our energy policy is. I do think it will be somewhat tougher in some places for renewable folks if some of those benefits go away, but people will still be building renewables in places like Texas because they’re economical and an important part of the grid. I would welcome stability more than anything else but, at the end of the day, energy has always been determined by what people want and markets rather than what anybody’s been able to dictate as a policy.

On a personal basis, I’m curious about your background. You have more conventional economics and law degrees, but then you have a doctorate in archaeology. How did you end up going that route and how you got back to here?

I came out of law school and was an energy entrepreneur for a while. I was lucky enough to sell a couple businesses and kind of made a career switch and went back to do the PhD. I’d always loved archaeology. That’s what I did on vacations, go visit sites, visit museums. And, for the first time, I didn’t have a company I wanted to start. So, I went back to school. The worst thing that can happen is I hate it, and I quit. I obviously didn’t hate it. After a few years, in 2001 and 2002, there were a whole lot of energy bankruptcies. People were looking for people who were familiar with energy but hadn’t been involved in any of the bankruptcies. Well, I’ve been in graduate school. I ended up on two boards at that time, NRG and the other one was Enron International, called Prisma Energy post-bankruptcy. I always make sure I add that. The boards were great because I could go to meetings and still go to excavating sites. That’s what I was doing along with the [Escala Initiative] foundation that I started to help poor women entrepreneurs in Latin America that I had seen around my sites. And I was doing those three things right up until the day I got into this [CEO] seat.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.aZYv3vGia.2iskpEbLpIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/bf3c8c71cf740773e3fd45c8cc0d859e,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:00.092187

Despite these concerning trends, Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on the electric vehicle maker’s long-term prospects, with some firms raising price targets to street-high levels based on Tesla’s artificial intelligence and autonomous driving ambitions.

Tesla Sales Plunge in the European Market

Tesla’s European operations are experiencing a severe downturn, with sales across 32 European countries tumbling 49% to just 7,261 vehicles in April 2025, down from 14,228 in the same month the previous year. This dramatic decline comes as the broader electric vehicle market in Europe actually grew by approximately 28%, highlighting Tesla’s specific challenges.

The sales collapse extends beyond a single month, with Tesla’s European sales falling roughly 39% to 61,320 vehicles for the first four months of 2025, while the continent’s overall auto market showed little change during the same period.

The decline is attributed to multiple factors, including protests and boycotts over Elon Musk’s political involvement, an aging model lineup, and intensifying competition from Chinese EV brands like SAIC, which saw sales rise 54% in April.

Additionally, Tesla faced operational challenges with factory shutdowns for several weeks while upgrading its best-selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, which constrained supply. The company’s struggles are further compounded by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has reportedly turned Europeans away from American brands, with Trump threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods before agreeing to delay duties until July.

Analyst Remain Upbeat on Tesla’s Long-Term Ambitions as an AI Company

Despite the sales challenges, Wall Street analysts remain remarkably optimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.

Wedbush Securities has issued the most bullish call, raising Tesla’s price target to a street-high $500 from $350, implying approximately 47% upside potential. Analyst Daniel Ives positions Tesla as “one of the best pure plays on AI for the next decade,” emphasizing the company’s artificial intelligence and full self-driving (FSD) ambitions as key value drivers.

Cantor Fitzgerald has also maintained its $355 price target with an Overweight rating, highlighting Tesla’s ambitious plans to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis starting with a modest fleet in Austin by the end of June 2025. The initial phase will involve Model Y vehicles equipped with unsupervised Full Self-Driving technology, with expectations to scale up and expand into other cities by year-end.

Key catalysts identified by analysts include the rollout of FSD in China (which began in Q1 2025), expected deployment in Europe during the first half of 2025 pending regulatory approval, and high-volume production of the Optimus Bot slated for 2026 with initial customer deliveries projected for 2027. Wedbush’s Ives forecasts that Tesla’s autonomy and robotaxi service could unlock approximately $1 trillion in AI-related valuation, potentially propelling the company’s market capitalization to $2 trillion by late 2026.

Divergence Between Tesla’s Short-Term Performance and Long-Term Potential

The contrast between Tesla’s current operational challenges and analyst expectations creates a fascinating market dynamic. While Tesla’s FSD technology has accumulated over 3.5 billion miles with supervision as of Q1 2025, the company faces immediate headwinds from macroeconomic conditions, tariffs, and the anticipated removal of EV tax credits.

Analysts acknowledge these near-term challenges but remain focused on Tesla’s technological transformation. The company’s strong financial position, with a current ratio of 2.0 and more cash than debt on its balance sheet, provides resilience against current headwinds. Tesla also plans to introduce a lower-priced vehicle in the first half of 2025, starting around $30,000 including tax credits, which could align well with market conditions.

Elon Musk’s confirmed commitment to Tesla for the coming years, even as he prepares to conclude his role at DOGE, has provided additional reassurance to analysts. The company is expected to update its 2025 automotive growth targets and energy storage outlook next quarter, aiming for over 50% year-over-year growth following more than 100% increase in FY24.

Tesla Stock Gains on Early Tuesday Trading

Tesla stock has shown significant volatility, with a 52-week range of $167.41 to $488.54, and currently trades near the higher end of this range with a market capitalization of $1.151 trillion.

Tesla’s valuation metrics reflect its premium positioning, with a trailing P/E ratio of 193.91 and forward P/E of 158.73. The company maintains strong financial health with $37 billion in total cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 17.41%. Despite the recent sales challenges, Tesla generated $95.72 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue with a profit margin of 6.38%.

The analyst community shows mixed sentiment with price targets ranging from a low of $115.00 to Wedbush’s high of $500.00, with an average target of $299.38.

This wide range reflects the significant uncertainty around Tesla’s transition from a traditional automaker to an AI and robotics company, with current trading levels suggesting the market is pricing in substantial future growth from autonomous driving and energy storage initiatives.

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO,” spokesperson Brian Wheeler said.","DETROIT -- The U.S. Energy Department ordered a Michigan coal-fired power plant to remain open, at least until late August, citing possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it's unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy's J.H. Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring.
Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower.
Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023.
Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.","After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.

Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.

Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.

The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.

Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.

Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.

But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.

Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.

In a news release distributed Tuesday, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition said the bill “takes a sledgehammer” to North Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry and would undo EV tax credits that have led to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state.

Among the provisions in current law that would be eliminated by the legislation:

a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new EV

a 30% tax credit up to $100,000 per single item or $1,000 for eligible home refueling infrastructure

a credit that supports a portion of the cost of producing certain technologies

a credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible commercial EVs under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 pounds

a credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used EV.

The bill “would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Prochazka said in the statement. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Prochazka said he hopes North Carolina Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd fight to preserve the EV credits.

The legislation also would implement a new car tax, which would levy an annual tax of $250 on owners of electric vehicles and $100 for owners of hybrid vehicles.

“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka said. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EV-charger.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:14:28.488418

House Bill Includes Major Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act

On May 21, the House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill which includes major cuts to clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169). This was part of the reconciliation process which fast tracks legislation related to federal spending and bypasses the filibuster in the Senate. When Congress passed the budget resolution at the end of February, it provided a blueprint for spending cuts to the relevant committees.

Passed in 2022, the historic IRA expanded and provided new clean energy tax credits. It also created loan and grant programs to support clean energy production, clean air, and environmental justice. Now lawmakers are targeting these programs for cuts to extend tax breaks for the wealthy.

Both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Ways and Means Committee have jurisdiction over parts of the IRA. On May 11, the Energy and Commerce Committee released legislative text proposing sweeping cuts to IRA and energy programs totaling nearly $6.5 billion. This includes cuts to the Loan Programs Office at the Department of Energy, $75 million in cuts to the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program, $25 million to clean air grants for low-income communities, and many more. These programs are essential to building resilient clean energy systems and stewarding our environment.

The House Ways and Means Committee released its legislative text on May 12, taking aim at the IRA’s clean energy tax credits which have spurred the creation of more than 400,000 new jobs. The legislation would end tax credits that lower the cost of home clean energy and home weatherization projects, and credits for electric vehicle purchases. It would also phase out tax credits that incentivize clean energy manufacturing. These proposed cuts and phase outs threaten energy affordability for working families across the U.S.

After passing out of the House, the bill now makes its way to the Senate for consideration.

Trump Administration Dismisses Scientists Working on National Climate Report

At the end of April, the Trump administration fired nearly all of the 400 scientists that work on the National Climate Assessment. Released every four years, the National Climate Assessment addresses the impacts of climate change on the United States. The report is congressionally mandated under the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-606). This report helps federal and state policy officials, business leaders, public health officials, and community planners integrate the risks of climate change into the work that they do. Ahead of the sixth edition, set to be published in 2027, the administration says it will be evaluating the “scope” of the next report.

“We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO,” spokesperson Brian Wheeler said.","DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. Energy Department ordered a Michigan coal-fired power plant to remain open, at least until late August, citing possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.

State regulators immediately fired back, saying it’s unnecessary to keep Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell plant open. It was supposed to close May 31.

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

MISO stands for Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada.

MISO’s forecast says there should be enough electricity in the region this summer, though “there is the potential for elevated risk during extreme weather.”

Consumers plans to close Campbell as part of a transition to cleaner energy. The power plant opened in 1962 in western Michigan’s Ottawa County, near Lake Michigan. It can generate up to 1,450 megawatts of electricity to serve up to 1 million people, the utility said.

“MISO and Consumers Energy shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday.

The utility said it will comply with the order, which expires Aug. 21.

A question that has been rocketing around the mahjongg tables at CleanTechnica global headquarters is, how will this price war affect Tesla in the Chinese market?","Last Updated on:

BYD is the tail that wags the dog in the Chinese new car market. It sells more “new energy vehicles” — which in China means plug-in hybrids and battery-electrics — than any other company. It is also pursuing an aggressive export strategy in many major markets around the world. When BYD sneezes, everyone else catches a cold.

This week, BYD announced sweeping price cuts of up to 34%, a move that has sent shock waves through the domestic industry and sent stock valuations — including its own — tumbling. On May 23, 2025, BYD announced it was reducing prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models through the end of June. The starting price for the BYD Seagull was rolled back 20% to 55,800 yuan ($7,780). The dual motor Han PHEV was cut by 34% to 102,800 yuan ($15,000), according to CNBC.

“We expect BYD’s vehicle margin would be under pressure in the short term as I think this move by them is driven by the need to hit their sales targets,” Victor Sun, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said, as quoted by CNBC. He added that he expects the company to “offset the impact via larger sales scale and battery cost staying low” regardless of whether its sales campaign is extended beyond the end of June.

Bloomberg analyst Tim Hsiao said the new pricing plan may spark a “prolonged price war,” that could have ripple effects that extend into into the second half of this year. Other brands will have to either increase their own discounts or concede market share, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joanna Chen.

What Is The BYD Game Plan?

At issue is whether the push for “new energy vehicles” by the Chinese government is beginning to lose steam. In April, the Xingyuan compact hatchback from Geely became the top-selling model in the country, overtaking the BYD Seagull. Smartphone maker Xiaomi also is continuing its into the auto sector, despite a serious setback earlier this year when a family was killed riding in one of its cars. Nevertheless, Ford CEO Jim Farley drove a Xiaomi sedan for 6 months in and around Detroit and told everyone within earshot the car was so good, he didn’t want to stop driving it.

The price war may devastate German manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes, and BMW, all of whom have have suffered declining sales in China partly because they refused to cut the prices of the models they sell in China to the same extent as their Chinese rivals. As they say in Sales Training 101, the three most important words in sales are the price, the price, and the price. Adding to those woes, Chinese drivers prefer Chinese brands that better suit their tastes. Tesla has also seen a decline in sales in China, with deliveries of cars manufactured at its assembly plant in Shanghai down for a seventh consecutive month in April. All in all, 2025 has not been a good year for Western manufacturers.

Morningstar’s Victor Sun told CNBC, “Retail discount levels stayed at high levels in the first quarter of 2025. With the expected prolonged price war, we believe the sector’s profitability will remain under some strain in the near term,” In a research note on May 26, auto analysts at Citi said they are not concerned that BYD’s price cuts would result in fewer sales for its competitors. Instead, they expect “robust sales growth” for “new energy vehicle” companies if prices remain below 200,000 yuan ($28,000) as “competition remains relatively mild.

The Zero Mileage Used Car

One area of concern for Chinese officials is the sale of so-called “zero mileage” used cars. Bloomberg’s Linda Lew explains that some manufacturers may be padding their sales numbers by reporting cars as sold that are in fact being distributed to finance companies and used car dealers. They are, in fact, new cars but appear in the used car market as cars with no miles on their odometers. The manufacturers record them as sales even though they are not purchased by end users.

On Sunday, May 25, China’s Ministry of Commerce summoned some of the country’s biggest automakers to a meeting on May 27 to discuss the practice. Attendance was not optional. The meeting also included industry organizations such as the China Automobile Dealers Association and online car distribution channels, according to a memo shared by Li Yanwei, an official at the dealers’ association, on Weibo.

Whether the tactic is legal or not in China, we cannot say. But it may be masking a slowdown in NEV sales in China and that is very much of a concern to Chinese officials.”‘Zero-mileage” cars came to public attention last week when Great Wall chairman Wei Jianjun warned of an unhealthy outlook for China’s car industry as the result of a price war that has now been ongoing in China for several years. Many see it as a race to the bottom, but others see it as the intended result of pure capitalism, as competition will weed out the weaker companies and benefit the survivors.

Playing The Long Game

Some readers may recall at the end of 2023, prices for lithium used to make batteries for electric cars had risen into the stratosphere. Then CATL, the largest battery maker in the world, suddenly announced it was slashing the prices of its batteries in anticipation of a significant decrease in the price of lithium. Within a few months, the price of lithium did indeed plummet and CATL got the yearly award for marketplace prescience.

China is still a place of great mystery. How BYD came up with the plan to dramatically reduce prices may never be known, but in the long run, BYD may turn out to be crazy like a fox after it drives some of its competitors out of business.

BYD has over 100,000 engineers on its payroll, which has allowed it to make several major announcements lately. First, it said it had developed an EV battery that could be recharged from 10 to 80% in 5 minutes. Second, it released its God’s Eye automatic driver assistance technology and made the most basic version of it standard equipment on all model priced at more than 100,000 yuan ($13,900). Some of the recently discounted models include cars equipped with the basic version of the God’s Eye ADAS suite.

The squeeze play is on in China and there is no way of telling who will win and who will lose. We have to assume before making this move, BYD thought its business strategy through and this is more than a “hold my beer” moment by founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu. A question that has been rocketing around the mahjongg tables at CleanTechnica global headquarters is, how will this price war affect Tesla in the Chinese market?

As a union family, they need to know that we’re going to have their back every step of the way.”

The UAW's success in Kokomo stands in contrast to efforts to organize EV battery workers at BlueOval SK in Glendale, Kentucky. Ford Motor Co. didn't agree to a card check system at BlueOval SK Battery Park, which encompasses two battery plants jointly owned with Korean battery maker SK On Co. Ltd. In January, the UAW requested a National Labor Relations Board vote at the site after a ""supermajority"" of employees there signed authorization cards in November. A vote, however, still hasn't been held with the union accusing the company of dragging out the process and intimidating workers, some of whom have accused the company of hazardous working conditions.

StarPlus began production in Kokomo earlier this year. Stellantis announced plans in 2022 for a first battery plant in the city where it already has powertrain and transmission production. It was expected to spend at least $2.5 billion on the 33-gigawatt hour plant and create 1,400 jobs. In 2023, it said it would build a second $3.2 billion, 34-gigwatt hour plant set to open in 2027 there with 1,400 jobs.

With that in mind, suppliers can take solace in GM’s commitment to improving its EV and battery supply chain through nearshoring battery production.
A standardised platform allows the Chattanooga plant to access parts using the entirety of the Group’s global supply chain.","The EV and battery sector has exploded in scope over the last two decades, with companies pouring record-breaking amounts of investment into the space. Galvanised by a myriad of factors – including consumer demand, decarbonisation efforts and other sustainability regulation, and a desire to innovate – OEMs have now created a landscape where EVs are commonplace on our roads and are a viable alternative for consumers traditional ICE vehicles

However, the industry has been quick to realise that EVs bring with them their own logistical challenges, especially when also factoring in batteries. From rethinking cargo flows to digitalising key processes, logistics teams have approached challenges from a variety of angles – read on for assessments and guidance from industry experts that will continue to be updated as more insights are shared.

Tony Stinsa at International on the importance of considering EV design when deciding FVL

The problems faced by the International team when looking at their BEV truck supply chain are indicative of the core problem faced by EV logistics teams – that is, transposing existing ICE frameworks over to EV won’t work.

Speaking at the Finished Vehicle Logistics North America conference earlier this year, Tony Stinsa, director of inbound and finished vehicle logistics at International, explained that the traditional means of transporting their Class 4-8 trucks often involves a deck-set approach, with one truck towing the rest. However, refuelling the lead truck becomes a problem when it’s an EV column as charging infrastructure is not as common as petrol stations. Similarly, Stinsa also points to EV design as also being an issue his team have faced. For one, the BEV trucks are heavier than their ICE counterparts, while the apparatus typically used to connect the truck rails can be blocked by the battery infrastructure.

Stinsa goes onto describe reactive and proactive measures that have been undertaken, and suggests that the latter should be more widely adopted. Reactive measures involve utilising existing ICE shipments, or combined shipments, to facilitate the transportation of BEV trucks. The more frequent refuelling infrastructure of the ICE trucks allows for better freight optimisation as the deck-set column is not limited to routes with charge stations. As for proactive measure, Stinsa argues that discussions on FVL need to “move way up into the development cycle”, with logistics teams being able to give feedback throughout the design process. By incorporating transportation parameters as early as possible, efficient and effective FVL can be ensured – an idea that’s worth adopting more widely.

Amy Paulsen at GM on how to ensure agility in EV logistics, even at scale

Amy Paulsen, director of finished vehicle logistics at GM, also looks at the importance of feedback and communication in the EV supply chain, and explores how the adoption of new technologies to do so can create a higher degree of flexibility.

Another common challenge in the EV logistics space is battery health and the state of charge throughout the supply chain. Paulsen states that monitoring these issues is crucial and so has introduced measures to maintain vigilance. Part of this involves an increased reliance on digital tools and quantifiable metrics. Using telematics to monitor charge throughout the battery’s journey allows the team to collect analysable data that can, in turn, be used to identify and remedy any problems – ensuring any risks are mitigated as quickly and as effectively as possible.

Paulsen also explores to the efficiency of communication and collaboration as being integral to GM’s flexibility in its EV logistics. With a network as vast as GM’s, there is a necessity to ensure that internal and external information flows are as optimised as possible, and Paulsen reveals that the secret for doing so is simply “transparency”. Sharing when there is “a plan… and problems” has facilitated a level of trust and understanding that Paulsen and her team can leverage to help mitigate any disruption. She points to the “very strong partnerships” with third party charging companies as an example of the benefits it can have in the EV space, and is a good reminder for other companies that talking to people and building relationships is key.

Javier Valdez at Paccar Mexico on having a “just in case” mindset

Speaking at ALSC Mexico 2024, Javier Valadez, director of operations at Paccar Mexico surmised that the “most expensive” thing to happen to an OEM is not having its products available. This is especially pertinent in the EV and battery space, as the landscape is very cost- and price-sensitive.

To combat this, Valdez recommends a mentality shift born out of disruption caused by the Covid pandemic – “think not only on having a just-in-time supply chain, but [the] just-in-case availability of your components.” Doing so will allow manufacturers to keep up production in the face of demand fluctuation or disruption in the flows from n-tier suppliers. He argues that it’s better to spend more on warehousing and be “a little overstocked” than lose business because of reduced production and delivery. This idea goes against the industry standard of just-in-time production and so is an interesting proposition for EV manufacturers.

He also discusses the role of international and regional legislature for EV supply chains. The USMCA agreement has been integral at reinforcing the auto trade between its three members – although, there are currently fears as to its continued success as it is up for review in 2026. However, Valdez argues that the regulations and legislature that form part of the agreement are integral in examining the “regional value” of an approach and has become a “major decision maker” in the adoption of new suppliers – a worthy reminder to any potential partner on the importance on keeping qualifications up to date.

Monica Garcia at GM explains the benefits of being challenged in EV logistics

Monica Garcia, GM’s director of global purchasing and supply chain in Mexico, also spoke at ALSC Mexico 2024. In her Red Sofa interview, she reiterated the importance of communication and collaboration with partners for EVs and batteries but approached it from a slightly different angle.

Whereas fellow Paulsen spoke about the benefits of transparent lateral and operations-focused communication, Garcia instead examines it from a more strategic standpoint. She wants GM’s partners to “challenge the way [they] are doing things” by suggesting alternatives or presenting ideas seen elsewhere in the market. In creating this discourse, “new ways of working together” can be created, which in turn can lead to improvements in network design and risk minimisation. As part of this, suppliers are encouraged to invest in innovation and take the initiative. This approach is worthwhile advice, as it strengthens the working relationships between OEMs and their suppliers, while facilitating future growth and development.

Garcia also points to “stability and continuity” as also being integral factors to effective collaboration. This can be achieved though strengthening relationships, but this is futile without delivery. With that in mind, suppliers can take solace in GM’s commitment to improving its EV and battery supply chain through nearshoring battery production. In the last year, GM has announced new plans for a new US-based battery plant, as well as unveiling a new EV and battery roadmap. This commitment to EV supply chain development sends a message to suppliers, clients and partners that stability is achievable and expected, and is the sort of message that OEMs should be encouraging if they want to strengthen their appeal to logistics partners.

Criss Edwards at Unipart on the role of 3PL players in EV FVL

The previous few Red Sofas have been great at getting the OEM perspective, but it’s also useful to learn more about how their logistics partners view the EV and battery space.

Criss Edwards, president and managing director North America at Unipart, describes there being a “massive transformation” in the automotive sector, driven by EVs, AI and autonomous vehicles, and nearshoring and localisation. Looking at EVs, he explains that one cause for this transformation is that the EV market has not grown in a “straight line” – rather, it’s been a “very dynamic situation”. A lower percentage market share growth for EVs compared to OEM expectations has led to manufacturers having to move away from set plans and adjust. “OEMs will have to manage… two independent, in-parallel supply chains” in response, one for ICE vehicles and one for EVs.

He goes onto to discuss the role that 3PLs can play in helping to manage this problem. They can leverage their networks and assets to make changes at speed, adjusting their cargo flows to meet OEM needs at that time. This expands beyond freight flows and is applicable to warehousing and storage. Edwards explains that both EVs and ICE vehicles are at risk of becoming slow-moving inventory depending on market demand at the time, becoming lost revenue for OEMs. 3PLs can utilise inventory forecasting and replenishment tool help counteract this, pivoting stock allocation to match demand. By working with 3PL, OEMs can ensure their supply chain maintains “flexibility, predictability [and] reliability” in the face of volatile markets and fluctuating EV demand – especially useful as uncertainty seems to be on the rise.

Paulo Monteiro at Volkswagen Group of America cracks the code on integrating software awareness into EV logistics

One recurring discussion point surrounding EVs that has been present for years is the concern around the software inside the car. Awareness of the coding creating this software is something that OEMs should also factor into their logistics network from the very start of the car’s production, explains Paulo Monteiro, head of Logistics, VW Group of America Chattanooga Operations, at ALSC Mexico 2024.

As the Chattanooga plant has diversified its output, the electronic complexity of the models has increased – the Passat had “about 30 modules”, the Atlas “jumped to about 90 modules”, and the currently produced ID.4 has “over 150”, which translates to “100 million lines of code”. This amount of coding is a monumental task in and of itself, but any issues can have serious knock-on impacts for logistics. Monteiro explains that each module must have the same generation, or the car will not start. Each module therefore needs to be verified ahead of production, leading to “additional difficulty” in processes.

However, now that processes are in place to check validity, these can be shared with other plants within the Group. Monteiro points to this level of collaboration and communication as being integral to the success of EV production and logistics. A standardised platform allows the Chattanooga plant to access parts using the entirety of the Group’s global supply chain. Doing so improves resiliency in the supply chain, as it facilitates increased flexibility, with Monteiro using a recent example of the plant bringing over parts from Europe after a domestic supplier couldn’t meet demand. A situation that could have been disastrous for the plant was negated by the global part accessibility afforded by a standardised strategy.

Saba Azizi at CATL explores the benefits that digitalisation can have for the EV market

Like most facets of the automotive industry, operations surrounding EVs and batteries have become increasingly digitalised. Speaking at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Digital Strategies Europe last year, Saba Azizi, overseas service network and development manager for CATL, discussed how carmakers can best leverage digitalisation in EV aftermarket logistics.

With a market share as significant as CATL’s, a core driver for continued success is keeping customers “satisfied, happy and loyal” and Azizi explains that digitalising the battery-maker’s service network platform has allowed them to achieve these targets. In creating an accessible hub for all the information surrounding services, including partner management details and technician certification, CATL can offer its customers a “consistent and transparent service.” This is especially pertinent as, although there may be increasing uncertainty surrounding EV markets, CATL are heavily investing in new battery production facilities across the world in response to increasingly regional production efforts. Considering these factors, increasing digitalisation in EV and battery operations is a useful means of maintaining efficiency and effectiveness.

Another useful lesson from Azizi’s Red Sofa is that the human side of logistics planning should never be forgotten. She promotes creating teams where everyone has a “different background or perspective” to ensure that there is a diversity in ideas. Creating this sort of environment allows for better “creativity and adaptability” in the face of uncertainty and a changing automotive landscape, bringing value to this important reminder.

Haley Wilson at Navistar on leveraging group dynamics in cross border EV logistics

Haley Wilson, logistics director at Navistar, sat down on the Red Sofa at ALSC Mexico last year at a time when Navistar had recently joined the Volkswagen Group of America. As such, her interview focuses on how an individual company can best utilise its sister companies and wider Group network to improve operational efficiency.

For one, Wilson describes the ability to tap into the wider Groups’ experience in producing and shipping EV models as “very helpful”, as it allows the company to identify issues that have already been encountered and create best practices to counter them without having to commit to lengthy trial-and-error or analysis procedures themselves. By adopting strategies that have worked for other companies in the Group, they can adapt to and overcome common challenges at speed. Like with increased digitalisation, this can be very beneficial for EV producers as regional flows and established production routes are in flux.

Similarly, Wilson also points to the increased supplier and logistics networks that come with being in a Group as being a significant advantage. She uses the example of Navistar leveraging fellow Traton Group member Scania to establish a cargo flow from their European hubs to Navistar’s US-based site. Such opportunities can be crucial at maintaining a solid cargo flow, and so the example acts a good reminder on the importance of communication between sister companies.

Oliver Bilstein at BMW outlines how plant logistics need to adapt to increased EV and battery output

Oliver Bilstein, vice-president of production control, logistics and material control at BMW Manufacturing in the US, sat down on the Red Sofa and explained how the BMW Spartanburg plant is adapting to increased electrification.

Part of this involves planning new logistics flows including inbound and outbound, but it also involves designing mature control processes for new components. This is an area that can be critical in introducing EV lines. As Monteiro outlined in his Red Sofa, there needs to be a holistic approach to parts production and assembly to avoid any late-stage crises. By planning these processes from the ground up, while also considering how they can be balanced alongside ongoing production lines, OEMs can ensure that planned EV expansion is carried out effectively.

For the Spartanburg plant, one approach to maintaining in-plant efficiency in the face of expansion and electrification is using automation – autonomous systems from the “building bricks” in Bilstein’s strategy to “bring logistics to the next level”. Such systems run through a centralised data hub which allows the team to teach and assign them new tasks with relative ease, facilitating quicker and smoother adaptation to new processes. While not every EV and battery plant might not have access to such systems, it is worth investigating their application.

Paulina Chmielarz at JLR discusses how digital strategies can be used to combat increased regulatory complexity

Paulina Chmielarz, director of Digital & Innovation at JLR, sits down on the Red Sofa and explains how increased electrification plays into JLR’s wider ‘Reimagine’ strategy, and discusses how such a shift requires a different approach to traditional ICE vehicle logistics.

She reflects that the traceability of traditional ICE engines through the value chain is “quite stable”, with established processes and regulations. For EVs, however, the regulations surrounding are much more granular – “it’s not tracing serial numbers through the supply chain, it’s tracing serial numbers of each weld and each cell.” Such an increase in monitoring has taken some adjustment, but Chmielarz points to technology as a means to achieve this watchfulness.

A common avenue for this is using AI for predicting and forecasting, but Chmierlarz presents an alternative approach that could be quite beneficial. She instead asks if AI software can help “literally relive yesterday”, using it to recreate scenarios where disruption may have occurred but not all the data needed for an analysis is available. Using AI to plug the gaps of missing information allows increased for increased analysis and “proper problem solving”. This approach is less common that future-looking AI uses, such as forecasting tools, but can offer valuable insight for both OEMs and LSPs, and so should be more widely considered.",https://d3n5uof8vony13.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/5/9/332859_tonystinsaredsofa_272052.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 15:14:34.929856

Erv knows his Tesla costs more.","Are EVs truly a cost-saving revolution? Or are they just fancy gadgets with a hidden price tag?

One Reddit user, armed with spreadsheets, has taken it upon himself to track the cost per mile of his Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt against his trusty, old-school Toyota Corolla.

The results are surprisingly counterintuitive, shattering some common EV myths and revealing a few hard truths about the cost of owning an electric car.

50,000-Mile Cost Breakdown of Tesla Model 3 vs. Chevy Bolt vs. Toyota Corolla

Erv, shared some insights and data on r/electricvehicles after driving 50,000 miles across a Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt EUV. The kicker? His old Toyota Corolla still beats them both in one crucial metric.

""I have a separate meter for my 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD that I use to track energy use, efficiency, cost (and cost-savings), etc., and compare back to very detailed data I kept on my previous ICE car.

Given I've now driven >30,000 miles, it felt like a good time to share the data, and because I had it, I also shared comparisons to the Bolt EUV.

*I benchmarked the fuel costs against my prior car, a Toyota Corolla, which got 33.17 mpg over the 100,000+ miles I tracked it, and I also benchmarked against current gas prices, which in my area have been roughly $3/gallon, but I am using nuanced monthly averages for my state. I also bake in a $30 oil change per 5,000 miles as ""fuel"".

**I also calculated the portion of my savings that is due to taxes I'm not paying at the pump (0.285+0.184 per gallon) - which is relevant politically given we can expect a $250/year EV surcharge to attempt to ""close that loophole"", which for me, looks to be ""fair"" if it were state + federal, but just being federal and combined with my state's surcharge ($75), it is not.

I have insurance, tabs, depreciation, maintenance, as well but wanted to focus on ""fuel"". Those costs are all higher than the Corolla due to the Tesla (and Bolt) being much newer cars (and fully insured instead of minimally insured), and the heightened costs do offset the fuel savings for now. I'll be curious to see over 100,000+ miles how the total cost to own tightens u,p and I expect the Tesla to win out.

Currently, depreciation/any cost of the vehicle, the Tesla is already winning at 15c/mile vs. the Corolla's 16c/mile due to the cheaper maintenance and fuel despite the higher insurance and tabs. But taking into account depreciation changes, that comparison to $0.34 vs. $0.20 in favor of the Corolla, for now. Which is a price I'm comfortable paying for enhanced safety, comfort, etc.

EFFICIENCY

Because it's always interesting to discuss - this is my ""efficiency"" based on the electricity I am actually paying for, so it includes losses (and I am adding in charging away from home, but that's been extremely minimal). The Tesla itself reports a different number: 239 Mi/kWh (vs 296), which is partially due to losses and partially due to the car not reporting preconditioning. Similarly, the Tesla app says 8,771 kWh charged vs. I have logged 9,028 (a 3% variance), which tells me the 20% variance on Mi/kWh is primarily preconditioning and not charging losses, which is surprising given I do not precondition very frequently and I do not use Sentry. I charge L2.""

Tesla Model 3 vs. Chevy Bolt EUV: Performance, Range, and Space Comparison

The Tesla Model 3 offers a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system producing 460 horsepower, achieving 0–60 mph in 2.9 seconds, with an EPA-estimated range of up to 342 miles. In contrast, the Chevrolet Bolt EUV features a single front-mounted motor delivering 200 horsepower, reaching 0–60 mph in approximately 7 seconds, and provides an EPA-estimated range of 247 miles.

The Model 3, a compact sedan, offers 97 cubic feet of passenger volume and 24 cubic feet of cargo space. The Bolt EUV, a subcompact crossover, provides similar passenger volume at 97 cubic feet but offers slightly less cargo space at 16.3 cubic feet.

Tesla's Model 3 includes a minimalist interior with a 15-inch touchscreen interface, advanced driver-assistance features, and access to Tesla's Supercharger network. The Bolt EUV comes equipped with Chevrolet's infotainment system, supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and offers GM's Super Cruise hands-free driving technology on compatible roads.

The 2025 Tesla Model 3 starts at approximately $42,490, positioning it in the premium EV segment. The Chevrolet Bolt EUV offered a more affordable entry point, with prices starting around $27,800, making it one of the most budget-friendly electric vehicles available at the time of its release.

Erv, in the kind of methodical tone that could make an actuary swoon, detailed everything: kilowatt-hours, miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe), oil changes priced to the penny, and even the political nuances of gas taxes and EV surcharges.

According to his logs, the Model 3 RWD clocked in at 15 cents per mile in fuel and maintenance. The Bolt? Slightly worse. But even those figures paled next to his dearly departed Corolla, which, once depreciation was factored in, ran just 20 cents per mile overall. The Tesla ballooned to 34 cents. That’s not a minor difference.

Depreciation and Maintenance, How Reddit Users React to True EV Ownership Costs

The Reddit horde, predictably, pounced. One commenter, Hsaphoto, praised the inclusion of depreciation: the forgotten financial bogeyman. Another, neutralpoliticsbot, scoffed at the $30 oil change estimate with a sarcastic “$30 oil change where?”, the internet equivalent of flipping a table.

Erv held the line, citing years of discount coupons and standard oil. Welcome to Reddit, where every car becomes a case study and every assumption gets litigated like a class-action suit.

Beyond the Spreadsheet, User-Reported Efficiency and Cost Highlights from Bolt and Hybrid Owners

One Bolt owner, Low_Thanks_1540, bragged about getting 5.1 mi/kWh in Detroit, averaging just 3 cents per mile. Another user brought their Ford Maverick hybrid into the ring, reporting a paltry $0.129 per mile in operating costs. Suddenly, the Model 3's efficiency crown didn’t feel quite so regal.

The Tesla still wins where it matters to many, comfort, safety, and long-term efficiency. It delivered 114 MPGe versus the Bolt’s 103, despite colder temps and nearly 11,000 more miles logged. And with LFP batteries under the floorboards and a 239 mi/kWh efficiency reported by the car itself (after adjusting for preconditioning losses), the Model 3 proved not only cost-effective but technologically superior. As one user noted, “It’s well documented that the Tesla Model 3 RWD is more efficient than a Bolt with all things being equal.” The key phrase is that all things being equal, which in the real world, they rarely are.

MPGe Demystified, How EPA’s Miles-Per-Gallon-Equivalent Rating Works for EV Buyers

MPGe is determined by equating the energy content of electricity to that of gasoline. Specifically, 33.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity is considered equivalent to one gallon of gasoline. To calculate MPGe, the distance an electric vehicle can travel on 33.7 kWh is measured, allowing for a comparison with traditional miles-per-gallon (MPG) ratings of gasoline vehicles.

MPGe was introduced to provide consumers with a familiar metric to compare the energy efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) to that of internal combustion engine vehicles. By translating electric energy consumption into a gasoline-equivalent format, it aims to simplify the decision-making process for potential EV buyers.

While MPGe offers a standardized measure, it doesn't account for various real-world factors such as driving habits, terrain, climate conditions, and accessory usage (like air conditioning), all of which can significantly impact an EV's actual efficiency. Consequently, two vehicles with similar MPGe ratings might perform differently under everyday driving conditions.

MPGe focuses solely on the energy consumed by the vehicle during operation, neglecting the efficiency and environmental impact of electricity generation and transmission. For instance, electricity produced from renewable sources has a different environmental footprint compared to that generated from fossil fuels, but MPGe does not differentiate between them.

Still, the most revealing part of this Reddit saga was the emotional math. Erv knows his Tesla costs more. He admits it. But he’s comfortable paying that premium for the intangible upgrades, refined ride, cleaner footprint, and the sense that he’s driving the future. That, right there, is the fine print most car reviews miss. We’re not always chasing the cheapest ride. Sometimes, we’re chasing the one that feels right. Even if it costs 14 cents more per mile.

Shifts in Car Ownership

So what does this all mean? It means the automotive world is no longer defined solely by horsepower and leather trim. It’s defined by kilowatt-hours, tax credits, and Reddit threads that dissect your every mile like a neurosurgeon studying a brain scan.

The EV revolution forces you to confront what you value, numbers or nuance, cost or conscience. And if you’re still wondering whether to switch, don’t just take it from the marketing brochures. Sit down with the math geniuses in the back booth of Reddit and let them show you what owning an EV actually costs.

Because in the end, the Tesla might feel like the future, the Bolt might get you there frugally, and the Corolla? That humble little gas-sipper might still be the most honest ride of all.

The data center industry has striven to address this by showcasing the many benefits of digital infrastructure, lately beginning to bring our own power to the table, and by advocating for how our infrastructure can help shape a more resilient grid.

Power generation and distribution started long before the data centers or the internet existed. In the early days, power plants manually controlled generation and local distribution without anything we’d recognize today as “digital communication.” Operators used mechanical gauges, manual switches, telegraphs, and direct human coordination to run the grids.

However, today’s power grids are far more complex, integrating thousands of plants, renewables, storage systems, microgrids, and millions of endpoints as the majority of our modern world (including data centers) relies on electricity. This complexity depends on fast, reliable, and centralized communication systems, like SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) networks, which run via internet and private data transfer systems. Data centers aren’t just reliant on this grid complexity, but in fact host and process the real-time data that grid operators need to balance supply and demand instantaneously.

A mid-sized utility might need between 1-5 MW of capacity to support operational, customer data, and regulatory needs. Additionally, as mission critical entities, utilities often require higher uptime such as Tier 3 redundancy, which further increases space and power requirements. There are over 3000 power utilities in the US that provide electricity to more than 140 million rate-payers, including investor-owned utilities, public power utilities, and rural cooperatives, each serving different regions and customer bases across the country.

The Data-Hungry Power Grid: Flipping the Script

The IT footprint for power grids may not seem like much compared to other data center tenants, but it’s certainly on the rise as more sensored devices are deployed and utilities begin to incorporate AI-backed algorithms into their operations. Additional considerations include:

Data Growth: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the volume of data generated by the grid is expected to increase exponentially as more smart meters, distributed energy resources, and IoT devices come online.

Cybersecurity: With this digital transformation, data centers also play a vital role in cybersecurity. Utility data centers are at the frontlines of defending against cyber threats that could disrupt critical infrastructure.

Resilience and Decarbonization: Data centers are helping utilities integrate renewable energy and distributed resources, providing the computational muscle for real-time grid balancing, forecasting, and demand response programs.

Interdependency: The relationship is symbiotic. While data centers depend on reliable power, modern grids increasingly depend on data centers for analytics, automation, and control.

So it’s worth pondering - and flipping the script: What would the power grid look like if data centers were not backing utility infrastructure? Would we be able to integrate renewables at scale, respond to outages in real time, or defend against cyber threats as effectively?

Grid Management

For starters, grid management would be far less efficient and resilient. Utility operators would be forced to rely on outdated manual oversight, resulting in slower reaction times and delayed response to outages. Accurate forecasting of demand would be severely hampered, making it difficult to balance supply and demand, especially as more intermittent power sources and endpoints come online.

Blackouts would become far more frequent. Today’s advanced distribution grids employ fiber-optic sensors, edge computing, and centralized data centers to detect faults and reroute power automatically. Rapid FDIR (fault detection, isolation, and response) depends on real-time data flowing through the utility’s communications network and being processed in high-availability data centers. Without this digital backbone, utilities would struggle to restore faults quickly, leading to prolonged outages and greater risk to public safety.

Wildfire mitigation presents a striking example of how data centers and cloud platforms have transformed gird management. This life-threatening scenario has been especially prevalent in driving innovation in using cloud-based analytics to protect communities, with platforms that provide localized alerts, support evacuation planning, and share real-time risk data with first responders and the public. AI-powered risk modeling can help predict fire weather conditions with a 90% accuracy by merging satellite data, vegetation maps, and grid telemetry. This data-driven approach influences dynamic safety shutoff protocols to balance preemptive shutdowns with minimal rate-payer disruption, adjusting in real time based on evolving grid conditions.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) emphasizes that grid reliability now hinges on digital infrastructure and real-time analytics, which are only possible with robust data center support. And the U.S. Department of Energy notes that the integration of distributed energy resources, demand response, and grid automation all depend on centralized data processing and storage. While this is not unknown, it is underrepresented as data centers showcase their value to society at large.

Microgrids and Decentralized Generation

Communication between local grids is entirely dependent on digital infrastructure to coordinate energy flows, manage distributed resources, and ensure seamless transitions between grid-connected and islanded operations. Data centers and cloud platforms serve as the nerve centers for these decentralized systems, processing vast amounts of real-time data from sensors, smart inverters, and distributed energy resources (DERs).

With new grid-edge technologies and microgrid advancements, decentralized solutions are fundamentally reshaping power distribution. The integration of DERs, including rooftop solar, wind, battery energy storage, and intelligent behind-the-meter systems enables local grids to stabilize themselves during outages or disturbances. None of this would be possible without an incredible communications network to automate power flow. This level of coordination and automation is only possible with robust communications networks and powerful data processing capabilities.

Data centers and cloud-based platforms optimize microgrid performance by aggregating and analyzing data from diverse sources: renewable generation, storage assets, and demand response systems. Advanced algorithms can forecast local supply and demand, dispatch resources in real time, and even enable peer-to-peer energy trading within communities. During grid emergencies, microgrids can automatically “island” from the main grid, keeping critical facilities powered—an operation that relies on split-second digital coordination.

As the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) observes, the proliferation of distributed energy resources requires advanced data analytics and control platforms to ensure grid reliability and maximize the value of renewables. Without the computational power and connectivity provided by data centers, the promise of resilient, decentralized energy would remain out of reach.

Renewable Integration

The inherent variability of solar and wind energy production demands fast, automated management to maintain grid stability. Cloud computing is, therefore, vital for renewable energy management, providing the scalable and flexible resources needed to handle fluctuating power inputs.

Modern grids rely on sophisticated forecasting algorithms, real-time monitoring systems, and advanced control technologies to balance renewable energy supply with demand. For example, cloud-based analytics can predict solar and wind output based on weather patterns and historical data, allowing grid operators to adjust generation and transmission accordingly. Additionally, energy storage systems are optimized using cloud platforms, storing excess renewable energy when production is high and releasing it when demand peaks or renewable output drops.

Without the digital infrastructure provided by data centers and cloud platforms, it would be impossible to integrate large amounts of intermittent renewable energy sources reliably. Advanced control systems require continuous data processing, machine learning, and high-speed communications to ensure grid stability in the face of fluctuating supply.

In short, power would still be possible without data centers, but modern energy systems rely heavily on the digital backbone that data centers and communications networks provide. Without it, we’d revert to much simpler, less reliable, less renewable, and more manually controlled grids, unable to harness the full potential of today’s technological advancements.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/05/6835f50d975c3e88fe50b6ac-dreamstime_xxl_358172703.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-27 14:16:08.719804

ZeroAvia’s Hydrogen Centre of Excellence will support the company in a range of manufacturing operations relating to powertrain production and testing. It will also serve as the company’s primary location for production of advanced high temperature PEM (HTPEM) fuel cell stacks and supporting systems. With nearly 3,000 full engine and component pre-orders agreed with airlines and OEMs – corresponding to over $10 billion in future revenues – ZeroAvia is advancing its production operations to meet demand.

“Scotland has some unique advantages for ZeroAvia with strong aerospace and engineering skills, a burgeoning hydrogen sector and a clear aviation strategy with potential for early adoption of zero-emission flights,” said Val Miftakhov, Founder & Chief Executive, ZeroAvia. “The aviation industry is on the cusp of the biggest transformation since the advent of the jet age, with entirely new propulsion systems set to power the next era of aviation – cleaner flights, better economics and better experiences for all.”

“With this new facility, Scotland has a big role to play in driving this transformation,” continued Miftakhov. “We welcome the grant award from Scottish Enterprise and the support of our equity investors that has enabled us to move into another phase of manufacturing readiness as we progress towards certification of our first engines.”

The new facility will complement ZeroAvia’s Propulsion Center of Excellence in Washington State which is focused primarily on electric motors and power electronics. The company also has plans to expand its R&D and aircraft testing centre at Cotswold Airport in Gloucestershire.

The project in Scotland, which will support hundreds of jobs over the next few years, has been made possible by $12 million Regional Selective Assistance grant from Scottish Enterprise. This follows an equity investment of $27 million from the Scottish National Investment Bank into ZeroAvia as part of the company’s Series C funding, with the UK National Wealth Fund investing $43.2 million as a cornerstone-level investor in the round. The Series C funding round was led by Airbus, Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital and NEOM Investment Fund.

The UK Government awarded ZeroAvia and consortium partners $14 million to develop the advanced HTPEM fuel cells in 2024 via the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) program in conjunction with the Department for Business and Trade and Innovate UK. The UK Government has awarded ZeroAvia $25 million total R&D funding since 2019 to develop its fuel cell and powertrain technology. This support, alongside more than $250 million private investment, has enabled ZeroAvia to make rapid progress: flying the world’s first hydrogen-electric commercial scale aircraft in 2020, more than doubling the power output to again fly the world’s largest hydrogen-electric aicraft in 2023, manufacturing and shipping fuel cell systems to customers, and securing significant regulatory traction for the certification of its powertrains.

“Scotland has the skills, the talent and the innovation to be at the forefront of efforts to tackle the climate emergency while developing significant new opportunities to grow the economy,” said John Swinney, First Minister of Scotland. “ZeroAvia’s decision to establish a base in Scotland – creating 350 highly-skilled jobs in the process – is the perfect illustration of Scotland’s growing reputation in the global transition to net zero.”

“By setting out a strategic vision in priority areas such as hydrogen, we are sending a clear statement to investors and businesses that Scotland is at the heart of the green energy revolution,” Swinney continued. “The Hydrogen Centre of Excellence will be at the forefront of fuel cell technology and offers a hugely promising and exciting proposition for sustainable aviation.”

“It is fantastic that we’ve been able to attract ZeroAvia to Scotland, not only for the jobs they will be creating, but for the hugely important role they can play in ensuring Scotland maintains its reputation for fostering innovative green technologies,” said Adrian Gillespie, Chief Executive, Scottish Enterprise. “Making aviation sustainable is crucial to a successful green economy and Scottish Enterprise is fully committed to backing ambitious companies with innovative ideas. ZeroAvia’s decision to come to Scotland is a real boost to our energy transition leadership, as well as being a further example of why Scotland is such a great place for inward investment.”

“ZeroAvia’s new facility in Scotland is fantastic news for the whole of the UK,” said Gary Elliott, Aerospace Technology Institute. “It shows how investment in aerospace research, made possible by support from the ATI Programme, is delivering jobs and growth right across the country, unlocking private investment and helping address climate change.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zeroavia-atr72-in-scotland-1a-1536x804-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:15:08.635274

Under these rules, all new commercial buildings must also allocate at least 50% of their parking spaces for EV charging.
The state will encourage setting up EV battery recycling hubs closer to EV battery manufacturing hubs and EV charging infrastructure.","The Maharashtra state government has announced a range of incentives across categories for the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) under the Maharashtra Electric Vehicle Policy for 2025.

The policy targets every one in three vehicles registered to be an EV by 2030.

It offers an incentive of a maximum of ₹2 million (~$23,502.8)/vehicle in the passenger bus/goods carrier category. Electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers will get a purchase incentive of ₹10,000 (~$117.52) and ₹30,000 (~$352.57) for the first 100,000 and 15,000 vehicles, respectively.

Electric cars will be eligible for a purchase incentive of ₹150,000 (~$1762.84) for the first 10,000 vehicles.

The policy, which will be valid for five years, aims to accelerate EV adoption across all vehicle segments and ensure widespread charging infrastructure to support it.

The policy also plans to reduce vehicular particulate matter (PM) 2.5 emissions in the state. It is estimated that Maharashtra will be able to reduce 325 tons of vehicular PM 2.5 emissions and approximately 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030.

The state’s Transport Department will be the designated nodal agency for the policy.

Under these targets, 40% of all new two-wheelers must be EVs, and electric four-wheelers will comprise 30% of all new four-wheeler registrations.

These incentives will be valid only for vehicles either manufactured for sale in Maharashtra or registered for sale in the state.

The original equipment manufacturer will avail the incentives and pass them on to the end consumer.

The incentives will be disbursed as a percentage of the vehicle’s ex-factory price. They will also be applicable for selling EVs without transferring battery ownership.

All EVs sold under the policy period will be completely exempted from motor vehicle tax.

There will also be a 100% toll tax exemption for passenger EVs commuting on state highways such as Yashwantrao Chavan Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Hindu Hrudaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg, Atal Bihari Vajpayee Sewri–Nhava Sheva Atal Setu.

Phased toll waivers for electric vehicles on other state highways are currently under discussion.

Charging Infrastructure

The policy includes the installation of EV charging infrastructure every 25 km along state and national highways.

It mandates all existing and new fuel pumps on state and national highways to have at least one fast charging station. The same requirement also extends to all Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation bus stations.

The state will also release viability gap funding for DC fast charging station installations to incentivize establishing EV charging infrastructure across highways. The state’s Energy Department will create a nodal agency to develop an integrated EV charging infrastructure plan. It will categorize EV charging stations based on renewable energy usage and availability of battery energy storage systems.

The concessional tariff for all EV charging and battery swapping stations will follow the tariff structure issued by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The state government will establish a one-window online system/portal to provide charging infrastructure approvals.

Building Code Amendments

Under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs guidelines, the state government has mandated that all new residential buildings have 100% EV-compliant parking spaces.

Each new residential building must allocate at least one dedicated community EV charging point.

Existing housing societies must allocate shared EV charging stations if at least 50% of the housing society members approve of this dedicated allocation.

Under these rules, all new commercial buildings must also allocate at least 50% of their parking spaces for EV charging.

The Mumbai – Pune Expressway and Mumbai – Nagpur Samruddhi will be built as a sustainable mobility corridor. It will comprise charging infrastructure for all EV types. Deploying hydrogen vehicles on the Pune-Mumbai Expressway on pilot routes is also targeted.

Battery Recycling

To attract investments for EV manufacturing, the state government will provide all benefits under the D+ category of mega projects/other categories for industries, including micro, small, and medium enterprises. These companies can be part of the EV battery and component manufacturing sector, irrespective of their manufacturing location in the state.

The state will encourage setting up EV battery recycling hubs closer to EV battery manufacturing hubs and EV charging infrastructure.

Urban local bodies will designate convenient drop-off points for used EV batteries. They will also identify and earmark the land for drop-off spots near the solid waste disposal and processing sites for battery segregation.

They can also collaborate with nearby and existing battery recycling facilities to bolster battery recycling.

Research and Development

To encourage R&D in the state, at least three centers of excellence will be developed, focusing on EVs, charging infrastructure, and hydrogen-based technologies.

The government has earmarked ₹150 million (~$1.76 million) under the “CM EV R&D Grant” to fund R&D activities in the EV sector.

The Maharashtra government will also develop specialized courses for EV design, battery technology, charging infrastructure, power electronics, and energy management.

The Transport Department will establish a network of automated testing stations for EVs to conduct standardized safety assessments.

The state government will also develop a digital battery passport to track key parameters such as manufacturing details, real-time health status, usage history, and end-of-life diagnostics.

According to data released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways through its Vahan Dashboard in January 2025, Maharashtra had the second-highest EV sales in the country.

In September 2024, the Union Cabinet approved the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement Program, with a total outlay of ₹109 billion (~$1.29 billion).

Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 (which must have begun construction by Dec. 31, 2024) are unaffected by the bill.
Foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions would apply to all IRA tax credits.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.
Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification would introduce an additional layer of complexity.","On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed (by a vote of 215-214-1) its version of the budget reconciliation bill (H.R. 1, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"") containing numerous tax reform provisions. Below are our summaries of the proposed amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration and markup, and we will continue to monitor any developments and updates.

Overview of Changes from the Ways and Means Committee Draft Bill:

The focus of the updates from the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee are as follows:

Termination of Tech-Neutral Credits Without Phaseout: Tech-neutral PTCs and ITCs under sections 45Y and 48E would terminate for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028.

The prior draft bill included a modified phase out of the credit rates starting in 2029 and running through 2032, with credits being terminated after 2032, based on when a project is placed in service.

The bill does not alter the existing guidance on how to begin construction of a project for tax purposes, and the date of enactment would be the date the bill is signed by the President.

Advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E would be required to begin construction before Jan. 1, 2029.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity: This restriction would apply to projects seeking tax credits under sections 45Y or 48E that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025.

The prior draft bill provided a 1-year grace period to begin construction before the material assistance rules applied.

Observation: If the bill is enacted into law before November 1, 2025, then this material assistance restriction would not affect projects seeking credits under sections 45Y or 48E, because such projects would have to begin construction within 60 days of enactment to be eligible for such credits.

Transferability: Tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period for projects that meet the Dec. 31, 2028 deadline to be placed in service.

The prior draft bill preserved transferability for projects that began construction up to 2 years after enactment.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Special Rule for Residential Solar: No credit would be allowed under sections 45Y or 48E for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: This does not seem to include residential PPAs because in such cases the owner is not leasing the equipment to the consumer (but only for systems that begin construction within 60 days of enactment and are placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028). We see no logical basis for treating PPAs differently than leases, so this treatment may be aligned by the Senate, if this special rule for residential property is otherwise maintained.

Observation: This also does not seem to include residential battery storage technology for which a credit is allowable under section 25(d)(6).

Observation: After the bill's amendment, the Section 25D credit would not be allowed for property placed in service after December 31, 2025. Thus, the lessee technically would not qualify for Section 25D credits after the bill's amendment, which means condition (ii) could not be satisfied. This is probably not the intended consequence and either the Senate or the House may modify the bill to fix this glitch.

Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 would qualify for the ITC under Section 48, as noted below.

Accelerated Termination of Section 45U PTC for Existing Nuclear Facilities: This credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2031, and such credits would remain transferable for the duration of the credit period.

The amendments to the bill did not affect the provisions in the draft bill presented by the Ways and Means Committee with respect to tax credits available under sections 45Q, 45V, 45X, 45Z, and 48, which are summarized below.

Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 (which must have begun construction by Dec. 31, 2024) are unaffected by the bill. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind). The quantum of PTC or ITC available for a given project under sections 45 or 48, as applicable, is the same (for a project that qualifies thereunder) as it would be for the same project under sections 45Y or48E. Application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements to achieve a 5x credit rate, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would not be affected by the bill

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the House Budget Bill:

Overall, the proposed amendments fall into 3 general categories:

Expiration of certain credits as early as December 31, 2025, while other credits would either expire in 2028 or follow a modified phaseout schedule starting in 2029.

Foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions would apply to all IRA tax credits.

Repeal of transferability after 2 years from enactment for credits under 45Q, 45X, and 45Z.

Observation: Safe harboring of credit rate would be based on timing of placement in service, whereas safe harboring of transferability would be based on timing of beginning construction.

§45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

The credits would expire for projects that (i) begin construction after 60 days from enactment, or (ii) are placed in service after Dec. 31, 2028. However, for advanced nuclear facilities and expansions of nuclear facilities, the deadline to begin construction would be Dec. 31, 2028, with no placed in service deadline. In other words, to claim credits a project would need to (i) begin construction within 60 days of enactment and (ii) be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2028.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, that include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity""; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

100% of ITCs claimed under Section 48E with respect to a property would be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning 2 years after enactment) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability would continue for the duration of the credit period.

No credit would be allowed for residential solar water heating property, solar electric property, or small wind energy property if (i) the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party and (ii) the third party would qualify for the 25D credit with respect to such property if the third party were the owner of such property.

Observation: The placed in service deadline represents a policy change from the general continuity safe harbor period of 4 years (10 years for offshore wind) provided under current IRS guidance on beginning construction.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for facilities that begin construction after 2 years from enactment.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit would terminate for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2031.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be continue for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit would be terminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

The credit rate would phase out as follows based on the date the eligible components are sold:

On or before December 31, 2029: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%; and

After December 31, 2031: 0%;

Wind energy components sold after December 31, 2027, would not be credit eligible.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" or make an ""applicable payment"" to a ""prohibited foreign entity"" with respect to any eligible component category in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment that (i) include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" or (ii) are produced subject to a licensing agreements with prohibited foreign entity valued in excess of $1 million.

Transferability would be repealed for components sold after 2027.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period would be extended until December 31, 2031 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel sold after December 31, 2025, would be required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions would exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and distinct emissions rates would be provided for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for fuel produced after 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The credit rate for ground or groundwater thermal systems would phase out as follows based on when such property begins construction:

Before January 1, 2030, 6%;

During 2030: 5.2%;

During 2031: 4.4%;

After December 31, 2031: 0%.

FEOC restrictions would disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after enactment;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" in tax years beginning 2 years after enactment.

Transferability would be repealed for property that begins construction after 2 years from enactment.

Observation: Credit-eligible asset classes under Sections 48, 45Y, 48E, and 45Q, application of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, potential bonus credit amounts for energy community and domestic content, and eligibility for direct pay under Section 6417 would be unchanged.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements would apply to credits under Sections 45Y,48E, and 45X that would not apply to credits under Sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

The bill aims to cement Trump’s America First agenda into law. The legislation includes tax cuts and reforms that many organizations say will benefit American workers, businesses, and families.

The Farm Bureau applauded updated farm programs and tax provisions that will help farmers and ranchers. The Chamber of Commerce said the bill will raise wages and improve lives by making tax relief permanent. Airlines for America praised the $12.5 billion investment to modernize air traffic control infrastructure.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the bill invests in cattle health and provides tax relief to protect family farms.

House passes Trump’s tax cuts bill

Small business groups like the Job Creators Network and National Association of Manufacturers called it a major victory.

They said making tax cuts permanent will allow small businesses to expand, hire, and raise wages. However, the bill would also roll back incentives for electric vehicles. It repeals subsidies for EV purchases, battery manufacturing, and charging stations passed under President Biden.

Analysts said this will make EVs more expensive and could delay automakers’ plans for new EV and battery factories in the U.S.

The legislation now heads to the Senate for consideration. Republican leaders aim to use money saved from cutting EV incentives to provide tax cuts primarily for high-income households and businesses. The White House said the bill could increase take-home pay for families and workers by over $13,000 and $11,000 respectively over the next four years.

“It is the first serious fusion power plant design that I’ve seen,” said Dr. Neilson.
The Type One Energy Infinity Two fusion power plant is being designed to put a nominal 350 MWe on the electricity grid.
By properly architecting Infinity Two, Type One Energy is creating a proprietary fusion power plant design that supports a compelling two-year power plant operating cycle separated by 30-day planned maintenance outages using today’s existing materials and enabling technologies.
The company also made use of its partner-rich commercialization program to access the power generation industry’s deep expertise in power plant engineering design.","Type One Energy announced on May 27 that it had successfully completed the first formal design review of Infinity Two, which is based on the world’s only implementable, peer-reviewed physics basis for a fusion power plant recently published by the prestigious Journal of Plasma Physics. The Infinity Two design is progressing in support of a potential fusion power plant project with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), using Type One Energy stellarator technology.

The Infinity Two design review board, which was chaired by Type One Energy Chief Technology Officer Dr. Thomas Sunn Pedersen, included several outside experts, including Dr. George H. “Hutch” Neilson from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Dr. Paolo Ferroni from the Westinghouse Electric Company, to provide independent assessments of the engineering work performed by Type One Energy.

“It is the first serious fusion power plant design that I’ve seen,” said Dr. Neilson. “The work they’ve done to date provides a sound foundation for continued design development of what could be the first system to produce net electricity from fusion.”

Dr. Ferroni, the Chief Engineer for Advanced Reactors—GenIV/Fusion at Westinghouse Electric Company, added, “I think it is important that the Type One Energy team is taking a comprehensive plant-level approach to develop their technology, which includes a description of all necessary systems, not just the plasma core.”

Successful completion of the initial design review confirms that the Infinity Two technology approach, architecture, performance, and reliability requirements remain aligned with the expectations of TVA and the broader global energy market for a commercially viable first-of-a-kind (FOAK) fusion power plant.

The Type One Energy Infinity Two fusion power plant is being designed to put a nominal 350 MWe on the electricity grid. This design is based on the company’s groundbreaking stellarator fusion physics basis, which, for the first time, realistically considered in a comprehensive and unified manner, the complex relationship between competing requirements for plasma performance, power plant startup, construction logistics, reliability, and economics utilizing actual power plant operating experience. The Journal of Plasma Physics considers this approach to be “… setting the gold standard for how this is done.”

The Infinity Two architecture is grounded in stellarator fusion technology. This technology has, uniquely within the fusion industry, demonstrated stable, continuous steady-state operation at large scale by the W7-X machine. By properly architecting Infinity Two, Type One Energy is creating a proprietary fusion power plant design that supports a compelling two-year power plant operating cycle separated by 30-day planned maintenance outages using today’s existing materials and enabling technologies. The company also made use of its partner-rich commercialization program to access the power generation industry’s deep expertise in power plant engineering design. Among other firms, AtkinsRéalis assisted in developing the design of those Infinity Two systems and structures not part of Type One Energy’s core focus on the stellarator fusion technology.

“Our ability to efficiently architect the initial Infinity Two design in an efficient, partner-rich manner reaffirms our commitment to pursuing the lowest-risk, shortest-schedule path to a commercially viable fusion power plant,” said Christofer Mowry, CEO for Type One Energy. “The energy industry needs more reliable, clean, power generation technology that can meet the rapidly increasing demand for electricity and we are delivering a commercially compelling solution.”

The progress Type One Energy is making on its Infinity Two fusion power plant design, together with its collaboration with TVA, has attracted the attention of the global energy industry. Several prominent energy utilities and industrial companies have expressed an interest in Infinity Two and participation in Type One Energy’s deployment of its first-generation fusion power plant technology.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/type-one-energy-fusion-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:24:46.715700

Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill Thursday that would further pare back most clean energy production, manufacturing and investment tax credits. The bill’s passage came after clean industry executives were looking for sympathetic members of the chamber to push for favorable changes to a version that passed the Ways and Means Committee earlier this month.

The bill’s passage immediately sparked alarm across the clean energy economy that has been supported by the credits, as companies and industry groups representing clean energy developers and responsible investors warned the bill would eliminate jobs, slow development and raise energy prices.

Scott Elias, vice president of policy and market development for clean energy developer and investor CleanCapital, said Thursday that the bill “threatens U.S. energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China.”

“Put simply, Congress is now one chamber away from passing a law that would dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments and stall clean energy deployment,” Elias said in emailed comments Thursday.

While the committee-passed bill text would have phased out most of the Inflation Reduction Act on a multi-year timeline, the House-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would repeal the IRA’s technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits for any projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment, according to an analysis by clean energy tax credit marketplace Crux. Non-nuclear projects that meet the accelerated construction timeline would see the credits eliminated entirely after 2028.

The nuclear energy industry saw positive changes from the committee text, including a carveout from the production and investment credits restrictions and having the full credit value available until 2031. However, other changes to transferability mechanisms, as well manufacturing production, carbon sequestration and clean fuels were also included.

The residential solar industry would be upended, with a credit eliminated for leased residential and community solar installs that began after Jan. 1 of this year, according to the Crux analysis. SunRun, the nation’s leading residential solar company, saw its shares fall nearly 40% on May 22, ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive reported.

Additionally, a foreign entity of concern provision that some House Republicans recommended be adjusted to aid the U.S. clean energy industry instead saw its start date pushed up to 2026 in the House-passed bill.

After the bill’s passage, industry group Advance Energy United President and CEO Heather O’Neill said the bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy.”

“If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs, and ceding energy dominance to China,” O’Neill said in a release. “This isn’t a scalpel, it’s a meat cleaver, and it will hurt us all.”

Climate nonprofit Ceres said the House-passed reconciliation bill is “unworkable” in its current form, as it “all but eliminat[es] clean economy incentives” and would freeze investment in “key sectors.”

“Unless redone, this legislation will raise prices across the country, resulting in less energy and more scarcity,” Ceres Senior Director of Federal Policy Zach Friedman said in an emailed statement May 22.

Industry groups and participants are hoping for more moderated changes to the current clean energy tax environment in the Senate version of the bill. Crux noted in its blog that “historically, the House version of a reconciliation bill represents the biggest change to law, with the Senate playing the role of narrowing the approach.”

After the committee-passed bill would have limited the window of tax credit transferability, the version that passed the House maintained the transferability mechanism through the lifecycle of the tech-neutral tax credits and nuclear production credits, in line with a recommendation from a group of House Republicans.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SzeDlF5mAUjrDGk1oJJJMM3i44d_IA-dOxj49B5UYxk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkwMTk5MTY0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:20.749374

Renewable energy is energy independence Climate and clean energy investments are at the top of DOGE’s hit list.
Meanwhile, other countries, including those that the administration says it cares to compete with, are investing dozens of times more into renewable projects.","There’s a reason the United States hasn’t seen a new aluminum smelter in 45 years. Producing this soft, pliable metal from scratch consumes astronomical amounts of electricity, and the costs of keeping a smelter open and running, let alone building a new one, are just too high.

But Century Aluminum, a U.S.-based company, hopes to change that by building a first-of-its-kind green aluminum smelter in the Ohio-Mississippi basins. Through improved energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, the proposed facility could emit 75 percent less climate pollution than a typical smelter and, potentially, rejuvenate the domestic aluminum industry.

Made possible by $500 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the project could also create 5,500 construction jobs. And yet, the future of the smelter, along with dozens of the DOE’s other multimillion-dollar climate and clean energy projects, is in jeopardy.

Around 8,500 DOE staffers risk losing their jobs due to the roughshod reorganization efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and thousands more have accepted voluntary resignation offers.

The Elon Musk–led office has already fired tens of thousands of federal workers and substantially shrunk or altogether shuttered multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, and the National Park Service.

The Trump administration is coming for the DOE’s budget too. The proposed 2026 federal discretionary budget reduces DOE funding by $19.3 billion, with the deepest cuts to renewable energy and decarbonization programs. When excluding the National Nuclear Security Administration, which received a 25 percent increase, the proposed cut is nearly 20 percent of the DOE’s remaining budget.

While DOGE’s efforts face widespread public scrutiny and mounting legal pushback, including by NRDC and partners, the work of the DOE remains in limbo. Here’s why an intact Energy Department is essential to solving some of the toughest challenges of a rapidly changing, and warming, world.

OCED: Because industry needs innovation

Heavy industries, such as steel, concrete, and chemical production, are notorious carbon polluters. In fact, in addition to spewing large amounts of local air pollution, industry contributes 30 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Often, the production methods in these industrial sectors haven’t changed in decades, and the pollution solutions that work for one industry don’t necessarily work for another.

“These have always been called ‘hard-to-abate’ industries, which meant sweep them under the rug and ignore their pollution,” explains Christina Theodoridi, head of NRDC’s industrial policy team.

This is where the innovations spurred by the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) come in. OCED works to speed up the commercial adoption of innovative cleaner technologies—the kind that have made it past the R&D phase but aren’t yet ready to go fully commercial. Private investors typically see such projects as too high risk, so the federal government’s initial support and cost-sharing is essential to getting big polluters to modernize without breaking the bank.

OCED launched its $6 billion Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP) last year. The program provides funding for groundbreaking projects that test new means of electrification, pollution control, and energy efficiency, among others. IDP projects vary widely. Current initiatives include new ways to make cement, glass, and steam, several with little or no fossil fuels.

The American Council for an Energy-efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization, estimates IDP could funnel $14 billion in private investment to communities within 20 states. But, with OCED’s future now uncertain, so is its $25 billion portfolio of projects.

Among them are the proposed regional hydrogen hubs—a network of facilities planned at sites throughout the country dedicated to advancing this burgeoning clean energy industry. The department had earmarked $8 billion for the program to develop innovative ways of producing hydrogen, which has a variety of end products, from jet fuel to fertilizer. Two other OCED endeavors are the direct air capture (DAC) hubs slated for Louisiana and southern Texas. These hubs aim to find ways to scrub carbon dioxide from the air for either storage underground or for new uses.

Both the hydrogen and DAC hubs appeared on DOGE’s short list of proposed canceled projects leaked in March.

Many local leaders expressed frustration with the decision. “Investing in DAC will generate demand for American-made steel, concrete, and advanced equipment, revitalizing U.S. manufacturing and ensuring that innovation and jobs remain here at home,” wrote Louisiana Secretary for Economic Development Susan Bourgeois in a letter to the state’s representatives in Washington, D.C., urging them to tell Energy Secretary Chris Wright to reconsider the defunding.

According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit organization that advocates for clean energy, OCED programs would support roughly 290,000 jobs and fuel nearly $70 billion in economic output. The DOE’s many private sector partners could also be left in the lurch.

“A lot of the work that the DOE does, especially when it comes to the commercialization of breakthrough tech, is through public-private partnerships,” Theodoridi explains. “The federal government is now letting go of its end of the bargain. It erodes confidence in our nation’s ability to be a partner—and it's going to take a long time to build it back.”

A resilient electric grid to keep the lights on

The grid is also in need of an overhaul. “If you started from scratch, you’d never build the system the way we have it today,” says Cullen Howe, a senior policy advocate at NRDC whose work focuses on improving the country’s transmission system and decarbonizing the power sector.

For starters, the grid needs double its transmission capacity—that is, its ability to move large quantities of electricity over long distances. “Right now, we don't have an equivalent to the interstate highway system for the transmission system, but that's what we need,” Howe says. With extreme weather of all varieties increasing the occurrences of power outages, upgrading our transmission capacity has grown more urgent than ever.

The DOE, and specifically its Grid Deployment Office (GDO), are central to this work. In 2023, the GDO launched its Transmission Facilitation Program, a $2.5 billion effort to build or upgrade high-voltage transmission lines that crisscross the country and connect previously separated regions of the grid.

In a recent round of contracts, the GDO awarded funding to four new projects that would together add nearly 1,000 miles of new transmission infrastructure and 7,100 megawatts of capacity to the grid. This kind of big-picture planning for the country’s transmission system is some of what the GDO does best.

For example, every three years, the office releases its National Transmission Needs Study, a look at what kind of infrastructure the country needs to meet its growing electric demands. The study informs investment and planning decisions by regional transmission operators, utilities, and local governments, among others.

“If a nonprofit puts out a study that says, ‘This is the amount of transmission we're going to need over the next 20 years,’ that's useful,” Howe says. “But it doesn’t carry the weight of a nonpartisan federal agency.”

During severe winter storms or heat waves, the grid must be able to move electricity around to meet regional demand spikes or address service interruptions. Further, because solar and wind energy generation tends to occur in rural areas, adequate transmission is vital to getting that power to wherever consumers need it.

Meanwhile, energy demand is expected to keep growing substantially, in large part due to the electrification of the building and transportation sectors and the expansion of power-hungry data centers, especially with the rise of AI.

With sweeping staff and budget cuts, the DOE won’t be able to build the modern, resilient power grid essential to meeting the electric needs of the coming decades. “My sense is that most of the work that the Grid Deployment Office was doing—if they even staff the office at all—is probably not going to be done,” Howe says.

Renewable energy is energy independence

Climate and clean energy investments are at the top of DOGE’s hit list. In its proposed 2026 budget, the administration eliminates more than $19 billion in funding for “climate change–related activities,” such as the Biden administration’s Justice40 initiative and what it falsely dubs “Green New Scam funds committing to build unreliable renewable energy.”

The DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy faces a $2.6 billion cut, along with the downsizing of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a research lab that focuses on energy systems research and development. NREL, located in Golden, Colorado, laid off 114 employees in May, but there are fears of more to come.

These cuts would hobble the United State’s ability to scale up its renewable energy output at a moment when the world needs to double down on it, in order to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.

Take for example the U.S. offshore wind industry, which could supply up to a quarter of the nation’s total electricity by 2050. A growing stretch of proposed offshore wind farms along the Atlantic Coast are poised to generate much of this power. Yet they need the DOE to help bring that electricity ashore—a complicated job involving laying cable deep in the sea, navigating harsh ocean environments, and coordinating ports, vessels, and crews.

So, over the course of two years, the Energy Department held a series of workshops to hear from state representatives, Tribal leaders, regional transmission operators, and energy experts (including those from NRDC), and other stakeholders. The result was the 2024 Atlantic Offshore Wind Transmission Study and a subsequent Action Plan, which now serves as a guide for decision makers up and down the coast.

Complex infrastructure projects like these have the potential to transform the U.S. power sector and make it more resilient, but they require ongoing collaboration with dozens of parties across federal, state, and local jurisdictions—each with their own interests and sensitivities. For DOE staff to succeed, they need to understand how the bureaucracy works, along with all the relevant laws, codes, standards, and stakeholders.

“These aren’t things that can just run on autopilot,” says Jennifer DiStefano, director of innovation and technology for industry at NRDC. And managing them is not a task that a brand-new DOE staffer could handle on day one. “Ultimately, the agency needs experts in order to do its job effectively.”

Turning our back on renewable energy investments now would not only spell climate disaster but also make the United States less of a player on the world stage.

In recent years, thanks to federal investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States was about to reclaim some of the solar manufacturing it had lost to China and Southeast Asia over the past 20 years. That comeback is in jeopardy now. Meanwhile, other countries, including those that the administration says it cares to compete with, are investing dozens of times more into renewable projects.

“We need to figure out how to deploy as much clean energy as possible so that we have reliable, affordable, abundant energy for all Americans,” Theodoridi says. “They should be turbocharging the Energy Department. Instead, they're pumping the brakes.”",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/worker-century-aluminum-smelter-kentucky-RC13E6D54B10.JPG?h=b9130491&itok=Kx54hg13,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:25.243150

“The Waterford 3 nuclear plant was in the midst of a previously planned outage on Sunday afternoon, as part of regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance,"" a spokesperson for Entergy said. “Entergy typically conducts maintenance on its utility plants in the spring and fall, when loads are lower. The Waterford 3 maintenance and refueling outage was conducted in accordance with that policy and was planned months ahead.”

New Orleans City Councilman JP Morrell, the lead regulator of Entergy in the city of New Orleans, said the council will hold a hearing on Tuesday, June 3, with Entergy and the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator (MISO) to get answers about what happened. He said he couldn't comment on the nuclear power plant going down until that hearing.

He did question the decisions made in Baton Rouge to cut power to 52,000 customers in New Orleans, more than the 38,500 that lost power in Jefferson Parish, even though Jefferson Parish has more Entergy customers than New Orleans. Another 12,000 customers were affected in St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes combined.

""Out of the 100,000 homes that were affected, over 50,000 were in one parish, and that seems very, very glaring,"" Morrell said. He said next Tuesday's hearing will provide more answers, but he's skeptical after what happened during Winter Storm Uri in February 2021, which forced similar rolling blackouts, including shutting off power to the city's water intake pumps.

""They had an investigation and it was shown that New Orleans bore a disproportionate brunt of that load-shed, and the excuse at that time was like the wrong lever had been pulled,"" Morrell said.

According to Entergy, the forced outages were directed by MISO as a last resort and done to prevent a more extensive, prolonged power outage that could have severely affected the reliability of the power grid.

MISO is a regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid in portions of 15 states, including Louisiana in the South and Midwest, and parts of Canada.

Lewis claims Entergy should share some of the blame for the outages.

""If we had more significant solar and battery storage, we could have been able to use some of those immediate resources for the short time to keep the lights on,"" Lewis said. ""If we had better transmission, we could have flowed power from other parts of the state and other parts of this nation to keep power on.""

More than 100,000 customers lost electricity during the series of rolling blackouts Sunday. Approximately 52,000 customers were impacted in the city of New Orleans. Outages were also reported in Jefferson, St. Bernard, Plaquemines, St. Tammany and Washington parishes.

As of Monday morning, power had been fully restored across the New Orleans area.

Cleco updates customers on Sunday’s forced power outage:

“If the power supply cannot meet the demand, periodic power outages could be needed to protect the stability of the power grid and prevent widespread lengthy outages,” said Jennifer Cahill, director of corporate communications. “This was the case yesterday when we took the unprecedented step, as directed by MISO, to force outages to some customers in St. Tammany Parish.”

“Controlled outages are a last resort when all other options have been exhausted, and every attempt is made to notify customers before an outage occurs,” said Cahill. “However, due to the many variables that affect the overall electric power grid, these events can occur quickly and without advance notice.”

“We apologize to our customers who experienced power loss during yesterday’s mandatory service interruption,” said Cahill. “And while we strive to give our customers advance notice of any outages, this emergency situation did not allow us the time to inform our customers ahead of time.”

What is MISO??!

""As our climate continues to change and rainfall increases, these types of projects help us maintain healthy lakes, rivers, and streams,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. ""It’s important that we implement strategies to eliminate the pollutants at the source, restore impaired waters and provide equitable access to clean and safe water.""

NPS pollution occurs when rainfall or melting snow picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, such as fertilizers, herbicides, construction sediment, nutrients and bacteria from animal waste, and eventually deposits those pollutants into our lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and ground waters. There are many types of NPS pollution that can impact our waterways. These grants help municipalities, tribal nations, regional planning agencies, and public and private entities address NPS pollution across Massachusetts.

The ten grants awarded are:

Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe — $700,000

Mashpee, MA

The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Town of Mashpee have collaborated to take a strategic, watershed-based approach utilizing a combination of structural and non-structural best management practices (BMPs) to improve water quality in Santuit Pond. This project will reduce persistent water quality degradation in Santuit Pond due to excessive in-pond nutrient loading by sequestering phosphorus over a 145-acre area of sediment where anoxia occurs most frequently. Alum treatment will be applied to the pond to reduce internal phosphorus loading to achieve substantial progress toward the watershed-based plan goal of an 81 percent reduction in phosphorus load established for the pond. This project will build on ongoing outreach and engagement activities targeted at residents in the neighborhoods surrounding Santuit Pond, Town officials, and the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe.

Mystic River Watershed Association — $869,640

Arlington, MA

The Mystic River Watershed Association will take a strategic, watershed-based approach to construct a total of 65 infiltration trenches in six (6) municipalities in the Mystic River watershed, offering cost-effective phosphorus reduction in a highly urbanized setting. This strategy is based on a model pioneered by the Town of Arlington in consultation with the University of New Hampshire Stormwater Center and EPA. The project is a continuation of work conducted by the City of Everett on behalf of eight municipalities. Municipalities will gain capacity to continue similar projects into the future, as municipalities work to meet the ambitious phosphorus reduction goals set out in the Alternative Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report for the Mystic River watershed, released in May 2020 by EPA and MassDEP.

Town of Monson — $203,965

This project will improve water quality and ecological conditions for Chicopee Brook by installing stormwater BMPs at Cushman Field and support improved landscape management at Veterans Field. These recreational facilities, located along Chicopee Brook in Monson’s downtown, are identified in the Chicopee Brook Watershed Plan as highest priority sites for stormwater management BMPs. For Cushman Field, proposed BMPs include the installation of a 5,750-square foot bio-infiltration basin and larger drainage pipe to capture storm flows from Main and Washington Streets and stabilization of the unpaved road to reduce sediment transport. At Veteran’s Field, the recommendation to develop a 10-foot “no mow” zone along 500 feet of Chicopee Brook will be combined with a transition to organic land care practice.

The Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center – Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment (Wastewater Division) — $416,997

This project will install 25 urine diversion (UD) systems in nitrogen-impaired watersheds. The applicant will document actual nitrogen load reductions by watershed and generate performance data of UD systems to support the inclusion of UD as a general use nutrient management strategy. The County will also develop and maintain a publicly accessible map tool to communicate real-time progress toward watershed TMDLs. This project will help develop the management infrastructure needed to support collection, transport, and recycling and/or disposal of urine, and document costs and energy usage to maintain a community urine diversion program.

Solar power is expected to become cheaper than nuclear energy between 2030 and 2035. Rapid improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower installation costs are driving this change. By 2035, solar is projected to lead the nation’s power generation. This shift supports a national goal of 80% renewable energy, aligning climate priorities with energy security and economic growth.

South Korea’s Power Mix in 2024: Heavy on Fossil Fuels, Light on Renewables

Think Tank Ember Group’s analysis showed that in 2024, low-carbon sources generated 40% of South Korea’s electricity, nearly matching the global average of 41%.

As the world’s 7th largest electricity consumer, South Korea still leans heavily on fossil fuels, which supply 60% of its electricity.

Nuclear energy is the country’s largest source of clean power, accounting for 30% of the mix. However, solar and wind together made up just 6%, less than half the global average of 15%.

Despite rapid economic growth and rising power demand over the last two decades, South Korea’s power sector emissions peaked in 2018. This turning point came as solar and nuclear began to edge out coal. Still, emissions remain high, at around 5 tonnes of CO₂ per person. It’s nearly three times the global average.

Looking ahead, South Korea is targeting 20% renewable electricity by 2030. That figure, though a step forward, falls far short of the 60% global renewables share envisioned in the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario for that year.

Why Solar Power Is Outpacing Nuclear?

The country’s energy model is shifting, supported by strong policies and rising investments in solar. A report titled “Assessing the Levelized Cost of Energy in South Korea” shows that solar’s levelized cost of energy (LCOE) may drop by 50% in the next decade. In contrast, nuclear’s LCOE could rise by 15% due to aging reactors and increased maintenance costs.

Solar’s declining costs give it a clear advantage over coal, nuclear, and natural gas. The report estimates that solar could supply over 60% of South Korea’s electricity by 2035, up from about 10% in 2020.

Growth will come from rooftop solar in cities and large-scale solar farms in rural areas. Thus, South Korea is seeing solar become the smartest and most sustainable energy option.

Boosting Energy Independence

EIA revealed that, “South Korea relies on imports to meet almost 98% of its fossil fuel consumption as a result of insufficient domestic resources.”

This dependence exposes the economy to global risks and price fluctuations. Transitioning to solar and other renewables aims to reduce this reliance and boost national energy security.

The country’s National Carbon Neutrality Plan links expanding clean power to building national resilience. By increasing domestic renewable energy sources, South Korea lowers its vulnerability to international supply chain issues. The plan also outlines key steps to enhance clean power, upgrade transmission networks, and expand battery storage, strengthening the grid against disruptions.

Cutting Emissions and Cleaning the Air

As of 2023, fossil fuels provide 62% of South Korea’s electricity, giving it one of the highest per-person carbon footprints in the G20. Replacing coal and gas with renewables like solar will significantly lower emissions by 2035.

The “A Clean Energy Korea by 2035” study shows that expanding solar and wind, along with a target of 10 GW of storage by 2030, can reduce fossil fuel use without building new coal plants. This shift will cut emissions, improve air quality, and help South Korea meet its climate commitments.

Kim Seo-Young from the Korea Energy Agency stated,

“Clean energy isn’t just about reducing emissions—it’s about improving public health and creating a stronger economy.”

Market Transformation Underway

South Korea’s electricity market is changing. New infrastructure and investment are making solar and wind more affordable. Analysts expect a 28% to 41% drop in the LCOE of solar and wind by 2035, while nuclear costs are likely to keep rising.

Nuclear currently makes up about 30% of power generation, but solar is set to overtake it in the next decade. Government plans include adding up to 14.5 GW of renewable energy each year from 2030 to 2035.

A $30 billion investment will support large solar projects and urban rooftop installations.

Private companies are also getting involved. As regulations change to support cleaner energy, local firms invest in solar development. New pilot programs and battery storage projects are beginning in industrial areas, with support from public R&D funding. This growth could create up to 400,000 green jobs by 2035.

These jobs will be in renewable tech, grid management, and clean manufacturing. This shift benefits both the planet and the economy.

Will South Korea Hit Its 2035 Clean Energy Target?

Reaching 80% clean electricity by 2035 depends on how quickly South Korea scales up. Current trends show that, without stronger action, renewables might only reach 21–33% of power by 2038. This is much lower than what other advanced economies expect.

Public, industry, and international partners are pushing for faster action. Sectors like AI and chip manufacturing are growing, and their energy demands are high.

If they continue to rely on fossil fuels, the country might lose its competitive edge. Thus, speeding up the rollout of renewables is essential for climate goals and maintaining relevance in the global economy.

Solar’s rapid growth, driven by affordability and smart policies, makes it South Korea’s leading energy source. No longer an add-on, solar is now central to the clean energy revolution. The next decade will challenge the system’s flexibility and resolve. The path ahead is clear: solar is leading the way.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2519034573.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:28.943814

The Trump administration touted low gas prices and ""the Trump Effect in action.""

Analyst credited economic turmoil and OPEC production for lower prices.

Gas prices — the subject of considerable political spin and even a doughnut promotion as millions of Americans hit the roadways and went shopping during the long holiday weekend — averaged $3.18 a gallon nationally and $3.20 in Michigan, according to AAA.

Petroleum analysts and news outlets have attempted to explain the fluctuations in prices in a global economy disrupted by tariffs and a shifting U.S. energy policy that encourages increased fossil fuel use and environmental deregulation.

The national gas price average, derived from a survey of about 120,000 gas stations, was 41 cents less on Monday than it was a year ago, but the same as a week ago.

Michigan’s average was down 46 cents from a year ago, but up three cents from last week.

Throughout the state, the highest gas price averages by community were in Benton Harbor, $3.27 a gallon; Lansing, $3.26 and Grand Rapids, $3.25, and the lowest were in Traverse City, $3.04; Marquette, $3.08 and metro Detroit, $3.16.

Amid the Memorial Day sales for everything from coffee makers, Apple watches, giant-screen TVs, refrigerators, headphones, swimsuits and ""perfect vintage jeans,"" Krispy Kreme crafted a quirky campaign around gas prices.

The doughnut company advertised: ""Long weekend plans = snacks on deck,"" urging folks to buy a box of a dozen original glazed doughnuts to ""fuel up"" for $3.17, the national average before rounding up, when you ""buy any dozen!""

And the Trump administration touted low gas prices and ""the Trump Effect in action,"" saying fuel was ""the cheapest since 2021"" and ""if you adjust for inflation and rising wages,"" and excluded the pandemic years, Americans were spending ""the least amount filling up this Memorial Day since 2003.""

The White House, which attributed its claims to GasBuddy, went on to declare ""Biden’s war on American energy is over"" and trumpeted Trump’s ""relentless action to revive the nation’s energy capabilities and undo the Biden-era stranglehold on American energy production.""

Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy’s senior petroleum analyst, confirmed on X that ""speaking seasonally, all 50 states are lower than last Memorial Day"" and noted that gas prices were at their lowest seasonal (Memorial Day) level since 2021.""

DeHaan said gas prices are at their lowest inflation-adjusted level since 2003, excluding 2020, meaning Americans are putting ""less of their paycheck into their tanks,"" although prices are higher than they were in December.""

In the last six months, DeHaan said, gas prices ""climbed in 39 of the nation’s 50 states, declined in 11.""

Politicians, he added, will ""lie/incorrectly lead you to believe they've done something,"" adding ""the bulk of this has been recent economic turmoil, as well as OPEC production changes, and continued re-balancing of the global economy"" since the pandemic.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil has been trading at less than $62 a barrel and could fall. At its May 31 meeting, Bloomberg News reported, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to discuss whether to increase oil output.

The price of oil is a key factor in the price of gasoline. More oil production could be good for consumers, but bad for oil companies, which also affects the economy. When prices fall, oil companies tend to profit less.

Fact-checkers also have suggested that previous claims by President Donald Trump that gas has been selling for less than $2 a gallon, and by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that prices have “collapsed under President Trump,” were misleading.

DeHaan also warned that hurricane season, if turbulent, could cause spikes in gas prices, and forecasted last week that ""due to a large jump in wholesale prices,"" the retail price could go up.

On Thursday, May 22, the Senate passed Congressional Review Act resolutions reversing California’s Environmental Protection Agency waivers for three vehicle emission rules: Advanced Clean Cars II, Advanced Clean Trucks and the Omnibus Low NOX regulation. All three resolutions passed on a party-line vote.

Last week’s votes kill any hope for California to implement regulations that phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. By using the Congressional Review Act, California cannot take a second bite at the apple with a future Democratic administration. It would take an act of Congress for it to do so.

Enacted in 1996, the Congressional Review Act requires agencies to send new rules to Congress, allowing lawmakers to review and overturn them. Once a rule is submitted, Congress has 60 days to file a joint resolution of disapproval to revoke the rule. Rather than the typical 60 votes needed to pass a bill in the Senate, a CRA resolution requires only a simple majority.

Once signed into law, an agency is barred from issuing a similar rule in the future. In this case, California cannot request an EPA waiver for vehicle emission regulations that are “substantially the same form” as the Advanced Clean Trucks and Advanced Clean Cars II rules.

If a future EPA wants to grant similar vehicle emission waivers, Congress would need to pass a law allowing it to do just that.

“This action, once signed by President Trump, not only prevents California from implementing their attempt at EV mandate actions but ensures that they can never do something similar again,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

The trucking industry applauded Congress’ decision to stop California’s electric vehicle mandate. The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said CRA resolutions “protect small-business truckers nationwide from California’s regulatory encroachments.”

“Setting national policy is the responsibility of Congress, not California,” OOIDA President Todd Spencer said. “It’s no wonder small-business truckers have left the state in droves to find better opportunities elsewhere. For OOIDA members, vehicle reliability and affordability are critical. So far, there is no convincing evidence that electric commercial motor vehicles are a viable option for small-business truckers given the high costs and inadequate charging infrastructure.”

CRA controversy

This marks the first time the Congressional Review Act has been used to overturn one of California’s EPA waivers, a move Democrats have warned may set a dangerous precedent.

Until now, the EPA has not submitted its California waivers to Congress because it determined that they are not considered rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have backed that determination.

Three years ago, the Biden administration rescinded the EPA’s decision from Trump’s first term to revoke an Obama-era waiver for the Advanced Clean Cars vehicle emission rule. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.V., asked the GAO whether those waivers are considered rules under the Congressional Review Act.

In November 2023, the GAO determined that the EPA waivers are not rules under the Congressional Review Act. Rather, they are considered orders and cannot be reviewed and repealed by Congress.

Despite that finding, the EPA submitted the three California vehicle emission waivers, collectively called an electric vehicle mandate, to Congress as rules in February. By doing so, the agency started the 60-day clock for a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the waivers.

In March, Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff asked the GAO if those waivers are rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. The GAO doubled down on its 2023 determination, stating that the EPA waivers submitted to Congress in February are not rules that Congress can review and overturn them through a CRA resolution.

Undeterred, House Republicans introduced the three resolutions in April to overturn EPA waivers allowing California’s electric vehicle mandate.

Just hours before Senate Republicans introduced their resolutions, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that EPA waivers are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, reinforcing the GAO rulings.

Since then, Democrats have raised concerns about breaking with traditional procedures by overruling parliamentarian and GAO rulings. Republican Sens. Mike Lee, John Thune and Susan Collins have acknowledged those rulings, with Thune and Collins indicating they would not vote against the parliamentarian.

During a Senate floor speech before the vote, Padilla called the votes to overturn California’s vehicle emission waivers a “nuclear option.” He claimed there is nothing stopping the Senate from weaponizing the Congressional Review Act to undo virtually any agency action that was not considered a rule in the past.

Padilla warned that using the CRA to overturn California’s electric vehicle mandate could set a dangerous precedent.

“Republicans have crossed the red line and gone nuclear,” Padilla said in a statement. “As the saying goes, ‘What goes around comes around.’ And it won’t be long before Democrats are back in the driver’s seat again. When that happens, all bets will be off. Every agency action that Democrats don’t like – whether it’s a rule or not – will be fair game, from mining permits and fossil fuel projects to foreign affairs and tax policies.”

Capito shot back, claiming nothing in the Senate rules gives the GAO the authority to prevent senators from overturning a rule through the Congressional Review Act. She said Republicans are not expanding the scope of the CRA. Rather, they are not narrowing the CRA by subjecting it to GAO approval.

“The procedural action we have taken today is not about the filibuster and not about the parliamentarian,” Capito said. “Instead, the procedural issue before the Senate was simply whether GAO staff should be able to block resolutions of disapproval against agency-submitted rules.”

The 72% figure represents a 24% increase in system-level defects from previous years.

Of the system-level defects, 62% were identified across three ‘Safety-critical failures’. The first was 28% of defects in fire detection and suppression, 19% with faulty auxiliary circuit panels, and 15% with thermal management defects.

The other notable categorised system-level defect was ‘Performance failures,’ which comprised 6% of systems failing capacity tests.

For CEA, a critical failure denotes “Findings that may result in severe safety risks and hazardous conditions. Critical findings are likely to cause damage to other products or property, trigger non-compliance regulatory issues and generally constitute a breach of mandatory regulations.”

The firm also says that none of the inspected systems were shipped with unresolved thermal management of fire detection/suppression defects.

It follows a four-step defect resolution protocol: buyers are notified, the manufacturer is informed of the issue, the manufacturer must fix or make a new item, and then the item is re-inspected.

CEA further clarified that most system-level findings, 64%, were balance of system (BOS)-related.

Balance of system-related findings occur when defects with BESS components or improper system integration procedures arise. CEA says an example would be a live conductor exposed within the AC/DC distribution, or malfunctioning sensors and alarms due to miswiring.

30% of system-level findings were enclosure-related. These are defects from the enclosure manufacturing and mishandling during transportation. CEA gave the example of grounding mechanism defects.

6% of system-level findings are performance test-related. This includes a wide variety of manufacturing defects or improper system integration. CEA gave an example of charging/discharging failure due to wiring issues in battery rack’s high-voltage boxes.

Defects at the system level greatly affect safety, potentially causing fires, system failures, or energy shortages.

The report from CEA indicates that 28% of the inspected BESS units exhibited defects in their fire suppression systems.

These defects included non-responding release actuators for the fire extinguishing agent, non-functional fire alarm abort buttons and non-responding smoke and temperature sensors.

15% of the inspected BESS had thermal management defects. These included circulation system component failures and compressor mainboards short-circuiting.

The Illawarra REZ Roundtable brought together energy experts, business leaders and local representatives to outline the next phase of planning for the zone, with a focus on delivering initial options by 2030, as revealed in a media release.

The initiative is being led by EnergyCo, the government agency responsible for coordinating the delivery of renewable energy zones across the state.

“The Illawarra has the potential to be NSW’s first urban renewable energy zone,” said Minister for Climate Change and Energy Penny Sharpe.

“This is a chance to leverage the community’s enthusiasm for solar, batteries and EVs to benefit the entire region, as well as pursue longer-term opportunities to support green manufacturing.”

The Roundtable coincided with the signing of a new memorandum of understanding between EnergyCo and Endeavour Energy, the local electricity distribution operator.

The agreement will support the joint development of innovative network and battery solutions within the proposed zone.

The government is considering the use of existing infrastructure and underutilised land – including rooftops and government-owned parcels – for energy storage and distribution, aiming to reduce environmental impact and community disruption.

“The Illawarra is uniquely positioned to show how renewable energy production and consumption can fit into an urban area,” said Minister for Planning and Public Spaces and Member for Wollongong Paul Scully.

“This Roundtable brings together industry pace setters and innovators in a crucial step towards delivering clean green energy that can meet the needs of both residents and local industry.”

With the growth of lithium extraction projects in the Salton Sea region, our community could become a global leader in clean energy and innovation. But if we are going to do this, we must do it right.

We are not against lithium development; we support it if done right. For too long, Imperial County has borne the brunt of poverty, unemployment, and environmental challenges. A well-managed, community-centered lithium industry could create jobs, boost infrastructure, and help address long-standing economic disparities. But these projects must need enforceable environmental protections, clear community benefits, and full transparency and accountability.

Too many of our neighbors feel like an afterthought in the decision-making process. Our voices are often missing from health concerns to basic safety planning. That has to change.

We need companies that will do more than just extract our resources, but also be committed to investing in people and communities. If lithium extraction leads to air or water contamination, or puts people at risk, there must be systems in place to hold companies accountable. That means enforceable mitigation agreements with legal teeth, not voluntary promises that are too easily broken.

Getting this right is an opportunity to set a national precedent and ensure community benefits for local communities. The outcome could help establish an efficient model for responsible lithium development that prioritizes environmental protection, community engagement, and real enforceability. If done correctly, it could show the country that clean energy doesn’t have to come at the cost of the communities closest to the work.

In Calipatria, we are especially concerned about safety. What happens if a fire or hazardous spill occurs at one of these facilities? Are our first responders trained and equipped to respond? Where is the emergency preparedness plan? We haven’t seen one.

There are also basic questions about infrastructure. Large-scale industrial development strains roads, water systems, and public services. If you build a project of this scale, you need to plan for the impact and invest in upgrades. The companies profiting from lithium extraction should bear more responsibility for these local upgrades.

Our message is simple: We support clean energy. We support jobs. We support progress. But we won’t support any of it without guarantees that our community will be protected, included, and respected.

Let this be a turning point. Let Imperial County show the rest of the nation how to balance innovation with inclusion. Lithium Valley must become a model for responsible development, not a warning sign of what happens when companies move too fast and leave communities behind.

We’re not asking for perfection. We’re asking for a seat at the table. We’re asking for standards that are real, enforceable, and fair. And we’re asking that the health, safety, and dignity of Calipatria and local Imperial Valley residents come first.

Some of the major players in the global EV market are Chinese firms, including BYD and Geely.
This is the automaker’s first dedicated EV production facility and was made with the explicit purpose of improving the stability of its US EV battery supply chain.
With the support of these projects, the potential for North America to grow as a manufacturing hub is increased.
Delays in EV production will also have an impact on the battery supply chain, easing the demand while more gigafactories come online to meet it.","According to the International Energy Agency, the market share of EVs in the US (including plug-in hybrids) jumped from 0.2% of total car sales in 2011 to 4.6% in 2021, with similar adoption rates also seen in Canada and Mexico. However, this initial increase has stagnated in recent years. Speaking at ALSC Global last year, Criss Edwards, president and managing director North America at Unipart, explained that there was only a small increase in total market share from 2023 to 2024, from 7.5% to 8%.

Despite this recent slowdown, automakers have poured millions of dollars into the EV space, encouraging innovation at every stage of the value chain. Experts at this year’s Finished Vehicle Logistics North America conference were positive about EV forecasts and the steps that North American companies had taken to reinforce EV and battery production in the face of disruption.

At the conference, Thomas Shannon, finished vehicle operations manager for ports and logistics EV at GM, said that the most important parts of an EV and any associated logistics were “batteries, batteries [and] batteries.” The question is, how might changes to EV demand in North America impact this key component?

Brakes on legislation

A major contributor in the rapid growth of EVs in the US market over the last few years has been the increased support for EV development and purchasing. The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Chips and Science Act, both sought to encourage domestic EV production while making it easier for consumers to buy into EVs. The former legislation introduced tax credits for EVs manufactured in the US while the latter provided federal support for technical R&D into semiconductors, which are crucial for EVs. A 2024 report by Sucden Financial pointed directly to these regulations as being key to the growth of the EV market – as without them, there would have been no way to “accelerate the adoption” of EVs in the US.

Facilitated by federal support for research and increased consumer buy-in to the space, the demand for batteries skyrocketed and far outweighed the supply and production capabilities. This continued on a trend seen in the wake of the Covid pandemic where core battery materials – most commonly lithium, but also cobalt and nickel – were in short supply, leading to increased prices and resource competition. Despite these supply-side challenges, automakers saw success in the hybrid and EV space, with almost 20m units being sold in the US in 2022 alone.

However, very early into his new term, President Trump announced a halt on IRA benefits. This followed an earlier statement about revoking an unspecified EV mandate.

The response to this was mixed, with some suggesting it could help address the difference between demand and supply in the domestic US market for EVs. If such a slowdown occurred, it would relieve some pressure on the battery supply chain and potentially help level out the price of battery materials. However, others feared it would see EV adoption stagnate even further, resulting in wasted investment for OEMs and exacerbating existing fiscal pressures.

The Trump administration “paint[ed] a clear expectation for US policy direction in the immediate term,” according to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility, who was commenting at the time. Her prediction was correct, as a bill recently introduced by the House of Representatives seeks to remove several of the tax credits associated with EVs. That includes the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, part of the IRA, which stipulates that businesses and tax-exempt organisations that buy a qualified commercial clean vehicle may qualify under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 45W for a clean vehicle tax credit of $7,500 for vehicles of up to 6,350kg, and $40,000 for vehicles over that weight.

Demonstrating how entrenched these tax credits were, Cox Automotive reported that the leasing rate for EVs increased from around 11% in 2022 to around 45% in 2024, which is an increase that is double the industry standard percentage. These credits being removed would disincentivise consumers even further, in turn slowing down both EV and battery demand.

The North American market does not exist in a vacuum however, and the role of foreign carmakers is not to be ignored. Some of the major players in the global EV market are Chinese firms, including BYD and Geely. Their vertical integration within the value chain has proven disruptive to the sector, as they have more agency over and resiliency in their battery supply chains compared to American counterparts. However, this disruption may not be a major factor going forward, as the previous Biden administration took steps to prohibit the sale and import of Chinese hardware and software systems. Similarly, the tariffs introduced by President Trump at the start of April further limit the flow of Chinese and other foreign battery parts into the US, which too could limit US-based EV production.

Nearshoring to strengthen battery supply

With the increased level of uncertainty, especially surrounding international cargo flows, there has been a significant rise in nearshoring as a means to reduce disruption and improve supply chain resiliency, as well as capitalise on the rising domestic market. As Kurt Kelty, vice-president of battery cell and pack at GM, puts it: “It’s a simple and pragmatic reality that development of any new technology benefits greatly from proximity to customers…[.] Today, the US has the customer base.”

Kelty’s comments represent a wider move by American OEMs to domesticate production within the EV value chain, including batteries and battery components. GM, for example, has committed to building a battery facility at its tech hub in Warren, Michigan with the goal of boosting the company’s R&D in battery tech. Similarly, last summer Ford announced plans to reshore battery production for several of its EV models, including the best-selling EV truck in the US currently, the F-150 Lightning, with the production moving from Poland to Michigan. Rivian also recently announced a $120m supplier park project attached to its EV production facility in Illinois – a move that CEO RJ Scaringe called a “key enabler” for scaling up the site’s production when the company’s R2 model launches next year.

While the price of GM’s new facility was not announced, the moves are indicative of the belief held by some American OEMs, despite any differences in scale and market share, that EVs will continue to grow and so it is worth investing the means to streamline and improve production efficiency.

Support for this idea is so strong that Kelty also stated that North America will soon become the global leader in EV battery production – an idea that has the potential to reverse the established flows of battery material and information from East to West.

This is also seen in the steps these automakers are taking to strengthen their domestic EV and battery logistics. Shannon expanded on his earlier declaration by explaining how GM had identified problems in its EV infrastructure and taken steps to fix it. For instance, deploying mobile charging stations along both rail and road routes. Fellow panellists echoed this sentiment, talking about how – even though adjustments would be required in both mentalities and infrastructure – there was invested support in ensuring EV logistics success. However, increased communication is key to this. As Charles Franklin, Glovis America’s senior national manager for business development, succinctly put it: “We’ll ship whatever you build – I just want you to be open on what your constraints are, and then I can make it happen.”

Foreign investment

It is not only American OEMs that are taking steps to localise EV and battery production in North America. Earlier this year, Toyota revealed that its first battery manufacturing plant outside Japan, located in North Carolina, was ready to begin production. The company’s press release said that the $14 billion plant is part of its ‘best-in-town’ approach, focused on “investing and producing locally, contributing to the local community and offering products tailored to local needs through a multi-pathway strategy.”

Hyundai already has opened a metaplant in the state of Georgia following a $5.54 billion joint investment from the company and its suppliers. This is the automaker’s first dedicated EV production facility and was made with the explicit purpose of improving the stability of its US EV battery supply chain. Again, this mindset and the level of investment represents a strong vote of confidence in the continued growth of the EV market in North America from OEMs. It also reinforces how the flow of batteries might change over the coming years, as the infrastructure required for the US to become a key manufacturing hub for batteries is increasingly being created from both domestic and foreign players.

While EV and battery production sites may be domesticated, there is still the risk that the supply of battery materials further upstream may be disrupted. However, recent research from the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) downplays this concern. Chang Shen, researcher at the ICCT, commented that “there’s more than 100 lithium mining and refining projects underway within the US and its trade partners”. With the support of these projects, the potential for North America to grow as a manufacturing hub is increased. Creating this direct flow of core battery components improves resiliency by reducing reliance on other markets and regions for a key part of EV production.

Another benefit to increased domestic mining and refining is that the distances covered in the supply of materials is significantly shorter which reduces the environmental impact of transporting them. Shorter distances between refinery and factory can therefore help American OEMs further decarbonise their supply chains and hit sustainability targets.

Scale backs and delays

Despite the optimism shared by some OEMs, others have raised concerns over the continued success of the EV market in the US and have responded by pulling away from battery-related investments. As Criss Edwards points out in his Red Sofa interview, EV sales have fallen short of expectations, which has resulted in some OEMs shifting gear. For example, while Ford plans to reshore its battery production, it is making several planned SUV model lines hybrid instead of purely electric and has said that its annual capital expenditure for EVs will drop from 40% to 30%.

Others have scaled back on planned EV expansions or delayed planned production lines. Stellantis, meanwhile, has pushed production of the electric version of the Dodge Challenger and the Ram 1500 Ramcharger back from 2026 to 2027. For the latter, this is the second pushback it’s had in as many years. Such moves bely increased caution surrounding EVs that is set to continue in the face of reduced governmental support and a projected slowdown in consumer demand.

Delays in EV production will also have an impact on the battery supply chain, easing the demand while more gigafactories come online to meet it. However, a renewed focus on hybrid models over pure EVs will maintain at least some investment in batteries from the more cautious OEMs.

So, what does the future hold for EV batteries in North America? The Global EV Outlook, published earlier in May by the International Energy Agency, forecast that sales of plug-in cars in the US will double to an overall automotive market share of 20% by 2030. While this may seem like solid growth, it is still far below the figure expected by many OEMs at the turn of the decade.

Such a difference may be alarming to some but there is still optimism from several leaders in the field, even if their approaches have adjusted. At this year’s FVL North America conference, Patrick Manzi, chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association, outlined several of the key problems facing the EV sector in North America, pointing to charging infrastructure and battery costs as critical roadblocks.

While the latter of these problems might be solved by nearshoring efforts, a pullback in investment might mean that the former remains a problem. In the face of all the difficulties facing the North American EV market, Manzi accurately summarised that “uncertainty is the only constant right now” but does think that “cooler heads could change that.”",https://d3n5uof8vony13.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/1/5/332815_factoryrowofevs_530051.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 13:22:24.261105

More than 50 years ago, Congress allowed California to request a “waiver” from applicable federal air regulations. Congress provided California with this tool because the state had extraordinarily poor air quality and unique challenges in controlling it. Recently, California has abused that discreet authority to set climate policy across the country.

In December 2024, the lame duck Biden Environmental Protection Agency approved California’s request to implement its Advanced Clean Cars II regulation when Democrats wouldn’t have to face voters over this politically toxic policy.

California’s ACC II waiver requires all vehicles sold in the state, Washington, D.C., and the 11 other states that have adopted California’s standard to be zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This means that in one decade, these states, totaling 30% of the nation’s new car market, will have a full ban on the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles and traditional hybrids. These unattainable standards, backed by a fine of over $26,000 per vehicle for non-compliance, would reshape auto manufacturing and take away consumer choice across the country.

The Biden EPA tried to avoid accountability from Congress by claiming its decision was not a rule and refusing to submit it to Congress under the CRA. Fortunately, Trump corrected this by identifying the waiver as a rule and submitting it to Congress.

To protect consumers and workers, as well as the Senate’s oversight authority over bad agency rules, I introduced a resolution under the CRA to reverse the EPA’s California waiver. Using this statutory process allows members of the Senate and the House, the constitutionally elected representatives of all Americans, to decide whether a nationally significant agency rule should move forward.

After the rule was submitted to Congress, Senate Democrats who wanted to protect this electric vehicle mandate requested the Government Accountability Office find that the waiver was not a rule under the CRA. Once a rule is submitted by an agency, GAO consistently refrains from issuing an opinion. Despite its own precedent, GAO “observed” in a letter that the Biden EPA action approving California’s waiver was not a rule under the CRA, despite the agency’s submittal to Congress.

Democrats got this GAO letter to obstruct the Senate from exercising its authority provided by the CRA. Nothing in the plain text of the CRA, Senate rules, or Senate precedents gives unelected staff at the GAO the authority to prevent the Senate from considering a resolution of disapproval against a rule that has been submitted to Congress.

Once an agency submits a rule to Congress, as the EPA did here, elected representatives are able to decide whether to approve or disapprove of the rule. That is how the CRA precedent has functioned since its enactment in 1996 as a statutory exception to the Senate’s normal practice of unlimited debate. This allows Congress to realize the fundamental purpose of the CRA: oversight by elected representatives over unelected agencies.

GAO FINDS TRUMP VIOLATED LAW BY WITHHOLDING CONGRESSIONALLY APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR EV CHARGING STATIONS

Democratic senators claim that our action undermines the legislative filibuster. That is simply untrue. Unlike my Democratic colleagues, I have supported the legislative filibuster as a senator in the majority and as a senator in the minority. The procedural action we have taken is not about the filibuster. Instead, the procedural action the Senate has taken is simply about whether GAO staff can violate its own precedent and have veto authority over elected officials’ ability to use the CRA against rules submitted to Congress by an agency. The answer is no.

Despite the best efforts of unelected bureaucrats in California, the Biden administration, and congressional Democrats to shield this electric vehicle mandate from the will of the people, Congress has rejected California’s attempt to impose a mandate that would have eliminated consumer choice, increased prices, and killed jobs across the country.

Partnering with industry and academia, their goal is to enable more effective and informed use of underground resources — from fossil fuels to geothermal energy to water.

Berkeley Lab’s researchers are advancing the science needed to access underground energy sources and store energy underground. They’ve made big advances in estimating lithium reserves and mapping rare earth elements, and are inventing new ways to measure earthquake risks to infrastructure and track groundwater. Read on to learn how Berkeley Lab is refining our understanding of the subsurface environment.

Geothermal Energy

Berkeley Lab geoscientists are advancing enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) — engineered reservoirs in Earth’s subsurface capable of providing access to round-the-clock energy. EGS technologies stimulate the flow of fluids through hot rocks that can be converted to electricity at the surface. Geothermal electricity-generating capacity has the potential to expand 20-fold in the United States by 2050 — enough to power up to 65 million homes.

With nearly 50 years of geothermal research behind them, geoscientists at Berkeley Lab study which geologic factors, such as depth and rock type, are most favorable for developing geothermal reservoirs. They led the U.S. Department of Energy-funded EGS Collab project, which focused on developing technologies to model and monitor rock fracturing at depths greater than two kilometers and temperatures exceeding 200°C. Now, they are testing methods to create and sustain EGS at Utah FORGE, a field-scale lab, and through other DOE-supported demonstration projects, including one exploring superhot conditions above 700°F. These can provide significantly more energy compared to geothermal reservoirs with lower temperatures.

Critical Minerals and Materials

The U.S. relies heavily on imports for critical minerals such as lithium, a key battery metal. With demand for some of these critical minerals expected to increase by up to seven times by 2030, Berkeley Lab scientists are finding new ways to tap into domestic resources and develop technologies for efficient mineral recovery. They use state-of-the-art tools to better understand how mineral systems form, evolve, and are transformed into important functional materials. Their research integrates fieldwork, laboratory experiments, and modeling to explore sources such as lithium in geothermal fluids and claystones, rare earth elements in mine tailings, and cobalt and cadmium in geological rock formations.

In a major step toward securing minerals domestically, Berkeley Lab scientists conducted the most comprehensive analysis yet of lithium reserves found in geothermal brines from Southern California’s Salton Sea. Their findings indicate the region could contain over 3,400 kilotons of lithium — enough to produce more than 375 million electric vehicle (EV) batteries, surpassing the total number of vehicles currently on U.S. roads.

AI and machine learning play a key role in characterizing and processing these critical minerals. The team is also mapping rare earth elements — like neodymium, used in high-performance magnets for energy and medical applications — from industrial waste such as coal fly ash. By combining drone-based geophysical sensing with AI, they are pinpointing neodymium hotspots at fly ash sites in Pennsylvania and developing processes to efficiently transform them into magnets.

Seismic Risk and Impact

Berkeley Lab researchers study seismic activity through real-world measurements and high-performance computing to predict major quakes and understand earthquake impacts on groundwater. Using the Perlmutter supercomputer at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), located at Berkeley Lab, they create high-frequency ground shaking simulations to identify the infrastructure within a region most at risk of a severe quake. This large database of simulated ground motions for the San Francisco Bay Area, shared with engineers via an open-access database, related to a M7 Hayward fault earthquake and is being replicated in the Los Angeles region and in a region of the Midwest that has experienced large quakes. This work is progressing in partnership with the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center at UC Berkeley and with the University of California at Los Angeles. With partners at the University of Nevada-Reno, the researchers also developed the largest U.S. facility for studying how the soil around a structure influences building performance during quakes.

Another team deployed an ultra-sensitive sensor developed at Berkeley Lab’s Geosciences Measurement Facility into a 200-meter-long borehole along the San Andreas Fault to measure natural seismicity from earthquakes. An example of what the future of earthquake data collection could look like, these instruments capture in real-time the displacement, location, and any changes in water pressure associated with faults — representing the first time that datasets can be sourced from a singular, continuous, autonomous sensor. This can give unprecedented insights into important societal and environmental implications from seismic activity, such as water-level shifts.

Energy Generation and Storage

Building on their expertise in fluid behavior in underground rock from geothermal energy research, Berkeley Lab scientists are exploring ways to ensure year-round energy access through geologic hydrogen and underground water-storage systems. With support from DOE’s ARPA-E program, they conduct research essential to stimulating the production of geologic hydrogen through chemical reactions between certain rocks and water in the subsurface, and to extracting geologic hydrogen safely. Applying knowledge gained over several decades of observing how fluids behave in Earth’s subsurface, one team is studying how to inject fluids at varying pressures, temperatures, and pH levels to control the extraction of hydrogen without inducing harmful seismicity.

Geologic hydrogen generation occurs fastest in deep and hot environments that would be costly and commercially risky to access. Berkeley Lab researchers are using quantum chemistry simulations and experiments as they investigate how to speed up hydrogen-generating reactions in cooler, shallower environments safely and affordably.

In parallel, scientists are advancing aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES), which uses naturally occurring underground water to store energy for later use to heat and cool buildings — helping reduce power grid strain during extreme temperatures. These systems use deeper aquifers that don’t impact drinking water supplies and often rely on heat pumps to deliver energy at usable temperatures.

Water Management and Reuse

Approximately 40% of the U.S. water supply comes from underground reserves, but their location, volume, and availability are often uncertain. To better understand and manage these resources, Berkeley Lab geophysicists track water movement using a mix of traditional methods, new sensors, and modeling tools. Their work helps answer key questions about groundwater recharge — such as where water goes, whether it reaches the aquifer, and how subsurface geology affects recharge. They’ve developed a way to estimate aquifer volume changes by analyzing ground deformation with satellite images and advanced modeling, creating region-specific 3D groundwater maps.

A suite of software codes developed at Berkeley Lab, called TOUGH for Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat, helps solve complex problems requiring advanced simulation of the movement of fluids and heat in Earth’s subsurface. Originally developed to trace groundwater contamination, the TOUGH codes are now widely used in research and industry for applications like geothermal energy and oil and gas production.

Berkeley Lab also leads efforts through the National Alliance for Water Innovation (NAWI) to improve desalination technologies for treating groundwater and other salty waters. Supported by the DOE and several California agencies, NAWI aims to lower the cost and energy demands of using nontraditional water sources.

Since its inception, the IRA has invested more than $90 billion in clean energy technologies and improvements for the building sector.

According to a Princeton University analysis, the bill cancels all uncommitted funding for clean energy and climate programs enacted by the IRA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021.

Since the IRA’s adoption in 2022, multiple glass industry-related companies have taken advantage of its tax incentives. The clean energy bill offers several benefits for the glass and glazing industry, including enabling a tax credit for electrochromic glass, appropriating millions to help states and localities adopt building energy codes and offering billions in grants to retrofit and upgrade building efficiency technology.

The IRA’s funding has also produced various programs targeting building decarbonization, such as the United States General Services Administration’s Green Proving Ground program. Since its inception, the IRA has invested more than $90 billion in clean energy technologies and improvements for the building sector. Nearly $50 million has already been awarded to parties working to decarbonize buildings.

According to the current version of H.R. 1, several provisions would end the Section 45Y Clean Energy Production Credit and the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit for any qualified facilities that don’t begin construction within 60 days following the bill’s enactment and that are placed in service after the end of 2028. Additional IRA provisions targeted by H.R. 1 include the following:

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program

State-Based Home Efficiency Contractor Training Grants

Clean Energy Production Tax Credits

Princeton University estimates that repealing current federal energy and climate policies would increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by around 0.5 billion metric tons annually in 2030 and more than 1 billion metric tons in 2035. A repeal would raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by $25 billion annually in 2030 and more than $50 billion in 2035. Furthermore, a repeal would increase average U.S. household energy costs by roughly $100 to $160 per household per year in 2030, and approximately $270 to $415 per year in 2035 and endanger $522 billion in pending investments in U.S. clean energy supply and manufacturing.

The move to target clean energy tax credits comes as politicians have long argued that the costs associated with the IRA’s energy and climate provisions are unnecessary, burdensome, expensive and add to the country’s deficit.

But with advances in technology such as generative artificial intelligence driving up energy usage across the country, Illinois lawmakers from both parties, as well as environmental advocates, say the state’s energy policy has fallen behind.

In the final days of the spring session, lawmakers are working on a legislative package aimed at addressing the state’s growing energy needs and rising costs without derailing the ambitious goals championed by Gov. JB Pritzker to make the state carbon-free by midcentury.

“What we’re trying to do is find ways to ensure those capacity spikes don’t continue for years into the future, and there’s really only two ways of doing that, and that’s by either decreasing demand for electricity or increasing supply,” said state Sen. Bill Cunningham, a Chicago Democrat who’s leading energy legislation efforts in the Senate. “I think that’s really the underlying impetus for energy bills this session.”

Due to supply cost increases, the average bill for a residential Commonwealth Edison customer is expected to increase this summer by $10.60 per month. The typical Ameren customer’s monthly bill is expected to increase by approximately 18% to 22%, depending on their usage.

Cunningham said while lawmakers don’t have control over the expected increased electricity charges going into effect this June, they can work to mitigate future spikes.

The state’s past energy legislation, such as the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims for 40% renewable energy by 2030, did not account for the dramatic rise in energy usage from data centers and other large energy developers, Cunningham said.

There are several business developments, such as data centers, being planned in Illinois that could bring a total of 30 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of 3 billion light bulbs, to the grid starting in 2029, according to Anna Markowski, Midwest director of Place-Based Advocacy on Climate and Energy for the Natural Resources Defense Council. That’s more than double the grid’s current maximum capacity, Markowski said.

A study by the Illinois Commerce Commission released early May estimated that the state could lose approximately $12 billion in direct development investments, along with $60 billion in hardware and systems investments, for every gigawatt of power that can’t be provided.

“The markets are screaming at us, saying build more generation,” said Mark Denzler, president and CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “Everyone’s bidding for a limited amount of power.”

Lawmakers sent a 600-page draft of energy legislation to stakeholders in early May, less than two weeks before the end of session. The measure’s proposals range from expanding nuclear energy to increasing large-scale energy storage in batteries.

One proposal would require new data centers and other large energy users building in Illinois to bring their own renewable energy to the grid, or pay a higher fee into the state budget that would fund other renewable projects. The measure is backed by environmental interests and others who say the companies building large data centers and other businesses that sap energy resources should pay more, instead of having the burden fall on homeowners and small-business users.

“Once those big loads start to come on the grid, we’re going to start to see instability,” Markowski said. “We’re going to start to see costs transferred onto every household, and so what we’re trying to do within the bill is protect against that by making them bring new energy. You can’t just cannibalize whatever we have here.”

Illinois electrical consumers, from residential consumers to commercial data centers, are already required to pay a fee to the state’s renewable portfolio standards, which fund the part of the state budget used to award grants to renewable energy developers.

But the fee for new data centers and other large energy users would be three times larger under the latest proposal.

Denzler warned the higher fee could have an adverse impact on economic development in the state.

“I mean your costs right there are going to be astronomical for a large user, and they’re just going to go to Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and other states,” Denzler said.

Another proposal that’s received increased support this year is a plan that could expand nuclear power by lifting a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants, an idea organized labor and manufacturers have historically backed while environmental groups have opposed.

Gov. Pritzker has indicated support for the idea of allowing flexibility on new nuclear plants, a shift from his previous position against large-scale nuclear plants. He vetoed a bill to lift the state’s decade-old moratorium on new nuclear plants in 2023.

“We’re looking forward to having a bill that comes to my desk that will allow us to expand the options for nuclear in the state of Illinois,” Pritzker said in mid-April. “But it has to be done in the right way, and I think the legislature and my team are working together to make sure that that happens.”

The legislative draft also would create an ambitious new goal for large-scale energy storage through large batteries that would absorb excess wind and solar power for later use, along with goals to deliver clean, low-cost energy, while also promoting several efficiency measures supporting virtual power plants.

Cunningham said that if the larger legislative package does not come together, proposals within the measure could still be pushed as individual bills.

“We’ll see if it bears fruit,” Cunningham said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/CTC-L-Illinois-Capitol24_228578818.jpg?w=1024&h=678,N,,2025-05-27 13:23:54.122590

What’s being done to get more minorities into green jobs?

Sam W., via email

Green jobs—those that directly contribute to a sustainable environment—have been growing in need as the world has become more eco-focused. According to the Solar Energies Industries Association (SEIA), between 2014 and 2019 employment in the solar energy sector increased five times faster than job growth in the general U.S. economy.

Despite this, there is still more to be done to improve workforce diversity. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported that 69 percent of the wind energy work force is white, and SEIA found that its workforce is 73 percent white. There is a clear lack of diversity in the green jobs workforce, often due to an underrepresentation of minorities trained in leadership roles, wage gaps unequal hiring practices. Lucky, there are a few ways green companies can address this problem.

The first solution to this problem is advancing access to training and degrees required for green jobs. Engineering jobs require bachelor’s degrees, but in 2022 only a quarter of engineering bachelor’s degrees were earned by women, and in 2018 only 4.6 percent were earned by Black people. “Despite the efforts of many ... within the formal educational system, education for a just and sustainable world is not a high priority,” explains Anthony D. Cortese in his report The Critical Role of Higher Education in Creating a Sustainable Future. In order to create a more diverse workforce, companies should offer financial aid for higher education and create real-life, research experiences designated for women and people of color.

Jobs that do not require degrees, such as repair, maintenance and construction, are covered by unions, though while unions generally protect workers’ rights and improve working conditions, they have a history of being exclusionary. “I understand that in the United States the same corporations that have been destroying the planet have collaborated to make it so that most American workers no longer have good, unionized jobs,” says Jane McAlevey, author and senior policy fellow at the University of California Berkeley’s Labor Center. Unions can implement new programs and policies, such as mentorship programs, to increase minority representation and improve worker skills. Another strategy is to create programs specifically for women and people of color that provide career development and financial support for transportation, uniforms or food.

Interested in taking action? Support companies that have inclusive hiring practices and educate your community about the need for diversity in the green job workforce.

Please email or call your legislators and ask them to support S.2237, sponsored by Sen. Comerford of Northampton, which takes nuclear and pumped storage out of the definition of “clean” energy. Tell them to oppose the governor’s plans to reintroduce nuclear power to the state and to bypass the requirement of a statewide vote.

Thank you to Ms. Darling and Senator Comerford and everyone working for a safe and green future for us all!

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is experiencing a significant sales decline across key markets, particularly in Europe, where monthly sales plunged by nearly half in April 2025. Despite these concerning trends, Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on the electric vehicle maker’s long-term prospects, with some firms raising price targets to street-high levels based on Tesla’s artificial intelligence and autonomous driving ambitions.

Tesla Sales Plunge in the European Market

Tesla’s European operations are experiencing a severe downturn, with sales across 32 European countries tumbling 49% to just 7,261 vehicles in April 2025, down from 14,228 in the same month the previous year. This dramatic decline comes as the broader electric vehicle market in Europe actually grew by approximately 28%, highlighting Tesla’s specific challenges.

The sales collapse extends beyond a single month, with Tesla’s European sales falling roughly 39% to 61,320 vehicles for the first four months of 2025, while the continent’s overall auto market showed little change during the same period.

The decline is attributed to multiple factors, including protests and boycotts over Elon Musk’s political involvement, an aging model lineup, and intensifying competition from Chinese EV brands like SAIC, which saw sales rise 54% in April.

Additionally, Tesla faced operational challenges with factory shutdowns for several weeks while upgrading its best-selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, which constrained supply. The company’s struggles are further compounded by US President Donald Trump’s trade war, which has reportedly turned Europeans away from American brands, with Trump threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods before agreeing to delay duties until July.

Analyst Remain Upbeat on Tesla’s Long-Term Ambitions as an AI Company

Despite the sales challenges, Wall Street analysts remain remarkably optimistic about Tesla’s future prospects.

Wedbush Securities has issued the most bullish call, raising Tesla’s price target to a street-high $500 from $350, implying approximately 47% upside potential. Analyst Daniel Ives positions Tesla as “one of the best pure plays on AI for the next decade,” emphasizing the company’s artificial intelligence and full self-driving (FSD) ambitions as key value drivers.

Cantor Fitzgerald has also maintained its $355 price target with an Overweight rating, highlighting Tesla’s ambitious plans to deploy fully autonomous robotaxis starting with a modest fleet in Austin by the end of June 2025. The initial phase will involve Model Y vehicles equipped with unsupervised Full Self-Driving technology, with expectations to scale up and expand into other cities by year-end.

Key catalysts identified by analysts include the rollout of FSD in China (which began in Q1 2025), expected deployment in Europe during the first half of 2025 pending regulatory approval, and high-volume production of the Optimus Bot slated for 2026 with initial customer deliveries projected for 2027. Wedbush’s Ives forecasts that Tesla’s autonomy and robotaxi service could unlock approximately $1 trillion in AI-related valuation, potentially propelling the company’s market capitalization to $2 trillion by late 2026.

Divergence Between Tesla’s Short-Term Performance and Long-Term Potential

The contrast between Tesla’s current operational challenges and analyst expectations creates a fascinating market dynamic. While Tesla’s FSD technology has accumulated over 3.5 billion miles with supervision as of Q1 2025, the company faces immediate headwinds from macroeconomic conditions, tariffs, and the anticipated removal of EV tax credits.

Analysts acknowledge these near-term challenges but remain focused on Tesla’s technological transformation. The company’s strong financial position, with a current ratio of 2.0 and more cash than debt on its balance sheet, provides resilience against current headwinds. Tesla also plans to introduce a lower-priced vehicle in the first half of 2025, starting around $30,000 including tax credits, which could align well with market conditions.

Elon Musk’s confirmed commitment to Tesla for the coming years, even as he prepares to conclude his role at DOGE, has provided additional reassurance to analysts. The company is expected to update its 2025 automotive growth targets and energy storage outlook next quarter, aiming for over 50% year-over-year growth following more than 100% increase in FY24.

Tesla Stock Gains on Early Tuesday Trading

As of May 27, 2025, at 10:31 AM EDT, Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) was trading at $357.42, up $18.08 (+5.33%) with the market open. The stock has shown significant volatility, with a 52-week range of $167.41 to $488.54, and currently trades near the higher end of this range with a market capitalization of $1.151 trillion.

Tesla’s valuation metrics reflect its premium positioning, with a trailing P/E ratio of 193.91 and forward P/E of 158.73. The company maintains strong financial health with $37 billion in total cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 17.41%. Despite the recent sales challenges, Tesla generated $95.72 billion in trailing twelve-month revenue with a profit margin of 6.38%.

The analyst community shows mixed sentiment with price targets ranging from a low of $115.00 to Wedbush’s high of $500.00, with an average target of $299.38.

This wide range reflects the significant uncertainty around Tesla’s transition from a traditional automaker to an AI and robotics company, with current trading levels suggesting the market is pricing in substantial future growth from autonomous driving and energy storage initiatives.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump signed executive orders Friday intended to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, a goal experts say the United States is highly unlikely to reach.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The order comes as demand for electricity surges amid a boom in energy-hungry data centers and artificial intelligence. Tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others are competing for electricity and straining the nation’s electric grid.

“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50” years in the industry.

Still, it’s unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two reactors, at a nuclear plant in Georgia, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

The nation’s 94 nuclear reactors supply about 19% of U.S. electricity, compared to about 60% for fossil fuels and 21% for renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Trump is enthusiastic

At the Oval Office signing, Trump, surrounded by industry executives, called nuclear a “hot industry,” adding, “It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”

Burgum and other speakers said the industry has stagnated and has been choked by overregulation.

“Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry,” said Burgum, who chairs Trump’s newly formed Energy Dominance Council.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 — 13 months from now — and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

The NRC is assessing the executive orders and will comply with White House directives, spokesperson Scott Burnell said Friday.

Jacob DeWitte, chief executive officer of the nuclear energy company Oklo, brought a golf ball to the Oval Office. He told Trump that’s the amount of uranium that can power someone’s needs for their entire life.

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” he said, holding up the ball.

“Very exciting indeed,” Trump said.

Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal that warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. Nuclear reactors generate electricity without emitting greenhouse gases.

Trump said reactors are safe and clean, but did not mention climate benefits. Safety advocates warn that nuclear technology still comes with significant risks that other low-carbon energy sources don’t, including the danger of accidents or targeted attacks, and the unresolved question of how to store tens of thousands of tons of hazardous nuclear waste.

The order to reorganize the NRC will include significant staff reductions but is not intended to fire NRC commissioners who lead the agency. David Wright, a former South Carolina elected official and utility commissioner, chairs the five-member panel. His term ends June 30, and it is unclear if he will be reappointed.

Critics have trepidations

Critics say the White House moves could compromise safety and violate legal frameworks such as the Atomic Energy Act. Compromising the independence of the NRC or encouraging it to be circumvented could weaken the agency and make regulation less effective, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Simply put, the U.S. nuclear industry will fail if safety is not made a priority,” he said.

Gregory Jaczko, who led the NRC under President Barack Obama, said Trump’s executive orders look like someone asked an AI chatbot, “How do we make the nuclear industry worse in this country?”

He called the orders a “guillotine to the nation’s nuclear safety system” that will make the country less safe, the industry less reliable and the climate crisis more severe.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity and supply it carbon-free. Last year, Congress passed legislation that President Joe Biden signed to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors.

Valar Atomics is a nuclear reactor developer in California. Founder and CEO Isaiah Taylor said nuclear development and innovation in the United States has been slowed by too much red tape, while Russia and China are speeding ahead. He said he’s most excited about the mandate for the Energy Department to speed up the pace of innovation.

The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. Currently, the NRC expects its reviews to take three years or less.

As electric vehicle juggernaut Tesla urges longtime battery partner Panasonic to accelerate production in the US, Korean are poised to take the spotlight as key material suppliers — leveraging their cost competitiveness and reduced reliance on the Chinese supply chain.

According to The Financial Times, Tesla has recently pushed Panasonic to fast-track the two companies’ joint battery cell manufacturing plant, which has been under construction since 2022. The $4 billion project, initially scheduled to begin operations by March this year, has been rescheduled for as early as July due to unexpected setbacks, including cost increases. The plant’s annual capacity is projected at 30 gigawatt-hours — enough to power approximately 300,000 vehicles — and is expected to increase Tesla’s US production capacity by 60 percent by March 2027.

“As we’ve been told by our customer to get Kansas moving quickly, we’re hurrying to do so … There are risks, but we are planning on robust demand for batteries from our main customer as of now,” said Panasonic CEO Yuki Kusumi in an interview with Tokyo-based media, as quoted by the Financial Times.

Korean suppliers rise as EV battery formulas evolve

Even if Panasonic begins operations at its Kansas plant this year, concerns remain over a potential production gap in new battery materials, stemming from Tesla’s cost-cutting strategy amid slowing EV demand, according to sources.

Reportedly, one of Panasonic’s main material suppliers, Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical, has announced plans to shift its cathode material chemistry from nickel, cobalt and aluminum (NCA) to nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) starting next year, citing customer demand.

“There’s a reason why Korean battery makers have preferred NCM over NCA. Manganese is significantly cheaper than aluminum — almost incomparable,” said Yang Min-ho, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University. “From a research perspective, it has also shown better structural stability in tri-component lithium-ion batteries. Although NCA initially outperformed NCM, companies have since improved capacity by increasing nickel content.”

While Korea’s LG Chem and L&F Co. are known to supply NCA cathode materials for Tesla through Panasonic, their deeper focus on NCM gives them a competitive edge over Sumitomo Chemical.

“We believe our company’s diversified product portfolio — ranging from NCM and nickel cobalt manganese aluminum (NCMA) to NCA — could appeal to Panasonic,” said an industry source who requested anonymity.

Industry insiders also point out that Korean firms may benefit from distancing themselves from the Chinese graphite supply chain. Despite pushback from Tesla and Panasonic, the US Commerce Department on May 20 issued a preliminary ruling to impose tariffs of up to 720 percent on certain Chinese graphite imports, citing unfair government subsidies.

In response, Posco Future M last month announced a 396.1 billion won ($289 million) investment in spherical graphite production — a key precursor for anodes — to reduce its reliance on Chinese raw materials.

Legacy carmakers chip away at Tesla’s lead

Tesla, still the leading EV maker in the US, is under pressure as it gradually loses market dominance — a position it established with the launch of its Model S sedan in 2012.

According to Cox Automotive, Tesla’s US market share fell from 55 percent in 2023 to 48.7 percent in 2024 — the first time it has dropped below 50 percent. Sales declined about 6 percent year-on-year to 633,762 units.

Meanwhile, legacy automakers such as General Motors, Ford and Hyundai Motor Group are expanding their presence in the US EV market. Hyundai Motor and Kia collectively sold 123,000 battery electric vehicles in the US in 2024, securing a 10 percent market share, according to data from the Korea Automobile & Mobility Association.

Tesla is racing to expand its US battery production to capitalize on subsidies and tax credits offered under the Inflation Reduction Act while the window remains open.

Last Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill moving up the expiration date for the $7,500 consumer EV subsidy by six years to Dec. 31, 2026. It also shortened the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit period by one year, now set to end in 2031. These changes increase the urgency for companies to localize their manufacturing and supply chains within the US clean energy sector.

As noted above, it was another remarkably quiet week in the pages of the Federal Register. The only rulemakings with measurable effects were a handful of airworthiness directives, with the most significant being one focused on certain Airbus aircraft that could involve roughly $29 million in costs.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

In terms of announcements with substantive regulatory policy implications coming from the White House, it was a generally quiet week – until Friday afternoon, at least. As the country headed into the holiday weekend, President Trump issued a quartet of executive orders (EO) focused on bolstering and expediting the development of nuclear energy resources. Perhaps the most significant of the four from a regulatory perspective is the EO on “Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC].”

Beyond broad-based directives to reform the Commission’s “culture” and “structure” (see Sections 3 and 4, respectively), the EO also tasks NRC with proposing within the next nine months – and finalizing within 18 months – a series of rulemakings aimed at making various changes to its licensing and approval processes. Among the most notable of these policy prescriptions is the putative establishment of “a deadline of no more than 18 months for final decision on an application to construct and operate a new reactor of any type.” The EO represents yet another bold assertion of executive branch prerogative over an “independent agency,” which will likely invite some degree of controversy over the eventual rulemakings in question. Nevertheless, many of the policy points included therein are directionally in line with other recent reform efforts related to nuclear energy.

Not to be outdone, however, there were also some important decisions made by the judicial and legislative branches this past week. Regarding the former, the Supreme Court handed down an emergency ruling in Trump v. Wilcox that allowed the president’s removal of certain members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board to remain operative for now. While the ruling in and of itself is a procedural and temporary decision, it suggests that a majority exists on the Supreme Court that, building off of the Selia v. CFPB decision, is willing to overturn the precedent set in Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S. that protected “independent agency” officials from presidential dismissal for reasons other than “for-cause” transgressions. As the Trump Administration continues to press on the actual independence of independent agencies, it is likely only a matter of time before the Court makes a substantive change on this precedent.

Across the street from the Supreme Court in the Capitol, the Senate finally took up consideration of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval that would repeal series of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waiver determinations under the Clean Air Act that had allowed California to move forward with its own, more stringent, state-level emissions standards for vehicles. As the American Action Forum (AAF) has previously noted, the determinations in question represented – in more ways than one – fairly unique actions in relation to the CRA.

The proceedings that ensued to pass these resolutions were – to put it mildly – also quite unique. While the general expectation heading into this week was that Senate Republicans would need to stage a direct challenge to the ruling of the Senate parliamentarian on the resolutions’ statuses under the CRA, the actual course of action took a somewhat different route. The primary issue hinged on the seemingly mundane status of “points of order” raised during the consideration of CRA resolutions in the Senate.

As part of the “expedited consideration” process afforded by the CRA to the Senate, “points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived” to avoid their usage as a delaying tactic. During consideration of an otherwise unrelated CRA resolution, Majority Leader Thune challenged this presumption by asserting – in a point of order – that “sections 802(d)(1), 802(d)(2), and 802(d)(4) [of the CRA] are in conflict with one another.” After a series of votes that likely only excites extreme parliamentary procedure enthusiasts, the Senate ultimately affirmed that: A) points of order are in order under the CRA, and B) in regard to a particular point of order on the matter:

Joint Resolutions that meet all the requirements of Section 802 of the Congressional Review Act or are disapproving of agency actions which have been determined to be rules subject to the Congressional Review Act by a legal decision from the Government Accountability Office, be entitled to expedited procedures under the [CRA].

With this framework established, the upper chamber took up and advanced (by respective votes of 51-45, 51-44, and 49-46) the trio of CRA resolutions on the EPA waiver determinations that now head to President Trump’s desk for his expected signature.

Be sure to follow the AAF CRA tracker. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 44 Biden-era rules that collectively involve $137.5 billion in compliance costs. Given the passage of the look-back window discussed above, it is highly unlikely any more resolutions of disapproval will be introduced this term. Since there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively, however, AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

ifas.ufl.edu | @UF_IFAS — University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS)","GAINESVILLE, Fla — A new University of Florida study shows how drones can do more than just take aerial pictures and videos—they can help farmers grow better hemp by seeing the health of their crops with some artificial intelligence assistance.

Researchers at the UF Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) in Homestead used drone-based imaging to help determine how much nitrogen fertilizer hemp plants need for optimal growth and flower production.

Their findings could help growers optimize fertilizer use to save money and preserve the environment.

“Farmers are looking for ways to assess their crops throughout the year to make informed fertilizer decisions,” said Zack Brym, associate professor of agronomy at UF/IFAS TREC.

“We’ve shown that farmers with access to aerial images using red and near infrared (NIR) detection can spot differences in plant health by their color when scanning their fields,” he said.

This is crucial because timely and precise fertilizer applications can significantly impact hemp crop yield and quality, Brym said.

“Since nutrients move through the soil so fast in Florida, farmers are applying fertilizer multiple times each year. Technology like the use of drone imaging will help determine how much fertilizer might be needed mid-season, promoting more efficient use of resources and supporting sustainable farming practices,” he said.

Hemp, a plant reintroduced in 2019 for cultivation research in Florida agriculture, provides an alternate opportunity for farmers due to the potential demand for hemp products across various industries. Low-input systems for fiber production may also offer benefits to soil health and carbon sequestration.

One of the biggest challenges is figuring out how much nitrogen—an essential plant nutrient—is needed for optimal crop growth and yield. Too little, and the plant suffers with chlorosis or yellowing of the foliage, stunted crop growth and reduced yield. Too much, and the plant may grow too much leafy material with little benefit to the valuable flower production, while excess nitrogen can leach into the environment.

Brym and his team set out to study this problem using aerial imaging. They grew a popular floral hemp variety called ‘Wife’ over three years and applied six nitrogen fertilizer rates, from none to very high. Using drones equipped with multispectral cameras, they flew over the fields one month before harvest to capture images of the crop from above. These images measured how green and healthy the plants were, indicating how well they grew under different nitrogen rates.

The study found that using a moderate amount of nitrogen — 112 to 168 kilograms per hectare or about 100 to 150 pounds per acre — resulted in the healthiest plants and greatest flower yields. Drone images picked up clear differences in plant size and color, which matched the actual amount of plant material harvested. The drone images provided real-time, accurate insights into the plant conditions on the ground.

As a final step to the research, scientists incorporated artificial intelligence (AI) technology to process the images captured by the drone flights of the canopy’s reflectance. Reflectance refers to the measure of the proportion of light or other radiation that is reflected off the surface of the hemp canopy. Reflectance is critical in remote sensing and agriculture studies, allowing researchers to analyze how much light is being reflected by the plants, which helps identify and map the canopy areas accurately.

“I was eager to see how effective the automated AI would be at identifying hemp canopy,” said Tamara Serrano, a lead author and former agroecology graduate student on Brym’s team. “To my surprise, the process wasn’t as seamless as expected and required manual corrections to address errors in canopy identification.”

This research is especially important in Florida, where fast-growing crops and shallow soils mean nutrients like nitrogen can easily be lost to runoff. Using drones for in-season monitoring could help growers fine-tune fertilizer use, reduce waste and improve profits, all while practicing environmental stewardship. With the hemp industry still evolving, these insights offer a valuable step forward.

“Despite the challenges they faced with AI technology, weed intensity and weather, the data consistently demonstrated a strong positive correlation between canopy size and aboveground biomass across years,” said Serrano. “This shows that drone-based aerial imaging can effectively monitor crop growth and health in field-grown flower hemp and inform nutrient management decisions for growers.”

A new nuclear power plant, however, came online 2023.
As of last year the U.S. had 94 operating nuclear reactors at 54 power plants, giving the nation the largest commercial nuclear power production fleet in the world, according to an EIA report April 24, 2025.
Fusion Technology The federal government has already been promoting fusion research and development to move nuclear energy utilization beyond fission.
According to the DOE’s “Fusion Energy Strategy” released June 2024, the U.S. should have pilot fusion plants before 2040.","President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to grow nuclear power generation and advance nuclear innovation in the United States.

“After decades of stagnation and shuttered reactors, President Trump is providing a path forward for nuclear innovation”, the Department of Energy (DOE) said in an online statement. “Today’s executive orders allow for reactor design testing at the Department of Energy's National Labs, clear the way for construction on federal lands to protect national and economic security, and remove regulatory barriers by requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue timely licensing decisions”.

Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, commented, “Over the last 30 years, we stopped building nuclear reactors in America - that ends now”.

A new nuclear power plant, however, came online 2023. The newest unit of Plant Vogtle, first put into service in the 1980s, is the first nuclear reactor activated in the country since 2016, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Georgia Power activated another reactor at the plant last year, making it the biggest nuclear plant in the U.S., according to the EIA.

As of last year the U.S. had 94 operating nuclear reactors at 54 power plants, giving the nation the largest commercial nuclear power production fleet in the world, according to an EIA report April 24, 2025. These units had a combined capacity of nearly 97 gigawatts. Most of these were built between 1970 and 1990, according to the EIA.

“The two reactors at Vogtle and one reactor at Watts Bar in Tennessee are the only new nuclear reactors to come online in the United States since 1996”, the EIA report said, adding 12 nuclear reactors have permanently closed in the U.S. since 2013.

Kratsios added, “Today’s executive orders are the most significant nuclear regulatory reform actions taken in decades. We are restoring a strong American nuclear industrial base, rebuilding a secure and sovereign domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and leading the world towards a future fueled by American nuclear energy”.

“These actions are critical to American energy independence and continued dominance in AI and other emerging technologies”, Kratsios said.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said, “As energy demand continues to surge, expanding our existing nuclear fleet and investing in advanced nuclear technologies ensures we have reliable energy to power our homes, fuel for President Trump’s manufacturing revolution, and a stronger electric grid”.

Concurrently the DOE announced another executive order to “rebuild public trust in the national science enterprise”.

“The EO defines Gold Standard Science and requires federal research agencies to conform their existing programs and activities to these fundamentals”, the DOE said.

“Gold Standard Science is just that - science that meets the Gold Standard”, the agency added. “It’s reproducible, transparent, falsifiable, subject to unbiased peer review, clear about errors and uncertainties, skeptical of assumptions, collaborative, interdisciplinary, accepting of negative results, and free from conflicts of interests”.

Fusion Technology

The federal government has already been promoting fusion research and development to move nuclear energy utilization beyond fission. It has also partnered with Japan and the United Kingdom to advance commercial fusion, as well as the European Union to curb global reliance on Russia in the nuclear supply chain. The U.S. has also signed agreements with foreign countries for civil nuclear cooperation that would promote American technology, including with Lithuania, the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea.

On January 16 the DOE announced the first selections for funding under the Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaboratives, a program to close knowledge and technology gaps in the design and building of a commercially scalable pilot fusion plant.

Provisionally awarded a total of $107 million, the six selected projects involve building nuclear blanket testing capabilities at the Idaho National Laboratory, developing materials at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, testing materials and developing advanced simulation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developing target injector technology for inertial fusion energy concepts, and developing fusion fuel-cycle testing capabilities at the Savannah River National Laboratory.

The collaboratives program “represents a significant step forward in FES’s commitment to advancing fusion energy research and development, and aims to create new economic opportunities, maintain US leadership in fusion, bolster US-based manufacturing and supply chains, and enable the development of technologies crucial for national security, energy security, and defense”, the DOE said then, referring to its Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program.

Concurrently the DOE announced that several privately funded fusion companies that were among those awarded a total of $46 million in May 2023 had completed early critical-path milestones under the Milestone Program.

According to the DOE’s “Fusion Energy Strategy” released June 2024, the U.S. should have pilot fusion plants before 2040. In the 2040s, commercial deployment should already be underway, as envisioned by the strategy.

The policy objectives include accelerating electric vehicle (EV) penetration across all vehicle segments, promoting circular economy through battery recycling, transitioning public transport to electric modes, and reducing vehicular emissions. The policy targets include 30 per cent EV penetration across all new vehicles, 40 per cent for e-buses in top six urban areas, and 50 per cent fleet electrification for aggregators and city utility vehicles. The policy also mandates EV charging facilities every 25 km on highways and at least one charging point in every government office parking complex. It aims to cut approximately 325 tonnes of vehicular particulate matter 2.5 emissions and 1 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2030.

The policy outlines demand-side incentives such as subsidies ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 2 million per vehicle across 10 EV categories, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, e-buses, tractors, goods carriers, and harvesters. Additionally, all EVs registered in the state during the policy period will receive 100 per cent exemption from motor vehicle tax and registration renewal fees. Furthermore, 100 per cent toll tax exemptions will apply for passenger EVs on select expressways, including Mumbai–Pune, Mumbai–Nagpur and Atal Setu. Charging infrastructure measures include mandatory fast-charging stations at fuel pumps and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation stations, viability gap funding support for DC charging stations up to Rs 1 million per unit, and one EV charging point per government office complex. New residential buildings must ensure all parking spaces are EV-ready, while commercial buildings must allocate 50 per cent of parking for EV readiness. Existing commercial buildings will need at least 20 per cent of parking spaces equipped with charging stations.

On the supply side, the policy extends ‘D+’ category mega project benefits to all EV and battery manufacturing units in Maharashtra, including medium, small and micro enterprises, irrespective of their location in the state. It also supports development of battery recycling hubs and designation of drop-off points by urban local bodies. Additionally, the policy will establish three centres of excellence for research and development (R&D) in EVs and hydrogen technologies, and allocate Rs 150 million under the Chief Minister’s EV R&D grant. Research will prioritise sodium-ion batteries, power electronics, bi-directional charging, vehicle-to-grid integration, and green hydrogen from biomass.

It continues: “The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act [IRA] during former president Joe Biden’s term. Biden’s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law’s incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.” The newswire adds that “at least four” Senate Republicans “have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources”. Reuters says the bill would “effectively halt…[the] US clean-energy boom”, but notes that it would “preserve” tax credits for nuclear energy. The Financial Times describes the bill as “Donald Trump’s showpiece” and says that clean-energy tax credits had been among the key sticking points before House Republicans agreed to back the draft legislation. The New York Times says: “The legislation would slash taxes, providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement, while cutting health, nutrition, education and clean energy programs to cover part of the cost. To win votes for passage, Republican leaders accelerated the implementation of work requirements in the Medicaid program and the repeal of clean energy tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, among other changes.” The newspaper explains that the bill would “quickly end most of the big tax credits for clean energy contained in the Inflation Reduction Act”. The New York Times Climate Forward newsletter says the bill, if passed, “would derail Biden’s signature climate law”. The Los Angeles Times describes the clean-energy rollbacks in the bill as “massive”. For the Hill, the cuts are “sweeping”. NBC News runs down the bill’s contents, saying it “terminates several hundred billion dollars” in clean-energy tax breaks for consumers, including for electric vehicles, as well as for developers in clean power, fuels and hydrogen. The Washington Post says these cuts only “partially offset” lost tax revenue under the bill.

The New York Times says the “divides that plagued the measure in the House are likely to resurface”, adding: “More moderate and politically vulnerable lawmakers have sought to protect Medicaid and fought to preserve clean-energy tax credits.” Bloomberg says the clean-energy tax credit cuts “won’t fly”, citing “key Republican senators”. The Los Angeles Times also says the bill is “facing an uncertain future among Senate Republicans”. Another New York Times story says “some Republican senators are leery of the House push to phase out tax credits for big energy projects in their states”.

Stocks in clean energy firms “tumble[d]” after the bill passed on Thursday, the Financial Times reports, adding that the cuts to tax credits had been “more aggressive than expected”. CNBC, the Wall Street Journal and Reuters all report on falling clean energy stocks in the wake of the bill’s passage. The Guardian reports on analysis saying that the bill would “cost 830,000 jobs and drive up bills and pollution emissions”. Politico asks if the bill would “hurt [Trump’s] energy agenda”. The Financial Times reports the comments of John Podesta, one of the “architects” of the IRA, saying that the bill “hand[s] a victory” to China by cutting clean-energy tax credits. Another Politico piece is titled: “In Trump’s war on clean energy, China (and everyone else) wins.” The Financial Times Energy Source newsletter reports the comments of Democratic senator Joe Manchin calling for Republicans to “kick the living daylights” out of aspects of the IRA that he does not support.

The US Senate on Thursday voted to block California’s “landmark plan to end the sale of petrol-only vehicles by 2035”, Reuters reports. The newswire continues: “The vote is a win for General Motors, Toyota and other automakers that heavily lobbied against the rules and a blow to California and environmental groups that say the requirements are essential to ensuring cleaner vehicles and cutting pollution.” The Financial Times explains that “the upper chamber of Congress passed the measure on Thursday in a 51-44 vote, sending the bill to president Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it”. It adds: “The resolution revokes a waiver that former president Joe Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency gave to California to let the state implement extremely strict emissions standards and require all new vehicle sales be electric by 2035.” The New York Times calls the vote “a victory for the oil and gas industry and for Republicans who muscled through the vote by deploying an unusual legislative tactic that Democrats denounced as a ‘nuclear’ option that would affect the way the Senate operates way beyond climate policy”. The Hill reports that the “controversial” move allows lawmakers to “sidestep the parliamentarian in the process”. The Associated Press says Trump is also expected to sign “two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks”. Politico reports: “Attorney general Rob Bonta said on Thursday that California will sue the Trump administration to protect its ability to set its own vehicle emissions rules.” The Wall Street Journal says the move is “effectively killing the country’s biggest driver of EV investment”. BBC News and the Los Angeles Times also have the news.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a plan to remove limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants, the New York Times reports, citing internal agency documents. The newspaper continues: “In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that CO2 and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ‘do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution’ or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said…The EPA sent the draft to the White House for review on 2 May. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.” The newspaper calls the proposed regulation “part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment”. Reuters, the Washington Post and Bloomberg also cover the news.

In other US news, the Guardian reports that “this year’s summer months promise to be among the hottest on record across the US”. Elsewhere, the Associated Press says: “Environmentalists are challenging in court president Donald Trump’s executive order that they say strips core protections from the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument and opens the area to harmful commercial fishing.”

“The European Commission will announce next week that the EU is broadly within target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels,” the Financial Times reports. Emissions are set to fall to 54% below 1990 levels by 2030, the newspaper says, citing EU officials familiar with the figures. It continues: “The data will be published weeks before the commission lays out how the bloc can reach its 2040 climate target, which should amount to a 90% emissions reduction. The EU has committed to reach net-zero by 2050 – one of the most ambitious targets in the world.” It adds: “Countries such as Italy and Poland have pushed for a lower target, while France has also expressed scepticism. Germany’s new coalition government has said it could support a 90% target if carbon credits could count towards the goal.” Euractiv says: “Germany’s new centrist coalition has aligned on an emissions reduction policy shaped by talks with the EU’s top climate official – signalling the likely form of a forthcoming EU proposal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, according to sources involved in the recent discussions in Berlin.”

Separately, citing internal documents, Reuters reports: “The European Union is facing further pressure from member countries to delay and weaken its upcoming law to restrict deforestation, with 11 governments demanding changes.” The newswire continues: “The world-first policy aims to end the 10% of global deforestation fuelled by EU consumption of imported soy, beef, palm oil and other products, but has become a politically contested part of Europe’s green agenda.” Euractiv reports that under the regulation, all 27 EU countries have “ dodged the ‘high risk’ label”. It adds: “The category determines how strict due diligence rules will be for companies – which also means more checks – on those importing crucial agri-food commodities like cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil and beef.” According to the outlet, the low-risk category includes countries such as the United States, China, Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, Belarus, Myanmar, North Korea and Russia are “high risk”.

In other EU news, Reuters reports that “Italy fully supports EU efforts to stop Russian gas imports into the bloc by 2027”. The newswire continues: “The EU said this month it would propose legal measures to phase out imports of Russian gas and LNG by the end of 2027, ending a decades-old energy relationship which crumbled after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.” In contrast, Reuters says that Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban told the state radio that the plan to ban Russian energy imports must be prevented “by all means”. Reuters also says that “a European official said on Thursday that the United States is ‘not convinced’ about lowering the Group of Seven nations (G7) price cap on Russian crude oil”. Separately, Reuters says: “The European Parliament backed changes on Thursday to the European Union’s carbon border tariff that would exempt from the scheme companies that import less than 50 metric tons per year of relevant goods.” Meanwhile, Reuters says: “The European Union has rejected a Russian request for consultations on its carbon border adjustment package, a World Trade Organization document showed on Monday, citing Russia’s ‘war of aggression’ against Ukraine as the reason.” A final Reuters story says that the EU is launching “an inquiry into how the European Commission fashioned its recent proposals to simplify sustainability law”.

Last year, the loss of the world’s forests reached the highest level ever recorded, the Guardian reports. Citing analysis from the University of Maryland hosted on Global Forest Watch it says that forest loss in 2024 was driven by “a surge in fires caused by global heating”. It reports that forest loss in Brazil accounted for 42% of all primary rainforest loss in the tropics. It continues: “In Bolivia, the loss of previously untouched forest continued to rise, ranking second behind Brazil in overall loss for the first time, driven by drought, fire and government policies promoting agricultural expansion for soya, cattle and sugar cane. The loss of Bolivia’s primary forest has increased nearly fivefold since 2020.” According to Climate Home News, forest loss in 2024 was equivalent to 18 football fields vanishing every minute. It says this is nearly twice as fast as forest loss in 2023. The Associated Press says: “For the first time since record-keeping began, fires, not agriculture, were the leading cause of rainforest loss, accounting for nearly half of all destruction. Those fires emitted 4.1bn tons of planet-warming greenhouse gases, which is more than four times the emissions from air travel in 2023, the researchers said. Still, land clearing for agriculture, cattle farming and other causes rose by 14%, the sharpest increase in almost a decade.” BBC News reports that “there was more positive news in South East Asia, however, with government policies helping to reduce forest loss”. Mongabay, Reuters and the Independent also cover the news.

There is widespread media coverage of the UK’s upcoming spending review. The Guardian reports that chancellor Rachel Reeves will “put £113bn of new capital investment at the forefront of the spending review and argue that the billions of investment in homes, transport and energy would only have happened under Labour”. The newspaper notes that Starmer confirmed last week that the government would “U-turn on the unpopular winter fuel cuts”. It adds that the Sizewell C new nuclear power station in Suffolk is also “likely to be approved”. The Times reports that Starmer “has been warned that his pledges on policing, housebuilding and climate change are being put at risk at a time of mounting cabinet tensions before the spending review”. The newspaper continues: “Ed Miliband, the energy and net-zero secretary, is fighting to save a pledge to spend an extra £6.6bn on insulating millions of homes by the end of this parliament. The scheme, called the warm homes plan, offers grants and low-interest loans to support investment in insulation, solar panels, batteries and low-carbon heating to reduce bills and cut emissions. Cutting the scheme will make it harder for the government to hit its commitment of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.” The Financial Times says that Miliband is also in negotiations about keeping the £8.3bn promised for GB Energy. It says that according to a person involved in the discussions, “wrangling had also been particularly tense with the Home Office, and both the energy and environment departments”. The Guardian carries a warning from charities that “plans to reinstate the winter fuel payment will be undermined if the government presses ahead with mooted cuts to home insulation upgrades”. The Daily Express quotes a “tax consultant” who says that “Reeves risks saddling the UK with up to £7tn in hidden ‘zombie debt’ thanks to the government’s ambitious net-zero target”.

In other UK news, the Times reports that “Britain’s energy costs could be cut by at least £2bn a year through reforms to stop expensive gas-fired power plants setting the wholesale electricity price”. According to the newspaper, Adam Bell, head of energy strategy at the business department during 2020-21, said that gas plants should be removed from the wholesale electricity market and instead “given regulated returns to fire up when needed to keep the lights on”. The newspaper adds: “Gas plants generate only about 30% of Britain’s electricity, yet set the wholesale price 98% of the time, according to a new report by Stonehaven, the consultancy where Bell is now director of policy.” Elsewhere, the Financial Times covers new analysis which finds that the UK is “likely to fall significantly short of its five-year target for offshore wind power, as developers continue to delay or cancel projects because of rising costs and poor returns”.

BBC News reports that the Rampion windfarm off the Sussex coast has caused a “’surprising’ tourism boom”, according to local residents. DeSmog reports that “a Reform UK mayor who claims ‘net-zero madness’ is ‘bankrupting Britain’ has called for investment in an offshore wind project “to boost growth” in the local economy. The i newspaper covers the impacts of climate change on UK rivers. A Daily Telegraph story trailed on its frontpage says that “Starmer’s bid to boost the economy with a slew of new data centres threatens to undermine Labour’s net-zero goals, campaigners have warned”. Separately, the Daily Telegraph reports that “a massive hydrogen project at the heart of Ed Miliband’s net-zero plans risks being cancelled as BP retreats from green targets”. Further stories in the newspaper attacking the UK’s net-zero target claim that it is a “threat to national security” and “less likely to bring down energy bills”. The Daily Telegraph also covers figures published by the Conservatives which find that Scotland will not reach its net-zero emissions target until 2080. Meanwhile, BBC News reports on a fire in a hospital that “began in solar panels on the roof”.

Donald Trump on Friday signed four executive orders, instructing the Department of Energy to “fast-track” nuclear energy development, with the aim of quadrupling US capacity by 2050, the Financial Times reports. The outlet continues: “In a factsheet accompanying the executive order, the White House said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had an ‘overly risk-averse culture’, which requires nuclear facilities to emit as few emissions as possible, including below naturally-occurring levels.” According to Reuters, current licensing for nuclear reactors in the US “can take over a decade at times, a process designed to prioritise nuclear safety but which has discouraged new projects”. The New York Times says: “One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the nation’s independent safety regulator, to streamline its rules and to take no more than 18 months to approve applications for new reactors…Another order directs the energy and defence departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases, possibly alongside new data centers. That could allow the agencies to bypass the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and develop their own, faster processes for approving reactors.” Bloomberg reports that the plans include building “small, untested designs that offer the promise of rapid deployment but haven’t yet been built in the US”. The outlet adds that Trump has “cast nuclear energy as a complement, rather than a replacement, for fossil fuels.” However, the Associated Press reports that experts say the goal of quadrupling nuclear energy capacity is ”highly unlikely” to be reached. According to the Guardian, Trump said the new reactors “would satisfy the electricity demands of data centres for artificial intelligence and other emerging industries”. The Washington Post says: “Administration officials say they expect the directives to result in new plants being built during the president’s term.” The Daily Telegraph calls the directives the “Manhattan Project 2”. The Wall Street Journal, Al Jazeera, CNN, Inside Climate News, Forbes, CNBC, Agence France-Presse and the Daily Mail also cover the story.

Donald Trump has urged UK prime minister Keir Starmer to stop building “unsightly windmills” and to instead accelerate drilling in the North Sea, the Times says. The newspaper reports that in a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “I strongly recommend to them, however, that in order to get their energy costs down, they stop with the costly and unsightly windmills, and incentivise modernised drilling in the North Sea, where large amounts of oil lay waiting to be taken. A century of drilling left, with Aberdeen as the hub. The old-fashioned tax system disincentivises drilling, rather than the opposite. UK’s energy costs would go WAY DOWN, and fast.” [Former Conservative ministers said that new drilling would be unlikely to reduce bills, the Guardian reported previously.] Bloomberg reports that the post on Truth Social came a few hours after Reform UK “was reported by the Financial Times to be trying to woo oil and gas companies with the promise of lower North Sea taxes”. The Sun says: “The US president called on the UK to mimic his ‘drill, baby drill’ policy to take advantage of 100 years of supplies left to bring down energy costs.” [North Sea gas production is set to decline 95% by 2050, even if the government issues new licenses.] The Press Association says: “President Trump has made no secret of the fact that he is not in favour of wind energy, and has previously ranted about ‘big windmill’ that “destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds”. He has claimed they are unreliable energy sources, once bizarrely saying, ‘and then, all of a sudden, it stops; the wind and the televisions go off.’” Other outlets including the Scotsman, the Daily Telegraph, the Daily Express and Bloomberg also cover the comments from Trump. According to the Press Association, Scotland’s first minister John Swinney has said Trump’s post was no “surprise”, adding that his government is “absolutely committed” to its net-zero targets. The Associated Press reports that “US ambassador Warren Stephens has met prime minister Keir Starmer after president Donald Trump urged the UK to ditch wind power projects and drill for oil”.

Elsewhere, the Press Association adds that according to a report by the Just Transition Commission, “urgent action is needed to ensure the transition from fossil fuels to renewables happens fairly”. The outlet continues: “The independent advisory body warned an unjust transition is possible despite it being known for decades that the North Sea oil and gas sector would decline. Oil and gas workers in Aberdeen told the commission they fear a ‘cliff edge’ for their livelihoods.” The Times says the report, which was published on Thursday, “was critical of the lack of clear planning from governments for the transition away from fossil fuels”. The Daily Telegraph reports that “Labour and SNP ministers have ‘no plan’ for thousands of North Sea oil and gas workers who face losing their jobs as production winds down,” according to the “damming” report. The Guardian reports that Reform UK “has promised to reverse the government’s ban on fresh North Sea oil and gas drilling as a ‘day one’ priority if elected to power, with the taxpayer taking a stake in the projects”. The Sun covers the news under the headline “Net hero. Nigel Farage plans to shred costly net-zero rules on [his] first day if he becomes prime minister.”

Meanwhile, the Times reports that “a record-breaking marine heatwave has hit the seas around much of Britain’s west coast and Ireland”. It says that sea surface temperatures are up to 4C warmer than usual for the time of year.

Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net-zero, has penned three separate comment articles carrying similar messages. In the Daily Express, he highlights recent announcements including the energy price cap drop and a consultation on expanding the “warm home discount”. However, he says that “the beating heart of our plan is to bring down bills and get off our dependence on fossil fuel markets controlled by dictators”. Miliband says that “fossil fuel shocks have caused half of Britain’s recessions since 1970”. He continues: “That is why this government is building the UK’s clean energy future- because every solar panel, every wind turbine and every piece of grid infrastructure we build helps get us off the fossil fuel rollercoaster so we can bring down bills once and for all. It is why we are making huge planning decisions to say yes to new homegrown power projects such as solar and wind. Since July we have consented enough wind and solar projects to power 2 million homes. We’ve also lifted the onshore wind ban and set up Great British Energy – Britain’s first publicly owned energy company in more than 70 years.” He concludes: “I know that some in British politics oppose this drive for clean homegrown power- siren voices who want to rip up clean energy projects, say no to the jobs they bring, and plunge the UK deeper into dependency on foreign markets. This Labour government will fight them all the way because the British people deserve energy security now and for the future.” In the Standard, Miliband writes: “Building clean homegrown power is the only way to take back control and protect billpayers from repeated price spikes. That is why the government is driving the most ambitious upgrade to Britain’s energy infrastructure in generations through our ‘plan for change’.” In the Daily Record, Miliband has a piece under the headline: “T​​he UK government is working relentlessly to bring down energy bills for Scots households.”

In other UK comment, Prof Dave Reay and Satwat Rehman, co-chairs of the Just Transition Commission, write in the Times that “the people whose livelihoods are tied to oil and gas production in Scotland need support as we move away from fossil fuels towards greener alternatives”. The piece warns that oil and gas workers in Aberdeen fear “a cliff edge” for their livelihoods. It continues: “So what does a credible plan look like? A key part is to accelerate the growth of offshore clean energy and make sure jobs coming on stream in wind, decommissioning, carbon capture and storage and green hydrogen have robust health and safety regulations and strong protections for workers on pay, conditions and union recognition.” John Redwood, a former Conservative cabinet minister and MP writes in the Daily Telegraph about his opposition to climate policies. A Daily Express editorial says: “The lowering of the [household energy] price cap should result in bills falling by £129 but the cost of powering a home is still far too high…Britain has untapped fossil fuel reserves and there is exciting potential for new small nuclear reactions and the might of nature is waiting to be harnessed. We need an energy revolution to jump-start Britain. Investment and innovation should not be delayed.” Climate-sceptic commentator Dominic Lawson writes in the Daily Mail: “What a farce! Labour is happy to import oil from Norway’s side of the North Sea – while banning drilling on ours”. Also in the Daily Telegraph, the Conservative peer Daniel Hannan argues that “Britain is heading for utter ruin”. He says: “We need to repeal the laws on which that state rests – the Human Rights Act, the Equality Act, the Climate Change Act – and the quangos they spawned.” In the Daily Telegraph, Jordan Peterson writes that “net-zero alarmism is a mental illness”.

An editorial in the Guardian highlights “an alarming new paper” which “shows that even if carbon emissions are slashed to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C, sea level rises will become unmanageable during this century”. The editorial continues: “[The paper] argues that a truly safe limit is likely to be 1C or lower, meaning seas would be unlikely to rise more than 1cm per year. Around the world, about 230 million people live within 1 metre above the current sea level.” It adds: “But people will adapt to sea level rises in the future as they have in the past. This is not to deny or underplay the scale of the threat, but to stress the importance of preparing for changes which are now inevitable, as well as trying as hard as possible to avoid the worst-case scenarios.” Elsewhere, an editorial in the Independent says: “Wealthier countries owe their support, financial and practical, to those countries overwhelmingly impacted by climate disaster – not only because it is right but because it has far-reaching implications for global security.” The editorial cites research undertaken by the Independent’s Rethinking Global Aid project, which “reveals the extent to which recent and continuing cuts in international aid programmes are leaving the world’s most vulnerable communities defenceless in the face of existential challenges”.

In other comment, Daniel Malinsky, an assistant professor of biostatistics at Columbia University, writes in the Guardian that “now is the time for scientists to stand up against Trump’s repressive agenda”. He writes: “Trump has also taken steps to sabotage congressionally mandated research on the climate crisis by dismissing expert authors of the National Climate Assessment. Opposing these moves and organising against them as scientists is a no-brainer.” Another Guardian editorial says Trump’s “big beautiful” budget “supercharges inequality”. The editorial notes that the bill “slashes green energy subsidies”. A Sun editorial says that “Trump is right” to tell Keir Starmer “to tear down the Chinese windmills that could be spying on us and start drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea”.

Meanwhile, Dr Kimberley Reid, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Melbourne, writes in the Guardian that “the floods and droughts devastating Australia are fingerprints of a warming planet”. Dominic Jones, an associate in the Energy and Climate Change Program at Grattan Institute, writes in the Guardian that “as the energy transition ramps up, Australia risks becoming a more unequal society”. He says: “Governments must help households to make the switch to cleaner energy, and change the rules so that the benefits and costs are fairly shared.”",,N,,2025-05-27 11:19:37.689450

An appeal against the decision to approve a new gas power station has been lost.

Environmental consultant Andrew Boswell appealed a High Court decision after arguing against the green credentials of Net Zero Teesside, which is planning to use carbon-capture technology at the station.

The case was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on Thursday, with Dr Boswell saying the ruling proved climate laws were ""broken"".

The project's developers said they were ""pleased"" with the decision. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) declined to comment.

In March, Dr Boswell's legal representatives had argued the government did not fully explore the environmental impacts of the scheme before approving it.

DESNZ said it had acknowledged the ""significant"" greenhouse gas emissions the scheme would cause before any decision was made.

Barrister Rose Grogan, for DESNZ, had told the court: ""Fossil fuel remains part of the government's energy mix.

""It's part of the transition to a low-carbon economy... but it needs to be low carbon through the deployment of CCS [carbon capture and storage].""

The plant, which is planned for the Teesworks site, near Redcar, is being developed by a firm called Net Zero Teesside Power – owned by BP and Equinor.

The company previously stated the project could generate up to 860MW of low-carbon electricity.

It has claimed at least 90% of the gas power station's emissions would be captured and funnelled beneath the North Sea.

'No merit in challenge'

In its judgement, the court said its task was simply to determine whether or not the decision-making process surrounding the power plant was lawful.

It said the ""evaluation"" and ""acceptability"" of the estimated emissions caused by the plant was a ""matter of fact and judgement for the decision-maker"".

The government had made ""lawful and properly reasoned conclusions"" regarding the plant's potential greenhouse gas emissions, the court said.

Net Zero Teesside Power said: ""[We] welcome this second judicial confirmation that there is no merit in Andrew Boswell's challenge.""

Dr Boswell called for the government to launch a scientific review into the use of carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) for gas power plants.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5670/live/8b2220a0-f9d3-11ef-8be4-3bf54461d42e.png,N,,2025-05-27 11:21:19.249961

The House passed its controversial 1,000-plus-page budget reconciliation bill by a razor thin 215-214 margin last week, handing down a slate of troubling measures that experts argue will kick millions of people off Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, bar transgender minors and adults from accessing gender-affirming healthcare through government programs, ""effectively halt the clean energy boom,"" impose a new $1,000 fee on immigrants seeking asylum, and much more.

The bill will more than double the current deficit despite steep cuts to social safety net and climate programs, which experts say will be largely used to offset tax perks for the ultra-rich. According to Rep. Rick Larsen (D–Wash.), ranking member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the legislation will benefit the top 0.1 percent of wealthiest Americans by an average of $255,000 a year, or about $700 a day.

""This budget is so terrible that the GOP had to force it through in the dead of night,"" wrote Larsen in a statement following last Wednesday's vote (thought two Republicans did cross the aisle to vote no with the Democrats). ""The fight isn’t over, and I will keep working to defeat this bill as the legislative process continues.""

Let's focus in on a few of the implications for surface transportation and infrastructure, specifically.

The end of the EV tax credit...

In one of the biggest blows to the nation's transportation decarbonization goals, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" would eliminate the $4,000 and $7,500 tax credits for used and new electric vehicles, respectively by the end of 2025, giving car buyers just over six months to snap up the rebate before it vanishes on Dec. 31. Those purchasing from automakers which have sold fewer than 200,000 clean vehicles will be granted a little more time until those manufacturers meet their caps, at least until the end of 2026.

A electrification tax credit to qualified commercial vehicles was also axed, which means industrial vehicles that can't easily be replaced with other modes will continue spewing dangerous pollution into communities.

That's bad news for U.S. communities held tightest in the grip of car dependency, for which vehicle electrification represents the only realistic hope to slash emissions and remove harmful pollutants from residents' lungs, at least in the short term. And for those who could displace car trips through stronger local policy to support transit, biking, walking, and other green modes, it means it's more important than ever to take local action to bolster those modes now.

...and new fees for driving them

In addition to making it harder for U.S. residents to buy EVs, the One Big Beautiful Bill would also charge drivers a cool $250 a year just to register them — and the drivers of hybrid cars will have to pony up $100 a year, too.

That move might have been intended to address shortfalls in the highway trust fund that powers America's core infrastructure programs, but Jeff Davis of the Eno Center for Transportation testified to Congress earlier this month that the fee ""wouldn't come close to actually closing the amount of revenue that you need to get another five-year [surface transportation reauthorization] bill.""

Steve Davis of Transportation for America, meanwhile, recently argued that ""it’s not time to rescue the trust fund, it’s time to write its eulogy,"" and that we need to whittle America's transportation spending down to a scale we can actually afford rather than adding new fees — while focusing on projects that deliver on safety, reducing congestions, and reducing emissions. (Spoiler alert: a lot fewer highways.)

Some nasty rescissions

As previously reported by Streetsblog, perhaps the most devastating cut to the transportation sections of the budget bill is to the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program, which would lose a staggering 97 percent of its funding – basically, any dollar not yet formally obligated — and defund nearly a hundred projects aimed at reconnecting communities torn apart by past transportation investments.

The bill would also repeal all not-yet-obligated money in a fund designed to help communities do more efficient and effective environmental reviews, which initially totaled $100 million.

Another less-talked-about program called the Low Carbon Transportation Materials Discretionary Grant Program also got the axe, which would have devoted a total of $2 billion to helping agencies green the process of building roadways and other infrastructure before it's actually used — which can itself be a significant source of emissions.

In a release, House T&I chairman Sam Graves (R–Mo.) collectively called those three initiates ""unnecessary Green New Deal style programs"" that represented ""progressive priorities that are either duplicative, are projects that states and other entities may pursue if they prioritize them, or are efforts that should be driven by the industry and not mandated by the federal government.""",https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2025/05/Mike-Johnson-e1748288196221.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:15:04.133286

BP Pulse, the electric vehicle charging arm of energy and retail company BP, has partnered with restaurant chain Waffle House to bring EV chargers to select locations.

BP will install six 400 kW direct current fast charging bays at select sites, which include Waffle House locations in Texas, Florida, Georgia and other parts of the South and Southeast. The first charging sites, which will offer the two most common EV connectors, are expected to come online in 2026.

The agreement comes as BP continues to install EV chargers across its hundreds of c-store locations under the Thorntons, Amoco and TravelCenters of America banners.

Dive Insight:

BP has roughly 40,000 charge points globally. The company opened a Gigahub with 20 EV fast-charging bays last month just north of Boston Logan Airport in Massachusetts, and earlier this year debuted BP Pulse at a TravelCenters of America site, part of a plan that will add dozens more across the banner.

BP had ambitions of reaching 100,000 EV chargers globally, though recently the company has been pulling back on many of its green energy plans. In February, it announced it would reduce investments in transitional businesses like electric vehicles by about $5 billion per year, to $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually. However, in spite of that broader refocus on its oil and gas business, the company is still expanding its EV charging network.

“We’re building a robust network of ultrafast chargers across the country, and this is another example of third-party collaborations enabling access to charging co-located with convenient amenities for EV drivers,” said Sujay Sharma, CEO of BP Pulse.

According to UBS, “declining EV interest and affordability concerns may limit near-term growth” for the electric vehicle maker.

While Rivian’s brand awareness in the U.S. has improved slightly, from 10% in 2024 to 13% this year, consumer consideration is said to remain low.

“Only ~5% of BEV owners/buyers indicated they would consider purchasing a RIVN (up from 4.5% last year),” UBS said. For comparison, UBS estimates Rivian’s estimated 2024 U.S. BEV market share, excluding vans, was around 3%.

The survey also found that while many consumers still seek more EV alternatives, interest in EVs overall has declined.

“Given potential pushout of EPA requirements and repeal of the California waiver, the EV inflection may be further out than expected,” UBS warned, noting that removing the California waiver could also impact Rivian’s ability to generate and sell Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits.

Affordability also remains a key barrier, according to the bank.

“Only ~35% of respondents believed EVs are affordable vs. ICE vehicles,” UBS noted. Rivian’s current models—the R1S SUV and R1T pickup—start at $75,900 and $69,900, respectively, well above the $47,900 average price for a U.S. vehicle.

UBS also flagged risk around the possible elimination of consumer clean vehicle tax credits, which they estimate supported around 59% of Rivian’s 2024 vehicle leases.

“Near-term, especially if U.S. policies move away from an EV world, continued cost out of the R1 and increased manufacturing efficiencies are key,” UBS said.

The pilot programme, named KIRA, is led by Deutsche Bahn (DB) and the Rhein-Main Transport Association (RMV), and operates in the towns of Langen and Egelsbach, south of Frankfurt.

The project uses six modified first-generation ES8 SUVs, Nio’s debut model launched in China in 2018, equipped with autonomous driving systems developed by Intel-owned Mobileye.

The Israel-based company provides the autonomous driving system, including HD maps and advanced sensors. The trial will run through the end of 2025, with an extension under consideration.

While all driving decisions are made by the car, a safety driver remains on board during the test phase. Supervisory staff monitor operations from a remote control centre.

The vehicles, capable of speeds up to 130km/h, operate in regular traffic.

Passengers must register through the KIRA app to book rides. DB said the service will expand to parts of Darmstadt later this year.

The KIRA programme—short for “AI-based regular operation of autonomous on-demand transport”—marks the first time Level 4 automated vehicles are being used with passengers on public roads in Germany.

The pilot project is backed by €2.2 million ($2.5 million) in funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry for Transport, with additional financial support provided by the State of Hesse.

Level 4 automation allows driverless operation within geofenced areas without human intervention.

“Congrats to Deutsche Bahn on launching the autonomous shuttle KIRA pilot project with test users today in Germany,” Mobileye wrote on LinkedIn this Monday.

“We are proud that our Mobileye Drive™ technology is powering this project into its next phase,” the company added.

The initiative builds on a partnership between Nio and Mobileye announced in 2019, which aimed to develop autonomous vehicles for the Chinese and global markets.

Earlier this year, Norwegian operator Ruter launched a self-driving ride-hailing service in Oslo using the same Nio ES8 model.

Last year, Mobileye showed a 14-minute clip of a Nio ES8 driving autonomously in Norway where the company claimed it handled “complex roads, intersections, and roundabouts, expertly making real-time decisions and maneuvers.”

Here’s the video shared by Mobileye last year.

Dries Acke, deputy CEO, said: “This Act marks an important step in the EU’s strive to diversify and reshore solar manufacturing to Europe.
It creates a dedicated market for EU solar products, giving much-needed relief to European solar manufacturing.
This provision may, then, apply to solar PV capacity auctions.","The Commission has clarified the specific clean energy technology components that will fall under the NZIA requirements, which include a broad list of solar PV supply chain components from polysilicon and silicon ingots to junction boxes, backsheets and inverters.

It also adopted rules for so-called “non-price criteria” in public procurement auctions, which will compel member state governments to consider “responsible business conduct, cybersecurity, and sustainability and resilience contribution”, as well as price, in public renewables auctions. The Commission said that 30% of yearly auction volumes must meet these criteria from 30 December, 2025 – amounting to around 6GW of energy capacity per country each year.

Measures similar to these have already been included in the Clean Industrial Deal (CID), but had not previously been made explicit under the NZIA. The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC) called for member states’ “resilience” criteria to be included in the NZIA earlier this year.

In response to the new acts, Christoph Podewils, secretary general of the ESMC, said: “This is a major step forward in our efforts to reshore solar manufacturing capacity to Europe. We now look forward to seeing these commitments translated into concrete measures through the Net-Zero Industry Act and the revised Public Procurement Framework.”

European trade body SolarPower Europe expressed similar support. Dries Acke, deputy CEO, said: “This Act marks an important step in the EU’s strive to diversify and reshore solar manufacturing to Europe. It creates a dedicated market for EU solar products, giving much-needed relief to European solar manufacturing.

“We look forward to seeing the first auctions under the Act in 2026 and encourage Member States to effectively implement the resilience principles, including premiums for made-in-Europe solar panels. With solar manufacturers in peril, there is no time to lose.”

The Commission also specifies that EU countries must not rely on any one country for more than 50% of renewable energy component supply, in addition to meeting the 30% “resilience” threshold for non-price criteria. In one section of this act, the Commission states that some technologies may have a level of dependency on an external country “so high that a strict application of the resilience criterion would endanger the security of supply of that component.”

Currently, Chinese producers account for over 80% of the world’s crystalline silicon solar manufacturing capacity, and the top four companies shipped over 65GW of modules between them in the first 3 months of 2025 alone. This provision may, then, apply to solar PV capacity auctions.

In a more explicit move, the Commission implied that the focus of its resilience drive will be on solar module assembly, rather than upstream components, specifically solar cells.

Article 10 of the act states that “the assembly of PV cells…or equivalent components into PV modules would not change the origin of the module. For this reason, it is appropriate to refer to the assembly of the solar photovoltaic system and of the PV module, rather than to their origin, as a reference for the contribution to resilience of those specific manufacturing steps.”

In its statement on the announcement, SolarPower Europe (which includes major Chinese solar manufacturers among its membership) praised the “positive, measured, approach” taken by the Commission. It continued: “This also means the rest of the auction market should remain unaffected, maintaining the necessary pace of solar deployment.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/European_Commission_flags-768x576-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 13:24:26.946819

A new Republican tax plan in the U.S. House of Representatives could eliminate many federal energy-efficient tax benefits, including electric vehicle (EV), solar panel, and clean energy home improvement credits.

According to the Kelley Blue Book, a record-breaking 1.3 million EVs were sold in the U.S. last year, with 87% taking advantage of the federal tax credit. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Department reports that over 3.4 million households have received $8.4 billion in tax credits for energy efficiency upgrades.

But the GOP’s latest proposal, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” might end affordability for many wanting to use clean energy tax incentives. (Though the U.S. Senate has yet to weigh in.)

Which credits could be eliminated? And in what ways might you still “go green” if the tax breaks do disappear?

Read on.

Clean energy tax credits in the House bill

During the Biden presidency, many clean energy tax credits were created, expanded, or extended under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As a result of that legislation, the federal government offered several tax credits promoting energy efficiency:

The electric vehicle (EV) tax credit, worth up to $7,500 for new qualifying “clean vehicle” EVs.

The previously-owned clean vehicle credit, worth up to $4,000 or 30% of the sales price (whichever is less), for used EVs.

The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, also called the “EV charger tax credit,” worth up to 30% of the cost of qualifying “green” equipment (maximum $1,000).

The energy efficient home improvement credit, worth up to $3,200 on qualifying items like doors, windows, and natural gas heat pumps.

The residential clean energy credit, worth up to 30% of qualifying expenditures, like solar panels.

…there were also various other energy credits included in the IRA. Together, those tax breaks have helped many Americans afford to “go green” and cut their tax bills when installing certain energy-efficient home upgrades.

Most IRA-sponsored clean energy initiatives expire at the end of 2032. However, under the new GOP tax bill, many provisions could be eliminated as early as December 31, 2025.

GOP tax bill on energy tax credits

The latest House GOP tax bill calls for the early termination of many clean energy tax breaks. However, the party seems to be split on the issue:

In March of this year, 21 House Republicans sent a letter to Jason Smith, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, advocating for preserving the clean energy tax breaks.

In May 2025, thirteen House Republicans warned that suddenly slashing IRA tax credits, including clean energy incentives, could harm new energy investment, according to a joint statement. Among the concerns cited were calls for ""additional time"" on certain tax credit phase-out schedules.

However, the House recently voted to pass its version of Trump’s one big, beautiful reconciliation bill to the Senate, with slashes to clean energy tax breaks in tow. Yet some still speculate whether energy-efficient tax breaks will be eliminated.

Just last month, four Republican Senators voiced concerns about ending federal clean energy tax credits and other incentives in the reconciliation process.

“...We caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,” wrote Rep. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John R. Curtis (R-Utah), Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina), and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.

The letter highlights the divide within the party, as some Republicans view clean energy tax credits as “reckless.”

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) proposed a bill in February calling for the complete elimination of electric vehicle tax credits. In a release regarding the bill, Barrasso said that repeal of the tax credits would “...stop Washington from giving handouts to our adversaries and high-income individuals.”

Energy bill cost if tax credits go away

Tax incentives help people afford clean energy upgrades like solar panels and EVs. By eliminating energy tax breaks, fewer people may obtain the benefits they offer, like lower energy bills.

According to a recent analysis by Energy Innovation, a non-partisan policy firm, repeal of federal clean energy tax credits could make electricity bills rise across the U.S.. The average American household could see an increase in its annual energy bill of:

About $40 to $60 by 2030

By about $56 to $150 in 2035

And about $140 to $220 in 2040

In total, repealing these tax credits could cost taxpayers $6 billion annually over the next five years. By 2040, American households could lose $25 billion per year.

Notably, that analysis doesn’t include any current or potential Trump tariffs.

Parts for clean energy initiatives, like EVs and solar panel pieces, are typically made abroad in countries like Mexico and China. When a tariff war occurs, as happened earlier this year (and continues to progress), consumers generally pay the price.

Consequently, energy-efficient tax breaks would be needed to combat raised prices from tariffs on imported energy products.

Otherwise, the hit to energy incentives would be twofold: Raised prices from tariffs, and elimination of tax credits that could have helped absorb the higher prices.

‘Go green’ clean energy ideas: Rebates and state tax programs

While many clean energy initiatives are under fire from the latest GOP tax plan, it’s important to remember the bill is still in its early days. The Senate will take up the bill and has already signaled that it plans to make revisions. Which provisions will be impacted remains to be seen.

In the meantime, there are ways you may be able to “go green” even if a potential elimination of energy tax credits occurs:

Apply for the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program, which offers qualifying homeowners rebates on stoves, heat pump water heaters, electric wiring, and more.

Check out the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps eligible households pay heating or cooling bills.

Regularly schedule maintenance on your HVAC, purchase “smart” energy usage appliances, or look around your interiors for potential air leaks in windows, doors, or attics. Timely repairs may save you up to 15% on heating and cooling costs, according to Energy Star.

Finally, check your state’s Department of Revenue website for energy-related tax credits or rebate programs. Several states have decided to stand against potential federal reform on the clean energy front.

For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last year that if the EV tax credit is eliminated, the Golden State would provide rebates for eligible EV purchases. States like New Mexico and North Carolina have also set goals for 100% clean energy by 2045 and 2050, respectively.

The House version of the GOP tax bill heads to the Senate next, where it will likely face revisions before final legislation may be reached. Republicans have said their goal for passing major legislation is July 4. Stay tuned.

Kia lowers a majority of EV9 trim pricing for 2026

Kia shared all the details of its 2026 EV9 models today, including its latest pricing. As mentioned above, most of the updates for the third model year are cosmetic, but there are some (slight) increases to range compared to the 2025 versions.

For example, the Light Long Range EV9 gained a whole extra mile (305 mi), while the Wind and Land trims jumped from 280 miles in 2025 to 283 for 2026. Lastly, the top-tier GT-Line increased the most, gaining 10 miles of range for 2026 (280 miles).

Before we get to EV9 pricing, here are some additional updates, per Kia:

New Nightfall Edition available on Land trim

Design and performance enhancements

Exclusive 20-inch gloss black wheels, black badging, and gloss black trim

New Roadrider Brown exclusive exterior color

Exclusive interior seat stitching pattern and design elements

Offered with both 6-passenger and 7-passenger seating configurations at no extra cost

All AWD trims (Wind/Land/GT-Line) gain Terrain Mode (Mud/Snow/Sand), which replaces 4WD

2026 GT-Line gains two new two-tone exterior color options:

Glacial White Pearl with Ebony Black roof

Wolf Gray with Ebony Black roof

Okay, as promised, here’s the 2026 model-year Kia EV9 pricing. For comparison, we’ve included MSRPs for the first three model years of the EV9’s existence so you can see how prices have changed (or held steady). Note that these MSRP’s exclude destination and handling, taxes, title, license fees, options and retailer charges:

As you can see, the Light SR trim of the EV9 held steady at $54,900 for a third consecutive year. The only other RWD option, the Light LR, saw a $2,000 price drop after going up $700 in 2025. The AWD Wind trim once again held steady while the EV9 Land saw a $1,000 decrease.

Last but not least, the 2026 Kia EV9 GT-Line’s pricing dropped $2,000 and is now below $72,000 before taxes and fees.

Looking ahead, Durfee explains that Virginia Tech is “absolutely looking at much larger solar installations.” The project has generated excitement among sustainability groups on campus.","By Kayla Masterman

As part of its commitment to sustainability, Virginia Tech has taken a significant step toward reducing its carbon footprint by completing four 1.2-megawatt solar arrays on building rooftops across its Blacksburg campus in fall 2024.

The four solar arrays are located on top of Sterrett Center, Durham Hall, the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine and McComas Hall.

The arrays generate approximately 2,300 megawatt-hours annually, with weather and cloud cover being variables in production. This is equivalent to the energy consumption of approximately 215 to 220 average residential homes.

Installed in September 2024, the project became operational in November, marking progress toward the university’s broader goal of clean energy expansion.

“It was several years in the making — a lot of negotiating and stakeholder engagement around how that was to happen,” says Stephen Durfee, associate director for campus energy management. “You’ve got to start somewhere, and this is how you do it.”

Durfee oversees a team of energy engineers, technicians, field engineers and program managers who work to improve energy efficiency on campus.

“We work together to identify the wasteful areas where we don’t benchmark well,” Durfee said. “Once we figure out why, we develop solutions.”

Mark Owczarski, interim vice president for communications and marketing, said the project aligns with the university’s Climate Action Commitment, which aims for carbon neutrality by 2030 and a transition to 100% renewable electricity.

“It’s a commitment to responsible energy use and recognizing that fossil fuels have a limited supply and consequences,” Owczarski says. “These projects aren’t just about reducing emissions — they also create learning environments and spaces for students to engage.”

According to the Climate Action Commitment, a key component of the plan is to “achieve 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030.” The solar array project moves the university closer to that goal.

“This project is part of a larger plan that benefits business, teaching, research and the environment,” Owczarski says.

Virginia Tech’s sustainability efforts extend beyond Blacksburg. Owczarski pointed to the university’s newly opened Innovation Campus building in Alexandria, Virginia, as another example of sustainable design.

“If you take a real close look at that building — the windows and all that stuff — what you’re actually looking at are little teeny solar panels,” Owczarski says. “The panels make the building look beautiful, and they’re collecting energy.”

He emphasized that sustainability initiatives are part of a broader strategy across all Virginia Tech campuses.

“Educating the engineers who are going to make the next generation of energy makers is part of what we do,” Owczarski says.

Durfee noted the importance of early stakeholder engagement in sustainability projects.

“There’s always pushback from someone, but working through concerns and reaching agreements is key,” he says. “The more successful solar installations we see in the region, the easier it becomes for others to manage risk by learning from those patterns of success.”

When pitching the project, Durfee said the university looked to peer institutions in the Appalachian region for inspiration.

“We absolutely pointed to some peers — other schools, towns and municipalities that have successfully implemented solar design, installs and operations.”

Owczarski added that long-term analysis and review will demonstrate the project’s return on investment.

“It is not only good for the environment, but it’s also good for business because it can lower our bills over time after the initial investment,” Owczarski said. “It provides energy sources that are controllable, which will help economically.”

A third-party solar developer owns and maintains the solar arrays and sells the energy to Virginia Tech through a power purchase agreement.

Owczarski explains how a $500,000 grant from the Virginia Department of Energy helped lower the power purchase agreement cost per kilowatt-hour. Due to this agreement, Virginia Tech now gets about 1.2% of its campus energy from clean sources and saves around $45,000 a year compared to regular market rates.

According to an EPA spokesperson, the agency has been re-evaluating the 2024 rule — unofficially dubbed “Clean Power Plan 2.0” — since March.
The rule would have required coal plants operating beyond 2039 to slash carbon emissions by 90%, and placed even tighter controls on new natural gas plants.

“BECCS is the way forward,” Greg Stangl, Phoenix E | RSS.com

The EPA did not disclose specific details about the rollback but confirmed that the revised proposal is undergoing interagency review and will be released once signed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This latest move continues a back-and-forth over federal authority to regulate power plant emissions.

The Obama-era Clean Power Plan sought to shift power generation toward low-carbon sources, but was replaced by the Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.

That rule was struck down by a federal court, and the Supreme Court later ruled in 2022 that the EPA had overstepped its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The Biden administration’s regulation, finalized in early 2024, immediately faced lawsuits from Republican-led states, energy companies, and coal industry groups.

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy,” an EPA spokesperson said. “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

Opponents argue that carbon capture remains too costly and technically uncertain, and say the vast infrastructure required to store captured CO2 safely underground is not yet in place — especially for the nation’s roughly 200 operating coal plants.

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.
Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.
Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.
Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.","The Georgia Public Service Commission is set to hold a second round of hearings on Georgia Power’s controversial long-range plans.

The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15 as the state’s largest utility expects to spend billions of dollars to meet skyrocketing energy demands attributed to new electricity-hogging data centers. Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.

Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.

A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.

Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.

In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.

Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.

“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.

Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.

Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.

Fossil fuels under fire

Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.

Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.

The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.

Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.

Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.

Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of unnecessary electricity-generating infrastructure.

“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”

Georgia Power has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.

Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.

Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.

“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”

Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.

“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.

Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week on how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.

“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.

However, it’s possible that some buyers of tax credits might be more inclined toward tax equity as a result of their experience with purchases.","The budget bill as passed by the House promises an overhaul of the clean energy tax credits introduced and expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act. The contours of the changes are subject to revision — and that process has already begun — as the bill heads into the next phases of its probable passage. But while the bill spells immediate difficulties for many of the credits, the longer-term implications might be even more challenging for the energy industry because the House bill could be a prelude to putting the clean energy credits on the “permanent extenders” treadmill.

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Ways and Means Committee’s proposed changes to the clean energy credits would total almost $561 billion over the 10-year budget window (JCX-22-25 R). The JCT also showed a loss of $2 billion from the addition of income from hydrogen storage and carbon capture as qualifying income of certain publicly traded partnerships. Before the IRA, the tax equity market saw approximately $20 billion in transactions per year; after the IRA, the estimates are roughly $100 billion. If enacted without changes, the proposed budget bill would shrink the transfer market considerably.

The bad news for the energy industry is that the House bill includes extensive new restrictions for prohibited foreign entities for nearly all of the credits, repeals transferability for projects that begin construction after the second anniversary of enactment, and terminates the sections 48E and 45Y tech-neutral investment and production credits much earlier. The good news is that some of the credits would survive the House’s scalpel and none of the changes are retroactive. The only credits that would be completely repealed are the section 25C energy-efficient home improvement credit, the section 25D residential clean energy credit, the section 25E used electric vehicle credit, the section 30C EV charging credit, the section 30D clean vehicle credit (subject to a phaseout), the section 45L new energy-efficient home credit, and the section 45W commercial clean vehicle credit. Although many negotiations remain to be conducted in the Senate, the bill likely represents the worst-case scenario for the industry.

That means some credits are all but gone. The Rules Committee’s final changes to the tech-neutral credits, made hours before the bill passed the House, rendered those credits unavailable except for projects that begin construction within 60 days of the date of the bill’s enactment or are placed in service before December 31, 2028. The bill that initially emerged from Ways and Means proposed a phasedown starting in 2029.

Shutting Out China (and Russia, North Korea, and Iran)

While some changes to the foreign-entity-of-concern rules might have been expected, the breadth of the proposals surprised the industry. Unlike the IRA and the CHIPS Act, which included foreign-entity-of-concern rules only in section 30D’s individual EV credit and section 48D’s advanced manufacturing investment credit, the proposed foreign-entity-of-concern rules would apply to all of the energy tax credits. “The language is incredibly broad and would render the credits useless to a very large portion of the critical U.S. taxpayer base,” said Matt Donnelly of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. A more recent revision incorporated by the Rules Committee and passed by the House narrowed the constructive ownership rules that apply in the foreign-entity-of-concern context but left the other rules largely unchanged.

New definitions would be included in section 7701(a)(51) with general applicability to the energy tax credits. They would take effect for tax years beginning after the date of enactment, leaving little time for taxpayers to adapt. A prohibited foreign entity is defined as either a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. A specified foreign entity is defined as certain types of foreign entities of concern specified under the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, a Chinese military company operating in the United States in accordance with that act, certain entities included on lists required by other laws, entities specified by the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, or a foreign-controlled entity.

A foreign-controlled entity is the government of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran; any citizen, national, or resident of one of those countries that is not a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; an entity or qualified business unit incorporated under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; or an entity, including subsidiaries, controlled by one of the above governments, individuals, or entities. Control means more than 50 percent by vote or value of the stock in a corporation, more than 50 percent of the profits or capital interests in a partnership, or more than 50 percent of the beneficial interests in any other type of entity. The section 318 rules on constructive ownership of stock apply, but an amendment by the Rules Committee removes the rules in section 318(a)(3) regarding attribution to partnerships and corporations in this context.

A foreign-influenced entity is defined based on its status during the tax year or the previous tax year. There are multiple ways to become a foreign-influenced entity during the tax year: if a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer of the entity, a single specified foreign entity owns at least 10 percent of the entity, one or more specified foreign entities own at least 25 percent in the aggregate of the entity, or at least 25 percent of the debt of the entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities. In addition, if during the previous tax year the entity knowingly pays dividends, interest, compensation for services, rents, royalties, guarantees, or any other fixed, determinable, annual, or periodic amount to a specified foreign entity equal to or greater than 10 percent of the total of such payments made by the entity during the tax year, or makes FDAP payments to more than one specified foreign entity of at least 25 percent of the total of such payments made during the tax year, the entity is a foreign-influenced entity.

Section 7701(a)(52) adds a prohibition on material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Material assistance occurs if any component, subcomponent, or applicable critical mineral included in property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity. If the design of property is based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by one, that too is material assistance. There is an exception for an assembly part or constituent material that is not acquired directly from a prohibited foreign entity. Assembly parts subject to the exception cannot be uniquely designed for use in constructing a qualified facility under sections 45Y and 48E or an eligible component in section 45X or exclusively or predominantly produced by prohibited foreign entities, and there are similar rules for constituent materials.

The definition of control for purposes of the foreign-controlled entity concept applies the broad constructive ownership rules from section 318, and the Ways and Means version of the bill created a big problem for companies with international operations, Donnelly said. Those rules attribute ownership not only from a subsidiary to a parent company, but also from a parent down to the subs. Applying all of these rules for energy credits may treat even brother-sister subsidiaries as owning other subsidiaries in the group. “For many multinational enterprises, if there is a Chinese sub, that could render all of the others foreign-controlled entities,” Donnelly said. The drafters of the Ways and Means version could have intended to include only the upward attribution aspects of the section 318 rules in order to capture situations in which companies in China, North Korea, Russia, or Iran have management and ownership control over the subsidiary; clarifying that is the object of the Rules Committee change, which was included in the bill that passed the House.

Transferability Repeal

Is it time to eulogize the IRA’s novel experiment in transferability? The House bill says yes, but there are more than a few indications that Congress rather likes the idea of making credits transferable. (Prior analysis: Tax Notes Federal, Apr. 21, 2025, p. 439.) The bill repeals transferability for projects that begin construction after the second anniversary of the date of enactment, which offers some lead time for taxpayers to adjust. But even with a transition period, the change is likely to greatly affect the clean energy industry, which has become reliant on transferability, said David Burton of Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP. “It has worked very well and had a big impact,” he added. Smaller developers might be the most affected, and larger developers that previously engaged in tax equity transactions, the least affected. “For smaller developers with a weaker balance sheet, the tax equity market might not be terribly interested,” Burton said. However, it’s possible that some buyers of tax credits might be more inclined toward tax equity as a result of their experience with purchases. Burton said that although some credit buyers who weren’t previously tax equity investors eventually entered those transactions, or at least considered it, they’re likely to remain a minority, even if the repeal passes.

Andy Moon of Reunion, a tax credit transfer platform, said that although the House bill published May 22 would significantly shorten the window of availability for clean energy tax credits, market participants are confident that tax credit transfers will be respected in 2025. For projects that meet the safe harbor requirements, transfers could still be made for the next couple of years, even under the House bill. That assurance will likely accelerate credit transfers through the end of this year, Moon said. “I think there has been some holding back due to a fear of retroactive repeal,” he said. “I expect to see a wave of buyers looking for tax credits in the second half of the year, which will drive prices up similar to what we saw in 2024.” Corporate tax credit buyers and the clean energy industry will now turn their attention to the Senate to advocate for a longer-term tax credit program to incentivize clean energy.

From Phasedown to Repeal

In a surprising last-minute change before the full House voted May 22, the Rules Committee added provisions to repeal the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits in sections 48E and 45Y, setting the stage for a debate in the Senate about those credits’ future. In contrast, the Ways and Means proposal included a phasedown of the tech-neutral investment and production tax credits starting in 2029 that offered a transition period to the industry. It also gave politicians some lead time, coming as it did immediately after the 2028 election. The Ways and Means proposal likely represented a compromise in the House, because it came bundled with a switch from the long-used beginning-of-construction timing to a placed-in-service standard. The latter could pose difficulties for developers, because when a project is planned to be placed in service and when it is actually placed in service may differ due to circumstances beyond their control, Burton said. The switch would increase risk and decrease certainty about what level of credits a taxpayer qualifies for, he added.

Short End of the Stick

The commercial clean vehicle credit in section 45W is slated for a full repeal for vehicles acquired after December 31, 2025, with the only exception being vehicles placed in service before January 1, 2033, that are acquired under a written binding agreement entered before May 12, 2025. Josh Green of the American Fleet Leadership Coalition said that the proposal to eliminate section 45W ignores many of the benefits companies are already seeing from the credit and could harm U.S. competitiveness, national security, and energy dominance. Green, who is also CEO of Inspiration Mobility Group, noted that ending the credit this year jeopardizes investments that businesses have already committed to, because the owners of commercial fleets plan their purchases years in advance. “There are a variety of ways to improve the credit and make it more targeted while still reducing the overall fiscal impact,” Green said. Those might include domestic content rules with a runway for implementation and proration of the credit in accordance with the percentage of domestic content included, or a sunset date further off than the end of the year. In addition to the impact of the proposed bill, section 45W has another source of uncertainty: The proposed regulations for section 45W (REG-123525-23) were only released in January and haven’t been finalized yet.

Wind energy is also poised to take a blow by being removed from the section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit after 2027, while every other technology gets to stay in until 2031. This change appears to be a nod to the Trump administration’s deprioritization of wind power.

Everything Old Is New Again?

Ironically, if the changes in the House proposal are enacted, the result could be a greater interest in traditional tax equity transactions, which were available long before the IRA and have remained unchanged. And the likelihood that clean energy credits wind up being year-end extenders like their pre-IRA predecessors is probably also higher if Congress ultimately goes with the earlier sunset dates.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6835bb656a261e5ebc1a9d4b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-27 11:19:57.729977

But these Texas Republicans are embracing it - The Guardian,Oliver Milman,,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/27/texas-republicans-trump-wind-power-turbines,"We are an energy state.” The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, is growing for the first time since the 1960s.
I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints, voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.
Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them.
Meanwhile, in Texas, there are three state bills that would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.
“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.","As a Republican state lawmaker for 16 years, a Texas rancher and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, John Davis’s conservative credentials are impeccable. But Davis has become horrified at his party’s assault upon an increasingly vital lifeline to many rural, conservative areas of the US – clean energy development.

Davis allowed seven wind turbines to be situated on his ranch, in the rolling hill country near Menard, west of Austin, and has seen the income provide opportunities not only for his family but also his local community in what is one of the poorest counties in Texas.

But a barrage of bills working their way through the Republican-held Texas legislature threaten to reverse the state’s position as the US’s clean energy superpower, even curtailing cherished private property rights by limiting a landowner’s ability to host wind and solar farms.

The bills come as Trump has ramped up anti-renewable rhetoric on the national stage, calling wind turbines “ugly” and “disgusting” and barring major clean energy projects on federal lands and waters. “We don’t want windmills in this country,” Trump, who has enjoyed strong electoral support from farmers, said shortly after being inaugurated as president.

This backlash has left many conservatives, such as Davis, bewildered, with recent polling showing that most Republican voters in Texas oppose moves to squash the state’s booming renewable energy sector. While climate campaigners see renewables as a crucial replacement for the fossil fuels that are overheating the planet, places such as Menard county, Texas – where Trump won more than 80% of the vote in last year’s election – are more inclined to weigh other factors.

“We’re supposed to be the party of common sense but we’ve shifted to be like the Democrats and that is what makes me mad. When you tell me what to do on my own property that sounds more like a Democrat,” Davis said. “Some of the bills they are trying to pass would kill renewables.”

Davis retired as state legislator in 2015 to spend more time on his ranch but has lately been donning a suit and traveling back to Austin to urge his former colleagues to reject the anti-renewables bills. “I testify as a conservative and say: ‘What are you guys doing? Have you lost your mind?’” he said. “Some of these bills are attacking battery storage of all things. How dumb is that? It’s sacrificing your core conservative value principles in order to protect the oil and gas industry.”

Texas’s traditional image may be of cowboy hats, steers and nodding oil wells, but in reality, the state today could just as easily be associated with solar panels, windmills and Teslas. Texas’s combined wind and solar power output is nearly double that of its closest rival, California, it tripled the amount of new battery storage added last year compared to 2023 and is leading the way in emerging alternatives such as geothermal. This year, a third of all new renewable and storage projects in the US will be built in the Lone Star state.

“We are still firmly an oil and gas state and producing more than we ever have but that’s not the full picture,” said Joshua Rhodes, an energy expert at the University of Texas. “We produce and consume more energy than any other state, we have more wind than the next four states combined and regularly have more than 50% of our grid running on renewables. We are an energy state.”

The stampede of new renewables has helped state energy demand that, fueled by data centers, is growing for the first time since the 1960s. It has also generated cash for struggling rural areas. Rhodes’ research has found existing clean energy projects in Texas will pay more than $12bn in taxes to communities where they are located, funding schools, roads and hospitals, while paying out another $15bn to landowners to lease their properties.

“It’s a hard life out here, there’s rocks, mesquite and coyotes and not a lot else – if there’s anything to make life easier, do it,” said Davis as he stood on his property under the whooshing blades of a wind turbine, one of a ragged line of turbines that make up the Cactus Flats wind project. “See any dead birds here? I’ve never seen one,” added Davis, in reference to one of the most common complaints, voiced by Trump himself, about wind turbines.

Places such as Menard, located in central Texas between two large oil and gas regions, have limited options for new income. Davis has several hundred goats and sheep and raises cattle for wagyu beef on his 1,300-acre property, but 40% of his income now comes from the wind turbines, money he hopes he can push back into the sleepy Menard community.

“I struck wind!” said the ebullient Davis, who likes to restyle Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra into “turn, baby turn” in recognition of his wind turbines. “I done turned the money into my back ass pocket,” he said.

Some locals still dislike the sight of wind turbines puncturing the prairie, with even Davis initially put off by them. “I think they look angelic now,” he said. Another nearby rancher, Hoppy Murchison, who has a drooping handlebar moustache, cowboy hat and checked shirt, is less enamored with their appearance and mostly subscribes to Trump’s worldview.

“But for me it made too much sense to not do it,” said Murchison, who now has several wind turbines on his own property, providing him a stable income. “I don’t think we can become totally dependent on renewable energy, but anything will help because we will run out of oil and gas at some point.”

For leaders of poorer counties such as Menard, the aesthetics of wind turbines are beside the point. “I literally have hungry children in my community, so I’m not turning my nose up at any kind of financial windfall,” said Brandon Corbin, the local Republican county judge. Corbin estimates that a proposed battery facility in the county could add as much as 30% to Menard’s stretched annual budget of $5m.

“It’s not productive or helpful when he spouts off like that,” Corbin said of Trump’s comments on wind and solar. “We are the ones on the ground here and he says and does things that puts fear and uncertainty out.”

But senior Republicans in Washington have sought to ape Trump, pushing forward a budget plan that strips away incentives for clean energy and electric cars. Meanwhile, in Texas, there are three state bills that would severely restrict any new wind or solar installations.

One that has already passed the Texas senate, SB819, calls for the “police power of the state” to drastically limit new wind and solar projects by requiring permits not needed for gas, coal or nuclear plants. A wind turbine would have to be 3,000ft from a neighbor’s property line, compared to just 467ft for an oil well.

“I’ve heard from many constituents with valid concerns regarding the reckless installation of these facilities,” said Lois Kolkhorst, a Texas state senator and one of the bill’s sponsors. Kolkhorst, a Republican who calls herself a “lifelong wildlife conservationist” said the legislation will provide “a reasonable approach to the recent proliferation of wind and solar facilities encroaching across Texas with no consideration or safeguards for landowners or the environment”.

While most Republicans don’t share such enmity towards renewables, Kolkhorst has some powerful and wealthy allies, including the Texas Public Policy Foundation thinktank and the Stewards of Texas group, which opposes new clean energy development. The latter group has ties to Dan Friedkin, a billionaire businessman whose interests include owning hotels and whose roles include being the executive producer of the Paramount show Landman (which includes a notable scene critiquing clean energy) as well as being the owner of soccer clubs Everton and Roma.

“Renewable energy has a role in Texas’s energy landscape, but it must be managed responsibly to ensure that our state’s most cherished outdoor spaces are not adversely affected,” a spokesperson for the Friedkin Group, on behalf of Friedkin, said.

Critics of the bills, though, argue that they are counterproductive political posturing designed to aid an oil and gas industry that feels threatened by the rise of renewables. Should the bills pass, 15% of Texas’s wind fleet could shutter, raising energy prices to the point that the typical household’s electricity bill would increase by $225 a year, according to one estimate.

“This would be extremely damaging to renewable energy and damaging to the whole Texas economy,” said Doug Lewin, a leading Texas energy industry expert.

“We desperately need new energy supply, and if we’re saying, ‘No, we don’t want the sources that can be deployed the fastest’ for ideological reasons, then the economy will stagnate.

“Some people have just decided that renewables are bad and they will fight them. To point at solar panels as an environmental problem when we have so many abandoned oil wells in Texas is just absurd.”

While the fate of clean energy support in the federal budget will come down to how many moderate Republicans will fight to preserve the investment flowing to their districts, in Texas the main decider could be time itself. The Texas legislative session ends on 2 June and should the bills get gummed up enough in the system, Davis hopes they will be beaten by the clock, at least until next year’s session.

“The system is set up to kill bills, to have less government,” he said. “So there’s a lot of advantages we have to kill these bills. We want to keep them bottled up. Delay, delay, delay.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02aeb10ccf91b310b2dccd9e8bf389cb36e9cbd/120_185_3085_2469/master/3085.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aaad5fef849cc81709a52e75ce9387d8,N,,2025-05-27 10:10:14.666895

US shale producers grapple with tariff fallout, Opec

US shale producers grapple with tariff fallout, Opec

New York, 27 May (Argus) — US oil executives remain on the defensive following forecasts for a sharp shale production growth slowdown this year, despite President Donald Trump's 90-day trade truce with China helping oil prices bounce back from four-year lows. The US oil sector is having to contend with surging Opec+ supplies at a time when worldwide demand is flagging, as well as steel tariffs that have raised the cost of oil field equipment. Some companies are already starting to cut spending and drop rigs after warning that the sector is near or already at peak output. And with oil prices still hovering around levels needed to profitably drill new wells, any renewed weakness could accelerate the downturn. Hundreds of producers and suppliers gathered at the Super DUG Conference & Expo in Fort Worth, Texas, earlier this month to discuss how best to navigate the growing challenges facing the industry. Many of them said they were bracing for further headwinds, but they also argued the industry is in better shape to withstand the latest slump after spending the years since the Covid-19 pandemic getting its finances in order. Some attendees expressed frustration that tariffs remain a moving target and are hard to plan for as a result, but services firms noted some upside from a rush of bookings from customers looking to avoid getting hit. Others believe the industry may be able to come together and figure out how to mitigate the effects of tariffs, but consider Opec+ a bigger concern as additional barrels hitting the market from the producer group have the potential to sink prices. Trump has ruffled feathers with his unwavering push for lower oil prices to help tackle inflation, but executives are giving him the benefit of the doubt, given his promise to roll back costly environmental regulations and free up permitting bottlenecks — both of which could bolster the industry in the long term. But oil field services companies are bearing the brunt of this year's slowdown, with the share price of Liberty Energy — founded by US energy secretary Chris Wright — down by about 45pc since January. The company's calendar is ""full"" and activity looks to be ""quite solid"" through to the end of the second quarter, Liberty chief executive Ron Gusek told the conference. ""My expectation is we are going to see a reduction in activity over the back half of the year, barring some meaningful change in the macro,"" he said. Drilling down An uncertain outlook for oil prices could spur a reduction in drilling programmes as companies look to shore up balance sheets and protect free cash flow. ""I don't know how steep that will be... I think it's going to be tens of rigs. Maybe it's in the 30-40 range,"" Gusek said, referring to the number of drilling rigs that are likely be shut down by US onshore producers. For Liberty, that could translate into a decline of 10-15 hydraulic fracturing crews. ""I don't view that as catastrophic by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think we're going to see a wind down,"" Gusek said. ""Certainly, by the time we get out into the fourth quarter, where capital programmes are normally winding down for the year, I think we're going to see a real taper-off there."" It is too early to say what 2026 has in store for the industry but ""we'll have to be ready for that"", Gusek said Meanwhile, upstream independent Continental Resources founder and chairman Harold Hamm — who helped kick-start the shale boom by combining horizontal drilling with fracking in North Dakota's Bakken basin to tap previously hard-to-access reserves — warned that the current bout of oil price weakness could continue as oversupply is likely to remain for some time yet. ""Should people expect lower for longer at this point, with prices where they're at? Probably,"" Hamm said. Hamm still sees potential for US crude output to increase by a further 1.5mn-2mn b/d before levelling off — even though the talk in industry circles is that shale is reaching a peak . Continental has recently expanded overseas and is looking at developing resources in Turkey, but the bulk of the company's spending will remain in the Lower 48 US onshore, Hamm said. The Bakken has been written off many times in the past, but the play keeps coming back. ""It just doesn't go away,"" Hamm said. ""We still find out every day new stuff that works really well."" A major campaigner for Trump, Hamm said he plans to source as much of the oil field equipment needed for his company from domestic suppliers in future, after being shocked to discover how much comes from overseas. ""We're going to buy as much as we can right here in the US. We think it's the right thing to do."" Peak or plateau? Leading operators from Diamondback Energy to Occidental Petroleum have recently talked about US crude output peaking sooner than previously expected, with shale remaining under pressure as prices hover below the $65/bl average breakeven price flagged by executives in a recent Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas shale industry survey as necessary to profitably drill a new well. Diamondback, the largest pure-play producer in the Permian, warned in a recent widely circulated letter to shareholders that US output is at a ""tipping point"", with geological headwinds starting to outweigh the benefits from improvements in technology and operational efficiencies. ""I would maybe caveat it just a little bit different and not call it a peak, necessarily, but I think we're in for a period of a plateau,"" Continental chief executive Doug Lawler told the conference. But he agreed that the industry's ability to offset the impact of lower oil prices is limited. ""There's nothing that we can use in the industry to absorb a $10/bl drop in price from a technology standpoint,"" Lawler said. ""There are no capital efficiencies that can be captured that make up $10/bl."" Still, recent market volatility might not be enough to deter investors that have gradually returned to the sector as returns have improved. The fear of missing out has brought back a growing number of investor groups — from pension funds to endowments — and that is unlikely to change for as long as returns are forthcoming — with the exception of funds modelled along environmental, social and governance investing. ""Most of our investors don't worry about short-term volatility,"" Pearl Energy Investments founder and managing partner Billy Quinn said. ""They rely on us to make good investment decisions through volatile cycles."" The industry is on a much firmer footing these days, having learned the hard way about the pitfalls of spending beyond its means, which resulted in multiple bankruptcies in previous downturns. Gone are the days when shale reinvestment rates exceeded 100pc as producers sought to boost output at any cost. Shareholder distributions are now the priority. ""It's just a much healthier industry than it once was,"" Houston-based EIV Resources' partner and chief executive, Claire Harvey, said. Others spoke about how a sector that has suffered the ups and downs of past downturns has learned over time to prepare for the leaner times. This has meant targeting top-quality acreage, ditching assets with high breakeven prices and using the latest technology to maximise returns. ""Necessity is the mother of invention,"" Denver-based independent SM Energy chief executive Herb Vogel said. SM Energy operates in west Texas' Midland basin, south Texas' Maverick basin and the Uinta basin of northeast Utah. ""Low price cycles make us stronger,"" Vogel said.

Texas’s clean energy sector is experiencing unexpected challenges as lawmakers introduce regulations that could hinder the growth of renewable energy projects. The ongoing tussle between fossil fuel interests and clean energy innovations threatens the state’s energy future, despite recent legislation aimed at enhancing grid reliability. While the sector has created thousands of jobs and attracted significant investments, new proposals could impose stricter regulations on wind and solar initiatives. As demand for energy continues to rise, Texas’s energy landscape may see critical shifts driven by political debates and economic implications.

Texas Clean Energy Faces Legislative Challenges Amidst Rising Demand

In Texas, the clean energy sector is facing legislative obstacles even as the demand for renewable energy continues to rise. Lawmakers are now considering regulations that could significantly impact the development of solar and wind power, critical components of the state’s energy landscape.

The Battle for Energy Innovation

Texas has established itself as a leader in the clean energy movement, successfully leveraging its natural resources to bring forth expansive wind and solar projects. Despite this progress, recent actions by state policymakers are introducing complexities that may hinder the growth of renewable energy projects. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages the majority of Texas’s electricity supply, is now in the midst of a conflict between entrenched fossil fuel interests and the advancing clean energy sector. As the state’s need for a reliable power grid becomes increasingly important, the decisions made in this political arena are critical for the economy and environment alike.

Amid these challenges, promising developments are also on the horizon. Legislation aimed at enhancing the reliability of the electric grid has gained traction, requiring utilities to conduct regular inspections and maintenance on their transmission and distribution systems. This change comes after dire events last year when system failures during outages resulted in losses estimated at $2.3 billion for ERCOT customers in 2023 alone.

Economic Implications of Clean Energy

The discussions surrounding energy production methods have significant ramifications for Texas’s economy. Adjustments in legislation now empower the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to better manage and plan new power line developments. As energy demand escalates, the need to address deficiencies in the transmission system has come under scrutiny. The clean energy industry has shown positive growth, contributing 29,000 new jobs and attracting over $14 billion in investments since the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. This growth has particularly benefitted rural areas, where jobs and income from renewable initiatives are vital for local economies.

In addition, advancements in technology, including utility-scale batteries expected to provide a capacity of at least 14 gigawatts by 2025, could revolutionize energy storage solutions. Such innovations can enable the conservation of energy generated during peak production, offering a potential lifeline to approximately 2.8 million households in Texas and enhancing grid stability.

Shifting Political Winds

Not all political leaders are aligned with those advocating against clean energy policies. Some conservative voices have emerged, expressing concerns over their colleagues’ resistance to supporting renewable initiatives. These leaders recognize the critical economic advantages that clean energy projects present. Conversely, new legislative measures proposing tighter regulations on wind and solar installation setbacks are emerging, raising apprehensions about potential overreach that could thwart job growth and elevate electricity costs.

Critics of these measures warn that imposing further restrictions on clean energy sources would undermine Texas’s economic prospects. With the future of job creation and affordable energy pricing at stake, maintaining a supportive environment for renewable energy remains crucial for the state.

The Road Ahead

As the implications of climate change and energy needs evolve, Texas stands at a pivotal juncture. The clean energy movement has highlighted inefficiencies within existing fossil fuel frameworks, leading to ongoing political challenges as the state seeks a balance between varying energy sources.

For communities dependent on wind and solar energy, the current surge in clean energy represents not just a trend but an essential economic support mechanism. The direction Texas takes, whether relying on traditional energy sources or adopting a more expansive approach to renewables, remains uncertain. What is evident is that Texas’s energy future will require strategic actions that prioritize both reliability and innovation.

As Texas navigates these complexities, the effects of legislative decisions could resonate throughout the economy and environment, making it imperative to monitor developments closely.

The IEA World Energy Investment report expects investment into grid and storage to almost triple.","THE surge in green investment in China continues to bolster growth, offsetting the drag from the beleaguered property sector. This pivot is essential to meet global climate targets but it also heightens geopolitical tensions, with headwinds from EV (electric vehicle) consolidation and excess battery capacity looming.

In 2024, green investment once again underpinned Chinese growth, driven by carbon reduction goals, energy security, and a push to lead in green technology. This surge included a record 275 gigawatt (GW) of new solar and 80 GW of wind capacity added, making renewable energy the largest driver of fixed asset investment for the second consecutive year. Investment in water conservation and environmental management also contributed significantly.

Conversely, investment in EV manufacturing moderated, and the contribution from solar and battery manufacturing swung from a strong tailwind to a headwind, reflecting substantial overcapacity.

Peering through the smog

China’s abrupt green pivot since 2023 partly reflects a need to counter the drag from real estate, but it also aligns with the country’s climate targets. As electrification continues at pace, China is likely to have already reached peak emissions or will achieve it very soon, well ahead of its stated 2030 target.

China’s announced “dual control” system for carbon emissions focuses on energy intensity and total emissions, with non-binding targets for absolute emissions until 2030. Details on the targets for its National Determined Contribution related to its Paris Agreement commitments, expected in the coming months, could be unambitious.

Despite this, there is a good chance these objectives will be reached early, as has been the case with China’s renewable agenda. However, emissions reduction will likely remain limited in this decade, as China continues to build coal power plants. The risk of stranded assets and subsidisation of coal power appear to be costs the authorities are willing to pay to guarantee energy security and manage renewable production variability.

China’s industry craves power

China’s electricity consumption and generation capacity surpassed those of the US and the Eurozone combined in 2024, reflecting its energy-intensive manufacturing sector. Industries like semiconductors, aluminium, nickel refining and data centres require vast amounts of electricity. Renewable energy production also demands significant power, with polysilicon needing four times more energy per tonne than aluminium and 150 times more than steel.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that manufacturing green products alone accounts for 16 per cent of total electricity growth.

More broadly, China is witnessing dramatic electrification.

China’s domestic EV adoption has slowed, but long-term electrification of transport will require greater grid capacity as oil powers fewer cars. Rising living standards and temperatures are increasing household electricity use, particularly for air conditioning and electric heating. This suggests solid fundamentals for grid expansion, with potential for exporting excess capacity to neighbouring countries.

Green light, red light

A key question is whether China’s green drive can continue to support growth or turn into a headwind. Investment from EV manufacturing moderated in 2024, and significant consolidation is expected, which could weigh on automotive sector investment over the next few years. Excess capacity in battery manufacturing, which dragged on whole-economy FAI (fixed asset investment) in 2024, may worsen as developed markets reduce reliance on China.

Bloomberg NEF tracks 6.8 TWh (terawatt-hour) of annual battery manufacturing capacity for the end of 2025, with China alone accounting for nearly 5 TWh . Industry reports suggest CATL, the largest Chinese manufacturer, is operating at 60 per cent capacity, with smaller firms at 20 to 30 per cent. Industry standards aimed at culling low-quality capacity will likely amplify consolidation pressures.

The renewable energy rollout must continue to gather pace to support gross domestic product growth in 2025 and beyond. Data to February shows little sign of slowing down, and China may lean more heavily on green investment to counter the trade war with the US. However, China is changing the pricing system for new wind and solar projects from June, moving from fixed prices benchmarked on coal power prices to competitive auctions, which could slow the rollout.

The good news is that investment in grid and ancillary infrastructure could still support growth, even if renewable energy capacity stabilises or eases. China likely needs more ultra-high voltage (+800 kV) power lines to move renewable power from the West to the East, and investments in energy storage, such as solar, battery, and pumped hydro, will be crucial to keep the electricity system operating smoothly.

CarbonBrief noted that storage infrastructure under construction rose to 189 GW (+13 per cent) in 2024, while energy storage was included as an aim for the first time in the government work report presented at the “Two Sessions” .

Unsustainable surge in sustainable investment?

China’s push into green investment in 2023 and 2024 was remarkable. The number of EVs manufactured has almost doubled since 2022 to over 13 million, while surging investment in renewables means that more than half of China’s electricity generation capacity is green. However, the pivot away from real estate and into green investment raises the question of whether China is swapping one unsustainable form of investment for another.

Assessing the time horizons over which different aspects of green investment could support or weigh on growth is complicated. Some aspects of green investment are already dragging on the economy, while others may curtail investment soon. Considering a longer time horizon, the potential for EVs to rise from their current 20 per cent share to a much larger proportion of China’s auto fleet suggests green investment in transportation could still be a significant driver of growth.

We have little visibility on the Chinese Communist Party’s plans for investment in renewable power over the long run. China smashed through its 2030 target of 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity, reaching 1,400 GW in 2024. The latest IEA Renewables 2024 report forecasts 4,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, more than triple its 2023 level. If correct, that would imply the renewable rollout would provide a strong near-term growth boost, as the installation of new capacity could still accelerate.

Our latest modelling work is more cautious, suggesting that such a fast pace of renewable capacity expansion would exceed fundamental demand. Regardless of the timescale and ambitions, the pivot towards renewable energy – which requires a greater amount of capacity to be installed relative to thermal power – suggests substantial expansion is the new norm. This modelling also assumes that coal-fired power capacity may continue to expand modestly over the next five to 10 years.

At some stage, the renewables’ rollout will need to slow, but grid capacity and ancillary infrastructure needs will still have to catch up, providing more long-lasting support to growth. The IEA World Energy Investment report expects investment into grid and storage to almost triple. If correct, green investment should continue to support growth over the coming years.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5cd103310056d57e33462792c8f44c1098487845e882df1e56d963b5086c6e05?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:00.826080

Sales of Tesla vehicles in 32 European countries tumbled 49% to 7,261 in April from 14,228 in the same month the previous year, according to the figures released by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA.

At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.

The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.

The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.

""2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,"" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.

Musk, meanwhile, said last month he would scale back his DOGE work beginning in May in order to spend more time at Tesla. The EV company's first-quarter earnings fell far short of analyst expectations, with revenue tumbling 9% and profit slumping 71%.

The latest European sales figures, which cover the European Union's 27 member countries and five other nations outside the bloc, back up early data from Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark released at the start of this month that had pointed to a sales collapse.

Tesla's aging model lineup

While Tesla has been reeling from protests and boycotts over Musk wading into politics, it also faces other factors including an aging model lineup and intensifying competition from rival electric vehicle brands, particularly from China.

Mr. Trump's trade war has also turned Europeans off buying American brands. In recent days, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, accusing the bloc of being ""very difficult to deal with,"" before agreeing to delay the duties until July.

In one sign that Tesla appears to be losing ground to cut-price Chinese brands, sales at China's SAIC zoomed up 54% in April, according to the ACEA figures. SAIC owns a slew of auto brands including U.K.-based MG, known for its low-cost EV models.

Tesla is also suffering because it had to shut down factories for several weeks this year while upgrading its best selling Model Y sport utility vehicle, pinching supply.

For the first four months of the year, Tesla's European sales fell roughly 39% to 61,320 while the continent's auto market as a while showed little change during the same period, according to the data.

For April, car sales in the EU edged up 1.3% from the previous year, ""showing signs of recovery despite the ongoing unpredictable global economic environment,"" the group said in a press release.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked.

Trump previously pledged to undo what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" referencing the Biden-era goal for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, said the administration's approach may slow the growth of the EV industry.

""It's not going to kill the electric vehicle,"" Higham stressed. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed about 40,000 EVs are on Utah roads. All EV owners in the state must pay an annual registration fee of about $140. The U.S. House passed the massive budget bill last week, moving it to the Senate for consideration.

House lawmakers have proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of the year. Analysts said Tesla, the largest EV automaker, owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, would be affected the most by the loss of the tax credit. Higham projected the proposal to repeal the tax credit could break down party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts.""

According to the Argonne National Laboratory, consumers can save more than $6,000 in lifetime repair and maintenance costs from an EV compared to a gas-fueled vehicle. It is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion on EV tax credit payments in 2024.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

Europe was once at the forefront of next-generation geothermal, especially in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Since then, progress has slowed. Meanwhile, other regions have advanced through public-private coordination, targeted pilot programs, and shared R&D platforms. Europe is still home to some of the most technically advanced labs and projects in the world. There is a need for stronger coordination across actors. A shared set of policy priorities could help unlock action, and speaking with one voice on the global stage would increase Europe’s influence and visibility in this space.

On May 14, Clean Air Task Force convened developers, researchers, and policymakers for a closed-door roundtable on the sidelines of the Global Geothermal Energy Summit in Warsaw. The discussion focused on enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), closed-loop systems (AGS), and superhot rock geothermal, which could unlock high-density electricity and heat far beyond conventional resource zones.

Participants aligned on challenges across permitting, funding, communication, and collaboration. More importantly, they voiced a clear willingness to work together. The energy in the room reflected a shared urgency to connect, coordinate, and act.

Early-stage innovation needs a better launchpad

Developers need real-world sites to test tools, improve methods, and validate performance. Participants pointed to Switzerland’s Grimsel Test Site and Bedretto Underground Laboratory as working models. These sites provide controlled environments to run experiments and generate field data before commercial deployment. Europe should prioritise the creation of more geothermal testbeds. Geothermal testbeds should focus on EGS and AGS in challenging environments and enable collaboration across countries and institutions. Without this infrastructure, many technologies will stall in lab conditions. collaboration across countries and institutions. Without this infrastructure, many technologies will stall in lab conditions.

Responsible permitting must be more consistent

Permitting delays block projects across Europe. But developers in the room did not call for deregulation. They called for consistency and transparency. The EU can help by identifying these successful approaches and building a suggested framework for other countries to adopt. Governments struggling with slow or inconsistent processes could implement these models to reduce bottlenecks without weakening oversight or safeguards.

Knowledge flows are disconnected

Most publicly funded geothermal projects do share data, but often only with funders, or buried in reports that don’t reach broader audiences. The current structure of many public programs does not encourage sector-wide learning or cumulative knowledge-building. As a result, key lessons, technical advancements, and performance data stay siloed.

More consistent and practical reporting requirements, linked to real outcomes, would help ensure that public support benefits more than just the individual project. Creating a shared data repository, backed by a clear structure for responsible disclosure, would accelerate learning curves and de-risk future projects.

Public support needs to match market realities

Many of the funding streams available to next-generation geothermal developers are mismatched with the realities of developing these systems. Requirements such as holding a permit before applying for EU funds lock out earlier-stage innovators. The lack of long-term contracts and risk-sharing mechanisms limits private investment.

Participants made the case for a more deliberate structure around funding: clear segments for early-stage research, pilot projects, and scale-up. Dedicated programs for next-generation geothermal, such as EGS, AGS, and superhot rock, should form a central part of that structure.

The EU’s Action Plan needs to back innovation

EU’s upcoming Geothermal Action Plan, expected in early 2026, is a critical moment. The European Commission must follow through with its release. More importantly, it must clearly back the innovation that will determine whether geothermal can scale beyond traditional zones.

This means directly supporting innovation as a central part of this plan. This includes the development of EGS and AGS, and these systems in >400°C conditions in order to ensure there remains a vision and pathway to lower cost geothermal energy. These approaches expand the geographic scope of geothermal and offer firm, clean power, exactly the profile needed for a decarbonised energy system. If the EU sidelines these technologies in its strategy, it risks locking out one of the few scalable options for clean baseload power.

Central and Eastern Europe is already moving. Poland, for example, adopted a national Multi-Year Program in 2022 to integrate geothermal into 114 existing plants and construct 78 new geothermal wells. The plan targets a total capacity of 290 MW by 2040. Over half the PLN 108.5 million investment is backed by national environmental funds.

Given the growing interest and concrete developments across Member States, EU policy must support this momentum with clear and sustained support for geothermal. Poland’s example demonstrates the increasing interest in this technology, which can accelerate the energy transition. Now is the time for the EU to match this local drive with a policy framework prioritising scalability, innovation, and long-term investment.

Europe has the pieces, now it needs to move as a team

Europe has the talent, technology, and motivation to lead on next-generation geothermal, but coordination is still missing. That can change. This roundtable was a first step toward building a more visible and coordinated community of next-generation geothermal leaders in Europe, one that speaks clearly to governments, funders, and the public about what this technology can deliver and what it needs to scale. CATF will continue working with partners across the region to define clear priorities, make opportunities for collaboration, and help turn potential into deployment.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/14205936/geothermal-hungary-web.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 11:21:48.604673

Tsu Storage Battery Plant is located in Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, in the southwestern part of Japan’s main island, Honshu.
NGK and Toho Gas announced the project in August 2022, as reported by Energy-Storage.news.
Toho Gas’ project was approved during the 2021 financial year (FY2021).
The utility said the system will be 5MW and 8-hour duration (~40MWh) and designed to evaluate the feasibility of sodium-sulfur as an alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage systems (BESS).","The high-temperature battery operates at 300°C using a sulfur anode and sodium cathode, designed to operate with less than 1% capacity degradation per year of operation, even through daily cycling at full depth of discharge.

The latest iteration of the NAS battery system, MODEL L24, was launched in April of last year and announced by NGK and its technology partner, German chemicals company BASF.

At that time, NGK said over 720MW/5,000MWh of sodium-sulfur systems have been deployed across more than 250 locations worldwide since the tech first went onto the market more than 20 years ago.

~6-hour duration Toho Gas project in Mie, Japan

Japanese gas company and utility Toho Gas, which is headquartered in Nagoya, the city where NGK is also headquartered, has just completed a grid-scale NAS battery project.

Tsu Storage Battery Plant is located in Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, in the southwestern part of Japan’s main island, Honshu.

The project has been built at the former site of a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal and features NAS batteries with 11.4MW output and 69.6MWh storage capacity (~6-hour duration at full rated power).

NGK and Toho Gas announced the project in August 2022, as reported by Energy-Storage.news. At the time, Toho Gas said the batteries would charge at off-peak times or times of abundant renewable energy, and discharge during peaks, helping the company adjust the supply and demand of its operations, while also participating in the growing suite of electricity market opportunities energy storage systems are eligible for.

The project also benefited from Japanese government subsidies designed to promote the adoption of energy storage through the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) Agency for Natural Resources and Energy. The central government scheme supports up to 30% of the Capex investment cost for equipment. Toho Gas’ project was approved during the 2021 financial year (FY2021).

Duke Energy selected NAS battery from more than 80 technologies

Duke Energy’s Emerging Technology Assessment (ETA) team selected the NAS technology for pilot deployment after evaluating more than 80 different options, according to a blog post on the US utility company’s website.

The test project will be installed at Duke’s Suwanne River Power Plant in Florida, which has already had numerous upgrades over the years to add natural gas peaking capacity and solar PV generation.

The utility said the system will be 5MW and 8-hour duration (~40MWh) and designed to evaluate the feasibility of sodium-sulfur as an alternative to lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery energy storage systems (BESS).

Duke said attractive aspects of the technology included the abundance and relatively low cost of sodium and sulfur, as well as the NAS battery’s high energy density.

“This pilot will help us study the technology’s performance, efficiency, and interaction with the grid,” Duke Energy’s project originator and execution developer Matt Gilton said.

Gilton added that findings from the project would be shared with organisations including the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toho-Gas-NGK-Mie.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 11:21:53.960871

“We’re no longer talking about the environment,” Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, told the paper.
The Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits were designed to lower pollution and reduce energy costs by bringing more zero-carbon electricity supply onto the U.S. power grid.
This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply.
The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.","The economics of building offshore wind in the U.S., at least during this nascent stage, are “entirely dependent” on tax credits, Marguerite Wells, the executive director of Alliance for Clean Energy New York, told me.

That being said, if the bill gets through the Senate and becomes law, Empire Wind may still be safe. The legislation would significantly narrow the window for projects to qualify for tax credits, requiring them to start construction by the end of this year and be operational by the end of 2028. Equinor, the company behind Empire Wind, maintains that it aims to reach commercial operations as soon as 2027. The four other offshore wind projects that are under construction in the U.S. — Sunrise Wind, also serving New York; Vineyard Wind, serving Massachusetts; Revolution Wind, serving Rhode Island and Connecticut; and Dominion Energy’s project in Virginia — are also expected to be completed before the cutoff.

Together, the five wind farms are expected to generate enough power for roughly 2.5 million homes and avoid more than 9 million tons of carbon emissions each year — similar to shutting down 23 natural gas-fired power plants.

Still, this would represent just a small fraction of the carbon-free energy eastern states are counting on offshore wind to provide. New York, for example, has a statutory goal of getting at least 9 gigawatts of power from the industry. Once Empire and Sunrise are completed, it will have just 1.7 gigawatts.

If the proposed changes to the tax credits are enacted, these five projects may be the last built in the U.S.

That’s not the case for solar farms or onshore wind, Oliver Metcalfe, head of wind research at BloombergNEF told me. They can still compete with fossil fuel generation — especially in the windiest and sunniest areas — without tax credits. That’s especially true in today’s environment of rising demand for power, since these projects have the additional benefit of being quick to build. The downside of losing the tax credits is, of course, that the power will cost marginally more than it otherwise would have.

For offshore wind farms to pencil out, however, states would have to pay a much higher price for the energy they produce. The tax credits knock off about a quarter of the price, Metcalfe said; without them, buyers will be back on the hook. “It’s likely that some either wouldn’t be willing to do that, or would dramatically decrease their ambition around the technology given the potential impacts it could have on ratepayers.”

Part of the reason offshore wind is so expensive is that the industry is still new in the U.S. We lack the supply chains, infrastructure, and experienced workforce built up over time in countries like China and the U.K. that have been able to bring costs down. That’s likely not going to change by the time these five projects are built, as they are all relying on European supply chains.

The Inflation Reduction Act spurred domestic manufacturers to begin developing supply chains to serve the next wave of projects, Wells told me. It gave renewable energy projects a 10-year runway to start construction to be eligible for the tax credits. “It was a long enough time window for companies to really invest, not just in the individual generation projects, but also manufacturing, supply chain, and labor chain,” she said.

Due to Trump’s attacks on the industry, the next wave of projects may not materialize, and those budding supply chains could go bust.

Trump put a freeze on offshore wind permitting and leasing on his first day in office, a move that 17 states are now challenging in court. A handful of projects are already fully permitted, but due to uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs — and now, around whether they’ll have access to the tax credits — they’re at a standstill.

“No one’s willing to back a new offshore wind project in today’s environment because there’s so much uncertainty around the future business case, the future subsidies, the future cost of equipment,” Metcalfe said.

That’s going to make the economics of an already financially unsteady industry even more difficult. “Especially given the early stage of the direct air capture industry, transferability is really key,” Giana Amador, the executive director of an industry group called the Carbon Removal Alliance, told me. “Without transferability, most DAC companies won’t be able to fully capitalize upon 45Q — which, of course, threatens the viability of these projects.”

We’re not talking about just a few projects, either. We’re talking about the vast majority, Jessie Stolark, the executive director of another industry group, the Carbon Capture Coalition, told me. “The initial reaction is that this is really bad, and would actually cut off at the knees the utility of the 45Q tax credit,” Stolark said. Out of over 270 carbon capture projects announced as of today, Stolark estimates that fewer than 10 will be able to begin construction in the two years before transferability ends.

The alternative to easily transferable tax credits is a type of partnership between a project developer and a tax equity investor such as a bank. In this arrangement, investors give project developers cash in exchange for an equity stake in their project and their tax credit benefits. Deals like this are common in the renewable energy industry, but because they’re legally complicated and expensive, they’re not really viable for companies that aren’t bringing in a lot of revenue.

Because carbon capture is a much younger, and thus riskier technology than renewables, “tax equity markets typically require returns of 30% or greater from carbon capture and direct air capture project developers,” Stolark told me. That’s a much higher rate than tax equity partners typically require for wind or solar projects. “That out of the gate significantly diminishes the tax credit's value.” Taken together with inflation and high interest rates, all this means that “far fewer projects will proceed to construction,” Stolark said.

One DAC company I spoke with, Bay Area-based Noya, said that now that transferability is out, it has been exploring the possibility of forming tax equity partnerships. “We’ve definitely talked to banks that might be interested in getting involved in these kinds of things sooner than they would have otherwise gotten involved, due to the strategic nature of being partnered with companies that are growing fast,” Josh Santos, Noya’s CEO, told me.

It would certainly be a surprise to see banks — which are generally quite risk averse — lining up behind these kinds of new and unproven technologies, especially given that carbon capture doesn’t have much of a natural market. While CO2 can be used for some limited industrial purposes — beverage carbonation, sustainable fuels, low-carbon concrete — the only market for true carbon dioxide removal is the voluntary market, in which companies, governments, or individuals offset their own emissions by paying companies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. So if carbon capture is going to become a thriving, lucrative industry, it’s likely going to be heavily dependent on future government incentives, mandates, or purchasing commitments. And that doesn’t seem likely to happen in the U.S. anytime soon.

Noya, which is attempting to deploy its electrically-powered, modular direct air capture units beginning in 2027, is still planning on building domestically, though. As Santos told me, he’s eyeing California and Texas as promising sites for the company’s first projects. And while he said that the repeal of transferability will certainly “make things more complicated,” it is not enough of a setback for the company to look abroad.

“45Q is a big part of why we are focused on the U.S. mainly as our deployment site,” Santos explained. “We’ve looked at places like Iceland and the Middle East and Africa for potential deployment locations, and the tradeoff of losing 45Q in exchange for a cheaper something has to be significant enough for that to make sense,” he told me — something like more cost efficient electricity, permitting or installation costs. Preserving 45Q, he told me, means Noya’s long-term project economics are still “great for what we’re trying to build.”

But if companies can’t weather the short-term headwinds, they’ll never be able to reach the level of scale and profitability that would allow them to leverage the benefits of the 45Q credits directly. For many DAC companies such as Climeworks, which built the industry’s largest facility in Iceland, Amador and Stolark said that the domestic policy environment is causing hesitation around expanding in the U.S.

“We are very much at risk of losing our US leadership position in the industry,” Stolark told me. Meanwhile, she said that Canada, China, and the EU are developing policies that are making them increasingly attractive places to build.

As Amador put it, “I think no matter what these projects will be built, it’s just a question of whether the United States is the most favorable place for them to be deployed.”

On Thursday, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives passed their megabill — which is dubbed, for now, the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — through the reconciliation process. They did so happily. But much like Obama’s sequestration, this bill is the wrong one for the wrong moment. It would add $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years. The bill’s next stop is the Senate, where it could change significantly. But if this bill is enacted, it will jack up America’s energy and environmental risks — for relatively little benefit.

It has become somewhat passé for advocates to talk about climate change, as The New York Times observed this week. “We’re no longer talking about the environment,” Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, told the paper. “We’re talking dollars and cents.”

Maybe that’s because saying that something “is bad for the climate” only makes it a more appealing target for national Republicans at the moment, who are still reveling in the frisson of their post-Trump victory. But one day the environment will matter again to Americans — and this bill would, in fact, hurt the environment. It will mark a new chapter in American politics: Once, this country had a comprehensive climate law on the books. Then Trump and Republicans junked it.

The Republican megabill will make climate change worse. Within a year or two, the U.S. will be pumping out half a gigaton more carbon pollution per year than it would in a world where the IRA remains on the books, according to energy modelers at Princeton University. Within a decade, it will raise American carbon pollution by a gigaton each year. That is a significant increase. For comparison, the United States is responsible for about 5.2 gigatons of greenhouse gas pollution each year. No matter what happens, American emissions are likely to fall somewhat between now and 2035 — but, still, we are talking about adding at least an extra year’s worth of emissions over the next decade. (Full disclosure: I co-host a podcast, Shift Key, with Jesse Jenkins, the lead author of that Princeton study.)

What does America get for this increase in air pollution? After all, it’s possible to imagine situations where such a surge could bring economic benefits. In this case, though, we don’t get very much at all. Repealing the tax credits will slash $1 trillion from GDP over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan group Energy Innovation. Texas will be particularly hard hit — it could lose up to $100 billion in energy investment. Across the country, household energy costs will rise 2% to 7% by 2035, on top of any normal market-driven volatility, according to the energy research firm the Rhodium Group. The country will become more reliant on foreign oil imports, yet domestic oil production will budge up by less than 1%.

In other words, in exchange for more pollution, Americans will get less economic growth but higher energy costs. The country’s capital stock will be smaller than it would be otherwise, and Americans will work longer hours, according to the Tax Foundation.

But this numbers-driven approach actually understates the risk of repealing the IRA’s tax credits. The House megabill raises two big risks to the economy, as I see it — risks that are moresignificant than the result of any one energy or economic model.

The first is that this bill — its policy changes and its fiscal impact — will represent a double hit to the capacity of America’s energy system. The Inflation Reduction Act’s energy tax credits were designed to lower pollution and reduce energy costs by bringing more zero-carbon electricity supply onto the U.S. power grid. The law didn’t discriminate about what kind of energy it encouraged — it could be solar, geothermal, or nuclear — as long as it met certain emissions thresholds.

This turned out to be an accidentally well-timed intervention in the U.S. energy supply. The advent of artificial intelligence and a spurt of factory building has meant that, in the past few years, U.S. electricity demand has begun to rise for the first time since the 1990s. At the same time, the country’s ability to build new natural gas plants has come under increasing strain. The IRA’s energy tax credits have helped make this situation slightly less harrowing by providing more incentives to boost electricity supply.

Republicans are now trying to remove these tax bonuses in order to finance tax cuts for high-earning households. But removing the IRA alone won’t pay for the tax credits, so they will also have to borrow trillions of dollars. This is already straining bond markets, driving up interest rates for Americans. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury auction earlier this week saw weak demand for $16 billion in bonds, driving stocks and the dollar down while spiking treasury yields.

Higher interest rates will make it more expensive to build any kind of new power plant. At a moment of maximum stress on the grid, the U.S. is going to pull away tax bonuses for new electricity supply and make it more expensive to do any kind of investment in the power system. This will hit wind, solar, and batteries hard; because renewables don’t have to pay for fuel, their cost variability is largely driven by financing. But higher interest rates will also make it harder to build new natural gas plants. Trump’s trade barriers and tariff chaos will further drive up the cost of new energy investment.

Republicans aren’t totally oblivious to this hazard. The House Natural Resource Committee’s permitting reform proposal could reduce some costs of new energy development and encourage greater power capacity — assuming, that is, that the proposal survives the Senate’s byzantine reconciliation rules. But even then, significant risk exists for runaway energy cost chaos. Over the next three years, America’s liquified natural gas export capacity is set to more than double. Trump officials have assumed that America will simply be able to drill for more natural gas to offset a rise in exports, but what if higher interest rates and tariff charges forbid a rise in capacity? A power price shock is not off the table.

So that’s risk No. 1. The second risk is arguably of greater strategic import. As part of their megabill, House Republicans have stripped virtually every demand-side subsidy for electric vehicles from the bill, including a $7,500 tax credit for personal EV purchases. At the same time, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration have gutted state and federal rules meant to encourage electric vehicle sales.

Republicans have kept, for now, some of the supply-side subsidies for manufacturing EVs and batteries. But without the paired demand-side incentives, American EV sales will fall. (The Princeton energy team projects an up to 40% decline in EV sales nationwide.) This will reduce the economic rationale for much of the current buildout in electric vehicle manufacturing and capacity happening across the country — it could potentially put every new EV and battery factory meant to come online after this year out of the money.

This will weaken the country’s economic competitiveness. Batteries are a strategic energy technology, and they will undergird many of the most important general and military technologies of the next several decades. (If you can make an EV, you can make an autonomous drone.) The Trump administration has realized that the United States and its allies need a durable mineral supply chain that can at least parallel China’s. But they seem unwilling to help any of the industries that will actually usethose minerals.

Does this mean that Republicans will kill America’s electric vehicle industry? Not necessarily. But they will dent its growth, strength, and expansion. They will make it weaker and more vulnerable to external interference. And they will increase the risks that the United States simply gives up on ever understanding battery technology and doubles down on internal combustion vehicles — a technology that, like coal-powered naval ships, is destined to lose.

It is, in other words, risky. But that is par for the course for this bill. It is risky to make the power grid so exposed to natural gas price volatility. It is risky to jack up the federal deficit during peacetime for so little gain. It is risky to cede so much demand for U.S.-sourced critical minerals. It is risky to raise interest rates in an era of higher trade barriers, uncertain supply shocks, and geopolitical instability.

This is what worries me most about the Republican megabill: It takes America’s flawed but fixable energy policy and replaces it with, well, a longshot parlay bet that nothing particularly bad will happen anytime soon. Will the Senate take such a bet? Now we find out.

The policy seeks to foster innovation and skill development while promoting battery recycling and reuse to support a circular economy.

The draft policy outlines, an ‘Operational Guidelines for Supply Side Incentives’ would be issued by the Industries Department. The State encourages the establishment of EV battery recycling hubs in strategic locations, prioritizing proximity to battery manufacturing hubs and EV charging infrastructure. Potential locations for these hubs may include the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Nagpur, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, etc. Through this investment, the state aims to ensure widespread access to charging infrastructure to enable seamless EV operations across both urban and rural areas. Additionally, to promote research and development, A dedicated corpus of Rupees 15 crore will be created under the “CM EV R&D Grant” initiative to fund the R&D activities.

The policy targets EV penetration for:

30% of all new vehicle registrations,

15% of new e-bus registrations, and

10% of new agricultural vehicles, including tractors and combine harvesters.

It also proposes extending EV adoption across six major urban agglomerations—Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, and Amravati. The policy will be applicable to 50% of all new vehicle purchases, and 50% of fleet operators and aggregators will be eligible for EV incentives.

Charging Infrastructure Push

To promote EV usage, the state will install EV charging facilities at 25 km intervals along state and national highways. It will also mandate at least one charging station in the parking area of every government office.

To ensure large-scale, high-power charging availability, Maharashtra plans to establish a Viability Gap Funding (VGF) framework to support the installation of DC fast charging stations.

Urban Infrastructure Guidelines

The draft policy proposes regulatory measures to ensure building readiness for EV charging:

The Urban Development Department (UDD) may amend the Development Control Regulations (DCR) to incorporate these provisions.

Upon adoption, No Objection Certificates (NOCs) will be granted to facilities meeting safety norms and technical standards.

Key requirements include:

a. All new residential buildings must be designed to ensure that 100% of parking spaces are EV charging-ready.

b. All new commercial buildings must allocate at least 50% of total parking spaces for EV charging, including wiring and installation provisions.

c. Existing commercial buildings with shared parking must have 20% of total spaces equipped with operational EV charging stations.

d. Every new residential building must provide at least one dedicated community charging point.

e. Existing housing societies must allocate shared EV charging spaces, subject to approval by at least 50% of members, with society management ensuring safety and operational compliance.",https://img.saurenergy.com/2020/12/ev-electric-vehicle.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:39.223184

An Historic Opportunity For Clean Tech Europe’s deliberative policymaking offers something rare in today’s climate: predictability.
At the same time, behind the smokescreen of U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures lies an unexpected upside.
If the moment is seized, today's fragmentation could catalyze a more resilient, decentralized clean tech economy.","Within months of each other, both Donald Trump and Ursula von der Leyen began their second terms as President of the United States and President of the European Commission, respectively. As they embark on new political chapters, their economic divergence is casting a long shadow over the future of clean tech.

Under President Trump’s renewed leadership, the U.S. has pivoted away from climate action, turning back to oil and gas. Meanwhile, nearly every link in the international supply chain is now tangled in tariffs, prompting swift retaliatory measures from Canada and China. Once-stable trade relationships are now marked by uncertainty and geopolitical tension.

Still, the outlook for technology development remains bright. The global economy is growing more diversified, perhaps because, and not despite, different regions pursuing divergent approaches to prosperity. The U.S. is doubling down on access to critical minerals and spearheading AI innovation; the EU remains a beacon of climate leadership; China continues its trajectory of unprecedented levels of renewable buildout and manufacturing capacities; and emerging economies across Africa and South America are asserting their place in the global value chain.

Despite rising tensions, each region is vying for leadership in the technologies that will define the next economic and industrial era – hinting that behind the tariffs, there may lie a hidden opportunity for clean tech to scale, compete, and thrive.

Climate Action In Disguise?

The U.S. trade conflict reflects a high-risk strategy to reshape economic terms in the region’s favor. While criticizing clean tech, the Trump Administration has actively championed investment in Artificial Intelligence.

Silicon Valley Bank recently "">reported that 40% of U.S. venture capital in 2024 was directed toward AI, up from just 10% in 2021, a trend expected to continue, with Trump attracting massive AI investments from all over the world.

Often dismissed in climate circles, AI actually holds massive potential for climate mitigation through efficiency gains across sectors. In this sense, attracting AI infrastructure investment can be seen as climate action in disguise.

Similarly, Trump's negotiation with President Zelenskyy, while controversial, led to the U.S.-Ukraine Minerals Deal, a strategic win in diversifying upstream supply chains for technology components currently dominated by China. Despite the optics, this too is a climate-relevant outcome.

However, such wins exist within a broader context of economic fragility.

The Limit Of Blunt Instruments

Originally designed to protect nascent industries, tariffs without complementary tools such as innovation funding, workforce development, and infrastructure investment often do more harm than good.

So, while it is true that the U.S., similar to the EU, is too dependent on imports, the same can be said for exports. For example, in 2024, China supplied 70 percent of all lithium-ion batteries consumed in the U.S. On the flipside, major U.S. states like Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, and Michigan each export over $30 billion annually to Chinese, Canadian, and EU markets. These states are now on the frontlines of potential reciprocal tariffs.

Still, Trump's tariff strategy, albeit blunt, does have a goal: to reignite domestic industries like steel and auto manufacturing. But without a long-term plan for sustainable growth, the policy risks turning inward at a moment when global cooperation is essential.

The contrast with Biden's approach is stark. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) showcased how policy can attract investors and manufacturers while being coupled with targeted tariffs and support mechanisms like the CHIPS Act. Between Q3 2022 and Q1 2025, a total of 380 clean technology manufacturing facilities were announced, nearly half of which were operational as of March 31 2025. This represents a five-fold increase in investments in clean manufacturing, from $2.5 billion in Q3 2022 to $14 billion in Q1 2025.

Yet, due to the Trump Administration’s funding freeze, combined with its approach to tariffs, a total of $6.9 billion of investments were cancelled – the highest value of quarterly cancellations on record. What’s more, the new budget bill which passed the House of Representatives, could effectively halt the US clean energy manufacturing boom.

The irony here should not be overlooked. Of the $289 billion invested in the clean tech manufacturing facilities, 77% went to Republican led districts. Thus, they have become the biggest beneficiaries of clean energy investment. And since President Trump is well known for being a dealmaker, renewable energy – with its falling costs and growing strategic importance – may well turn out to be the best deal on offer.

A Model For Stability Amid Volatility

While U.S. policy undergoes significant overhaul, the EU has spent decades preparing for a sustainable economic transition. That preparation has sometimes been a challenge for industry, but it has also laid solid groundwork. Decarbonization targets are binding. Renewable energy deployment is accelerating. Emissions are priced through the ETS. And carbon leakage is being addressed via the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Now, the EU is aligning trade and climate goals, using tools like carbon pricing to create a level playing field without isolating itself.

For U.S.-based investors and innovators navigating political unpredictability at home, Europe increasingly stands out as a stable, rules-based market with long-term industrial clarity.

An Historic Opportunity For Clean Tech

Europe’s deliberative policymaking offers something rare in today’s climate: predictability. Combined with a cooperative stance toward China, the U.S., and emerging blocs like Mercosur and the African Union, the EU remains a pragmatic and reliable partner.

At the same time, behind the smokescreen of U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures lies an unexpected upside. In the race to reshape supply chains, secure resources, and dominate future-defining technologies, climate progress may emerge not despite geopolitical tensions, but because of them.

If the moment is seized, today's fragmentation could catalyze a more resilient, decentralized clean tech economy. One built not on ideology, but on common interests, cooperation, and global interdependence.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68357d29bdcab7f5419bf760/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-27 09:05:23.140175

Patty Murray, D-Wash., faced off with Energy Secretary Chris Wright about the Hanford budget.

The hearing with the new energy secretary was called by the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday to discuss the Trump administration’s fiscal 2026 budget request for the Department of Energy.

But Murray, told Wright that the energy department’s Office of Environmental Management had not released money for work under the current fiscal 2025 budget that Congress appropriated.

On March 15, President Trump signed the fiscal 2025 budget resolution for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2024, with a spending plan required by law within 45 days, Murray reminded Wright.

But DOE had not yet given that plan to Congress, which needs to know where the money is being spent, Murray said.

“Hanford site is on the brink of having to lay off subcontractors and restart an entire procurement process on an important project because they are being directed now to hold off on implementing projects at FY’25 spend levels,” she said at the hearing.

Murray is the vice chairperson of the Senate Appropriations Committing and the ranking member of the subcommittee holding the hearing.

Funds for Hanford waste disposal

DOE responded the next day by releasing money for the Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility at Hanford, which had subcontract work that was reportedly most immediately at risk.

The lined landfill in the center of Hanford has been used since 1996 to dispose of more than 19 million tons of waste from environmental cleanup at the nuclear reservation.

It accepts low level radioactive waste and hazardous chemical waste, that includes contaminated soil, debris from demolished buildings and debris from burial grounds that do not meet modern environmental standards.

Waste is disposed of in cells, which are added as needed.

This summer, work is planned to start on adding an 11th cell, called a super cell because it is twice the size of the landfill’s first eight cells.

It will be 2,000 feet long and 1,000 feet wide and hold about 2.8 million cubic yards of waste, providing disposal capacity to allow environmental cleanup to continue.

While money was released for the ERDF subcontract, Murray indicated during the hearing that it was not the only Hanford subcontract at risk due to money appropriated by Congress for the current year not released.

DOE provided no information last week to the Tri-City Herald on subcontracts potentially at risk.

Flat Hanford budget inadequate

For the fiscal 2026 DOE budget, DOE has released only limited information

Hanford is called out in the budget as the only cleanup site that the Trump administration proposes giving steady funding, while 13 other DOE sites and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico are targeted for cuts totaling $389 million.

A flat budget for Hanford “has serious repercussions,” Murray told Wright.

In January, DOE and the Washington state Department of Ecology finalized an agreement on treating tank waste after nearly four years of negotiations.

But flat funding means the only way to meet deadlines in the new plan for preparing and treating high level radioactive waste for disposal would be to pull money from other Hanford cleanup priorities, Murray said.

That “would have ripple effects for workers carrying out critical projects across the site and ultimately would delay remediation along the Columbia River,” Murray said. “That is unacceptable. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.”

Long-term plans for Hanford cleanup outlined in the 2025 Hanford Lifecycle Scope, Schedule and Cost Report call for increasing annual spending at Hanford by billions of dollars to finish most remaining environmental cleanup as early as 2085 at a cost ranging from $364 billion to $589 billion.

Wright criticizes ‘political science’

Other DOE programs that impact research at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory would have deep cuts under the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget, Murray said.

“Your budget slashes $1.1 billion from the Office of Science,” Murray said to Wright. “Who is telling you that we should cede ground to China in the race for innovation and lay off scientists at our national labs?”

That spending reduction will undermine research projects, including in areas that are key for the national lab in Richland, for artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy, she said.

But Wright responded that the $1.1 billion cut would not impact important research, including in fundamental basic science, fusion and quantum computing.

“The problem is the labs drifted into things that are not fundamental basic science — that are political science,” he said.

He named “a crazy range of things on climate change” as an example.

Sen. Murray says calls not returned

Murray called out Wright in the hearing for not responding to Congressional questions on staffing and other issues and not spending money as directed in budgets approved by Congress.

At a House subcommittee hearing May 7 Wright said he received too many requests for information and briefings from Congress to have time to respond. But he said he would be happy to take phone calls from Congress.

But Murray said not only was she not getting written responses, but he has not been returning her calls.

It took a month and a half for her to get a call scheduled, and the seven letters she and colleagues have sent him over the past several months requesting information were ignored until the day before the Senate subcommittee hearing, she said.

Wright said at the House subcommittee hearing that less than a thousand workers had left DOE since he became energy secretary.

That was untrue, Murray said.

“We know over 3,500 DOE employees have taken the so-called buyout that you offered and we know you fired 500 more,” she said.

She also pressed him on a statement that no contracts have been canceled “when you have plainly canceled electric vehicle and low-income energy assistant grants in Colorado,” she said.

“And it is false for you to say there are no unpaid invoices, when we have heard from organizations still waiting on payments, including hydrogen hubs, which have unpaid invoices,” Murray said.",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/bfq9h8/picture306771886/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/72e63f57-a69e-45ed-b19c-827c35b97745,N,,2025-05-27 10:10:46.240220

Latin America will now not have any new coal projects coming up. This development comes after Brazil and Honduras scrapped their plans of opening two new coal plants this year, according to a report by Global Energy Monitor.

Last week, Honduras announced that it was joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a coalition of governments and others committed to transitioning away from coal, signalling an intent to not invest in coal anymore.

In other words, the country’s last coal plant proposal — the 0.1 GW Puente Alto Energy power station — will be shelved. According to GEM, there hasn’t been any development at Brazil’s last active coal plant proposal — the 0.6 GW Pedra Altas power station — since the licensing work completed in 2023. This can also be considered as shelved.

GEM’s data points that the scrapping of these two coal plants means that there has been an overall collapse of 18 plants totaling 7.3 GW of capacity proposed in 2015.

More importantly, Latin America now seems to follow UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres’s 2019 call for “no new coal,” which calls for the cancelling of all unabated coal proposals not already under construction.

All eyes on Brazil

Even though Brazil hasn’t proposed any new coal plants, it also hasn’t joined the PPCA, therefore its stance on this matter is still hanging in the balance. If it does join the PPCA, it would be a clear-cut signal that it will not build any new coal plants.

According to GEM’s report, another worrying phenomenon is that the coal-generated power in Brazil is heavily subsidised. Just two coal plants received over R$5 billion (Brazilian real) between 2020 to 2024, and these costs are ultimately borne by the Brazilian people.

GEM’s report also found that there are also no new coal plants proposed in Brazil’s national energy auctions this year, with a decrease in coal power generation projected through 2034 in the country’s most recent 10-year energy plan.

“It is crucial for Brazil to formally join the PPCA, especially amid intense pressure from Congress advocating for coal and gas subsidies to be extended until 2050. As this year’s COP host, we cannot miss the opportunity to officially commit to no new coal,” said Juliano Bueno de Araujo, presiding director at Arayara.

Latin America following Paris Agreement guidelines

According to the report, the Latin America region is close to achieving the 1.5°C target of the Paris Climate Agreement, if it stays on course. Meeting the Agreement goals requires phasing out unabated coal power globally by 2040, following the IEA’s Net Zero scenario.

If one looks at planned retirements and phaseout commitments, over 60% or 10 GW of the region’s 16.3 GW of operating coal power capacity is scheduled to come offline by 2040, found the report.

The only anomaly is Argentina’s Río Turbio power station, the report noted. The lone coal plant is still under construction. The project is not only long-delayed, but also faces technical difficulties, cost overruns, and allegations of corruption, according to the report.

“Honduras is signaling a decisive shift away from coal. The country is an example for others in Latin America that a coal-free future is possible. The baton is now being passed to Brazil. Brazil is in a prime position to lead the charge in the global coal-to-clean energy transition – and help keep the Paris Climate Agreement on track,” said Christine Shearer, project manager at Global Energy Monitor.

Lamb and Harper responded to the bill by issuing the following statement:

“If we are serious about an America-first energy strategy, then we need serious investments in our energy future from both the private and the public sectors. This legislation signals a retreat from that America-first strategy, pulling back critical public sector energy investments at a time when our nation is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand. The real casualties of this legislation will be the Pennsylvania workers, businesses, and consumers who are ready to lead and benefit from a more reliable, more affordable, and cleaner energy system.

“Here in Pennsylvania, the impact of this legislation cannot be overstated. Billions of dollars in private sector investment in Pennsylvania’s two regional hydrogen hub projects are now at risk, along with the tens of thousands of good paying jobs the hubs are estimated to create, as a result of the repeal of the hydrogen tax credit. Efforts to reinvigorate nuclear power in the state – including restarting the former Three Mile Island Unit 2 – could be snuffed out, because of the proposed repeal of the nuclear production tax credit and the elimination of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31.0%, respectively.
Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables in March alone reached a new record and provided almost one-third (31.9%) of total U.S. electrical generation.","The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reveals that the mix of renewable energy sources produced over one-quarter of the nation’s electrical generation in the first three months of 2025 and provided nearly one-third of total U.S. electrical generation in March specifically.

Utility-scale solar expanded by 43.9% while estimated small-scale/rooftop solar PV increased by 11.1% during the first quarter of 2025 compared to same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by over one-third (33.7%) and was almost 6.8% of total U.S. electrical generation for January through March — up from 5.3% a year earlier. This means solar-generated electricity surpassed the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.7%).

Moreover, in March alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar increased by 45.6% while that from small-scale systems rose by 13.0%. Combined, they provided 9.1% of the nation’s electrical output during the month. This is based on a review of the data by the SUN DAY Campaign.

Wind also got off to a strong start in 2025, producing 9.5% more electricity in the first three months of 2025 than the year before. That output was nearly one-eighth (12.2%) of total U.S. electrical generation and more than double that produced by the nation’s hydropower plants. In March alone, wind-generated electricity increased by 11.1% and provided over one-seventh (14.8%) of the nation’s electricity supply.

In the first quarter of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided nearly one-fifth (19.0%) of the U.S. total, up from 17.0% during the first three months of 2024. In just the month of March, solar plus wind accounted for almost one-fourth (23.9%) of U.S. electrical output.

During the first three months of this year, the combination of wind and solar provided 6.8% more electricity than did coal and 6.0% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants. In March alone, the gap increased significantly when solar + wind outproduced coal and nuclear power by 66.5% and 31.0%, respectively.

The mix of all renewables produced 10.5% more electricity in Q1 than they did a year ago (12.5% more in March alone) and provided over one-quarter (26.1%) of total U.S. electricity production compared to 24.8% one year earlier. Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables in March alone reached a new record and provided almost one-third (31.9%) of total U.S. electrical generation. Moreover, for the first time, it came close to that of natural gas (34.8%) whose electrical output dropped by 8.9%.

The mix of renewables has strengthened its position as the second largest source of electrical generation, behind only natural gas — with the gap closing rapidly.

“Renewable energy sources, led by solar and wind, are clearly outpacing fossil fuels and nuclear power,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong. “It therefore defies logic that the Trump Administration and the Republican Congress would be making efforts to curtail that growth in favor of dirtier and more expensive technologies.”

(NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced today that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), a leader in nuclear operation and construction. The agreement outlines plans to collaborate on the development and global deployment of Oklo’s advanced nuclear technology.

Under the MOU, KHNP and Oklo intend to explore opportunities to jointly advance the standard design development and verification of Oklo’s planned Aurora powerhouse. The parties also plan to cooperate on early-stage project development efforts, including manufacturability assessments and planning of major equipment, supply chain development for balance of plant systems, and constructability assessments and planning.

Oklo plans to deploy its 75 MWe Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory site and is currently advancing through the licensing process. The company is engaged with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in a Pre-Application Readiness Assessment and intends to submit a formal Combined License Application (COLA) later this year. Oklo also plans to file follow-on applications to support its growing order pipeline, which exceeds 14 GW. Unlike the traditional approach, which requires separate construction and operating licenses, the COLA allows both to be granted simultaneously, streamlining the overall licensing process.

“We’ve recently completed site characterization borehole drilling for our first commercial powerhouse and are preparing for construction, with commercialization as a top priority,” said Jacob DeWitte, Co-Founder and CEO of Oklo. “Partnering with KHNP, one of the most accomplished nuclear builders in the world, who have been building nuclear power plants continuously since 1971, offers meaningful opportunities to align on key execution factors such as manufacturability, constructability, and supply chain development. Their experience in delivering projects at scale can complement our efforts and help us move more efficiently toward commercialization and the ability to build future powerhouses faster.”

KHNP CEO Whang Ju-ho stated, “KHNP is focusing on developing its innovative domestic advanced nuclear technology, the i-SMR, to achieve world-class competitiveness. In addition to enhancing safety, successful entry into the advanced nuclear market requires cooperation with leading technology firms. By combining the strengths of KHNP and Oklo, we expect to create strong synergy in the design, construction, and operation of advanced nuclear technology.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale; establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes; and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel material from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

The Chesapeake Bay Journal

As Crisfield Mayor Darlene Taylor sees it, the low-lying Maryland town has no future unless it can hold back rising water. Computer models suggest that the adjacent Chesapeake Bay could get high enough by 2050 to trigger daily floods that are deep enough to stall cars on roads.

Hope arrived in the form of a federal grant program created during the first Trump administration under the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program helped rural communities like hers to invest in massive projects to fight disaster threats, ranging from wildfires to floods.

Crisfield officially got word from FEMA last July that it had secured $36 million from the program to launch the first phase of its massive flood-protection initiative. “Everything had lined up and everything was in place for this to be a highly successful project,” Taylor said.

A lot has changed since then. Trump returned to office in January, vowing to drastically shrink the size of the federal government. In a terse April 4 press statement, FEMA announced it was pulling the plug on the disaster-preparedness funding, not just for Crisfield but for all applicants and grantees, calling it “wasteful and ineffective,” though without citing evidence to support those claims.

The administration announced that any undistributed funds from the program’s inaugural year, 2020, through 2023 would be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund or the U.S. Treasury. The agency also canceled the 2024 funding opportunity, just days before the application deadline for that year’s $750 million allocation.

The reversal has left hundreds of communities nationwide scrambling to find alternative sources for the billions of dollars they had been promised. Among the six states and the District of Columbia in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, BRIC grants had been on track to disburse nearly $1 billion across about 350 applications, according to a Bay Journal analysis of FEMA’s database.

Among the region’s losses: $32 million to restore wetlands along the Patapsco River’s Middle Branch near Baltimore; $2.7 million to acquire 21 flood-prone properties in Scranton, Pennsylvania; and $20 million toward finishing a floodwall in Washington, D.C., around the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, the largest sewage plant in the Bay watershed.

And, of course, there’s Crisfield. With an annual budget of just $4 million, the town of 2,500 residents can’t afford to fight sea level rise without financial help from beyond its borders, Taylor said.

“We’re pretty much devastated,” she added. “Without this, we know that we will be in a really bad position to protect our citizens, protect our property, protect our community and really protect our way of life.”

Wasteful?

The FEMA announcement described the program as “more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” Many experts contend the opposite is true.

Recent studies suggest that investments in flood hazard mitigation yield a return of up to $8 in benefits for every $1 spent, according to the Association of State Floodplain Managers. Chad Berginnis, the association’s executive director, acknowledged that the BRIC program had flaws, but said it was making important strides in warding off disasters.

“I don’t [doubt that we] have debt issues in this country, but I take very strong exception to the FEMA press release that characterizes this program as wasteful and ineffective,” he said. “Those are just flat-out lies.”

Berginnis said he largely agreed with the findings of a recent Republican-led task force’s report, which called for reforming the BRIC program. The 61-page report offered a broad range of recommendations to improve the nation’s overall disaster response and preparedness efforts.

Among them: creating a pathway for smaller communities to obtain BRIC grants, so they don’t have to compete against “coastal elites” who have access to caravans of consultants and grant writers. During the 2023 grant year alone, about 75% of the program’s funding benefited such “high capacity” applicants, according to the report.

But the report was notable also for what it didn’t say, Berginnis pointed out. It didn’t say anything about getting rid of BRIC.

‘The water doesn’t care’

The BRIC program was established by Congress through the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018, which Trump signed into law in October of that year. Beginning in 2020, applicants could receive up to $50 million for projects designed to help communities reduce their exposure to catastrophes.

Such “pre-disaster” funding, backers say, is necessary now more than ever with climate change exacerbating a variety of threats and driving up the costs of “post-disaster” spending.

The abrupt cancellation of the program has drawn strong criticism, especially from Democratic lawmakers.

“When we talk about government cuts to environmental programs, I will caution that rising seas don’t care who is in the White House,” said Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd). “The water doesn’t care how a small town that experiences 90 days of flooding or more a year voted in the last election. Flooding will continue to devastate communities, even if the president does not believe in climate change.”

Some Republicans, while supportive of Trump in general, appeared to be quietly working to get the president to change his mind and restore at least some funding.

“We were made aware of this cancellation in funds and are reaching out to the appropriate federal agencies for a better understanding of this decision,” said Rep. Andy Harris’s (R-1st) office in a statement. Harris, Maryland’s only Republican congressman, chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and his district includes Crisfield.

His office noted that Harris had written a letter in support of Crisfield when the community was applying for BRIC funding. Harris remains “supportive of the city’s need to become more safe, resilient and prosperous by reducing the negative impacts of flooding,” according to the statement.

Because of the sluggish manner in which FEMA disburses funding, some of the grants now being canceled date back to the program’s inaugural year in 2020. In many cases, communities have already expended millions of their own dollars designing, engineering and permitting projects that now may never see the light of day, Berginnis said.

For multiphase projects, FEMA said its regional offices will work with applicants on previously obligated projects to determine what it called the “best path forward,” adding that “this may include ending the project after the completion of Phase 1 or at another appropriate stopping point.”

In the April 16 FEMA memo, the administration also cited BRIC’s purported failure to produce “concrete results” and the distribution of the “majority of funding … to only a few states.”

Community impacts

From small-town mayors to state emergency management coordinators, officials have reacted to the administration’s action with shock and disbelief.

“I don’t know what facts they are looking at to call this [program] wasteful,” said Maryland Secretary of Emergency Management Russell Strickland. “I know of nothing in Maryland that I would call wasteful.”

His agency estimates that communities across the state stand to lose more than $80 million across 26 applications that were in FEMA’s approval pipeline. The impact remains “undetermined” for $8.7 million that was allocated to 17 projects but hadn’t been spent as of the April 4 announcement.

Meanwhile, 31 Maryland-based applications for the 2024 funding year were dropped. Those $70 million in requests would have included $36 million for the second phase of Crisfield’s flood project and $16 million for a long-planned effort to fight frequent flooding in Cambridge, another Eastern Shore community struggling to transition its economy from seafood to tourism.

“We’re in a holding patten now,” Strickland said, adding that he hopes Congress and the administration work together to create a replacement for BRIC. He also is waiting to see whether Maryland and other states take legal action to overturn the decision.

The South Baltimore Gateway Partnership, along with other partners, has raised $67 million to restore the first phase of what will ultimately be 11 miles of the shoreline along the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. BRIC funding accounted for about $32 million of that total. About $5 million has been used for designing the project, but the rest stands to be clawed back, said Brad Rogers, the partnership’s executive director.

So, Rogers said, the wetlands to be added along the shore by MedStar Harbor Hospital will be scaled back from 12.3 acres to 8 acres. And instead of simultaneously launching another project at the BGE Spring Gardens campus in Ridgely’s Cove, that phase will be delayed until more funds are raised.

“We are saddened that the federal construction funds won’t be available going forward, but we are confident this will still be a terrific project,” Rogers said. “We’re not being deterred. We’re just moving forward on a slightly different timeline.”

In Virginia, the affected projects included $12 million to upgrade Richmond’s water treatment plant and $24 million to repair and modernize Portsmouth’s Lake Meade Dam, which holds back the city’s main drinking water reservoir.

In Pennsylvania, outcry followed the cancellation of FEMA’s $2.5 million award to the city of Scranton to acquire 21 flood-prone properties and demolish 18 homes standing on them. The properties were set to be repurposed into infrastructure to help prevent future flooding, city officials say.

“You have people that are in limbo,” Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti said. “Going forward, we are always going to have natural disasters. It’s absolutely untenable that cities and municipalities won’t have access to federal dollars to fend off and prevent [them] but also prepare.”

Many of the places impacted by the program’s cancellation abound with Republican voters. For example, in Crisfield’s main voting precinct, Trump won a 56% margin of victory in last November’s election.

Plans there call for installing a tidal flood barrier that will surround most of the city as well as adding sewers, pump stations, water-retention facilities, tide gates and wetlands. The goal is to ensure protection from up to 5 feet of flooding above ground level — akin to the inundation from Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Several residents recently completed coursework in a “resilience academy” program, hosted by the city and several partners. As part of their final project, three younger residents — all under 20 years old — pitched a plan to share knowledge with a “sister city” facing similar flooding issues.

“I live in this area,” said Emily Napier, indicating a point on the map near downtown, “and we flood on a daily basis.”

Dennis Marshall was on hand to collect his wife’s certificate in her absence. He owns a vacation rental in town that he says could benefit from the project.

“People come down here, and if they have to wear boots, they aren’t coming back,” he said. But Marshall added he is far from confident that the flood project, if built, would deliver the results it promises. “If it works, it’s fine,” he noted. “That’s the problem.”

Does he regret voting for Trump now that the Republican president has nixed the city’s massive windfall? “I think if he did it, he did it for a reason,” said Marshall, clad in a black Trump T-shirt.

Barbara Mete, another enrollee in the three-month resilience academy, moved to Crisfield about six years ago after retiring from a job in New York. She hoped the course would give her a deeper appreciation for her new home and the estuary at its doorstep. In the wake of the loss of funding, she is deeply concerned about her community’s future, she said.

Her message to Trump and FEMA? “Please think about the people who live here and the children that will come after your administration,” Mete said. “Nature is the key. If we take care of her, she will take care of us.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6823846caf447.image-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:07:08.055456

Ever since, solar energy has been established as a firm pillar of carving out a future for the present industries within the country. High wind of electricity costs, global climate obligations, and possible incentives at the policy level make solar not just a green option but a competitive advantage for the factories of tomorrow in India.

Rising Energy Demand in Manufacturing

Being an intensive consumer of electricity, manufacturing, and production in India have been subject to higher prices and cost increases. With the initiation of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes in various sectors like electronics, pharma, textiles, and others, a further increase in demand of 5-6% yearly is foreseen.

At the same time, such conventional sources do keep posing their issues: with coal-based electricity, the conditions are the prices that can fluctuate and are also subject to logistical problems, regulatory issues regarding environmental concerns. Against this background, solar energy is gaining a foothold as a clean, scalable source of power for industrial units.

India’s Solar Surge

India has made beautiful strides so far in solar capacity. As of March 2025, India’s solar power installed capacity had reached 73.31 GW, an enormous surge from just 2.6 GW in 2014. Solar capacity of 292 GW is targeted by the government for the year 2030 under its renewable energy roadmap. Growth is provided via big solar parks and smaller rooftops. Manufacturing units, particularly MSMEs in industrial clusters, are opting more and more for captive solar installations, thereby reducing operational costs.

Economic Benefits for Factories

The move to solar power provides strong financial incentives. A 1 MW rooftop solar concept can make nearly 1.4 million units of electricity in a year; this, in turn, brings potential savings of 1 crore every year, depending on the site and areas in the tariff. Such systems have a payback of 3-5 years; thereafter, electricity is considered virtually free for at least 20 more years of system life.

It also serves as an escape from outages and fuel cost fluctuations, and traditional grid-based power or diesel generation. Also, solar integration helps export-oriented manufacturers with ESG compliance and improves competitiveness in the international markets where the carbon footprint is getting attention.

Government Policies and Incentives

Multiple policy mechanisms have been introduced in India to nurture solar adoption in the industrial sector. Accelerated Depreciation: Business houses can claim depreciation up to 40% in the first year for solar assets. Solar Park Scheme and PM-KUSUM are targeted toward scaling solar in rural and semi-urban areas where many small factories exist.

With Green Open Access Rules being announced in 2022, the industries are to be able to procure renewable energy straight from the developer, thus reducing dependence on Discoms and achieving price efficiency.

Challenges and Road Ahead

These, though, remain promising times, yet challenges are there to be faced. High upfront capital cost, land acquisition for huge plants, and variability in state-level regulations stand as hurdles before integrating solar systems at a fast pace. The shortage of skilled manpower for solar system installation and maintenance remains acute, especially in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

Converging efforts from policymakers, financiers, and industry associations need to come together to tackle these issues. Though innovative finance models such as RESCO and green bonds are gaining traction, there is still a lot of scope for mass awareness and adoption.

Conclusion

No longer a distant dream, the convergence of energy sustainability with industrial growth is unfolding along the length and breadth of manufacturing corridors across India.

Under the newly elected government, Energy Minister Tim Hodgson has set out plans to identify and fast-track various renewable energy projects over the next 2 years. A Major Federal Projects office will be created to simplify the process of obtaining permits for clean energy projects. Hodgson stated that this would improve efficiency leading to ‘less red tape, more certainty, better outcomes.’

The government will focus on specific technologies such as hydrogen, geothermal, biofuels and nuclear as they are scalable and exportable. An importance will also be placed on the integration of electricity grids with Hodgson saying, “A pan-Canadian grid means more reliable, affordable, sustainable power for Canadians. It means powering industries from AI to manufacturing. And it means exporting energy between provinces who want Canadian solutions.”

A report from April 2025 has also highlighted significant wind power opportunities in the Atlantic Canada region, which will help to drive this clean energy growth. This area has some of the world’s greatest onshore and offshore wind resources and projects here could generate thousands of jobs. An existing skilled workforce makes the region well-placed to succeed with these wind projects.

Earlier this year Canada joined the Global Offshore Wind Alliance (GOWA) to help expand their wind power market. The alliance was launched in 2022 at COP27 and the members states aim to install a total capacity of 380 GW of wind power by 2030.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.","Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

The average residential customer of northern Illinois’ Commonwealth Edison will pay about $10.60 per month more this summer, according to a company statement. Downstate Ameren Illinois says customers can expect an 18% to 22% increase in their monthly bill, or about $45 per month depending on usage. Prices will likely decrease in October once winter electric rates go into effect.

Increasing energy prices are causing alarm among some consumer advocates and state policymakers, who worry that the long-term problems underlying the rising costs could lead to even higher prices or rolling blackouts.

Clara Summers, who advocates for consumer-friendly energy policy on behalf of the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board, said the ComEd price increases were for two reasons: increasing demand from data centers and large manufacturing as well as procedural issues slowing down new renewable projects.

CUB officials said the issues underlying Ameren’s increase were similar, while noting that both were due in part to the way grid regulators structure pricing.

The price hikes are a major undercurrent of escalating tensions over a package of energy reforms making its way through Springfield as lawmakers race toward their scheduled May 31 adjournment.

“We’re trying to keep prices low while combating climate change,” Jen Walling, head of the Illinois Environmental Council, told Capitol News Illinois. The IEC has been heavily involved in advocating for parts of the bill.

In December, federal officials at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — the nonprofit oversight agency for grid operators — designated the grid for central and southern Illinois as “high risk” for not having enough electricity to meet demand on hot days in the summer and cold days in the winter over the next five years. The grid that stretches from central Canada to the Mississippi river delta is the only power grid in the nation to have that designation, with much of its risk stemming from power plants closing.

Illinois’ northern grid, which includes parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. from Illinois to the east coast, faces “elevated” risk. That means extreme weather events are “likely” to cause shortfalls in energy reserves.

The increased demand stems from data centers, increasing adoption of electric heat pumps and the rise of electric vehicles, according to NERC.

David Braun, an executive at the energy technology company Intelligent Generation, said demand on the electric grid is the highest it’s been in the 30 years he’s worked in the energy sector.

“We haven’t seen this in a long time,” Braun told Capitol News Illinois. “So, it’s catching planners by surprise, and it takes a long time to build power plants.”

Shrinking supply

That demand, according to NERC’s December report, is coming at the same time supply is going down — increasing pressure on the grid.

Around the country, fossil fuel plants are closing as states move to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. While Illinois exports energy overall, plant closures elsewhere in the country can affect the price of energy, raising prices for Illinoisans. Grid operators nationwide, meanwhile, face yearslong red tape-induced backlogs on new renewables.

Downstate Illinois’ grid might run out of energy reserves as soon as 2034, per NERC. Northern Illinois’ grid has more reserves but will face decreased levels throughout the next decade. If nothing is done to either reduce demand or increase supply, this means prices could continue to increase or blackouts could become necessary to stabilize the grid.

To address these issues, lawmakers in Springfield are weighing sweeping energy legislation. The bill’s proponents say its provisions to incentivize new developments are the only way to prevent serious problems without walking back the state’s climate goals.

Republican critics contend that the main reason for the legislation is to fix problems with the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. Gov. JB Pritzker’s marquee climate policy, they say, is a major cause of the supply shortfalls because it requires fossil fuel-burning power plants to shut down by 2045.

Others say provisions aimed at reducing data centers’ energy demands on the grid will hurt businesses in the state.

Lawmakers and advocacy groups are currently reviewing draft language for the bill, which has not been made public. Even with complex procedural maneuvering to avoid long-passed deadlines, lawmakers face a tight turnaround to reach an agreement before the legislative session ends.

The process could have become more complicated, some suggest, after the U.S. House passed a wide-ranging bill early Thursday that could drastically alter federal energy incentives if it becomes law.

Higher prices

Bills for customers of private electric utilities — most notably ComEd and Ameren — will go up in June.

The increase was determined at two recent capacity auctions, which are how grid operators set energy prices for years into the future. High prices at these auctions can indicate low supply relative to demand.

PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for northern Illinois, saw a roughly eight-fold jump in its most recent capacity auction compared to the year prior. Downstate’s energy grid, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, saw more than a 20-fold year-over-year price jump at its capacity auction in April.

Representatives of the state’s two largest electric utilities stressed that these increases occurred beyond their purview.

“ComEd does not profit from this increase, was not part of the auction, does not supply capacity, and does not retain any proceeds of the capacity charge payments,” ComEd spokesperson John Schoen said in a statement.

An Ameren spokesperson echoed the sentiment, noting that the state requires utilities to pass this type of cost to customers “dollar-for-dollar, without markup.”

The price is lower for ComEd customers than it could have been due to a provision in CEJA, which credits customers when energy generated by nuclear power plants is above a certain level. Consumer watchdogs at CUB estimate that the policy cut the increase for ComEd customers by about 17%. Customers in the Ameren area, which has much less nuclear power, are not eligible for the credit.

Other energy providers

While millions of Illinoisans get their power from ComEd and Ameren, some get their electricity through other means, including alternate retail suppliers, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives. Many of these energy suppliers are not affected directly by the capacity auctions.

Municipal customers in towns like Naperville, St. Charles and Rantoul are largely insulated from the spike, according to Staci Wilson, the head of government affairs for the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency. The IMEA is a private entity that provides electricity to 32 of the 42 municipal electric systems in the state.

IMEA sometimes participates in capacity auctions. But Wilson said the agency tends to secure energy through other means, such as having ownership stakes directly in power plants.

“IMEA member municipalities have rates that are currently lower than private utilities and our ownership model continues to gain value as we transition to a carbon-free future in an affordable and reliable manner,” Wilson said.

But other municipal utility officials, including those at Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power, are less optimistic about future prices.

“Regulations are forcing plant retirement a little too soon,” CWLP spokesperson Amber Sabin said. “And the grid operators that are here, they have resources that they can’t connect to the grid. They’re waiting, or they don’t get financing or ever developed. They have supply chain issues, workforce issues, right? There’s a cost to all of that.”

CWLP didn’t participate in the recent MISO auction, although it could have. The utility shut down several coal-fired generators over the past five years but continues to operate one coal-fired power plant on the southeast side of Springfield. That plant will need to shut down permanently at some point in the next two decades under state law.

“In the future, all the costs are going to go up,” Sabin said. “We do expect that capacity auction prices will affect our customers.”

That echoes what some state officials expect as well. Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, has worked on energy legislation for years and said that there is “nothing we can do” to reduce prices for this summer as capacity auctions have concluded, but he said lawmakers should do what they can to address the root causes of the spike.

“We think this is going to be the new normal,” Cunningham said.

Legislative moves

Negotiations over energy reforms in Springfield have included lawmakers, the governor’s office, and interest groups including environmentalists, organized labor and business associations. The process is sparking heated debate.

Over the past week, a draft of legislation began circulating among lawmakers and advocates, many of whom discussed portions of the bill with Capitol News Illinois.

CUNINGHAM PHOTO

“I don’t think, by any stretch, you’ll see a bill the size and scope that CEJA was, that we passed four years ago — certainly won’t see that,” Cunningham, who was involved in the negotiations, said.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.

Environmental groups clashed with business and labor this week over a provision meant to lower the energy burden brought by data centers. That proposal would require large energy consumers to build their own energy generation through renewable sources like wind or solar power or pay the state to do so.

The pitch sparked fierce pushback from business and labor groups, which sent a collective letter to Pritzker, urging him to oppose the specific provision. The letter was co-signed by groups including the AFL-CIO, Climate Jobs Illinois, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and Constellation Energy — the last of which operates all the state’s commercial nuclear power plants.

The proposal is being pushed by environmentalists, who say they want more accountability from data centers and other large consumers.

“We cannot allow these power-hungry facilities to drive up costs for consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills,” Gina Ramirez, director of Midwest environmental health at the National Resources Defense Council, said at a Wednesday rally.

Other issues are less controversial, largely because they’ve been negotiated for months.

Cunningham, a prominent player in the passage of CEJA, has his own proposal in the current draft: incentives for the energy storage industry. The current draft of that provision closely parallels recommendations made by the Illinois Commerce Commission. That agency was directed by a bill passed earlier this year to study how to handle energy storage projects.

While legislative Republicans have largely been shut out of negotiations over the bill, some of their ideas are being considered.

Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, put out a pitch to ease the pressure on electric demand earlier this year by expanding nuclear energy. She was the architect of a bill two years ago that eased the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants, lifting it for next-generation, small generators.

This year, Rezin introduced a bill that would eliminate the remaining state restrictions on new nuclear power plants. Language similar to Rezin’s was included in draft legislation circulated this week.

REZIN PHOTO

Rezin, who leads several energy-related groups of lawmakers as part of her involvement at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said all states are facing similar issues around electricity.

“All energy buildout will take years because of the regulatory process,” Rezin said. “That’s why it’s important now. The state of Illinois needs to send positive messages to companies that are looking to invest in technology — whether it’s nuclear or any other kind of energy producing plant — that we are open for business.”

The feds’ ‘big, beautiful bill’

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday morning passed a bill containing many domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump that many fear could upend state energy policy.

The bill contains provisions rolling back several clean energy tax incentives. Several key solar company stock prices fell sharply Thursday morning in response, including NextEra Energy, FirstSolar and Enphase Energy among others.

The solar industry has been a key part of Illinois’ renewable energy plans and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Lesley McCain, the head of the Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association, said that the bill could “cause solar energy companies of all sizes to cancel projects, and many will be forced to shut their doors.”

Environmentalists were quick to criticize the federal bill, which still requires negotiation and an eventual vote in the U.S. Senate before it can become law.

“It strips funding for climate programs, guts clean energy manufacturing, kills good union jobs, drives energy prices up, and abandons farmers and small business owners,” Walling said in a statement.

Illinois Republicans, meanwhile, expressed optimism that some of the bill’s provisions could help the fossil fuel sector in the state.

“If the federal government is going to help us to, you know, power up coal, power up gas — we want all energy,” Illinois House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said at a news conference. “We want solar, we want wind, we want nuke, we want coal. We want all of it.”

Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, noted that the federal bill should not “be used as an excuse to rush forward” on the energy legislation under consideration in Springfield.",https://www.bnd.com/latest-news/puynsm/picture307131916/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/250522%20METERS%20AA.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:07:22.057595

Do you plan to cross-shop the 2026 Toyota bZ with any other EVs?","Four versions of the ’26 Toyota bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve estimated range of between 278 miles and 314 miles. A front-drive XLE trim will get a new 57.7-kWh battery and 236 miles of range.

Early next year, bZ shoppers can step up to something more rugged: the 2026 bZ Woodland edition with a range-topping 375 hp and standard AWD.

The new instrument panel overall is streamlined and looks more upscale than the one in the 2025 bZ4X, and the design team moved the gauge cluster higher, making it easier to see in the ’26 model.

It’s much more than just a name change.

Yes, Toyota has ditched the clumsy and awkward bZ4X moniker for its most recent battery-electric vehicle for the US market, in hopes that the simplified name “bZ” will resonate with shoppers and bear fruit when this updated 2026 model starts arriving at Toyota showrooms later this summer.

The bZ4X has been in the market for three years—and has taken its lumps along the way. The 2022 launch was plagued by an embarrassing recall for loose hub bolts that might cause wheels to detach. Barely 1,200 units sold in 2022.

But the bZ4X recovered well enough to achieve 9,329 sales in 2023 in the US and then another 18,570 in 2024.

But for context, higher-priced luxury EVs like the BMW i4, Cadillac Lyriq, and Rivian R1S handily outsold the bZ4X in 2024, as did mainstream EVs like the Mustang Mach-E, Nissan Ariya, and Honda Prologue.

So Toyota clearly has work to do in this volatile and politically charged segment for all-electric vehicles, and the latest changes to this refreshed (and renamed) 2026 bZ are notable on a number of fronts.

On the outside, you can barely see the difference in the trim and unaltered sheetmetal compared to the 2025 bZ4X.

But the mechanical changes for the new bZ are meaningful. The ’25 bZ4X offered two battery packs (71.4 kWh and 72.8 kWh), capable of range between 222 and 252 miles.

More bZ Photos

Four versions of the ’26 bZ will use a 74.7-kWh battery and achieve estimated range of between 278 miles (with AWD) and 314 miles (with front-wheel drive).

Even better, a front-drive XLE trim will be offered with a new, smaller 57.7-kWh battery, rated at 236 miles of range and likely coming in at a lower price point—but with a meager 168 hp.

Look for 338 hp combined with AWD (Limited and XLE trim) for ’26, up from 214 hp combined on the prior AWD bZ4X.

We didn’t get to drive that new 338-hp bZ, but even the 221-hp Limited FWD model felt lively on a short route last week in and around Plano, Texas, near the Toyota North American headquarters.

For some people, 168 hp and 236 miles of range might be the perfect vehicle, at a lower price point.

The spec sheet shows a big step up in acceleration to 60 mph, from 6.5 seconds with AWD for the bZ4X to 4.9 seconds with the 338-hp AWD system in the new bZ.

But at the lower end with FWD and the smaller 57.7-kWh battery, the bZ is slower to 60 mph: a leisurely 8 seconds compared to 7.1 in the base bZ4X with a larger battery.

Toyota’s basically giving EV shoppers more options—at both the lower and upper end of the bZ range. For some people with shorter range and power requirements, 168 hp and 236 miles of range might be the perfect vehicle, at a lower price point.

And early next year, bZ shoppers can step up to yet another option if they are looking for something more rugged. The 2026 bZ Woodland edition will bring a range-topping 375 hp, standard AWD, up to an estimated 260 miles of range, 3,500 pounds of towing capacity, and 8.3 inches of ground clearance for adventuring off-road.

Another important addition for the ’26 bZ, including the Woodland: Standard on all of them is the Tesla-designed North American Charging System (NACS) port, giving access to thousands of DC fast charging stations nationwide.

If you have a favorite charging station that still uses the Combined Charging System (CCS) port that has been standard for most other EV makers, then you’ll be glad to find an adapter that comes with your bZ, at no extra charge. Consider it an insurance policy giving you a lot more charging options during road trips.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X at right saw substantial interior changes for the 2026 Toyota bZ (left).

Look inside the 2026 bZ and you’ll see significant design upgrades.

The instrument panel is all new and now gets a larger 14-inch multimedia touchscreen in the center that integrates more neatly within the instrument panel. That new screen is positioned higher for better visibility.

The old screen had tiny buttons positioned at the base for adjusting volume up and down—good luck working those while moving. Below that were climate controls that were also poorly organized and hard to read.

The new configuration is cleaner and simpler and includes two chunky dials for adjusting cabin temperature for both driver and passenger.

And right between those dials is another welcome new addition: a physical volume knob (which could use some brightwork to stand out from the all-black background).

The instrument panel overall is streamlined and looks more upscale than the one it replaces. The digital gauge cluster in the bZ4X sat too low, and the steering wheel blocked its visibility. But for ’26 the design team moved the cluster higher, making it easier to see, and pushed it a bit closer to the windshield.

More bZ Photos

2026 bZ Woodland edition will bring 375 hp, standard AWD, up to an estimated 260 miles of range.

And there was just too much going on with the old gauge cluster, which had arms on either side reaching forward toward the driver. In between those arms was a hump that extended and tapered back from the steering wheel toward the cluster. The mess is cleaned up.

Also for ’26, that steering wheel (which is unchanged and has lots of buttons) comes with paddles to crank up the regenerative braking force (up to four clicks) with the right side, or down with the left.

Those paddles weren’t there for the bZ4X, so you had to use a switch in the center console. The new paddles work great, but you still don’t get full one-pedal driving, just like with the bZ4X.

There’s another big interior change worth mentioning. The bZ4X center console had one port for wireless phone charging, while the new bZ gets two. And the console has been reconfigured to bring the gear shifter closer to the driver. It all looks better than it did.

Starting price for the 2025 bZ4X was $38,205, and we’ll have to wait until later this summer for the new pricing when the ’26 bZ starts arriving at Toyota showrooms, in XLE and Limited trims. Toyota builds the bZ4X in Japan and China.

China, the world’s largest EV market, reported a 55% jump in BEV sales to 1.64 million units in Q1 2025.
After three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in BEV sales, Q1 2025 experienced a significant revival in Europe, according to the report.
In Q1 2025, the United States saw an 18% rise in BEV sales to 301,000 units, even as PHEV sales slipped by 11% to 79,000 units.","India’s battery electric vehicle (BEV) market posted solid growth in the first quarter of 2025, with sales reaching 31,661 units, a 22% increase from 25,842 units in the same period last year. However, the country’s performance lagged behind the 42% global surge in BEV sales to 2.66 million units, driven by robust demand in markets such as China, Europe, the UK, and the US, according to a report from Strategy&, a consulting business unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

India’s BEV growth was particularly robust in March 2025, with monthly sales climbing to 12,163 units—up 24% year-on-year. This was on account of incremental volumes from Mahindra & Mahindra and Hyundai Motor India BEVs.

The rise in BEV sales highlights India's expanding shift toward clean mobility, spurred by government incentives, evolving consumer preferences for premium vehicles, and new product launches by domestic and global automakers.

Currently, India’s electric passenger vehicle market is led by players like Tata Motors, MG Motor India, Mahindra and Mahindra, and Hyundai Motor India. Maruti Suzuki India, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker, is expected to launch its first EV domestically in September. In the luxury segment, brands like BYD, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz are also expanding their EV offerings in India.

Despite the growth, India’s EV share remains modest—just 2.5% of total passenger vehicle sales in 2024—held back by high prices and limited charging infrastructure. S&P Global expects a shift in the coming years as affordable EVs, better financing options, and expanded charging networks bridge the price gap with conventional vehicles. The Indian government aims for EVs to comprise 30% of all passenger vehicle sales by FY2030.

In Q1 2025, India’s hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) segment recorded a modest 1.5% rise in sales to 93,173 units, while plug-in hybrid (PHEV) volumes remained negligible at 30 units.

Global Sales

Globally, BEV sales momentum was even stronger. China, the world’s largest EV market, reported a 55% jump in BEV sales to 1.64 million units in Q1 2025. PHEV sales rose 37% to 994,000 units, while hybrids increased 18% to 213,000 units—bringing China’s total EV sales to nearly 2.85 million units for the quarter. The BEV and PHEV numbers include commercial vehicles, and hybrid numbers include only passenger cars

The Chinese market continues to be boosted by a series of government measures, including the expansion of the trade-in scheme which offers financial incentives that encourage consumers to upgrade to newer vehicles, Strategy& said. The country ICE sales were down 7% year on year, the tenth successive quarter in which such a decline was registered.

Europe–including the European Union, UK and European Free Trade Association--also witnessed robust growth, with BEV sales climbing to 574,000 units in Q1 2025, a 28% increase from a year earlier. PHEVs grew 6% to 268,000 units, and hybrid sales expanded 20% to 1.22 million units. The total EV volume for Europe stood at 2.06 million units, as per the report.

After three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in BEV sales, Q1 2025 experienced a significant revival in Europe, according to the report. Sales of BEVs increased in the top five European markets by 30%, resulting in the highest BEV market share on record for the first quarter of the year (15%). The relatively large BEV markets of the UK and Germany were responsible for much of that growth, up by 43% and 39%, respectively.

Germany’s strong growth can be partly attributed to a sudden fall in sales in the equivalent quarter last year in the wake of the sudden withdrawal of incentives. Despite the overall strong performance, Germany remains in second place for the largest market for BEVs in Europe, following the UK's lead in both the first quarter and full year of 2024, Strategy& said.

In Q1 2025, the United States saw an 18% rise in BEV sales to 301,000 units, even as PHEV sales slipped by 11% to 79,000 units. Hybrid vehicles, however, saw a sharp 47% increase, with 473,000 units sold during the quarter.

Tesla Loses Ground

Tesla, one of the world’s largest EV makers, lost ground in several key markets in Q1 2025. In Europe’s leading markets (Germany, Italy, Spain), Tesla’s Model Y fell to fifth place in sales rankings, with 5,797 units sold, while the Tesla Model 3 dropped to sixth. The top-selling models in Europe were the VW ID.7 (9,515 units), VW ID.4/ID.5 (8,301 units), and Skoda Enyaq (7,515 units).

In China, Tesla’s Model Y ranked third with 81,889 units sold, behind the Geely Geome Xingyuan (89,215 units) and the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV (86,946 units). The Model 3 held sixth place with 52,718 units sold.

In the US, Tesla retained its lead, with the Model Y topping the charts at 64,051 units and the Model 3 following at 52,520 units. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, with 11,607 units sold, rounded out the top three.

As global and domestic markets transition toward electrification and software-centric automotive technologies, industry analysts expect continued momentum in EV sales in the coming quarters, with India’s efforts to build out local supply chains and charging infrastructure playing a key role.",https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/769f8f5d-50dd-4457-94c3-2df26d94a715_Screenshot-20250527-163437.png,N,,2025-05-27 11:20:44.316623

The Toyota bZ goes on sale in second half of 2025.

PLANO, Texas – The 2026 Toyota bZ makes a leap forward with improvements for everything from the subcompact EV's name to its charging system. The 2022 bZ4X was an uncharacteristic disappointment from the world’s largest automaker. Overpriced and under-equipped, it was hamstrung by everything from uncompetitive technology to a ludicrous name.

Toyota listened to its critics and turned one of the world’s most formidable continuous improvement machines loose.

Renamed the bZ ― still not poetry, but the badge no longer looks like a laser printer threw up ― the new model is competitive with small electric SUVs like the Kia Niro, Hyundai Kona and Fiat 500e.

The 2026 bZ goes on sale in the second half of 2025. Detailed figures for price, range and charging will be available later.

I recently drove a loaded bZ Limited through the exurbs surrounding Toyota’s North America headquarters in Plano. It felt like a completely different vehicle from the bZ4X Limited I tested a couple of months ago.

Key improvements to 2026 Toyota bZ

25% range increase to 314 miles

50% power increase to 338 horsepower

NSCS charging port

Plug & Charge compatibility

Radical makeover

Improvements to the ’26 bZ start at the EV’s heart: battery, charging and motors.

The bZ gets two sizes of lithium-ion battery: a 74.7 kWh unit delivers up to 314 miles range and a 57.7 kWh unit rated at 236 miles. The battery is now capable of pre-conditioning, which speeds up charging and reduces energy use in cold weather.

A built-in NACS charging port provides access to Tesla’s DC fast charging network. An adaptor will be necessary for CCS chargers common at other charging stations. An onboard charger upgraded from 7 to 11 kW will hasten charging at the 240v connections most EV owners use at home. Plug & Charge software makes charging fast and easy at participating chargers including Electrify America, EVgo, ChargePoint and Tesla.

Maximum power increases dramatically, from 214 to 338 hp for the AWD model and 201 to 221 hp for FWD.

The exterior styling benefits from updated front LED running lights and fascia that bring the nose into harmony with Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" nose. Body-color front fascia and cladding around the wheels is also new.

Driving impressions

The ’26 fairly leaps away from stops compared with its under-power predecessor. Toyota claims a 4.9-seconds 0-60 mph for the AWD bZ. It was mum on the previous model’s acceleration, and not out of modesty.

The steering was responsive in my time in neighborhoods, shopping districts and along wide, smooth roads that curved between corporate campuses and public parks.

The brakes are firm and easy to modulate. New steering column paddles adjust regenerative braking to recapture energy, but there’s no one-pedal setting to bring the bZ to a full stop.

The front seat is roomy, with a big center console that holds two new wireless charging pads. Wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard.

The new dash has a 14-inch touch screen. The instrument cluster is new, too, bigger and easier to read.

A heat pump reduces energy use for heating and cooling the cabin.

Standard heated steering wheel and front seats further reduce cold-weather energy use. Climate control options include ventilated front seats, heated rear seats and a radiant front-seat foot and leg heater.

Why buy a 2026 Toyota bZ?

Price and charging time are huge unknowns, but there’s lots to like about the 2026 Toyota bZ.

Its improved power and battery size give it competitive performance and range. Revised lights and exterior color pattern make it look like a grown-up vehicle, as opposed to the bZ4X’s cobbled-together appearance.

The interior of my bZ Limited was comfortable, trimmed in appealing soft materials and roomy.

It’s a huge step forward to Toyota’s EV status, worth a look from anybody shopping for a small electric SUV.

Traditionally, flat rooftops with low bearing capacities have been overlooked for solar installations because they cannot support the heavy weight of standard photovoltaic installations and mounting systems. Fortunately, SHEEFT tackles this problem as it manufactures cutting-edge, lightweight photovoltaic (PV) panels specifically designed for flat rooftops, allowing for the installation of more solar panels and in turn, enabling the uptake of renewable energy and lowering carbon emissions.

Led by the French start-up, HELIUP, the project uses ultra-thin glass technology in its innovative Stykon® PV panel. This panel is tailor-made for large existing commercial, industrial and logistic buildings with low load-bearing capacities. Unlike conventional solar panels, SHEEFT’s panels are glued directly to waterproof membranes, cutting weight by 60% without compromising performance or reliability.

‘The SHEEFT project addresses the unrealised needs of buildings traditionally unsuitable for solar installations due to structural limitations’, explained Yannick Veschetti, CEO of HELIUP. ‘

The support of the Innovation Fund was crucial to scaling this solution, accelerating our ability to contribute substantially to Europe’s decarbonisation objectives’.

The factory is now fully operational and meeting its targets, marking a major milestone in demonstrating Europe’s ability to industrialise innovative solutions rapidly. Reaching this point required selecting equipment and a production site, securing permits, managing procurement, recruiting skilled staff, and maintaining strict control over budget and timeline. These achievements reflect the dedication and coordinated efforts of the entire project team.

Environmental and local benefits

Supported by a €3.22 million grant from the Innovation Fund, the project will deliver substantial environmental and economic benefits. Notably, the technology harnesses the untapped potential of pre-existing building rooftops once unable to use PV panels to generate clean energy.

Over a 10-year operational period, SHEEFT will generate approximately 3.76 terawatt-hours (TWh) of clean electricity. Based on an average EU household consumption of 3.76 megawatt hours, this is enough to supply an equivalent of 100 000 EU households, significantly enhancing Europe’s energy independence and sustainability. Also within a 10-year operational period, the project expects to avoid emitting over 360 000 tonnes of CO₂, which is the equivalent of eliminating the annual carbon emissions of approximately 20 000 EU households.

SHEEFT also champions key industrial growth within Europe. Its pilot line for pre-production and product development in Bourget-du-Lac, and its 4 000 m2 production line in Le Cheylas, one of the largest production capacities in France, contribute significantly to local economic growth and employment stability by creating 100 direct jobs.

Looking forward and scaling up

The next steps focus on commercial development to fully leverage the 100 megawatt-peak annual capacity of Le Cheylas plant by 2030. To this end, a gradual ramp-up is planned, expanding from one to three shifts while maintaining high yield and efficiency.

HELIUP will also launch a second phase beyond the Innovation Fund project, scaling industrial production units by five to ten times their initial size from 2026 onwards. This expansion will drive further cost optimisation and increased adoption of lightweight solar technology. With rapid execution and strong European roots, the project continues to show its potential to be a highly credible player in the clean energy sector.

SHEEFT is a startup-led initiative bringing certified French energy technology to market via a new 100 MWp production line. With rapid execution and strong European roots, it’s a credible player in the energy sector.

Some clean energy groups shun nuclear power.

“America’s great innovators and entrepreneurs have run into brick walls when it comes to nuclear technology,” Michael Kratsios, Trump’s science and technology adviser, said Friday.","In his call Friday for a nationwide expansion of new nuclear power plants, President Donald Trump has set up a potentially historic showdown between his authority and the independence of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the U.S. standard-setter for nuclear safety for the past half-century.

Trump on Friday gave the NRC until February to prepare and publish “a wholesale revision of its regulations and guidance documents,” in consultation with White House budget officials and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Department of Energy and the Defense Department were also given totally new nuclear missions that could support — or compete — with the NRC’s charter.

NRC was directed to review “unsound” and “myopic” rules that limit radiation exposure. And the new rules must include 18-month deadlines for approving new reactor designs.

Trump’s four executive orders signed Friday support the goal of a fourfold increase in U.S. nuclear output by 2050 to power data centers that can help fuel American leadership in artificial intelligence technology. Some clean energy groups shun nuclear power. But nuclear advocates inside the environmental community say it’s a vital source of carbon-free power after 2030. Other backers point to rising electricity demand and long-term energy reliability as reasons to advance nuclear technology and build more plants.

Responses to the orders have landed far apart.

Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy and innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, a supporter of expanded nuclear power, said the White House is requiring the NRC to reconsider radiation standards, but the executive orders don’t order the agency to change nuclear power’s safety threshold. Instead, Trump calls for adoption of “credible and data-backed” safety standards, he said. “The orders do not undermine safety.”

“The executive order is challenging the agency to reexamine its processes … to make sure they are appropriately balancing risks and benefits and are not imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former NRC commissioner and an attorney with Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. “I believe at the end of the day, the agency still has the last word on what it needs to do to meet its safety mission.”

The orders offer no clarity on how differences would be resolved by the NRC commissioners and administration officials, even if much of NRC’s legal authority is still in place.

Allison Macfarlane, a former NRC chair, said Trump’s intervention in the NRC process smacks of political interference, which will “crater” essential public confidence in nuclear power. “I think it’s really going to damage public trust,” she said.

“I’m concerned about this intrusion on the historic independence of the agency,” said another former NRC chair, Stephen Burns. “You’re seeing this in how they’re acting with other independent agencies.”

A White House official confirmed that staff reductions are planned at the NRC. “There will be turnover and changes in roles,” a White House official said Friday, speaking on background. “Total reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization.”

Ambition and resources

“It will be impossible for NRC to maintain a commitment to safety and oversight with staffing levels slashed and expertise gone,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a nuclear power critic, said Friday. (The Trump order said specialists could be added to NRC staff if necessary to evaluate certain reactor technology).

Trump’s orders called on the departments of Defense and Energy to vet new reactor designs in parallel if not in competition with the NRC. The U.S. Army is ordered to have a new reactor operating at a U.S. military installation within three years. Under the White House plan, DOE must coordinate construction of new reactors to power data centers within 30 months.

Reactor technologies approved by DOE and DOD should receive expedited approval at the NRC. The commission would have limited authority to reconsider the DOE and DOD decisions, the president directed.

“There’s a question about whether the resources are going to match the ambition,” said Judi Greenwald, CEO of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance, which supports zero-carbon advanced nuclear technology as a way to address emissions in the power sector.

The first few new reactor designs will take at least a couple of years to review, she said. “That’s a process that we think NRC is competent to do.”

Once nuclear builders get construction experience, she added, regulators can accelerate processing of standard designs. “You can just keep licensing the same thing repeatedly, and we should get pretty fast at that,” she said.

New, unproven technologies

The NRC’s yearslong process of creating a new regulatory review process for advanced reactors generated bipartisan frustration in Congress. That paved the road for enactment of last year’s ADVANCE Act to speed up reviews, passed with significant majorities from both parties.

Today, a dozen reactor builders are in preliminary discussions with the NRC about their designs. Four small modular reactor developers have applied for licenses. Most of the advanced reactors Trump is counting on to bring about a nuclear “renaissance” use fuel or heat management technologies that are far different from currently operating U.S. reactors.

New fuels and technology pose unique safety review challenges, according to a 2023 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

Much of the licensing of new reactors revolves around testing and licensing new cooling technology. Instead of the water-cooled systems, advanced reactors employ less familiar cooling systems such as liquid sodium, helium gas or molten salt. While the projects include some built-in safety improvements over existing reactors, “the designs will need to demonstrate that they can meet [NRC] standards through testing and safety analysis,” the National Academies report said.

Former NRC Chair Richard Meserve, who chaired the National Academies panel, said the NRC is deeply engaged with the new reactor vendors. “The NRC has been tackling the issues, but the hard decisions have not yet been completely confronted. There is no way to cut corners on ensuring that these new features are carefully analyzed,” he said.

“Sodium-cooled reactors face significant fire risk, as sodium ignites explosively on contact with air,” said Amir Afzali, a retired utility senior director with more than three decades experience in nuclear power.

One potential engineering solution, he noted, is to enclose sodium-carrying pipes within a secondary containment pipe. “While effective, this approach requires rigorous testing, inspection, and monitoring — raising construction and operating costs,” Afzali said.

History across industries — whether it’s nuclear, banking or aerospace — raises alarms about an approach that weakens oversight and blurs the lines between promotion and regulation. “Maintaining independent, effective regulation is essential to avoid serious consequences,” Afzali said.

In the preamble to his order for rule changes at NRC, Trump said the basis for his orders was an “overly risk-averse culture” at the NRC that imposed unnecessarily lengthy licensing timetables and high costs, thwarting the expansion of nuclear power in the United States.

“America’s great innovators and entrepreneurs have run into brick walls when it comes to nuclear technology,” Michael Kratsios, Trump’s science and technology adviser, said Friday.

The history is more complex.

Around 2000, the NRC licensed 14 new reactor applications from seven utilities, including 10 of Westinghouse’s AP1000 units — the large reactor designs used by Georgia Power to expand its Vogtle plant.

The Vogtle expansion ended up the only project completed. Costs ran up to $35 billion and the project was seven years late.

But the NRC can’t be blamed for the issues Vogtle faced, Afzali said. The high costs deterred utilities that had been considering a nuclear build-out.

“The NRC has plenty of areas where they need to improve,” Afzali said. “But undermining them as an effective regulator isn’t consistent with the facts.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/a9/41/0d0188994ca2aecda650d718cd86/trump-30115.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 08:05:06.958923

Risks of fragmented remote access The risks facing the sector are exacerbated by the widespread use of low-grade, unsecured, or ungoverned remote access software.
The abundance of remote access tools creates operational challenges as well.
Centralised remote access not only reduces the attack surface but also improves productivity and ensures that critical operations are maintained securely and reliably.","In Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act 2019, the US Congress sought to protect national security by preventing government procurement or contracting of Chinese telecommunications and video surveillance equipment and services which allegedly contain backdoors for espionage.

While the adversaries of Western democracies seek to use access to cyber-physical systems for espionage and to disrupt critical infrastructure, many industrial environments rely on a sprawling patchwork of remote access tools for day-to-day operations that is frequently insecure, uncontrolled, unmonitored and thus highly vulnerable.

This isn’t an isolated risk but an issue which spans the energy sector and beyond. If we are to protect the resilience of our energy infrastructure, we must confront the reality that remote access, while essential, has become one of the least governed aspects of cybersecurity with real world potential consequences.

The European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC)’s call for an EU-wide“Inverter Security Toolbox” reflects this shift in understanding. Security must extend beyond the device to the ecosystem of access surrounding it.

Solar’s security blind spot

For energy providers, the issue isn’t that remote access exists, but that it exists in such unmanageable volumes that are invisible to security teams.

Tools are regularly onboarded for practical reasons such as vendor maintenance, emergency fixes, or legacy system support. Over time, though, these legitimate needs accumulate into a fragmented jumble of digital doors, many of which inadvertently remain open.

In one notable case, a manufacturer discovered it had more than 7,000 remote access points across its plants. Any one of these connections, if compromised, could act as a highway through established security controls into the heart of its production systems.

This encapsulates the gulf between operational needs and cybersecurity fundamentals. While automation vendors and machine builders must maintain uptime and minimise onsite interventions, asset owners commonly overlook the security implications of their procurement and deployment decisions.

Once you see the scale of the sprawl, you can’t unsee it. Even more vexing: once seen, what was once ignorance becomes negligence if left untreated.

In the solar sector, this risk is no different. A recent analysis from US cybersecurity firm DER Security foundthat 45% of global solar capacity was exposed to nation-state adversaries or cybercriminal threats in the past year alone. As the sector matures, so too must the rigour applied to its cybersecurity practices throughout the entire procurement, deployment, and operations lifecycle.

Risks of fragmented remote access

The risks facing the sector are exacerbated by the widespread use of low-grade, unsecured, or ungoverned remote access software.

Claroty’s research found that 55% of industrial organisations have four or more non-enterprise-grade tools operating within their OT environments. While using multiple vendors may not necessarily be problematic, the number of remote access points – sometimes measured in hundreds or thousands – quite certainly is.

Some of these tools have been directly implicated in recent security breaches. For example, TeamViewer was reportedly compromised by the APT29 threat group, while AnyDesk disclosed a breach that forced the revocation of passwords and code-signing certificates across its user base. These widely deployed tools, when not properly managed, become significant liabilities within industrial settings.

But the risks extend beyond cybersecurity alone. The abundance of remote access tools creates operational challenges as well. A fragmented environment is less efficient, adding to the workload on both IT and OT teams, and is more complicated to enforce consistent security policies.

This sprawl increases costs and generates blind spots which hinder visibility and control. In environments where uptime, safety, and precision are critical, these operational consequences can be just as damaging as a direct cyberattack.

Fragmentation, centralisation, governance

Fortunately, organisations have an alternative. Leading energy companies are beginning to adopt centralised and policy-driven approaches to remote access management. These programs begin by mapping all access points and identifying outdated or risky tools. From there, they can consolidate access pathways under a single, secure entry point.

Importantly, this process involves not just internal restructuring but renegotiation with third-party vendors. Organisations are now requiring that vendors use the company’s preferred access method, rather than shipping their own tools or relying on outdated practices.

However, this transition is neither fast nor easy, and vendors regularly resist changes. The energy sector must put pressure on vendors to ensure that these standards are upheld. Centralised remote access not only reduces the attack surface but also improves productivity and ensures that critical operations are maintained securely and reliably.

A strategic imperative for the future

The alleged incident with Chinese solar inverters shouldn’t be a surprise. Yet, what might surprise asset owners is the deeper issue – a fragmented approach to remote access that frequently and silently proliferates in asset-intensive organisations.

If the energy industry is serious about securing its future, it must address this sprawl head-on. Visibility, standardisation, and accountability must become the new benchmarks.

Cybersecurity is not a matter of convenience or compliance. In the context of energy infrastructure, it is a matter of national resilience, economic security, and public safety.

This can include converting waste-to-energy, recycling e-waste for critical mineral recovery, and developing circular microgrids that maximise resource efficiency.
Lastly, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy offer crucial avenues for green investment.
These diverse opportunities highlight Africa’s strategic importance in the global shift towards a green economy.","At the forefront of this green industrial revolution is critical minerals beneficiation. Africa holds approximately 30% of the world’s mineral reserves, including vast deposits of critical minerals like cobalt, lithium, manganese, graphite, copper and platinum-group metals – essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems and energy storage solutions. Immense opportunity lies in moving beyond raw material extraction to value addition and beneficiation at source. This means investing in sophisticated processing plants and even integrated manufacturing facilities for battery components, or electric vehicle parts, directly within Africa. The African Union’s “African Green Minerals Strategy” explicitly highlights this potential, aiming to position Africa as a global hub for critical mineral processing, transforming its mineral wealth into genuine industrial power. For example, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia are already exploring alliances to develop regional battery manufacturing capabilities.

Another cornerstone of Africa’s green future is renewable energy generation. The continent possesses immense untapped potential in solar, wind and hydropower, boasting some of the best solar irradiation and wind resources globally. Investment opportunities span large-scale utility projects, which can feed into national and regional grids, as well as distributed generation solutions like rooftop solar for commercial and industrial users, and innovative off-grid solutions crucial for electrifying rural communities. The demand for clean energy is rising rapidly across Africa, driven by industrialisation needs, population growth and persistent energy access deficits. Countries like South Africa, through the recent adoption of the South Africa Renewable Energy Master Plan (SAREMP) and Namibia, through the adoption of its Namibia Green Industrialisation Blueprint are actively working towards further localisation of renewable energy manufacturing, creating additional opportunities for component production and assembly. Public-private partnerships (PPP) are crucial for financing and developing these large-scale renewable energy projects, particularly those designed to integrate into a future interconnected continental grid under the African Continental Free Trade Area.

Africa is also rapidly emerging as a potential global leader in green hydrogen production. Leveraging its abundant and low-cost renewable energy resources, countries like Namibia, South Africa, Morocco and Egypt have launched ambitious green hydrogen projects aimed at both domestic consumption and export to decarbonise heavy industries in Europe and Asia. Investment opportunities exist in the entire green hydrogen value chain, from electrolysis plants powered by vast renewable energy farms to critical infrastructure for storage and transport, such as pipelines and port facilities for green ammonia, e-methonal or liquid hydrogen. PPPs are essential for developing the significant infrastructure required for a green hydrogen economy.

Beyond raw materials and energy, there are substantial prospects in green manufacturing and the circular economy. Africa can establish itself as a hub for the production of components for renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles and other sustainable goods. The continent’s growing population and expanding consumer base provide a ready and increasingly affluent market for such products. Furthermore, there are significant opportunities in the circular economy, focusing on innovative waste management solutions, recycling and remanufacturing. This can include converting waste-to-energy, recycling e-waste for critical mineral recovery, and developing circular microgrids that maximise resource efficiency. Initiatives like the African Development Bank’s Africa Circular Economy Facility are supporting countries in developing national roadmaps and attracting investment into these high-potential areas.

Lastly, sustainable agriculture and the bio-economy offer crucial avenues for green investment. Investing in sustainable agricultural practices, such as precision farming and drought-resistant crops, can not only enhance food security for the continent but also significantly contribute to climate resilience and carbon sequestration. Opportunities also exist in the broader bio-economy, including the sustainable production of biofuels, bio-based chemicals and advanced biomaterials, leveraging Africa’s vast biodiversity and agricultural resources.

These diverse opportunities highlight Africa’s strategic importance in the global shift towards a green economy. However, realising this potential requires not only robust investment but also a clear understanding of the legal and regulatory landscape that governs these projects.",https://www.cliffedekkerhofmeyr.com/export/sites/cdh/images/news-thumbnails/industrials-manufacturing-04.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:05:46.701848

The U.S., already the world’s largest exporter of the superchilled gas with 91.3 million tonnes of annual capacity, should triple that before 2030 thanks to projects awaiting final investment decisions. Those come on top of 95.7 mtpa under construction, according to an April note to clients from Poten and Partners.

Trump has said he wants to vastly expand U.S. energy production and exports, and his administration has lifted a freeze on new LNG export permits, declaring an energy emergency.

The trade war has complicated construction of new plants, analysts and developers said, especially Trump’s 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum which are heavily used at LNG facilities. Some worry this might ultimately raise prices for U.S. LNG exports, making customers look for cheaper alternatives.

Still, at least seven proposed U.S. LNG projects are in various stages of development, with owners saying they intend to make a final investment decision in 2025, according the Reuters survey of recent earnings reports and analyst calls.

Five of the seven are expansions of existing facilities. The other two are on green field sites without existing infrastructure like port facilities: Energy Transfer’s ET 16.5 mtpa LNG plant at Lake Charles and Commonwealth LNG’s proposed 9.5 mtpa facility at Cameron, both in Louisiana.

Among companies expected to soon approve construction of additional export facilities are the two largest U.S. LNG exporters, Cheniere Energy LNG and Venture Global VG.

Cheniere is on track to approve this year its 5 MTPA expansion of its Corpus Christi, Texas plant, called mid-scale 8 and 9, the company’s CEO Jack Fusco said last Friday during its earnings call.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a “permit on mid-scale Trains 8 and 9, one of the key remaining steps ahead of an expected FID later this year,” Fusco said. FID stands for final investment decision.

Venture Global VG aims to approve the 28 MTPA CP2 project in Louisiana, the largest single LNG plant in the U.S., in the “middle of this year”, its CEO Mike Sabel said at an earnings call on Tuesday.

Last week, the company said it received the final supplemental environmental study on its CP2 plant. It also has its non-FTA export permit, allowing it to export to a broad range of markets.

“An essential permit ahead of our FID for phase one of the project, which is anticipated for the middle of this year,” Sabel told the earnings call.

Commonwealth LNG, Port Arthur LNG and Next Decade announced several long-term supply deals in 2025, building commercial momentum toward final investment decisions they promise will come this year.

TRADE HEADWINDS

Venture Global’s Sabel said increased steel, aluminum and other tariffs could raise the cost for CP2 by about 1%.

Sempra aims to make a final investment decision (FID) this year on phase 2 of its Port Arthur facility but will exercise patience to lock in favorable long-term economics, said Jeffrey Martin, Sempra’s SRE CEO.

“Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment may affect the timing of product development,” he said.

Since 2021, almost all U.S. LNG projects under construction have faced price escalation or cost overruns due to supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, high borrowing costs and other factors.

Woodside’s Louisiana LNG project price jumped by 31%, Next Decade’s Rio Grande facility increased by 29% and Port Arthur Phase 1 by 18% from the original pre-FID figures, said Alex Munton, director of global gas and LNG research at consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group.

He noted those increases hit largely before Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. Even if the White House totally cancels country-specific reciprocal tariffs, those 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and the 10% blanket levy remain in place putting pressure on LNG construction costs, Munton said.

Cheniere has promised to maintain capital discipline and will ensure it sells over 90% of its capacity before FID, said the company’s Chief Commercial Office Anatol Feyin.

Woodside, in contrast, said it gave the financial go ahead for its Louisiana LNG terminal with long-term sale contracts for only 1 MTPA in place.

“We saw the first FID in two years here. And very little commercial activity to underpin that,” Feyin told the earnings

call. “We’re not changing our stripes. We’ll stay disciplined.”

On Wednesday, Woodside announced it entered into a non-binding agreement with Saudi Aramco that could lead to the Saudis taking a stake in the Louisiana project

What else should we know about the November 2024 royalty hearing?","On Wednesday Arkansas’ Oil and Gas Commission will for the third time in 18 months consider what lithium extractors should pay mineral rights holders in royalties.

On the agenda tomorrow is an application filed by SWA Lithium, a joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor, known for its Empire Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of New York.

Standard Lithium has already gone before the commission twice for a royalty determination — first in December 2023 and then again in November 2024. Both times, questions were raised as to whether Standard Lithium and its co-applicants — in 2023, Lanxess; in 2024, Lanxess, Albemarle, Tetra Tech and ExxonMobil-subsidiary Saltwerx — had provided enough data to justify the proposed royalty rates.

Neither time resulted in a royalty being set.

The commission will have to decide if Standard Lithium’s new proposed 2.5% royalty rate and royalty structure are fair and equitable.

You can read more about the application itself here.

What’s the deal with lithium, anyway?

Multiple companies — from oil and gas behemoths like ExxonMobil, to major chemical companies like Lanxess and Albemarle, to relative-newcomers like Standard Lithium — are trying to get in on the valuable lithium reserves trapped in South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the earth.

Arkansas state officials have touted the economic benefits such industrial investments could bring to the state while passing legislation to incentivize it.

Albemarle, Lanxess and their predecessors have extracted this brine for decades, as bromine is also abundant in the fluid. Brine is also extracted as a byproduct of the region’s century-old oil and gas industry.

Companies have cited Arkansas’ extensive and unique regulatory structures as one of the points that makes the state attractive for developing a U.S. lithium industry. Now-retired AOGC director and current AOGC Commissioner Larry Bengal previously told the Advocate he believed Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with a brine statute.

A widely reported study from the U.S. Geological Survey last year estimated that the brines in the parts of the Smackover formation under South Arkansas held enough lithium to meet U.S. demand for decades. The study used machine learning to predict lithium quantities for the region using existing well data. However, one of the authors of the study told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the report said nothing on whether that much lithium could feasibly be extracted from the formation, saying the study was meant to provide a birds-eye view of the potential of the region as a whole.

Geologists have known about the high lithium content of South Arkansas’ brine for decades, but until recently, the technology to extract it profitably wasn’t there. Companies said they’ve already spent millions in pursuit of lithium in the state, even though those companies haven’t yet given the final green light for large-scale extraction projects.

Standard Lithium and Equinor’s SWA Lithium project has already been awarded hundreds of millions in federal funding to build up a lithium extraction operation in South Arkansas as part of federal investments into critical minerals and other supply chains that have increasingly become concentrated in China. Lithium is a key component of rechargeable batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.

That’s great and all, but how are they going to get lithium out of water?

In short, it’s a process called “direct lithium extraction,” or DLE. It’s similar to the process used to treat hard water, just on a much larger scale. It hasn’t been used at commercial scale to extract lithium in the U.S. before, but some companies in China already use it. It’s different from other lithium mining methods, such as hard-rock mining and evaporation pond methods.

Why does the royalty matter?

There are a few reasons. The first is that none of the companies that have expressed interest in growing a lithium extraction industry in South Arkansas can actually begin extracting lithium from brine for profit before the AOGC approves a royalty. They have said previously that having a set royalty is crucial in order to know how much a full-scale extraction project will cost.

The royalty is required by the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA), which first passed in the 1970s as a result of court cases that saw mineral rights owners demanding compensation from big chemical companies for diminishing the value of their owned mineral rights through the companies’ bromine operations, which would sometimes push spent brine towards their owned tracts and unextracted brine away from them. An amendment was added in the 1990s establishing the “other substances” provision, which sets the framework to determine royalties for substances extracted from brine other than bromine, such as lithium.

The second reason is that some, like former AOGC commissioner Mike Davis, believe the only real economic benefit many ordinary Arkansans will get from lithium extraction will come from royalty payments.

“When the drilling rigs are gone, when the completion process is complete, you’ve got two things left. You have the maintenance and you have the royalty income,” Davis said at the November hearing. “For the majority of the citizens and for the state of Arkansas itself, the real benefit to the mineral owners and royalty owners and citizens of the state of Arkansas will be the royalty that you gentlemen determine.”

Other issues affecting the 2024 royalty decision

The commission agreed with the opinion of Administrative Law Judge Charles Moulton that a royalty could be applied only to existing brine units — geographic areas approved by the commission for mineral extraction. However, the November applicants wished to apply their proposed royalty to “existing units … and proposed future units” within certain counties — but only after amending their application. Originally, they asked for a royalty determination for the entire Smackover Formation within specific counties.

Since then, both Standard Lithium and Saltwerx have applied for and received permission to create new brine units. You can read more about the brine units here.

Why wasn’t a royalty determined in the last two hearings?

The AOGC unanimously rejected the application it heard in November for a few reasons.

The state brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission must determine if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar.

One of the key hang-ups last year was that many people, the AOGC commissioners included, felt the royalty proposed by the so-called “Big 5” — Albemarle, Lanxess, Tetra Tech, Standard Lithium and Saltwerx — was not fair and equitable. The companies, for the most part, refused to provide any project data to justify the proposed royalty, citing antitrust concerns.

Multiple commissioners cited that refusal as the key reason they voted to reject the application in November, even as they said they believed the proposed royalty at the time, 1.82%, was not fair and equitable in the first place.

Similarly, the 2023 application filed by Standard Lithium and Lanxess ran into justification issues, with commissioners requesting the companies return with further documentation to support the proposal before they made a decision. Instead, the two companies withdrew the application and eventually signed onto the second application last summer.

Are all of the same companies involved in the royalty the commission is hearing this week?

No. Only Standard Lithium and Equinor, its partner in the SWA Project, are party to this royalty hearing. That means that if the commission decides to approve the proposed royalty, it would apply only to Standard Lithium’s and Equinor’s Reynolds Unit, which encompasses parts of Columbia, Lafayette and Miller Counties. It would not apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit, Tetra Tech’s Evergreen Unit, or any of Lanxess’ long-established brine units in Union County.

If the joint venture decides it wants to expand the royalty’s applicability to other units it establishes in the future, it would need to go back before the commission for another royalty determination.

What else should we know about the November 2024 royalty hearing?

The run-up to tomorrow’s hearing has been much quieter than last year’s hearing. Dozens of people objected to the 1.82% royalty proposed in the Big Five application last year.

The South Arkansas Minerals Association, a group representing mineral-rights holders, objected to the first proposed royalty in December 2023, and their objection led to the hearing being delayed from September to November so that the administrative law judge could hold a hearing on certain legal matters. Moulton’s recommendations to the commission after that hearing were largely adopted and played a role in why the Big Five application was rejected.

As of Friday, only one person had filed an objection to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application. Robert Reynolds, the president of SAMA, has not filed an objection, but told the Advocate he would be watching carefully to see if the applicants brought forward sufficient evidence to support their royalty proposal this time around.

President Donald Trump has signed seven CRA resolutions into law.

Resolutions signed by Trump

A Bureau of Ocean Energy Management rule protecting archaeological resources: In March, Trump signed a resolution introduced by Rep. Mike Ezell (R-MS) to overturn the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Protection of Marine Archaeological Resources rule.

The regulation was supposed to protect and identify archaeological resources on the Outer Continental Shelf before oil and gas operations could take place. The rule required surveys to be conducted of the area by a marine archaeologist who meets the Department of the Interior’s standards. Republicans argued that the rule blocked domestic energy production and burdened oil and gas lessees with costly surveys.

An Environmental Protection Agency rule on methane emissions: In March, Trump signed a resolution offered by Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) to undo an Environmental Protection Agency rule imposing an annual fee on oil and gas facilities that emit methane emissions exceeding a certain threshold.

A Department of Energy rule on refrigerators and freezers: This month, Trump signed a resolution from Rep. Craig Goldman (R-TX) canceling stringent Department of Energy standards for commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers under the agency’s Energy Conservation Program. The regulation aimed to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

A Department of Energy rule on water heaters: Trump also signed Rep. Gary Palmer’s (R-AL) resolution to undo DOE standards on gas-fired water heaters.

A Department of Energy appliance energy conservation program: Trump also signed Rep. Andrew Clyde’s (R-GA) resolution to cancel an energy conservation program run by the DOE that grants appliances a label that shows consumers they are energy-efficient.

A Department of Energy rule on walk-in coolers: Trump also signed a measure to cancel standards for walk-in coolers and freezers.

An IRS rule on crypto brokers: In April, Trump signed Rep. Mike Carey’s (R-OH) resolution canceling an IRS rule classifying some decentralized digital asset entities as brokers subject to reporting rules.

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on bank overdraft fees: In May, Trump signed into law a resolution overturning a CFPB rule that would have limited large banks’ ability to charge clients for overdrawing their bank accounts.

Resolutions sent to Trump’s desk

There are two CRA resolutions that have been sent to Trump’s desk to sign.

A National Park Service limiting ATVs in Glen Canyon: One measure awaiting Trump’s signature is Rep. Celeste Maloy’s (R-UT) resolution overturning a NPS rule limiting the use of all-terrain vehicles and other motor vehicles in environmentally vulnerable areas within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.

An Environmental Protection Agency rule on rubber tire factory pollution: Another measure on Trump’s desk is a resolution from Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) to eliminate the EPA’s new standards relating to hazardous air pollutants from rubber tire facilities.

Resolutions that have passed both chambers

Three California emission standards rules: The Senate last week passed three resolutions related to California vehicle emissions. One repeals California’s vehicle emissions waiver, granted by the Biden EPA, that allows the state to set stringent vehicle emission standards, which would encourage the use of electric vehicles and eventually ban gas-powered cars. The other standards that the Senate passed to overturn are state emission regulations on heavy-duty vehicles and nitrogen oxide emissions. The California rules are significant because they are followed by several other states.

A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule on regulation of digital wallets: Both chambers have passed a resolution from Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NE) to repeal a CFPB rule for supervising large nonbank companies that offer digital wallets or payment apps.

An Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rule ending expedited bank mergers: Both chambers have passed a resolution from Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) that would cancel an Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rule limiting expedited mergers under the Bank Merger Act.

Legislation that has passed one chamber

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rules on hydrogen vehicles: This month, the Senate passed a measure from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) that would cancel National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety rules for hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Federal Communications Commission: In January, the Senate passed a resolution from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to undo a Federal Communications Commission rule allowing E-Rate funds to subsidize off-campus use of Wi-Fi hot spots.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/trump-ngo.webp,N,,2025-05-27 10:11:03.493027

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-27 10:08:59+00:00,The Colorado Sun,"Congress likely killed Colorado's EV mandate, clean energy programs, environmental groups say","Michael Booth, Michael Booth Environment",,,,,https://coloradosun.com/2025/05/27/congress-colorado-ev-mandate-trump/,"“I think that this is going to block Colorado from implementing our Clean Car and Truck Rules for now.
Clean energy advocates also say the combined moves will hurt Colorado’s economy by wiping out thousands of jobs, from rooftop solar panel installers to battery makers to wind turbine electricians and mechanics.
Clean energy trade groups are calling for Senate changes, but do not appear overly hopeful.
They pointed to both an end to what they call unfair and unproductive clean energy subsidies, and opening up of more federal and offshore spaces to oil and gas drilling and expanded coal production.
The near-complete House rollbacks of Biden-era green energy subsidies last week were only the latest blows to national and Colorado environmental advocates.","Congressional actions in the past week essentially killed Colorado’s electric vehicle mandate and threaten billions of dollars in solar and wind power construction meant to ease greenhouse gas emissions and ozone, environmental and state political leaders said.

Congress overturned an EPA waiver granted to California to allow that industry-dominating state to ban fossil fuel vehicle sales by 2035, a move that Colorado officials say also negates copycat EV mandates passed by Colorado and a dozen-odd other states.

In 2023, Colorado air regulators voted to require 82% of new vehicles be EVs by 2032, and an increasing share of heavy trucks as well, going well beyond floors set by the EPA. They also required a study of how Colorado could match California’s fossil fuel car ban by 2035.

“I think that this is going to block Colorado from implementing our Clean Car and Truck Rules for now. States need the waiver to enforce their rules,” said Travis Madsen, transportation analyst with the nonprofit Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. “The approach here” — getting Congress instead of an EPA administrator to overturn the waiver “is unprecedented,” Madsen said.

“If it holds up in court, EPA may not be able to issue a similar waiver again in the future. Who knows what that means — it’s totally untested law,” he said. States are vowing to fight the Congressional overturn in court, Madsen said, but “while those challenges move forward, I’d bet that states will not be able to enforce the rules.”

Killing the California and copycat state plans by Congressional vote is at least “inappropriate” given that the General Accounting Office and the Senate parliamentarian said the Congressional Review Act could not be used that way, Colorado Energy Office CEO Will Toor said. California and others are vowing to fight Congress in the courts.

“States should have the ability to take action to protect clean air and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their state,” Toor said. “So we’ll see where that heads going forward. But it was a very disappointing action.”

Not only California, but all the other following states will lose their authority to establish standards more strict than federal rules, said John Boesert, president of the CalStart clean transportation trade group, in an interview. And the Trump administration has announced it plans to further reduce the already-weaker EPA targets for clean car and truck sales.

“The authority for California and other states to enact stronger standards has been an unqualified success,” Boesert said. “All of the states have been able to grow their economies while significantly improving air quality.”

Colorado’s targets for greenhouse gas reduction and finally meeting EPA ozone caps in the Front Range nonattainment area rely on the goal of nearly 1 million EVs on the road here by 2030. State officials said dealers and consumers were making good progress on that goal with the help of lucrative federal and state subsidies for EV buyers.

But wiping out the mandate on car manufacturers to produce steadily-rising percentages of EVs, along with Congressional budget action to eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit, could reverse that, environmental advocates said.

The budget passed by the U.S. House last week also erases many clean energy subsidies including tax credits that made it cheaper to develop utility-scale solar and wind farms, as well as battery and solar panel factories.

“Republicans are showing that they will take unprecedented congressional action to attack a growing and successful market to defend the desires of the polluting oil and gas industry,” said Sierra Club Colorado Chapter political director Garrett Royer.

“The Senate illegally and unconstitutionally” ended California’s EV mandate in a way that will “infringe on states’ rights to pursue clean air protections for their residents. We will continue to fight Congress’ attacks against our environment and affordability,” Royer said.

Clean energy advocates also say the combined moves will hurt Colorado’s economy by wiping out thousands of jobs, from rooftop solar panel installers to battery makers to wind turbine electricians and mechanics.

“The budget reconciliation bill that the U.S. House of Representatives passed overnight is deeply disappointing,” said Nate Bernstein, executive director of the union-backed Climate Jobs Colorado. “it completely guts the federal investments that we were counting on to create good union jobs and drive down energy bills. We hope this damaging proposal is walked back in the Senate.”

The Senate could make changes to the House version of the bill, including restoring some subsidies. But because the budgets are being voted on through a “reconciliation” process, they require only the small majority Republicans hold in both chambers and are not subject to a filibuster by Senate Democrats.

Clean energy trade groups are calling for Senate changes, but do not appear overly hopeful.

“The bill that House Republicans passed will devastate the Colorado solar industry, which accounts for over 8,000 employees and over $600 million of investment in solar installations in 2024 alone,” said KC Becker, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association and the regional EPA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

“I don’t want to sugarcoat it,” Toor said. “I think we are very concerned about all of the actions that both the administration and now potentially Congress are taking. I’m not sure that I can predict, but we’re certainly hopeful that cooler and wiser heads will prevail in the Senate than in the House.”

Western GOP lawmakers who supported both the killing of clean car waivers and the House budget were as jubilant as progressives were devastated. They pointed to both an end to what they call unfair and unproductive clean energy subsidies, and opening up of more federal and offshore spaces to oil and gas drilling and expanded coal production. They have been referring to the Obama and Biden clean economy efforts, dubbed the Green New Deal, as the “Green New Scam.”

The conservative-led Congressional Western Caucus said the House budget bill “saves Americans approximately $300 billion over 10 years by ending Biden-era electric vehicle mandates.”

U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Republican representing a rare swing constituency in Colorado’s 8th District that takes in north-metro suburbs along U.S. 85 into Greeley, supported the budget but also pointed to earlier statements advocating to preserve some clean energy tax credits that have boosted Colorado solar and wind farms and manufacturing. Evans calls it an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, expanding fossil fuel production while supporting new technology.

“With all this in mind, we request that any proposed changes to the tax code be conducted in a targeted and pragmatic fashion that promotes conference priorities without undoing current and future private sector investments which will continue to increase domestic manufacturing, promote energy innovation, and keep utility costs down,” Evans wrote in a letter to Congressional leaders.

Some Republican Senators now say they are hopeful the subsidy rollbacks, which went much farther in the final House version than some expected, can be reversed by the time the Senate votes.

The near-complete House rollbacks of Biden-era green energy subsidies last week were only the latest blows to national and Colorado environmental advocates.

Trump administrators had already frozen spending from a $5 billion Biden fund to build more EV charging stations around the country, calling it wasteful and mishandled spending. The Sierra Club, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and others have sued to end that freeze, saying the executive branch doesn’t have constitutional authority to reject Congressionally authorized spending.

The station-building program “benefits everyone, whether you drive an EV or not,” Sierra Club Executive Director Ben Jealous said. “And the only people who benefit from blocking it are big oil and auto executives seeking to keep us hooked on fossil fuel-powered cars.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rivencharger2-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1443&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-27 09:05:50.744797

Here's what consultants say about the industry's future.,Lakshmi Varanasi,,,,,https://www.businessinsider.com/nuclear-power-future-obstacles-2025-5,"Public sentiment is still a headwind There are 94 nuclear reactors in the United States, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.
Last October, Amazon invested $500 million in X-Energy, a developer of small nuclear reactors and fuel.
The Trump administration is also working to jumpstart nuclear reactor construction, building on Biden's ADVANCE Act last year, which sought to remove regulatory hurdles.
There are also lingering concerns about the government's capacity to mitigate nuclear disasters and nuclear power's association with nuclear weapons proliferation.
However, nuclear power remains only a ""medium-term solution,"" McKinsey said in a 2024 report on data centers and power.","It wasn't long ago that the very mention of ""nuclear"" was enough to unsettle people across the ideological spectrum.

Between the meltdown of a nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island, explosions in Chernobyl, and an earthquake-powered disaster at Fukushima, the one thing people seemed to agree on was that nuclear was a dirty, if not dangerous, word.

But times have changed, new insights and new data have emerged, and what once seemed unethical has been rebranded as clean, in every sense.

The nuclear energy renaissance — fueled by Big Tech investment, a more favorable legislative climate, and shifting public opinion — hinges on a change in perspective: Nuclear energy has the potential to be one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy on Earth.

But the construction of nuclear reactors in the United States — where nuclear accounted for 19% of electricity generated in 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration — is lagging compared to efforts in China and elsewhere, according to the Boston Consulting Group.

That's part of why consulting firms are searching for ways for nuclear energy companies to cut costs, improve efficiencies, and remove the obstacles holding up progress.

Public sentiment is still a headwind

There are 94 nuclear reactors in the United States, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute. And tech giants are investing considerably to bring new ones online.

Last October, Amazon invested $500 million in X-Energy, a developer of small nuclear reactors and fuel. Around the same time, Google said it would purchase nuclear energy from Kairos Power, a California-based company developing small modular reactors. The month before, Constellation Energy struck a deal with Microsoft to provide the tech giant with nuclear power for the next two decades by resurrecting part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.

The Trump administration is also working to jumpstart nuclear reactor construction, building on Biden's ADVANCE Act last year, which sought to remove regulatory hurdles. Trump issued four executive orders on Friday to accelerate the development of the domestic nuclear energy industry, touching on areas from fuel cycle development to reactor construction, testing, and licensing, to workforce training.

However, hurdles persist.

""Growth in nuclear power is projected to be almost flat to 2050 due to more stringent regulatory requirements than for other low-carbon energy sources, negative public perception, perceived safety issues, supply chain constraints, and uncertainty around waste disposal,"" McKinsey & Company wrote in its 2024 Global Energy Perspective.

Some of the persisting negative sentiment can be attributed to concerns about how the radioactive waste that nuclear reactors generate will be stored. The federal government once planned to direct all waste to Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but lawmakers and the public objected.

There are also lingering concerns about the government's capacity to mitigate nuclear disasters and nuclear power's association with nuclear weapons proliferation.

There is hope, however. In 2024, three-quarters of respondents, out of a sample of 3.5 million people used by Bisconti Research, said they favored the use of nuclear energy for electricity, up from about half in the 1980s and 1990s.

The efficiency of construction

Large-scale nuclear reactors require a significant investment in time and money. They necessitate significant upfront capital and require long construction windows that are often beset by delays, cost issues, and regulatory hurdles.

BCG says that the ""simpler the design, the better."" The firm said the optimal design should follow ""a 'design-for-manufacturing' approach, which has delivered compelling results in other industries such as aerospace and defense.""

The goal, according to BCG, should be to standardize the components and material needed for construction, along with reducing the number of construction steps to promote ""modularity,"" the firm said. That applies to both large-scale and small-scale reactors, Benjamin Vannier, managing director and partner at BCG, told BI by email. The AP1000, a large-scale pressurized water reactor, is an example of a reactor designed for modular construction, he added.

Modularity is perhaps the biggest trend in nuclear right now. There are a number of small modular reactor companies, like Oklo, which was until recently chaired by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman; TerraPower, which is backed by Bill Gates; and X-Energy, which Amazon invested $500 million in last year. These more compact nuclear reactors are designed to be built in factories and then shipped to sites for installation and are, therefore, easier to standardize for production.

The economics of scaling

Nuclear fission, which produces energy by splitting uranium atoms, releases almost no greenhouse gas emissions. Many AI executives consider nuclear fission the only reliable way to power their data centers.

Tech leaders are also excited by recent advances in fusion technology, which involves combining two atomic nuclei to release energy and is considered safer than fission. Type One Energy, funded by Gates, published research in March that shows there are no scientific barriers left to making commercial fusion a reality.

However, nuclear power remains only a ""medium-term solution,"" McKinsey said in a 2024 report on data centers and power. ""The timeline to scale nuclear so it can achieve rapid, repeated deployment is nearly a decade, while constraints on data center power are appearing today.""

It added, ""The early economics of nuclear are challenging compared with other energy options, and implementing various technologies to try to reduce its costs may or may not work.""

While power plants are relatively cheap to run in the long term and can last as long as 60 years, they require considerable upfront investment.

In a report published in 2017, the World Nuclear Association said that nuclear plants are strongly influenced by capital cost, which accounts for at least 60% of their total levelized cost of electricity, which is essentially a measure of a plant's economic efficiency. It is calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power plant over its lifetime by the total electricity output.

Generative AI may help improve efficiencies on the operating side. Rafee Tarafdar, the chief technology officer of Infosys, a global consulting firm, told BI that the firm is helping companies integrate AI into their plans.

""One proof of value that we built is: How do we use all the logs, all the sensors that come from all these machines in order to triage, predict failures, and help resolve issues much earlier,"" he said, in reference to the work the firm did with a large US energy company.

The consensus among consulting firms is that solving early construction bottlenecks is key to scaling nuclear energy as a viable power source for AI and beyond.",https://i.insider.com/682e624dac40ae2b0c9eb9f8?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:48.099976

India’s renewable advantage India’s vast solar and wind resources provide a strong base for green hydrogen production.","As the world races to address the climate crisis, green hydrogen emerges as both a promising solution and a potential disruptor in the clean energy landscape. Unlike conventional hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, green hydrogen is produced using renewable energy sources and emits zero carbon in the process. For India—committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070—green hydrogen is not merely an opportunity; it is a necessity.

Why green hydrogen matters

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity through electrolysis, is gaining global attention as a versatile and zero-emission fuel. Unlike grey hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, green hydrogen offers a clean energy alternative that can be applied across diverse sectors—transportation, industry, and power. It acts as both a fuel and an energy carrier, capable of stabilising grids by storing excess renewable power and meeting peak demand. More importantly, it plays a pivotal role in decarbonising “hard-to-abate” industries such as steel, cement, ammonia, and long-haul transport, where direct electrification is impractical or costly. For a developing country like India, green hydrogen is not just a technological opportunity—it is an essential enabler for sustainable growth. It bridges the gap between the present carbon-intensive infrastructure and a future powered by renewables. By integrating green hydrogen, India can balance economic development with environmental goals, making strides toward its 2070 net-zero target. The adoption of green hydrogen also offers energy security, reducing dependency on imported fossil fuels. As climate change intensifies, India must embrace green hydrogen as a strategic solution—both to meet its international climate commitments and to transition into a resilient, clean-energy economy.

For India, green hydrogen offers a pathway to reconcile economic development with environmental stewardship.

A bold beginning

India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, launched in January 2023 with Rs 19,744 crore, aims to produce 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen annually by 2030. The initiative supports over 125 GW of renewable energy and could reduce 50 MMT of CO2 per year while creating 600,000 jobs. Financial support under the SIGHT program and pilot projects in steel and shipping show India’s intent to lead in green hydrogen. These steps aim to align clean energy goals with national development..

To drive this mission, the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) program offers financial incentives—Rs 17,490 crore to support production and electrolyser manufacturing. Pilot projects in sectors like shipping and steel are already underway, including plans to retrofit vessels and develop green ammonia refuelling hubs at key ports. These are not just technical experiments; they are strategic moves to anchor India’s place in the global hydrogen economy.

India’s renewable advantage

India’s vast solar and wind resources provide a strong base for green hydrogen production. With 180 GW of renewable energy already installed and a 2030 target of 500 GW, India can produce green hydrogen affordably. Large corporations like Reliance and Adani plan major investments, potentially increasing production beyond the government’s targets. These efforts support India’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement, helping reduce carbon intensity and dependence on coal.

Green hydrogen could become the cornerstone of India’s clean energy strategy, combining low costs with global competitiveness.

Staying competitive in a global race

Green hydrogen costs currently range between $2.7-8.8/kg but are expected to fall to $2-6/kg by 2030. Countries like China are scaling fast, lowering global costs through technology and manufacturing dominance. India must stay competitive by expanding domestic electrolyser production, building full hydrogen value chains, and forming strategic partnerships. Government incentives—such as capital subsidies and tariff waivers—could help green hydrogen reach parity with fossil-based alternatives. With coordinated efforts, India can be a leader in the global hydrogen economy.

To stay competitive, India must act swiftly and strategically. Building robust domestic manufacturing capabilities is crucial—not just for electrolysers but for the entire green hydrogen value chain. India must also actively engage in global partnerships, secure access to critical minerals, and create a business environment that attracts both domestic and foreign investment.

Overcoming key challenges

India faces several hurdles—high capital costs, raw material dependence, safety issues, and limited infrastructure for hydrogen transport and storage. Financing is another major concern, especially in emerging markets. Innovative funding models and policy support are needed to attract investments. Environmental oversight is also essential, as hydrogen could indirectly affect greenhouse gases like methane and ozone. India must ensure robust monitoring to maintain its green credentials. Overcoming these issues is key to unlocking the full potential of green hydrogen.

Environmental safeguards also need to evolve. Though hydrogen is a clean fuel, it can indirectly impact greenhouse gas levels by affecting methane and ozone concentrations. India must therefore adopt strong monitoring and regulatory mechanisms to ensure that green hydrogen truly remains green.

A call to action

The National Green Hydrogen Mission is a strong first step, but India must adopt a whole-of-economy approach to scale its efforts. Integrating green hydrogen into national policies, trade strategies, and urban planning is crucial. International partnerships, such as with the EU, can support technology transfer and market access. India has a unique chance to lead the global green hydrogen movement. But quick action, bold investments, and strategic planning are needed to ensure long-term success and global leadership in clean energy.

India has a window of opportunity to lead the world in green hydrogen—but this window will not stay open forever. With bold leadership, targeted investments, and strategic global engagement, India can position itself as a clean energy powerhouse, proving that climate responsibility and economic ambition can go hand in hand.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-05-27%2Fjsg6rctk%2FGreen-Hydrogen.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:17.942663

Voters will take up the 46-article warrant, which includes a $7.68 million municipal operating budget, starting at 9 a.m. at the Shutesbury Elementary School.

The budget is up 5.8%, or $425,451, from this year’s $7.25 million, and includes a $1.78 million assessment for the Amherst Pelham Regional Schools. That assessment is increasing 7.8%, or $126,789, from this year’s $1.65 million assessment, with Shutesbury obligated to pay this amount because Amherst, Pelham and Leverett have already adopted their assessments toward the $37.08 million regional schools budget.

Also included in the town spending is the budget for the elementary school, up by 5%, or $124,241, from $2.47 million to $2.59 million. Other changes include boosting the administrative assistant position to $44,265, up $14,701, for 32-hour workweeks, and increasing health insurance payments by 19%, or $99,000, from $520,000 to $619,000.

Other spending will mostly be covered by free cash, with $50,000 going toward establishing a mitigation fund for PFAS contamination, and another $100,000 coming from the stabilization account. Another $30,000 in free cash will cover legal expenses related to protecting the town’s solar bylaw.

The warrant includes several capital purchases and repairs through free cash, including fixing the Highway Department grader for $16,600, buying a zero-turn lawn mower for the Highway Department for $11,400, completing Town Hall meeting room repairs for $10,000 and replacing the Town Hall fire alarm system for $8,648.

Finally, $8,000 in free cash will serve as matching funds for an $80,000 Rural Development Fund Grant that will evaluate sources of erosion into Lake Wyola and potential mitigation and management measures.

Several projects are being supported by Community Preservation Act money. They include $72,900 to restore, repair and preserve the recreational trails in the South Brook Conservation Area; $13,775 to develop a scope of work for dam repair and maintenance of the Lake Wyola dam; $9,000 to preserve, rehabilitate and restore historic gravestones at West Cemetery; and $4,000 to remove invasive plants and replace them with native species at the Top of the Lake Conservation Area.

Also, $6,482 in CPA spending will complete the work of fixing up the historic Town Common guideboard, with an additional $2,250 going toward building a concrete foundation base for the guideboard.

Green articles

The Energy and Climate Action Committee is seeking endorsement of the “Zero-Emission First Vehicle” policy and to repeal a policy adopted in 2011 in which only fuel-efficient vehicles are purchased.

The purpose of this is to “advance the economic, energy and climate sustainability of municipal operations by achieving long-term reductions in energy costs, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions,” with hopes to accelerate the adoption of emissions-reduction technologies and the transition of the fleet to all electric or other environmentally advantageous vehicles. The new policy does allow for the town’s purchases of such vehicles “as financially feasible and practicably appropriate.”

That committee is also recommending adoption of the state’s specialized energy, which will impact new construction and existing buildings by further reducing the climate impacts of buildings, with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector no later than 2050. This means the town will go beyond the existing stretch energy code.

Shutesbury voters will also be asked to commit to a “municipal decarbonization,” defined as the elimination of all on-site burning of fossil fuels in municipal buildings and vehicles, by 2050, in accordance with state climate goals.

Other bylaws and policies

A citizen petition is promoting the town as a safe and welcoming community, building on the “Honoring our Differences in a Safe Community” passed in 2017.

A petition also seeks support for Massachusetts Medicare for All, which would promote the idea of establishing a single-payer health care system in the state.

Revised rules for use of Lake Wyola are in the “Watercraft and Persons Using Lake Wyola” bylaw, last amended in 2014.

Sponsored by the Lake Wyola Safety and Boating Committee, this makes minimal changes to the current bylaw, which has rules setting the speed limit at 30 mph during the daytime, and 5 mph from dusk to dawn, requiring motorboats to go counterclockwise, limiting water skiing to daylight hours and requiring swimmers to be accompanied by a boat when they are 150 feet or more from shore.

The major change includes adding a statement to the bylaw that “reckless or unsafe boating is prohibited, including speeding near shorelines, swimmers, or docks, boating under the influence, and failing to maintain a proper lookout,” setting 8 a.m. as the specific dusk time and increasing the speed limit to 6 mph, which matches state regulations.

Matt Borowiec, who chairs the Lake Wyola Boating & Safety Review Committee, told the Select Board that there has been a strong push for more education, but not other major changes.

The Planning Board is updating the town’s zoning bylaws. One will remove the rate-of-growth provisions from the town’s zoning, because the effective dates have expired. A second will add language regulating so-called tiny houses, which are now included in the state building code. Finally, accessory dwelling units, which are now part of the state’s Affordable Homes Act and a protected use, will be included in the bylaws.

Town Clerk Grace Bannasch is bringing forward the amended “Dog Licensing And Control Bylaw” adopted in 2002. The impetus for this is the kennel license procedure and Ollie’s Law passed last year by the state Legislature, though this doesn’t impact any residents. The bylaw change will be to have the dog tag year be done on the calendar year rather than fiscal year, so licenses will be renewed in January, which Bannasch said will “make a lot more sense to the average dog owner than renewing them in July.”

Finally, another citizen petition seeks to create a bylaw requiring a landowner’s written permission before anyone is allowed to “trap, fish, hunt, or discharge a firearm, bow, or other weapon for the purposes of hunting animals, fish, birds, or any game on any private property in the town.”

Few revolutions happen as quickly or as quietly as the rise of the e-bike. In 2023 alone, 40 million e-bikes were sold globally, matching, and in many places outpacing, new car sales. That’s a scale of adoption not seen since the smartphone boom. And yet, this story is only just beginning.

One of the key reasons Upway was founded is our strong belief that the car industry, and car-centric culture more broadly, is already in decline and will no longer hold a dominant share of mobility within the next 50 years. Why? Because lightweight electric mobility is better suited to the demands of modern urban life, and more crucially, to the existential challenges we face today.

The car’s waning reign

The 20th century was undeniably shaped by the car. It brought freedom, convenience, and economic growth. Entire cities were designed around the automobile. But since the car’s golden era between 1970s and early 2010s, when production in the US ballooned from 30 to nearly 60 million vehicles annually, the cracks have started to show.

We now know the costs: cars account for around 60% of global transport emissions, and a staggering 80% of car trips in the US are under 10 miles. This is a distance that could easily be replaced by cleaner, smaller modes of transport.

Congestion, too, has spiralled out of control, costing the US economy an estimated $90 billion annually. In fact, last year the average American spent longer than a work-week sitting in traffic.

Then there’s the human toll. Road traffic accidents cause 1.2 million deaths per year, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. And despite decades of innovation, car-related deaths in the US have remained high, falling only 21% from 1991 to 2021, while countries like Spain saw reductions of up to 86%.

Add to this the growing body of evidence linking car emissions to pollution-related illnesses. The 2017 Lancet Commission attributed nine million deaths per year globally to pollution, many of which stem from fossil fuel combustion. These are not just numbers; they represent a massive public health failure that disproportionately affects the poorest communities worldwide.

At the same time global oil reserves, the lifeblood of the car market, are in long-term decline. Oil is a finite resource and experts warn that conventional reserves are being depleted faster than they are replaced. As demand continues to rise, especially from the transport sector, the industry is becoming increasingly reliant on harder-to-extract and environmentally damaging sources. This growing scarcity not only threatens energy security but also underscores the unsustainable foundation of a car-dependent economy.

The electric car: Not a silver bullet

It’s tempting to believe electric cars are the answer, but the data tells a more complicated story. EV production relies heavily on rare metals, which are resource-intensive and geopolitically volatile. Battery manufacturing has a large environmental footprint, and the global electricity grid remains largely fossil-fuel based. Transitioning to an all-EV fleet will take decades and the infrastructure to support that vision is nowhere near ready.

Meanwhile, insurance premiums are soaring, raw material costs are volatile, and car ownership is becoming increasingly unaffordable for younger and lower-income populations.

So where do we turn?

The case for e-bikes

Electric bikes provide a radically different and compelling alternative. Their carbon footprint is microscopic compared to cars: just 21g of CO₂ per kilometre.

E-bikes take up a fraction of the space that cars do in crowded cities, cause no local pollution, and are agile enough to dodge traffic. They’re increasingly diverse in function too, covering use cases from daily commuting to heavy-duty cargo hauling.

Affordability is a major part of the equation. Consider the cost breakdown: a typical car priced just under $50,000 loses around $4,000 in value each year. Factor in fuel, maintenance, insurance, and financing, and you’re looking at an annual outlay of around $10,000. In contrast, an e-bike might cost around $2,500, with depreciation of just $250 per year. When you add up the significantly lower maintenance and insurance costs, the total annual spend comes to roughly $725—a fraction of what it costs to run a car.

It comes as no surprise then, that e-bikes are already outselling electric cars in the US. In 2021, e-bike sales surpassed those of electric cars, with Americans buying around 800,000 e-bikes compared to estimated 650,000 electric vehicles. This milestone went largely unnoticed in mainstream discourse but signals a fundamental shift in how people are choosing to move.

This shift is being turbocharged by policy. From New York’s congestion pricing scheme, to Paris converting four-lane roads into bike boulevards, and California, Vermont and Minnesota offering e-bike incentives, governments are beginning to dismantle car-first infrastructure in favour of more sustainable options. Cities like Milan and NYC are building hundreds of miles of protected lanes.

Why second-hand is the key

If we want to democratise this movement, we must make e-bikes more accessible. That’s where the second-hand market comes in.

At Upway, we’ve built our business around three core pillars: trust, affordability, and choice. By refurbishing high-quality e-bikes and offering them at up to 60% off the retail price, we’re lowering the barrier to entry and giving people a reliable alternative to car ownership.

The opportunity is enormous. With e-bike sales projected to nearly double by 2030—reaching 77 million units annually—a thriving resale market will be essential to meet demand sustainably. And unlike electric cars, which depreciate rapidly and are expensive to maintain, e-bikes are simpler, cheaper, and easier to reuse.

Make no mistake: cars will still play a role, particularly for rural travel, freight, and users with mobility needs. But for the vast majority of short urban trips, the kind that clog roads, pollute air, and waste time, there is a better way.

The transition away from car dominance is not just desirable; it’s inevitable. What’s exciting is that we’re not waiting for the future to arrive, it’s already happening. And it’s arriving on two wheels.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Upway-Maxime-Renson-fotor-20250214162341.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:18.103756

Driven by AI, the US will consume more electricity to process data in 2030 than it will to manufacture all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to a recent report from the International Energy Agency.

If data centers cannot get the power they need, their growth will be stifled — and rate payers will revolt if they are asked to bear the cost of the utility upgrades needed to serve those data centers.

Utilities are recognizing that the centralized grid approach to generating and distributing power, which has reigned for a century, isn’t always the most effective way to provide quick time-to-power. Thus, it is no surprise that utilities are increasingly turning to onsite or distributed power solutions which can be installed fast and supplement grid power.

Among the host of approaches, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) represent a proven, flexible, scalable technologythat empowers utilities to deliver clean, resilient power quickly, when and where it's needed most, often deployable in months versus years.

For energy leaders confronting mounting capacity constraints and growing interconnection queues, SOFCs represent not just a response, but a strategic advantage.

How fuel cells work

A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that generates electricity and heat by directly converting the chemical energy of a fuel to electric energy through a reaction with oxygen, without combustion. Unlike traditional power generation, which burns fuel to drive turbines or pistons, fuel cells use a cleaner, more efficient reaction that significantly reduces the generation of criteria pollutants.

The basic principles of fuel cells have been known since the mid-1800s, but it was not until the 1960s that practical systems arrived and gained prominence in NASA space missions. Today, there are many varieties of modern fuel cell technologies, and they are used in everything from vehicles to large-scale power plants.

Solid oxide fuel cells stand out because of their high efficiency, long life and lower operating costs. While other types of fuel cells use precious metals, corrosive acids or molten materials to generate electricity, SOFCs use a solid ceramic electrolyte coated with proprietary inks. Fuel and air pass over different sides of the fuel cell, while oxygen ions pass through the electrolyte and recombine with fuel elements to release electrons that generate electricity. Operating very quietly at around 850˚C, SOFCs achieve high thermal efficiencies and have great reliability, given their small number of moving parts.

The technology is compact and scalable, enabling utilities to install it and bring it online quickly, then expand it easily as customers’ power needs grow. Multiple SOFCs can be stacked into modules that can be combined to form power generation systems tailored to customer needs. Their modularity means capacity is limited only by available space. Bloom Energy, a leader in onsite power solutions, can deliver up to 100 MW of electricity in an acre, more than twice the power density compared to traditional combustion generation technologies.

Given their operational profile, SOFCs are not just backup power options: They serve as primary power providers for multi-technology systems, where they complement other energy resources. SOFC power systems can operate as either grid-connected or standalone resources, offering flexibility and supporting resilience strategies such as operating during outages.

In fact, SOFCs even eliminate the need for backup power by offering a cleaner and more cost-effective alternative to traditional generation, such as diesel generators. They also offer increased electrical reliability and improved energy security because they produce power at or near the point of consumption, so they do not require miles of high-tension power lines.

SOFC power generation can achieve commercial operation faster than traditional solutions

Utilities can benefit from fuel cell systems in several ways. One major advantage is reducing the time to power for new large-load customers, such as data centers, manufacturing facilities or hospitals. Rather than waiting for Transmission & Distribution upgrades, utilities can deploy fuel cell systems directly at the customer site, bypassing long interconnection queues or bridging the power gap while transmission and distribution infrastructure is built.

“Fuel cells are a win-win move for utilities with power-hungry data center customers,” said Kris Kim, Vice President, Global Power & Utilities for Bloom Energy. “The utility limits the fuel cell project economics to the onsite fuel cell customer, whichultimately bears the cost of the system. That satisfies the utility commission because there's no impact to the rest of the ratepayers. Meanwhile, the customer gets power faster, the utility remains the energy provider, and no other ratepayers are affected. Everyone wins.”

This is not just theory: Utilities have already started using fuel cells as a cost-effective alternative to billion-dollar grid investments. For example, Consolidated Edison avoided a $1.2 billion system upgrade by incentivizing 52 MW of local energy efficiency and distributed generation projects, which included storage, demand response, and fuel cells, at a cost of just $200 million.

In addition to faster capacity deployment, SOFC systems are also fuel-flexible. SOFCs can operate on natural gas, biogas, hydrogen or blends, enabling utilities to meet today’s needs while preparing for the future. SOFCs do not require additional water during normal operation, enhancing their sustainability. And because there is no combustion used for power generation, they emit almost no smog-forming pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.

Finally, fuel cells support decarbonization goals by simplifying carbon capture and sequestration and helping customers achieve near-zero carbon power, while still having a reliable, consistent source of power.

“Because SOFCs can operate on different fuels, the technology is future-proofed for customers who value decarbonization and want the ability to use different fuels as they become more widely available,” Kim said.

Infrastructure isn’t being built fast enough, and supply-side solutions are struggling to keep up. But what if the answer has been right under our roofs all along?

Welcome to the new frontier of grid reliability: the rise of residential Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).

The rise of residential DERs

DERs are transforming the way energy is generated, stored, and consumed. Devices like rooftop solar panels, home batteries, smart thermostats, EV chargers and electric water heaters aren’t just saving homeowners money, they’re becoming strategic grid assets.

Once these technologies were considered fringe or supplemental; now foundational to a distributed, resilient energy system. And the numbers reflect it. According to Guidehouse Insights, flexible residential DER capacity is expected to triple from 28.4 GW in 2023 to more than 96 GW by 2032.

That’s not just growth, it’s grid-scale transformation.

Virtual power plants: Real value

When aggregated at scale, these devices combine into what’s known as a Virtual Power Plant (VPP), a coordinated network of DERs that collectively responds to grid conditions. Think of it as a community-powered solution, where households work together to balance supply and demand.

And the value to utilities isn’t just theoretical. A 2023 report from The Brattle Group estimates that VPPs could provide up to 60 GW of capacity in the U.S. at 40–60% of the cost of traditional supply-side alternatives. That equates to $15–35 billion in potential savings over the next decade.

VPPs help utilities:

Reduce peak demand without major infrastructure investments

Mitigate blackout risk during extreme weather events

Advance decarbonization efforts with clean, distributed assets

The time to act is now

With flexible load adoption on the rise and DER ownership growing rapidly, utilities have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape the future of energy delivery.

Several key trends are converging including increasingly affordable smart home and electrification measures, and strong public interest in sustainability, resiliency and energy savings. To capitalize on these trends, utilities should go beyond traditional infrastructure planning. This moment calls for a strategic shift from traditional grid management to proactive customer engagement.

The path forward: Partner with experience

Turning DER potential into real capacity requires more than just technology. It requires trust, education, and thoughtful program design.

That’s where Franklin Energy comes in.

We partner with utilities to deliver turnkey residential load management programs integrating smart devices, customer behavior insights and grid-optimization strategies into seamless solutions.

Besides Sembcorp, the strategic partnership includes a Malaysian consortium established by the country’s utility company Tenaga Nasional and its national oil company Petronas, as well as a Vietnamese technical services company for the energy sector, PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PTSC), which is a member of PetroVietnam, the country’s state-owned oil company.

The consortia will focus on unlocking Vietnam’s renewable energy resources, particularly offshore wind power, as a source for green electron generation and to supply clean electricity across borders, the four entities said in a joint statement on Monday (May 26).

“This alliance reflects the growing momentum towards a regionally integrated Asean power grid,” it read.

The partners will also evaluate the feasibility of exporting renewable energy from Vietnam to Malaysia and Singapore via a new subsea cable, which will pass through the national grid of Peninsular Malaysia. There is also the possibility of adding more renewable energy generation and storage that is reliable and consistent in its supply.

The statement said: “To this end, the consortia will work closely with the relevant national authorities throughout the development process, seeking necessary approvals at various project phases, and paving the way for this significant regional power integration and energy interconnection.”

It added that the agreement, inked on the sidelines of the ongoing Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur during Malaysia’s stint as Asean chair, marked “a significant step forward in operationalising the tripartite collaboration and affirmed a shared commitment to advancing cross-border renewable energy trade”.

“This milestone reflects growing momentum in the realisation of the Asean power grid, reinforcing regional cooperation towards a more resilient, sustainable and interconnected energy future.”

This partnership aims to open pathways for a scalable model of cross-border renewable energy cooperation in South-east Asia, which would position the region as a global leader in collaborative decarbonisation and energy transition.

Wong Kim Yin, chief executive officer of Sembcorp Industries, said that this agreement highlights Singapore’s strategic role as a demand centre and a key enabler of cross-border power imports to support its decarbonisation goals.

“We are committed to support Asean’s low-carbon transition through shared infrastructure and strengthened partnerships,” he added.

Tenaga’s chief executive officer Megat Jalaluddin Megat Hassan and Petronas chief executive officer Tengku Muhammad Taufik – who are members of the Malaysian energy consortium – said in a joint statement that the country’s participation in this initiative reflects its strong commitment to the vision of establishing an Asean power grid, which aims to strengthen regional energy security through the creation of a power transit hub.

“This tripartite partnership is a step forward in advancing transnational green infrastructure, tapping into Vietnam’s renewable energy potential, and delivering stable, low-carbon electricity to communities and businesses,” they added.

Vietnam’s Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính had previously highlighted offshore wind as a national priority.

By participating in this trilateral collaboration, Vietnam aims to catalyse new economic opportunities, stimulate sustainable growth and generate quality employment, the statement said.

Strengthen policy levers The official support for investment and demand stimuli needs policy enablers to accelerate the market uptake.
This provides direction to the EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government.","Within a tight timeframe of 2026-2030, both the automobile industry and the battery manufacturing industry — that have qualified for production linked incentives (PLI) — are expected to make huge investments to localise manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and components and ensure the market uptake of the new production to avail of the incentives.

Yet, the regulatory enablers to create committed market demand to absorb this investment within the same time frame are uncertain.

Similarly, under different demand incentive programmes, the consumers are also required to absorb an assigned number of EVs to stimulate a much larger market demand to move towards the intended ambition of at least 30 per cent fleet electrification by 2030 or even higher level for two-three wheelers. But the current annual market penetration is still hovering at only 6.5 per cent.

The continuous policy flip flop on the expected regulatory target for EV market penetration is making the investment climate as well as the trajectory of zero tailpipe emissions transition, uncertain.

Risking localisation

Even when the official policy is so deeply interested in pushing its industry to localise the value chain and use demand incentives to create a critical mass of market demand, the policy steps on setting firm targets for time-bound upscaling of the EV transition, is weak and hesitant. There is no firm signal.

Take for instance, the PLI schemes for local manufacturing of 50 GW of advanced chemistry cell and battery storage with support of Rs 25,938 crore by 2030. The beneficiary firms under this scheme are required to achieve a domestic value addition of up to 60 per cent within five years and make mandatory investment of Rs 225 crore /GWh for committed manufacturing capacity within two years and sell between 2025 and 2029 to access the PLI incentives within this period.

So far, three beneficiary firms have been allocated a total capacity of 30 GWh. The information from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) statement of December 2024 shows only a capacity of 1 GWh is pilot-run by Ola Cell Technologies Private Limited. Where is the policy to create a market for 50 GW within that time frame?

If industry has to sell at least 30 GW of batteries by 2030, the current fleet of EVs are absorbing just about 4 GWh of battery (as of 2023) — according to the S&P Global. According to the estimates of the International Council on Clean Transportation, the FAME incentive for 1 million electric two-wheelers can create demand for only about 2.3 GWh of battery cells. The larger demand for GWh scale of battery development will come from four wheelers as their battery capacity is about 10 to 20 times larger than the electric two-wheelers. Only scale can make the PLI scheme more viable by 2030. But what will change dramatically in the next five years without strong policy enablers and levers?

Similarly, in the case of the PLI Scheme for Automobile and Auto Components scheme that has been extended by one year to 2027-28, the incentive will be provided for determined sales for a total of five consecutive financial years, starting from the financial year 2023-24 to 2027-28.

Yet again, the PIB information shows that of the Rs 25,938 crore allocated, the actual disbursement of the aggregate incentive is only about Rs 322 crore (1.2 per cent) for FY 2023-24 — the first performance year of the scheme, that has been disbursed only in FY 2024-25.

It’s too little and too late. While industry needs to be pushed to ramp up its assembly line quickly, firm policy signals are also needed on the expected scale of the market to be supported by regulatory targets.

Already, the massive committed investments for incentive support (adding up the PLIs and all the incentive programmes), adds up to Rs 74,023.33 crore until 2030. The PLI schemes have further attracted more proposals of additional investment from the industry reflecting the market interest. But this has to materialise.

There is a significant lesson in the first generation compressed natural gas programme in Delhi when its market was created with a firm regulatory mandate when the conventional and incremental technologies of petrol and diesel dominated.

Moreover, the government’s own investments in supply chain of critical mineral supply for a self-reliant ecosystem also requires certainty in the EV industry roadmap.

Strengthen policy levers

The official support for investment and demand stimuli needs policy enablers to accelerate the market uptake.

Need state level drivers: It is encouraging how some state governments are coming forward to accelerate the EV transition.

The most significant is the lead taken by the Maharashtra government to set the overall as well as vehicle segment-wise electrification targets in its newly released ‘Maharashtra Electric Vehicle Policy 2025’ this month. While aiming for 30 per cent electrification of all new vehicles by 2030, it has apportioned further targets to vehicle segments — 40 per cent of all new 2/3 wheelers, 30 per cent of new cars, 25 per cent of the of four-wheeler goods carriers, 40 per cent of buses, among others, by 2030. The policy also provides for state-level incentives for a fixed number of vehicles in each category. The passenger vehicles will also be exempted from toll tax. This policy has not been diluted by including incremental, alternative fuel-powered internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies and hybrids.

Similarly, the new draft EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government under discussion has aimed for an ambitious 95 per cent fleet electrification based on battery operated fully EVs in the time frame of 2027-30.

Further, the Supreme Court has asked all government owned, public institution and public undertaking-owned vehicles in Delhi to be EVs. This provides direction to the EV policy 2.0 of the Delhi government.

From this perspective, it will be beneficial if the recent advisory from the Commission for Air Quality Management — that has put both EVs and the alternative fuel-powered ICEs including CNG, ethanol and hybrid modes in the same bracket as the EVs — to further refine and develop a more differentiated policy approach to support rapid electrification for clean air and to support the Delhi government’s ambition.

This is much needed in this polluted region, as a 2025 study from the National Institute of Advanced Studies has shown that if Delhi achieves full EV adoption, the highest reduction in ambient PM2.5 concentration will be possible with a 26 per cent reduction in mortality, related healthcare costs, 13 per cent in morbidity costs, and 27 per cent in per capita healthcare costs.

Need central drivers: At the same time, nationally, more stringent fuel economy norms and zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandates are needed to build strong obligation for the industry to quicken the pace of electrification across segments.

While efforts are underway to develop these norms for two wheelers and heavy duty segments, the car norms have been revised. But the draft corporate average fuel consumption standards (CAFÉ) for cars that was put up for consultation way back in April, is not yet out.

The proposed CAFÉ III and IV norms are proposed to be 91.7gCO2/km for the period 2027-2032 and 70gCO2/km during 2032-37. This needs to be firmed up immediately even though there is a scope of further tightening of these norms. As a reference, by 2030, the European Union (EU) would begin to enforce the standard 49gCO2/km that will require massive electrification.

India’s draft norms need to achieve the desirable increase in the actual and absolute EV numbers. The system of giving extra points or super credits to different technology approaches to meet the norms need to create stronger opportunities for EVs and not the incremental technologies including alternative fuels or hybridisation that are well-established technologies for improving fuel efficiency of the ICE vehicles. These super credits need to taper off.

Placing regulatory obligations through ZEV mandate can be a stronger driver of change.

Create policy stakes in new industrial transition

Despite the challenges, the reality is that even with the current policy signals and the incentive programmes, industrial investments in EV manufacturing have begun to expand and the product portfolio is diversifying.

There is, therefore, no room for policy uncertainty and turnaround anymore.

This change is evident in the official information on the domestic value addition certification (DVA) from the testing agencies. As per the PIB statement of March 27, 2025, six applicants under the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) category have received DVA certification for 66 variants, while seven applicants under the Component Champion category have received DVA certification for 22 variants.

According to the available information, the first movers are Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, and Ola Electric. Mahindra & Mahindra is the first company to meet the DVA criteria in the three-wheeler category, while Tata Motors is the first company to meet the DVA criteria for both four-wheeler and bus categories. Ola Electric is the first two-wheeler company to meet the DVA criteria. Individually these companies have achieved noticeable EV share in their total annual production.

The growing industry interest in manufacturing is also evident in the fact that a total of 115 companies have filed 120 applications under the PLI scheme for automobiles and auto components. Of these, 85 applicants have been approved. This also reflects the optimism in the market.

Frontrunners, including Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra and MG Motors dominate EV car sales. A Centre for Science and Environment analysis of the VAHAN database for the year 2023-24 shows rapid diversification of car models and variants from 15 in 2021 to 30 in 2024.

There is higher diversity in vehicle models and improved range for the same price range, reduced battery prices and improved battery energy densities. Upcoming models are bridging the price diversity gap, and integrating advanced features.

Similarly, e-two-wheeler models have increased from 195 models in 2021, to over 350 models today. The e-two-wheeler segment that was primarily start-up led, has now seen entry and growing market share of the traditional OEMs including Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS. Considerably more dormant demand can be unlocked in all segments with reliable charging infrastructure.

Future is electric

Clearly, there is no scope of turning back to stop India from developing an electric vehicle programme as a self-reliant industrial policy to meet the needs of climate and clean air action, industrial development, and clean energy transition in the automotive sector.

Australia’s Queensland cancels planned 450MW wind farm

Sydney, 26 May (Argus) — Australian state Queensland's Liberal National Party (LNP) government has cancelled the proposed 450MW Moonlight Range wind farm, following a majority of public submissions supporting the rejection. The government received over 550 submissions, 142 from local residents, with 85pc supporting a review of the project's application, according to a press statement from deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie released today. The project — located northwest of Rockhampton — included 88 wind turbines, a battery energy storage system and the clearing of 434 hectares of vegetation. Developer Greenleaf Renewables expected the project to start construction by 2026. Moonlight Range was originally approved by the State Assessment Referral Agency in December last year. But the new LNP Queensland government vowed to tighten regulations for wind power in January this year, ensuring that local communities must be consulted on new wind farm developments. This resulted in wind projects being delayed, allowing for the consultation period. The previous Queensland government passed the Clean Economy Jobs Bill in April 2024, which includes a 75pc emissions reduction target by 2035 and net zero by 2050. The new government will provide a Net Zero Roadmap and Energy plan by 31 December. Brisbane-based environmental lobby Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) is urging the government to accelerate its planning for the renewable energy sector. But the state LNP government has vowed to keep coal-fired power stations. Black coal-fired power contributed 64.2pc of the state's energy demand in 2024, according to Australian platform Open Electricity.

UK N2EX peak-load discount reaches record in May

London, 22 May (Argus) — Peak-load power on the UK's N2EX day-ahead spot market has cleared at its widest discount to the base load this month, driven by rising solar generation and falling national demand. The N2EX has cleared at £75.92/MWh ($85.66/MWh) for base load so far this month, while peak-load hours have delivered at £70.23/MWh. This is on track to be the widest peak-base discount on record in the UK, surpassing the peak discount of £4.40/MWh in August last year — which came amid record low peak demand for the month and unseasonably strong wind output. UK solar generation has averaged 7GW in peak hours so far this month, up from 6.2GW last month and 4.7GW in May last year. In these hours, solar has accounted for around 22.5pc of domestic generation, the highest share for any month on record. Embedded solar output during peak hours for the remainder of the month is currently forecast at 6.1-10.4GW, peaking on 23 May and bottoming out on 24 May. And national demand is forecast to range 16.0-22.4GW over the same period, with peak demand ranging 14.1-23.9GW. Solar output is on track to generate more power than gas-fired units during peak-load hours for the second time on record after August last year. Gas-fired generation has been 6.2GW in peak-load hours so far this month, around 800MW below solar. In comparison, peak-load gas burn was just 50MW below solar in August last year. The rise in solar generation has also continued to weigh heavily on the UK's net imports in the hours around midday. Net imports during base-load hours have stood at 3.9GW so far this month, down from 4.3GW in April and well below 4.8GW in May last year. Imports have only been around 4.6GW in settlement periods 27-28, between 13:00-14:00 local time, below 5.9GW during the same interval last year and 5.1GW in 2023. A decline in peak-load demand compared with previous years has also weighed on power prices in these hours. UK national demand has been 22GW so far in May, the lowest for the month aside from May 2020. But demand in peak hours has been around 200MW lower than in May 2020 at 21.7GW, while late-night and early morning demand has been 1GW above 2020 levels. This has largely been driven by a rapid increase in embedded solar for self-consumption in recent years, which could accelerate further with the recently passed Great British Energy Act, allocating £200mn for rooftop solar and other renewable energy schemes in 7,000 schools, hospitals and community buildings. The bulk of solar installations in the UK are between 0-4kW, totalling 1.4mn as of March and equivalent to 4.2GW, or 23pc of the UK's total solar capacity, government data shows. Some 73pc of the new solar installations in March were on residential buildings, adding a total of 68MW. And 3.3GW between transmission and distribution-connected solar projects won contracts for difference in the last allocation round held last year. Almost 1.1GW of this is due on line in 2026-27 and 2.2GW in 2027-28.

US could undermine global climate co-operation: Podesta

London, 22 May (Argus) — The global climate community will have to pay close attention to the fact that the administration of US president Donald Trump ""may do whatever they can to undermine global co-operation in the energy transition"" in forums such as the G7 and the UN Cop 30 climate summit, former US government climate advisor John Podesta told the Financial Times Climate and Impact Summit Europe today. ""I hope people will resist them,"" he said, after pointing out that during Trump's first term, the US administration was ""essentially… passive"" on the climate on a global stage. Podesta said that through Trump's attacks on former president Joe Biden's clean energy-supporting Inflation Reduction Act , the US has ""handed a victory particularly to China"". The act had become an energy transition model around the world, Podesta said, pointing to the EU's Green Industrial Deal. ""The way to decarbonise and deal with climate change is through investment, innovation and technology… and what we have done is thrown in the towel and thrown in the hand"", he said. ""There was I think, bi-partisan consensus in the US and consensus in Europe that we need to react to [China's domination in the green industry sector],"" he added, saying that there is an economic security dimension with leaving China in a dominant position. Clean energy deployment in the US is likely to stay robust in the short term, he said. Some Republican state governors have raised objections to the administration's rollback of clean energy support, but business investing in that area is keeping its collective head down, Podesta said, largely because ""the administration has been engaged in a process of intimidation"". Podesta said that there remains significant sub-national action in the US, but warned that the Trump administration is trying to undermine that too. The administration has moved to ""attack the underlying science"" and the ""human capital"" in institutions such as US climate and weather agency the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Podesta said. ""If you eliminate all the information sources maybe the problem goes away"", he added. The government has already pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement and could withdraw from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) — the UN's climate body. But there are legal issues around this, including whether the government may need a ""supermajority"" in the Senate, Podesta said. ""The law has not been a constraint on this government,"" Podesta added.

Iraq signs integrated energy deal with China’s Geo-Jade

Dubai, 22 May (Argus) — Iraq's oil ministry has signed an agreement with China's Geo-Jade Petroleum and local firm Basra Crescent to expand the capacity of the 20,000 b/d Tuba oil field and develop a suite of downstream and power assets, in a move that mirrors recent integrated energy deals with international partners. A key component of the South Basrah Integrated Energy Project will be to raise Tuba's production capacity to 100,000 b/d, oil minister Hayan Abdulghani said at the signing ceremony in Baghdad on 21 May. The project will also include processing of up to 50mn ft³/d of associated gas. Downstream components include a 200,000 b/d refinery, a 620,000 t/yr petrochemical plant and a 520,000 t/yr fertilizer facility. A 650MW thermal power plant and a 400MW solar plant will also be part of the project, Abdulghani said. No financial details or project timelines were disclosed. The agreement marks a further step in Geo-Jade's expansion in Iraq, following its successful participation in the country's fifth and sixth licensing rounds. While the company now holds multiple upstream assets in Iraq, it has yet to bring any into production. The deal follows a similar multi-billion dollar agreement signed with TotalEnergies in 2023 , which bundled gas processing, water treatment and solar power with development of the Ratawi field. In February this year, BP signed a major upstream deal with Iraq that also includes power, water and potentially exploration.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

Sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and more than a half dozen environmental groups have alleged in a lawsuit that the Trump administration has indefinitely and unlawfully frozen funds for a nationwide electric vehicle program.

The complaint was filed on Thursday last week in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Plaintiffs’ attorneys are asking the judge to require the Trump administration to unfreeze the funds and distribute them to the states according to a formula established by Congress.

During the Biden administration, Congress appropriated $5 billion for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, also known as NEVI, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021. The money would have been disbursed each year to all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, to build a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

“Transportation is the leading source of climate pollution in the U.S., and halting the NEVI program directly threatens our progress toward clean, reliable transportation options — especially in the Southeast, where EV infrastructure is still catching up,” said Megan Kimball, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“In rural and urban areas alike, more charging access means cleaner air, economic growth, and real savings for families. We’re defending that future.”

The legal challenge coincided with a Government Accountability Office report published Thursday that found the U.S. Department of Transportation is unauthorized to withhold the congressionally appropriated funds. The Transportation Department could petition Congress to pass a law to rescind the funds or change the NEVI program, the GAO wrote, but it can’t act unilaterally.

A department spokesperson said in a prepared statement that the GAO report ​“shows a complete misunderstanding of the law” and ​“conflicts with Congress’ intent.”

Less than three weeks after Trump was elected to a second term, the Transportation Department ordered states to stop distributing their funds for fiscal years 2022-2025, worth about $2.7 billion. States could reimburse contractors for money already spent, but no new funding could be obligated.

DOT justified the funding freeze by saying the Federal Highway Administration was ​“updating the NEVI Formula Program Guidance to align with current policy and priorities.”

The GAO report concluded that the Transportation Department erroneously froze funding when it determined that funding was available only for signed project agreements. Instead, the GAO wrote, the effective date for funding was much earlier: when the law made money for the program available for obligation.

Some agencies delay their funding distribution while trying to comply with legal requirements for a program, the GAO wrote. In the NEVI case, however, DOT imposed requirements that exceed what the law prescribes. For example, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act requires states to submit plans to DOT, but does not provide authority for the secretary of transportation to approve or disapprove such plans.

A DOT spokesperson said the GAO was ​“cherry-picking language in the program statute.”

The agency is updating NEVI program guidance, according to the spokesperson, ​“because the implementation of NEVI has failed miserably, and DOT will continue to work in good faith to update the program so it can be utilized more efficiently and effectively.”

Attorneys for the environmental groups — including CleanAIRE NC, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, West End Revitalization Project, Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council — wrote that in blocking the distribution of funds, the Trump administration directly defied congressional directives.

The funding freeze nullified more than 150 state implementation plans, according to court documents, which harmed local communities. NEVI requires EV charging stations in the first phase to be installed every 50 miles along the federally approved Alternative Fuel Corridors, and that they be within one mile of those routes.

“By reducing access to reliable public charging,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote, ​“DOT and the FHWA are restricting electric vehicle owners’ ability to travel and use their EVs, increase their fuel costs, delay EV purchases, worsen health impacts from vehicle pollution, and deprive communities of promised public investment.”

In the Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area, for example, air quality — such as levels of ozone and particulate matter — has worsened, according to the 2025 American Lung Association State of the Air Report. The largest city in North Carolina, Charlotte is ringed and bisected by several highways clogged with cars.

“Tailpipe pollution is a public health crisis — fueling asthma, heart disease, and respiratory illness in communities already overburdened by environmental harm,” Jeff Robbins, executive director of CleanAIRE NC, said in a prepared statement. ​“NEVI is a vital step toward reducing that harm through zero-emission transportation. Freezing the program blocks progress and keeps our most vulnerable residents breathing dirty air. Clean air and climate justice cannot be put on hold.”

Interstate 85 and U.S. Highway 70 run through many underserved communities in Alamance County, North Carolina, about 30 miles west of Durham.

“For decades, communities like ours in Alamance County have been denied access to basic infrastructure,” said Omega Wilson, codirector of the West End Revitalization Association. ​“The NEVI program offers a real chance to change that — with public investment in EV charging that finally includes rural Black and brown neighborhoods. Suspending the program delays critical investments, widens infrastructure disparities, and sends the message that once again, the taxpayers who’ve been left behind the longest will be the last to benefit.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/53236936038_549d46144d_k.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=9130c6ad6d76860c001c5add4fabef84,N,,2025-05-27 09:06:58.493031

The third step is to plan how to fairly share the costs of the energy transition.
The energy transition is essential to tackle climate change, and it’s good for many consumers, who can save on gas, petrol and power.","The great energy transition is happening before our eyes. You can see it on our roofs: more than one in three Australian homes now have solar. You can see it on our roads: nearly 10% of new cars sold in Australia last year were electric.

But the greening of Australia is creating losers as well as winners. While wealthier households are saving on their energy bills by installing solar panels and switching from gas to all-electric, many people have no choice but to stay with more expensive fossil fuels.

The newly returned Albanese government should urgently lead action to ensure all Australians benefit from a greener grid.

People who own their own homes have the flexibility – and often the income – to upgrade their house when it makes sense. With solar panels and a battery, you’re able to draw less energy from the grid and use it when it’s cheapest. If you can afford to swap your gas stove for an electric one, or buy an EV, you’re able to save even more.

But if you rent, you are eight times less likely to have solar panels on your house. That’s because most landlords aren’t interested in buying new tech, upgrading appliances, or switching from gas to all-electric when they’re not the ones paying the energy bills.

So, while wealthier Australians switch, everyone else is stuck. And the way our gas and electricity bills are calculated means the people least able to afford it will pay the most for their energy.

On average, about 40% of your gas bill goes to maintaining the network, not the amount of gas you use. The more people that are connected to the same network, the cheaper your bill. Those who can afford to switch to electric will do so and save. Those who are left behind on the gas network will foot the bill. If you end up being one of the unlucky few who are still paying for gas – mostly renters and people on low incomes – your energy prices are set to skyrocket.

When it comes to electricity, if you can’t afford to install solar panels and batteries, you’ll have to pay more to help maintain the grid. Customers are increasingly being charged different prices depending on when they use electricity or how much they use at once. That’s a big advantage if you own an electric vehicle and can charge it in the dead of night, or you can afford a battery so you can store your solar energy and use it when you need it.

But it’s hard to change the time you cook dinner, and no one is checking tariff rates while they’re watching the footy. If you don’t have a battery to shift when you draw from the grid, you’re going to bear the brunt of peak-time prices.

As the energy transition ramps up, Australia risks becoming a more unequal society. Here’s what needs to change to avoid windfall savings for the well-off, while everyone else gets whacked with the costs.

First, governments need to create a clear plan to get off gas. It’s an essential step on the road to net zero. Each state government should set a date – following the lead of the ACT – for when there will be no more gas in homes. They should put these dates into rental standards, requiring landlords to make the switch.

The second step is to help the people who can’t upgrade their houses. In public housing, state governments should pay for the switch to all-electric, and have solar panels and batteries installed where appropriate. The federal government should increase funding for upgrades to social housing and push the states to move faster. To help other renters switch, landlords should be given an instant write-off if they convert gas appliances to electric.

The third step is to plan how to fairly share the costs of the energy transition. As the gas network is wound down and new poles and wires are built, someone will have to pay. If households pay the same way they have been, the result will be unfair. If networks wear the whole bill, they will go broke.

The federal government needs to coordinate this process and, building on the work of the Australian Energy Market Commission, reform the way we pay for electricity and the grid. The new rules should be designed to ensure costs are distributed equitably for all households.

The energy transition is essential to tackle climate change, and it’s good for many consumers, who can save on gas, petrol and power. But without action, the transformation risks worsening inequality. Governments must help households to make the switch, and change the rules so that the benefits and costs are fairly shared.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6fb67759b27b9aadc8f7075d28355b7fcb244f1/815_0_3835_3070/master/3835.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d5d9b21ff18112fd407a5d4673a2ed9e,N,,2025-05-27 06:12:12.583184

These actions mark a significant turning point after decades of stagnation in the US nuclear energy industry, setting the stage for what is being hailed as a modern nuclear renaissance.

The newly signed directives empower the Department of Energy (DOE) to take the helm in accelerating nuclear innovation.

Among the measures announced are the authorisation of reactor testing at DOE’s National Laboratories, streamlined construction on federal lands, and a mandate for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite licensing processes.

These initiatives dismantle long-standing regulatory roadblocks and inject momentum into the development of next-generation nuclear reactors.

A strategic energy move amid rising global demand

The revival of American nuclear technology comes at a crucial time, as global energy demands surge and concerns over energy independence intensify.

The Trump Administration’s actions support the expansion of the existing nuclear fleet and pave the way for scalable, advanced nuclear technologies capable of delivering clean, consistent energy regardless of weather conditions.

The emphasis on civil nuclear infrastructure also aligns with broader economic strategies, including the reinforcement of domestic manufacturing and the securement of a sovereign nuclear fuel supply chain.

These advancements are poised to play a pivotal role in powering artificial intelligence systems, supporting heavy industry, and ensuring a stable electric grid for future generations.

Reinforcing trust in science through “Gold Standard” principles

In addition to energy-focused initiatives, President Trump has implemented a science directive aimed at restoring integrity and public trust in federal research.

The executive order introduces “Gold Standard Science” as a benchmark for all federally supported scientific activities.

This framework prioritises transparency, reproducibility, and peer-reviewed rigour while demanding clarity around uncertainty and objectivity in research.

The initiative is intended to align government science efforts with traditional academic values, encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, and foster a research environment free from conflicts of interest. It signals a national call to excellence for scientists and institutions across the country.

White House Office of Science and Technology Director Michael Kratsios added: “President Trump is making Gold Standard Science the cornerstone of the federal science enterprise and rebuilding public trust in science.

“With this executive order, we are recommitting ourselves to scientific best practices and empowering America’s researchers to achieve groundbreaking discoveries.

“Gold Standard Science starts in the policies and programmes of our great federal research institutions and continues with partnership across academia, industry, and philanthropy.”

Why nuclear technology is vital for America’s future

Expanding America’s nuclear technology capabilities is a national imperative. Nuclear power offers a reliable, emissions-free energy source that enhances energy security, strengthens the grid, and provides a critical backbone for future technological advancements.

By investing in modern reactor designs and breaking down bureaucratic hurdles, the US positions itself to lead globally in clean energy innovation while protecting its strategic interests.

After U.S. President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on select imports this April, ASEAN countries swiftly launched negotiations in a bid to cushion the blow.

According to analysis by financial advisory firm S&P Global, nations that had previously benefited from the China+1 strategy now face rising tariff risks. Steep U.S. tariffs could dampen electricity demand from Southeast Asia’s manufacturing sector, casting uncertainty over the region’s energy transition.

Solar costs keep falling, firms urged to reassess power strategies

In a recent webinar hosted by S&P Global Commodity Insights, experts examined the implications of U.S. tariffs on ASEAN’s clean energy and power sectors. The discussion focused on projected trends in solar development and how companies might adapt.

Cecillia Zheng, an analyst specializing in natural gas, power, and climate solutions, noted that stricter U.S. trade rules have already affected Chinese production lines and are beginning to erode the value-added exports of ASEAN countries—particularly in sectors such as electronics, automotive, machinery, clean energy, and solar which face higher tariff pressure.

According to S&P Global data, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia—ASEAN’s top solar exporters—shipped nearly 30 GW of solar modules and cells to the U.S. in 2023, valued at over USD $9.5 billion.

Vince Heo, another analyst, pointed out that Chinese solar manufacturers have ramped up production, leading to global oversupply and offsetting post-pandemic inflation effects. This has kept capital expenditures for utility-scale solar projects in Southeast Asia from rising significantly—some have even seen slight declines. Heo forecasts continued drops in solar power costs.

In Vietnam, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from onshore wind and solar is already lower than coal-fired power, with solar-plus-storage costs also steadily falling. Within 2–3 years, these costs are expected to reach parity with coal, prompting large energy users to reconsider their power sourcing strategies.

Heo added that if the U.S. enforces anti-subsidy and anti-dumping tariffs, a wave of low-cost solar modules and storage systems could flood into ASEAN markets. The Philippines is particularly well-positioned to benefit, with its relatively liberalized electricity market and strong governmental support for renewable energy.

Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia are most exposed to the new U.S. tariffs. (Image: S&P Global Commodity Insights webinar)

Vietnam most vulnerable as tariffs threaten energy progress

Given their deep reliance on the U.S. market, ASEAN countries face reduced foreign investment and lower manufacturing-related power demand if tariffs are enacted. Vietnam appears most at risk.

Heo emphasized that Vietnam exports USD $70 billion worth of computers and electronics to the U.S. annually. With 90% of Apple’s wearables and nearly half of Samsung’s export goods produced in Vietnam, any new tariffs could deter foreign manufacturers, decrease output, and subsequently reduce electricity consumption.

Tariffs may also drive up fuel prices in ASEAN countries, pushing electricity costs higher. Vietnam is particularly exposed due to its expanding LNG imports and weakening currency, raising the risk of foreign exchange losses and pressuring utility profit margins—potentially stalling the nation’s energy transition.

Overall, the research team at S&P Global believes U.S. tariffs could significantly affect power demand and solar manufacturing in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. The clean energy supply chain may shift, and energy developers could face increasing risks in procurement and cost structures.

Despite the uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff outcomes, Cecillia Zheng recommended that companies monitor these three key developments:

How will evolving tariff policies influence energy firms’ investment decisions?

How can companies balance cost competitiveness while securing resilient supply chains?

In the face of protectionist measures like the April tariffs, how can energy companies use regional or global partnerships to build effective buffers?

Allen Wang, Executive Director of the research team, concluded that cautious market sentiment is slowing short-term energy investments. He noted that the prospects for other clean energy sources, such as geothermal, remain difficult to assess under the current uncertainty.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1748327651818833028.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 06:12:33.568872

Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.

Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.

A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.

Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.

In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.

Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.

“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.

Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.

Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.

Fossil fuels under fire

Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.

Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.

The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.

Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.

Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.

Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of unnecessary electricity generating infrastructure.

“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”

Georgia Power company has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.

Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.

Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.

“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”

Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.

“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.

Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week for how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.

“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fayette-QTS-data-center-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 05:02:32.833822

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable.
The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because its land-use effects are so devastating.
Currently, most of the world’s aviation fuel classified as sustainable is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly.
The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.","The “Big, Beautiful Bill” that Republicans are pushing under President Trump would roll back almost all the clean energy incentives that Democrats enacted under President Biden, shredding federal support for solar, wind, nuclear, electric vehicles, and other climate-friendly technologies. But it would make a lavish exception for one supposedly green form of energy that isn’t green at all: farm-grown jet fuels.

Aviation, which generated about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, is a notoriously difficult sector to decarbonize, and the U.S. aviation industry has committed to using so-called “sustainable aviation fuels” to reach its net-zero climate goals. But using crops like corn and soybeans to produce fuel instead of food not only increases food prices and global hunger, it spurs farmers around the world to tear down more forests and plow up more grasslands to create new farmland to replace the lost food. That’s why farm-grown biofuels have been a climate problem masquerading as a climate solution for cars, and they would have the same problem in planes.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable. That would be like banning consideration of smokestack emissions when calculating which power plants are sustainable. And in legislation that otherwise slashes energy spending, the biofuels giveaway would cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $45 billion.

The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because its land-use effects are so devastating.

But such is the power of U.S. agricultural interests, which are increasingly worried that electric vehicles will crush demand for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel on the road and have been furiously lobbying Washington to create new demand in the sky. In case there was any confusion about the purpose of the biofuels provision, it’s not in the energy policy section of the Big Beautiful Bill: It’s in the section that claims to “Make Rural America Grow Again.”

The political twist is that it’s not just a Republican provision. While the overall bill has no Democratic supporters, and even some Republicans have objected to its assault on other energy subsidies, the biofuels carve-out has strong backing from farm-friendly Democrats, who created the original tax credit for SAFs in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. There’s always been broad bipartisan support for the federal mandate requiring corn ethanol to be blended into gasoline, and even though the overall Big Beautiful Bill aims to dismantle Biden’s climate policies and extend Trump’s tax cuts, its biofuels language was lifted from a bipartisan “Farm to Fly” bill explicitly designed to get ethanol to qualify for SAF credits of up to $1.75 a gallon.

“It’s shocking but it’s not surprising,” says Dan Lashof, a climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. “Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

The impacts on the global landscape could be dramatic. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that producing about 10 percent of U.S. jet fuel from SAF by 2030 — an explicit Biden Administration goal — would require about half the U.S. soybean crop, occupying enough farmland to cover the state of Nebraska. Princeton senior research scholar Tim Searchinger has calculated that using vegetable oils like soybean for one fourth of global aviation fuel would require 40 percent of global cropland, an area twice the size of India. Flying a plane with corn ethanol would be particularly inefficient; it takes 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make a gallon of jet fuel, and producing ethanol uses almost as much fossil fuel as ethanol replaces.

The world is already losing a soccer field worth of tropical forest every six seconds, most of it to agricultural expansion, and heightened demand for feedstocks like corn, soy, canola, and palm could overrun vast swaths of forests and undeveloped land, releasing its sequestered carbon and eliminating its ability to absorb atmospheric carbon in the future. The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because the land-use effects are so devastating, but even when Biden was still president, the U.S. farm lobby was fighting to make sure that didn’t happen here.

Currently, most of the world’s aviation fuel classified as sustainable is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly.

At one Biden cabinet meeting in 2023, agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack handed treasury secretary Janet Yellen a one-page briefing document, flagging it as a high-priority issue. Yellen’s high-priority issues usually involved inflation, threats of recession, and global economic crises, so she was perplexed to read a page of acronym-laden biofuels-industry talking points about the methodological superiority of the GREET computer model over the CORSIA model for calculating carbon emissions from ILUC.

“Can someone tell me what this is about?” she later asked her top aides.

It was about billions of dollars, because the CORSIA model put enough emphasis on “indirect land-use change,” known as ILUC, to make crop-based aviation fuels ineligible for tax credits, while the farm-friendly GREET model downplayed ILUC enough to give corn and soybeans a chance to look sustainable. The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.

As I recount in my forthcoming book We Are Eating the Earth, the working group held weekly meetings that were clearly less about improving climate analytics than justifying the creation of a lucrative new market for farmers. “Nobody talked about the elephant in the room,” one administration official recalled. “It was theater of the absurd.”

The GREET modeling implied that all of Iowa’s corn production could be converted to ethanol while inducing virtually no farmers anywhere on Earth to expand their fields to grow more grain, but the results didn’t have to make sense when Biden was declaring at an Iowa ethanol plant that “we want to see facilities like this all over the Midwest.”

In 2024, the Biden administration agreed to use GREET — and since even GREET didn’t make ethanol look quite climate-friendly enough to qualify for credits, Vilsack secured several additional conditions that made the model even more favorable for farm-grown fuels. He barely even pretended the decision was driven by science in his public statement, hailing it as “a great beginning as we develop new markets for… home-grown agricultural crops.” The initial U.S. biofuels mandate for cars, in 2007, unleashed a torrent of deforestation in the Amazon, but Nikita Pavlenko, director of fuels and aviation for the International Coalition for Clean Transportation, says the farm lobby’s influence in Washington helped persuade the White House to ignore fears of a reprise. “We spent two years wrangling,” he says, “and in the end everyone who wanted to take land-use change seriously got steamrolled.”

It’s hard to imagine politicians bucking the powerful agriculture lobby over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change.

Today, only 0.3 percent of the world’s aviation fuel is classified as sustainable: Most of it is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly because it doesn’t use farmland or spur deforestation. United Airlines has an ad campaign touting its commitment to making SAF from waste instead of crop-grown feedstock, featuring Oscar the Grouch as its “Chief Trash Officer.” Environmentalists also hope to see planes fly on “green hydrogen” produced with clean energy; pongamia oil made from the seed of a climate-friendly tropical tree; and electricity, at least for short-haul flights.

But for the airlines, the most scalable alternative fuel opportunity would be subsidized crop-based fuels, which is why they have joined farm interests to push the current Congress to extend the SAF credit and make it even easier for farm-grown SAF to qualify. The Biden team had already diminished the role of indirect land-use change in its emissions analyses — the critics say its ILUC value should have been at least five times higher, and perhaps 40 times higher — and the U.S. has already built enough biorefineries since 2021 to increase its production capacity for crop-based SAF sixfold. Still, the industry lobbyists wanted to make sure that ILUC would pose no threat whatsoever to fuels brewed from crops, and they got what they wanted on page 208 of the Big Beautiful Bill: “the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land-use change.”

This is like Congress dictating that financial regulators can’t look at how much banks owe their creditors when determining whether they’re solvent; one environmentalist compared the provision to a legislative decree that pi equals nine.

“There’s a lot of hype about how this kind of legislation can jumpstart SAF and make a lot of money for farmers, and I think that’s right,” says Dan Blaustein-Rejto, who runs the Breakthrough Institute’s food and agriculture program. “I just don’t think that’s good.”

Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a riddle: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? His answer was four: A tail is still a tail, even if you call it a leg. And using farmland to grow fuel still induces the expansion of farmland elsewhere to grow more food, even if emissions analysts aren’t allowed to acknowledge those indirect land-use changes. The brazen ban on even evaluating indirect land-use change could create problems for airlines that want to sell carbon credits for using alternative fuels, since a Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, funded by Jeff Bezos, is working with environmental groups to make sure the credits are scientifically credible. But it’s not clear how much buyers like Microsoft and Meta really care about scientific credibility.

In any case, the biofuels lobby tends to get its way in Washington. The Biden administration issued an “emergency waiver” to get more ethanol blended into gasoline last summer, and the Trump administration plans to issue the same waiver this summer. The first specific item the Trump White House mentioned in a May 8 press release hailing its preliminary trade deal with the U.K. was increased access for U.S. ethanol, with celebratory quotes from the U.S. Grains Council, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association. Those groups have a lot of influence, and it’s hard to imagine politicians bucking them over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change in life-cycle analyses.

“It’s hard to build a constituency for addressing an issue that seems so technical,” Lashof says. “And even if we could, it’s even harder to fight the farm lobby.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/Corn-Ethanol_AP-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1748014090&s=ed5aa80ddb2b10abdc07d70ef2239b72,N,,2025-05-27 06:11:25.762067

""If you know that you are not at risk of litigation that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

Hochman said that could leave rural areas behind.

The U.S. House narrowly passed the bill. It now moves to the Senate.

Hochman said for developers with large projects, fees aren't a problem.

""For a developer who has a project that still will go through environmental impact statement, the vast majority of time $5 million - or whatever it might be - is peanuts,"" said Hochman. ""I think this will become the common avenue for private developers.""

Advocates fear this progress could slow if project scoring continues to prioritize cost-efficiency over need.

The Florida Legislature's failure to pass a budget before adjourning has left key environmental projects in limbo, including a Senate-approved proposal to restore the Ocklawaha River by dismantling the Rodman Dam.

For residents like Samuel Carr, president of the Bartram Trail Society who fished the river before the dam's 1971 construction, the more than $6 million project represents a chance to revive what he called a ""free-running wild river"" from what he said he believes turned into ""a mud hole.""

""Since they put that dam in, 150 million gallons of fresh water doesn't come into the St. Johns River now per day, as it did before 1971,"" said Carr. ""So, the restoration would literally turn the faucet back on to get that cool, clear water to the St. Johns River.""

Carr noted the dam blocks 20 springs and forces periodic pollution releases into the St. Johns, which he said has suffered catastrophic algae blooms and lost critical eelgrass.

Lawmakers will reconvene sometime after June 2 to resume budget talks. The Senate has already approved the funding, but House approval remains uncertain amid broader disputes over tax cuts.

A Florida Atlantic University study projects the restoration would deliver a 214% return on investment, yielding over $15 million a year in recreation revenue and 340 jobs.

Former Putnam County Commissioner Linda Myers framed restoration as an economic imperative for rural Florida.

""This area of northeast Florida has so many rivers that connect to the St. Johns and this specific structure, the dam, has actually eliminated some of that connectedness,"" said Myers. ""So, opening that up would just give the opportunities - and here in Florida, we know the tourism dollars, we know how important they are.""

Myers said she believes the project aligns with lawmakers' stated priorities of water quality, conservation and leveraging Florida's tourism industry.

The study also shows restoring the Ocklawaha River would reconnect 213 river miles for fish migration, revive 20 submerged springs, and reduce algal bloom risk by 63% by restoring natural water flow.

Support for this reporting was provided by The Pew Charitable Trusts.

There are more than 20,000 abandoned oil and gas wells scattered across West Virginia, putting communities at risk for water contamination and increased exposure to environmental pollutants.

State lawmakers said a new law will make it easier to fill those wells. Previously, state code required removal of mining infrastructure before wells could be plugged with cement and other materials.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said at a recent news conference the new law will allow operators to fill wells without removing the largest mine shaft.

""This will provide operators with greater flexibility, especially when dealing with older wells in poor structural condition,"" Morrisey explained.

West Virginia historically has only been able to plug just a few wells a year because of lack of funding. Federal investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 has led to the plugging of around 275 wells within the last three years. The state's new well plugging law goes into effect July 10.

Morrisey noted safely plugging a well can cost between $60,000 and $200,000 but argued doing so is necessary because untreated wells can expose communities to harmful chemicals.

""Abandoned and orphan wells can pose a significant threat and safety risk and can potentially impact surface and groundwater drinking water sources, land and air quality,"" Morrisey outlined.

According to advocacy group West Virginia Rivers, more than half of West Virginians live within a mile of an active oil and gas well.

As the Environmental Protection Agency scales back enforcement because of staff shortages and new federal rollbacks, concerns are growing in Michigan and across the country about who will hold polluters accountable.

Michigan, with more than 11,000 inland lakes and access to four Great Lakes holding 90% of the nation's freshwater, faces challenges as EPA budget cuts reduce enforcement by nearly 20% and eliminate more than 200 staff.

Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a recent webinar that his organization commissions polling and focus groups every two years on clean-water issues in the Great Lakes.

""And it's an 85% issue. It's almost as if, when you push people and you say, 'How much should we do to protect the Great Lakes and restore them?' he asked, ""It's like, whatever it costs, you do it.""

Supporters of EPA cuts, especially in energy, manufacturing and agriculture, contend strict environmental rules are too costly for businesses. In late 2024, more than 100 industry groups urged then-President-elect Donald Trump to roll back regulations they said were ""strangling"" the economy.

Partisanship continues to shape the debate over environmental laws, with lawmakers often split along party lines when it comes to regulations.

David Uhlmann, a former EPA official and environmental law attorney, stressed in the webinar the need to take politics out of environmental protection.

""The environmental laws require EPA working with the state to promote clean air, healthy rivers and streams, to make sure that we're living in communities free of toxic waste,"" he said. ""Those laws apply regardless of who the president is.""

In Fiscal Year 2024, the EPA's enacted budget was more than $9 billion, with a workforce of more than 15,000 employees.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked.
In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments.","Utah is embracing electric vehicles but President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" could eliminate a $7,500 EV tax credit which helps buyers afford them.

Trump previously pledged to undo what he called the ""electric vehicle mandate,"" referencing the Biden-era goal for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, said the administration's approach may slow the growth of the EV industry.

""It's not going to kill the electric vehicle,"" Higham stressed. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed about 40,000 EVs are on Utah roads. All EV owners in the state must pay an annual registration fee of about $140. The U.S. House passed the massive budget bill last week, moving it to the Senate for consideration.

House lawmakers have proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of the year. Analysts said Tesla, the largest EV automaker, owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, would be affected the most by the loss of the tax credit. Higham projected the proposal to repeal the tax credit could break down party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts.""

According to the Argonne National Laboratory, consumers can save more than $6,000 in lifetime repair and maintenance costs from an EV compared to a gas-fueled vehicle. It is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion on EV tax credit payments in 2024.

Loss of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Mining Program will reverse decades of progress in preventing disease, injury and death among miners, experts said.

Around 150 researchers are expected to be laid off next month, effectively shuttering the program.

Steve Schafrik, associate professor of mine engineering at the University of Kentucky, said the agency's research labs are conducting studies not easily be replicated, noting the labs contain specialized equipment aimed at reducing hazards to which miners are exposed.

""Facilities for trying to reduce the noise of equipment so that workers aren't exposed to that level of noise all day, every day,"" Schafrik noted. ""That's a pretty difficult task, and you need to have very specific research equipment to do that.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said layoffs are part of an effort to combine numerous agencies under the umbrella of the new ""Administration for a Healthy America."" According to federal data, around one of five of the nation's operating coal mines are located in Kentucky.

Schafrik pointed out the program's worker safety materials are used by mining industries around the world. He stressed the shutdown also leaves an uncertain future for grants and contracts needed to recruit new researchers.

""NIOSH has put a big emphasis on generating capacity within the academic institutions for replenishment of the researchers who can go out and work in academia, industry, regulatory bodies and government research,"" Schafrik outlined.

He added the program's closure will affect other industries, such as mineral production.

""While we are looking to get more critical mineral production inside of the United States, to be coupling that with the reduction of the Health and Safety Research Program, I don't understand the reasoning behind that,"" Schafrik observed.

According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, 10 miner fatalities occurred between Jan. 3 and March 5, 2025, more than triple the number from the same period last year.

The budget bill passed by the U.S. House and now under consideration in the Senate would reform environmental permitting in Illinois and nationwide, potentially streamlining the process and reducing litigation exposure.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, large projects with the potential to affect the environment must complete environmental assessments or impact statements, including all federal agencies and affects private development projects needing federal permits. The new provision would create an expedited review process for a fee of 25% on top of the usual cost of a review.

Thomas Hochman, director of infrastructure policy at the Foundation for American Innovation, said the new rule would also shield projects from litigation related to permitting.

""There are quotes from folks like an outgoing EPA General Counsel, who say 90% of the details in a NEPA review are purely there for litigation-proofing the document,"" Hochman pointed out. ""You can imagine if you only need 10% of the details in that environmental impact statement, because you know that you are not at risk of litigation, that is almost certainly a radically faster timeline.""

National Environmental Policy Act reform has been attempted by both parties in Congress in recent years but could not pass the Senate. This year's bill marks the first time it has been attempted in the budget reconciliation process. If approved, the permitting reforms may accelerate some of the later phases of the multiyear Rebuild Illinois capital program.

In court, federal agencies have an 80% success rate on appeal and their environmental reviews are not often changed through litigation. One study of reviews showed solar energy projects face the highest litigation rate. Frequent litigation was also seen with pipelines, transmission lines and wind energy projects.

Despite streamlining the process, Hochman pointed out the reforms may also make projects subject to changing political priorities.

""If you let each administration determine what the cost is and also spend time determining what the cost should be, you can potentially see differences in treatment,"" Hochman observed. ""Maybe a Republican administration drags their feet and puts out a really high cost for a wind project that's going through an environmental impact statement. Maybe a Democratic administration does the same for a pipeline that's going through an environmental impact statement.""

Projects may still face litigation under other environmental laws such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts.

Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

The Senate must reject this reckless bill and we urge our entire delegation to fight to restore these provisions.” Unfortunately, it didn’t end with the House’s reconciliation bill.
At a time when we should be accelerating the transition to clean energy, Congress must not slam on the brakes.”","When the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August of 2022, it was the biggest, boldest climate legislation in U.S. history. It promised to accelerate the clean energy transition, create green jobs across the country, and invest in a healthier, more sustainable future.

Now those promises are at risk of being broken. The reconciliation bill that passed the House, if enacted, would unravel key provisions of the IRA, rescind billions in clean energy investments, slash funding for key climate programs at the EPA and Department of Energy, and pull the rug out from under American families and businesses that have begun to rely on clean energy tax credits.

It’s a dangerous step backward, and the New York League of Conservation Voters is urging lawmakers in the U.S. Senate to reject this reckless legislation and restore the critical climate measures the House is attempting to strip away.

To understand how we got to this point, and with such a narrowly divided Congress no less, it helps to understand exactly what a reconciliation bill is.

“Budget reconciliation is a legislative procedure made available as a result of the 1974 Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act,” states to the Bipartisan Policy Center website. “Reconciliation allows for expedited consideration of certain and specified changes in law to align spending, revenue, and the debt limit with agreed-upon budget targets.”

The website for House Budget Committee Ranking Member Brendan Boyle explains it this way: “If the budget calls for reconciliation, it tells certain committees to change spending, revenues, deficits, or the debt limit by specific amounts. […] Each committee writes a bill to achieve its target, and if more than one committee is told to act, the Budget Committee puts the bills together into one big bill.”

Like the budget itself, that bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only needs a simple majority to pass. That’s why the content of reconciliation bills matter so much, and why the version that passed the House this year is so alarming.

“Early Thursday morning, the House of Representatives passed a reconciliation bill on party lines that guts nearly all federal tax credits for clean energy production and adoption, and slashes funding for key climate programs at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy,” NYLCV said in a statement following the vote. “This bill – worse than the initial proposal – would bring New York’s clean energy progress to a grinding halt. Families and businesses would face higher utility bills, a less dependable grid, and increased air pollution. We are especially disappointed that New York’s Republican representatives, who championed the clean energy tax credits, ultimately failed to protect them. The Senate must reject this reckless bill and we urge our entire delegation to fight to restore these provisions.”

Unfortunately, it didn’t end with the House’s reconciliation bill. Separately, the anti-environment majority in Congress also removed a key tool for states to rein in air pollution.

“Just as troubling, both chambers voted to rescind the California Clean Air Waiver – a dangerous attack on states’ rights and one that strips New York and more than a dozen other states of the ability to set stronger tailpipe emissions standards, which are essential to our clean transportation strategy,” the League’s statement continued.

“These actions are a direct assault on our health, our economy, and our climate future. At a time when we should be accelerating the transition to clean energy, Congress must not slam on the brakes.”",http://nylcv.org/wp-content/uploads/D2F5EA00-C5B7-F538-0D33DD9DB13B2BBF.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 03:01:18.529889

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

""India’s clean energy growth outpaces global trends"" was originally created and published by Energy Monitor, a GlobalData owned brand.","India is addressing its rapidly growing electricity demand using affordable, clean, and efficient renewable energy sources, according to a new report from Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), an independent, non-profit organisation based in the US.

Titled ‘Empowering India: The Clean Energy Growth Opportunity’, the report highlights that India is achieving this through policy initiatives and innovation while minimising costs, boosting jobs and domestic production, and increasing competitiveness.

India's electricity demand could triple by 2050 due to a surge in vehicle use and air conditioning needs.

This development presents a unique chance to establish efficient and sustainable infrastructure from the outset, the report stated.

The report underscores that India is moving away from fossil fuels and import dependency by adopting clean and efficient energy solutions.

Importing fossil fuels currently costs India 5% of its GDP, but the shift to renewable energy, including solar and wind power, is proving to be a cost-effective alternative.

The largest renewable energy project under construction in India is nearly four times the size of the largest projects in the US or Europe.

Furthermore, India is advancing towards self-sufficiency in producing solar modules, wind generators, and battery cells.

The report also reveals that electricity generated from new solar plus storage facilities is now more affordable than new coal power plants. Moreover, solar power alone is cheaper than operating existing coal-fired plants.

Despite these advancements, India attracts only 4% of the global clean energy investment.

The report suggests that with adequate financial support, India's energy transition could lead to significant emission reductions by mid-century, surpassing those of Europe and North America, and setting a precedent for other emerging economies.

Earlier this month, India formalised a renewed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Denmark to extend their collaboration in the energy domain.

As he does with other policies affecting immigration, trade and culture wars, Trump is still — or once again — pushing coal, beautifully clean coal as he calls it, as an energy goal. In pursuit of his belief that coal is being overlooked or displaced by “woke” concerns for solar, wind and alternative energy sources, last month Trump signed a series of executive orders towards reviving the dying coal industry.

Whatever political sense it makes for Trump to court miners (or mine owners) in West Virginia and Wyoming, his efforts seem a tad shy of recognizing environmental, economic or market condition realities. Apart from all else, Trump’s tariffs-driven trade war would seem on its face to discourage exports of coal to China and other Asian countries — the biggest markets for it.

To underscore the strategic pretzels being created around coal, China could turn to its increasingly warm ally Russia to buy yet more of its coal.

Earth.org, one of the myriad environmental groups critiquing Trump on coal, reminds us that coal remains the dirtiest fossil fuel, at 40%, the single largest source of fossil fuel carbon emissions and a major contributor to air pollution. “In fact, nations worldwide are turning away from coal,” the group said after the executive orders came out.

Similar coal promotion efforts during the first Trump administration fell flat and more than 100 plants shut down and others preferring cheaper, cleaner alternatives.

Trump on Coal

In four executive orders signed in April, Trump claims emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.

Trump has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands — ending a “war on coal.” Basically, the orders rescind any existing rule that gets in the way of mining coal or distributing it and calls for acceleration of coal technologies. Trump believes in “clean” coal technology that the industry itself finds overly expensive with questionable environmental gains. The difference concerns sulfur content, according to the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis says

As a further incentive to coal-fired power companies, Trump offered a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene because, well, ridding of regulation and dismissing concern about pollutants apparently are good.

In particular, Trump’s orders push to use coal to power new artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, which strikes one as using outmoded, dirty energy to power something Trump sees as cutting edge and “clean.” For context, Microsoft wants to re-power the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania to power its AI operations.

Together, the orders accept that coal is essential to national and economic security; he sees the supply as vast, while others see it as finite.

Of course, the coal promotion fits with incentives to the oil and natural gas industries and is meant to counter climate-driven government policies towards harnessing more solar, wind and nuclear sources — all part of the “Green New Deal” that Trump ridicules and hates. And, in the Trump way, the energy push is another national emergency that requires setting aside regulations and cutting Congress or courts out of policymaking.

The Environmental View

Consensus among environmentalists has been that Trump’s oil-heavy view of energy-at-any-cost policies are bad across climate, business and individual economics and strategic concerns, and that his chosen path to declare a national emergency to bulldoze over years of legislative and regulatory protections are a “sham.” We have Trump emergencies for immigration, tariffs, education, justice and more.

The Sierra Club says that since taking office Trump has weakened domestic energy production by pausing all wind projects, for example, and promising to slash hundreds of clean energy projects promoting under Joe Biden’s infrastructure project legislation.

Indeed, wind and solar now account for more U.S. energy power by percentage than does coal, which two decades ago reflected fully half of all electro power, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) predicts that Trump’s push will fail again. Coal is more costly, pollutes more and offers less reliability than other sources, and promoting it for power will increase consumer costs. No new plant has kicked in in more than a decade and the average age of existing plants is 53 years because coal has trouble competing. Studies suggest that emissions from it had a role in a half-billion U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2020.

Once again, coal policy offers us an interesting perch to watch the Trump administration at work. Clearly there are elements of politics at work here over, say, concern about environmental concerns, but we also see how anything related to “energy” that comes out of the ground is a personal trigger for Trump action. The idea that a nation could have some coal and some oil and some wind and solar just doesn’t seem to add up for Trump; to promote coal means to halt wind power — even as the world’s power needs as a whole are increasing.

Unless you are Trump or a fan, pushing coal to the exclusion of other energies makes little sense.

After a successful debut last year, the program returns with triple the size, double the duration and a stronger lineup of sustainability initiatives. This season, green-minded travelers have even more reasons to choose Copenhagen.

Known for its commitment to environmental policies, Copenhagen is already putting climate solutions into action and redefining its tourism approach. As visitors explore famous landmarks, dine at Michelin-starred restaurants and walk around the city, CopenPay offers unique experiences and rewards, encouraging longer stays and participation in environmental efforts.

A new currency: Responsible actions

The World Travel & Tourism Council reported in 2024 that the travel and tourism sector contributed $10.9 trillion to global GDP, about 10% of the world’s total economy. It also supported 357 million jobs, roughly 1 in 10 positions worldwide.

However, the environmental downsides of tourism are significant. The World Counts says that the industry often puts pressure on natural resources through overconsumption, especially in areas where those resources are already limited. Common issues include water scarcity, pollution, waste buildup and harm to local ecosystems. Over time, tourism can also lead to soil erosion, habitat loss and increased pressure on wildlife, which can sometimes damage the very environments that draw visitors in the first place.

That’s exactly where CopenPay steps in. The initiative offers a practical response to tourism’s environmental toll by shifting the focus from high-impact habits to low-emission alternatives. Instead of racking up costs, visitors earn access to experiences by doing things that align with Copenhagen’s values, like taking public transit, eating plant-based meals and even joining a cleanup.

This year, CopenPay runs for nine weeks from June 17 to Aug. 17 and spans 90 attractions across the city. That includes everything from bike rentals and yoga to discounted entry at world-class museums like the National Gallery of Denmark and the Danish Architecture Center. More than just perks, the initiative encourages travelers to rethink not just what they do on vacation, but how they get there in the first place.

Rewards for traveling responsibly

Tourists travel to Copenhagen in all sorts of ways, from planes and cruise ships to buses and private cars. But transportation has a major environmental impact, and not all travel modes are created equal. In the words of Søren Tegen Pedersen, CEO of Wonderful Copenhagen, “The biggest climate impact from tourism comes from transportation. So, this year, we encourage travelers to take the train to Copenhagen. Furthermore, we want visitors to travel less but stay longer.”

Travelers who arrive by train are rewarded not just with a lighter carbon footprint but with experiences that showcase the best of Copenhagen. Rewards include complimentary meals made from surplus food, free bike rentals, yoga sessions and guided tours at the city’s cultural spots.

Visitors who collect flower seeds in the city center and plant them in designated green areas or pots get free entry to Kronborg Castle, and some travelers may even be invited to a dinner by JunkFood CPH, the nonprofit founded by Michelin-starred chef Rasmus Munk.

People arriving in electric cars also qualify for perks such as discounted parking. And those staying four days or more unlock additional benefits, like vegetarian meals, free bike rentals and more rewards tailored to longer visits.

“By integrating more responsible actions into the visitor experience, CopenPay is redefining how we in Copenhagen approach tourism. Rather than bringing more tourists to the city, the goal with CopenPay is to nudge our visitors and raise their awareness about traveling in a more sustainable way, exploring Copenhagen more responsibly while being rewarded with unique experiences,” added Pedersen.

Stay longer, travel less

Today’s travelers are rethinking the impact of their trips, with growing awareness of how tourism affects both the environment and local communities. CopenPay taps into this shift by encouraging longer, lower-impact stays over quick, high-emission getaways. The rewards program promotes slower, more thoughtful travel that allows visitors to engage more deeply with Copenhagen. The result is a better experience for the traveler and a lighter footprint on the city.

Copenhagen leads, others follow

CopenPay started as a small pilot last year and exceeded expectations by boosting sustainable choices and earning strong participant endorsements. Yahoo Finance reports that, in just four weeks, the initiative drove a 29% rise in bike rentals, led to widespread litter collection and earned a 98% recommendation rate from participants. Now, back at triple the scale, it has become a case study in how cities can engage visitors in low-impact travel.

But the ambition behind CopenPay stretches beyond city limits. Wonderful Copenhagen has since shared its results with more than 100 destinations around the world, hoping to inspire similar programs elsewhere. The idea is not just to change behavior during a single trip, but to plant lasting habits that travelers carry home with them.

“One of the great things about tourism is cultural exchange,” says Søren Tegen Pedersen. “We learn a lot from our visitors, and in return, we hope they’ll leave Copenhagen inspired to bike more, choose more plant-based meals and continue making more responsible choices wherever they are.” The program encourages visitors to reduce their environmental impact while contributing positively to the places they visit.

A model for what travel can be

CopenPay proves sustainable tourism works when it’s grounded in real actions. The program makes responsible travel easy and rewarding, without taking away from the experience. It’s built on trust, shaped by local values and designed to inspire long-term change. As more cities look to Copenhagen, the future of travel seems more thoughtful, connected and sustainable.

New Delhi: In a push to electrify its roads and reduce vehicular emissions, the Maharashtra government has notified its EV Policy 2025, setting an ambitious target to convert 30 per cent of all new vehicle sales to electric by 2030. The policy is in effect from April 1, 2025 to March 31, 2030, and offers incentives across the EV ecosystem, from buyers and manufacturers to charging infrastructure developers.

The policy outlines specific category-wise EV adoption targets by 2030, including 40 per cent for new two-wheelers (L1 & L2) and three-wheelers (L5M), 30 per cent for passenger four-wheelers (M1), 25 per cent for light goods carriers (N1), and 20 per cent for heavy goods carriers (N2, N3). Public transport electrification goals include 40 per cent for State Transport Undertaking (STU) buses and 15 per cent for non-STU public transport buses in six urban regions.

To accelerate adoption, the government will offer purchase subsidies of up to ₹2 lakh per electric transport vehicle (M1), capped at 25,000 vehicles. For buses (M3, M4), the subsidy can go up to ₹20 lakh per unit, with a maximum of 1,500 vehicles. Electric tractors and harvesters will receive subsidies up to ₹1.5 lakh, with 1,000 units covered.

All EVs registered within the policy period will be exempt from motor vehicle tax and registration renewal charges. Additionally, electric passenger vehicles will be exempt from tolls on major state and national highways, including Mumbai–Pune Expressway, Samruddhi Mahamarg, and Atal Setu.

The policy mandates the installation of charging stations every 25 km on highways. All fuel stations in the state will be required to install at least one charging point. Up to 1,500 high-power DC fast charging stations will receive capital support of up to ₹10 lakh per station.

Fleet electrification will be made compulsory in select areas. This includes 100 per cent electrification of government fleets, 25 per cent for aggregator and e-commerce fleets, and 50 per cent for last-mile delivery vehicles in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and Amravati.

The policy extends “D+” category incentives under the 2019 Package Scheme of Incentives to EV and battery manufacturing units across the state. It also outlines the development of EV battery recycling hubs in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.

Advt

According to the government, implementing this policy could reduce vehicular PM2.5 emissions by 325 tonnes and greenhouse gas emissions by 1 million tonnes by 2030.

For real estate and infrastructure, the policy mandates that all new residential buildings must provide 100 per cent EV-ready parking spaces. Commercial buildings will need to reserve at least 50 per cent of their parking capacity for EVs.

A Chief Secretary-led Steering Committee will oversee implementation. All relevant departments have been directed to issue implementation guidelines within 30 days of the policy’s notification on May 23, 2025.

The policy also outlines support for R&D, including the establishment of three Centres of Excellence in EV innovation, to be supported by a ₹15 crore Chief Minister’s R&D Grant.

Models like the Baker Electric Coupe and Riker Electric Roadster ran smoothly on U.S. roads, with electric taxis making up a third of New York’s fleet at one point. But as oil-based fuels became widely available and the Ford Model T offered a cheaper, longer-range alternative, battery cars began losing ground. By the mid-1930s, electric vehicles had almost completely vanished, overtaken by gas-powered cars and the rise of the oil industry, which was heavily supported by federal tax incentives.

The politics that powered gasoline — and sidelined EVs

In 1926, US lawmakers offered generous tax breaks to oil companies, letting them deduct 27.5% of their sales from taxable income. This helped cement gasoline’s dominance for decades. Today’s Republican leaders are taking similar steps — but in reverse. The Trump administration is pushing to eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles, impose a new annual fee of $250 on EV owners, and halt federal investment in EV charging infrastructure. The proposed changes could stall the industry’s momentum just as it's beginning to grow, the New York Times reported.

Infrastructure remains a key challenge — then and now

One of the main reasons electric cars failed a century ago was the lack of electricity in many parts of the country. Rural America wasn’t fully electrified until the 1970s. Today, the challenge lies in the lack of accessible charging infrastructure. US Congress approved $7.5 billion under the Biden administration to build public chargers, but the Trump administration has stopped that rollout. As in the past, range anxiety and slow charging times continue to hurt EV adoption, particularly in areas outside major cities.

From feminine to macho: The changing image of EVs

Early electric cars were marketed as clean, easy-to-use alternatives — often pitched to women. Jay Leno’s 1909 Baker Electric, still operable, includes space for Victorian hats and even features a built-in makeup case. That image of quiet refinement contributed to gendered stereotypes, which played a role in their decline. Today, the narrative has shifted. Critics like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene say EVs are an attempt to “emasculate” driving culture, while Elon Musk’s Tesla Cybertruck represents an attempt to rebrand EVs as powerful and masculine. Yet Musk’s political alignment with Trump may be alienating many of Tesla’s environmentally conscious customers.

EV sales are booming globally — but slowing in the U.S.

Electric vehicle sales grew by 35% in China and 25% in Europe during early 2025. But in the U.S., sales grew just 11%. Policy uncertainty and the rollback of federal support are dampening growth. Analysts warn that while the Republican proposals may not kill the EV sector, they could delay progress by years — especially with infrastructure expansion on hold.

Lessons from history: Technology isn’t always enough

Electric cars didn’t fail a century ago due to poor design — they were simply outmatched by lower costs, better fuelling options, and political bias toward oil. As historian Leslie Kendall notes, a Ford Model T cost one-third of what an electric car did in 1908. Carrying extra gas was easy; carrying extra electricity was not. Richard Riker, the grandson of electric car pioneer Andrew L. Riker, says the same issues remain today: until fast, widespread charging is available, gas will remain more convenient.

The future of EVs may again rest on political will

Despite the setbacks, Riker believes EVs can still win the race — if charging becomes quick and widespread. “If you can charge a car in five minutes and go 500 miles,” he said, “the gasoline engine is history.” But for that future to arrive, policy support may matter as much as innovation — just as it did a century ago.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/05/20250527041958_EVs.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 01:03:44.282100

Meanwhile, The Big Love Network — a group that opposes environmental racism in Akron — has voiced concerns about emissions the Alterra plant produces.

Before the Ohio EPA decides on the request, the agency will hold a public meeting this week to hear from residents. The draft permit for Alterra will be discussed Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the Akron-Summit County Public Library at 60 S. High St. in downtown Akron.

Public comment will follow a presentation by Alterra.

In addition to the public meeting, the EPA is accepting comments on the proposal through 5 p.m. June 4.

About Alterra, an Akron company

Alterra already has permission to use a process called pyrolysis to convert hard-to-recycle plastics into raw oil products, said Katie Boyer, an EPA spokesperson.

Omar Terrie, a spokesperson for Alterra, said the company heats post-consumer plastics — like milk jugs and plastic bags — back into an oil. The oil is then sent to chemical companies to make new plastics or for other uses.

Alterra’s process turns plastics into a gas by heating them in a kiln with no oxygen, Terrie said, then converting the gas into a liquid known as a feed stock for other purposes. The process, he said, is rigorously regulated.

The company, which was founded in 2009 and has been in operation since 2015, does this work at a facility on East Waterloo Road near the Akron Fulton Airport.

If renewed, Alterra’s permit would reduce the maximum amount of plastic the company can feed into its kiln each hour — from 6,250 pounds to 5,000 pounds. Boyer said in an email the reduction request was made because Alterra found it could not meet its maximum; Terrie said the reduced number is what the plant is run at.

Terrie said the permit renewal had been delayed “out of an abundance of caution” while the EPA learned more about the technology.

The permit was first issued in 2012 and was good for 10 years; it was modified in 2013, 2015 and 2017. Boyer said the renewal was delayed because of the modifications.

Opposition concerned with ‘pollution of toxic chemicals into the air’

Big Love has for months organized in opposition to Alterra’s permit, holding meetings and rallies.

“Our concerns, obviously, are pollution of toxic chemicals into the air from the Alterra facility,” said Beth Vild, The Big Love Network’s chief operating officer and director of programming. Vild is also a member of People Over Polymers.

Vild said she has particular concerns about benzene and vinyl chloride emissions. The draft permit provides limits for a number of pollutants: volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide and particulate emissions.

If approved, Boyer said, the permit would set limits on Alterra’s emissions of those pollutants. Terrie said Alterra has operated in compliance and does not have any violations.

“We’re a good corporate neighbor and partner,” he said.

‘Barely recycling anything’ or reducing the amount of plastic in landfills?

The process that Alterra uses, Vild said, is akin to incinerating plastic waste, not recycling it. She said Alterra is “barely recycling anything” and instead just burning plastic.

Terrie said Alterra is producing 20,000 tons of synthetic oil annually, with a staff of more than 50 people that is consistently growing. While he understands there are “a lot of legacy issues in the area that predate us,” and Alterra’s technology can seem scary, he said it’s used to reduce the amount of plastic that goes into landfills.

Still, Vild is concerned that the company is “greenwashing” — claiming to care about the planet while “doing really awful, terrible things to the planet.”

Boyer said in an email that, if approved, the permit “allows the company to operate in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, following both Ohio and U.S. EPA air requirements set under the Clean Air Act.”

The permit process included an environmental justice screening. A representative from the Akron Regional Air Quality Management District, which completed the screening, did not respond to a request for the report or for comment.

The Akron Regional Air Quality Management District will make a recommendation to the EPA about whether the permit should be issued. Boyer said there’s no timeframe for the recommendation.

Public comment to the EPA can also be submitted, using permit number P0133062, online or by mail to:

The Cybertrucks are part of a larger delivery of 678 patrol vehicles to state and municipal forces, enhancing capability and public perception. Lemus’ comment reveals one of the reasons that Tesla Cybertruck continues to attract buyers despite its out-of-the-box design.

The Tesla Cybertruck’s unveiling received mixed reviews, with many commenting on its origami-like form. Over time, the pickup truck was seen as a good commercial vehicle since it attracted attention and could be imposing.

During President Donald Trump’s visit to Doha, Qatar, two Tesla Cybertruck police vehicles accompanied his motorcade. Their iconic light bars and striking design made them stand out, showcasing their versatility beyond Jalisco’s borders.

As Jalisco prepares for the global spotlight of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the Tesla Cybertrucks symbolize a fusion of cutting-edge technology and strategic security planning. The initiative aims to protect visitors and positions Jalisco as a forward-thinking region, leveraging Tesla’s innovative vehicles to enhance its global image. With the tournament approaching, these patrols could set a new standard for security at international events, blending sustainability with strength.

A controversial tax set on cars that are above the £40,000 price threshold in the United Kingdom could be abandoned, as the “Tesla Tax,” as it is commonly referred to, is taking the blame for poor EV sales.

The tax has been imposed on ICE vehicles since 2017, but on April 1, 2025, the “Expensive Car Supplement,” or ECS, was applied to new EVs sold after that date, a move that was initiated in an act of fairness.

Tesla best-rated car brand in UK, beats Toyota in reliability: survey

However, the tax is now being blamed for sluggish EV sales across various parts of Europe. In the UK, manufacturers are blaming the tax for making it more difficult to reach sales quantities for binding green car sales targets. Missing these sales goals could cost manufacturers millions or even billions of dollars.

A leaked letter seen by This Is Money and MailOnline shows the UK is ready to reconsider the tax, which is combined with a Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on cars in the second year after they are registered.

The tax could be applied to vehicles at a higher price point, or it could be eliminated altogether. However, Ben Maguire, a Lib Dem MP for one region in the UK, said:

“We will consider raising the threshold for zero-emission cars only at a future fiscal event to make it easier to buy electric cars.”

Several companies said an adjustment to the tax would be “a move in the right direction,” and one of the major new car retailers in the UK said sales targets are “unrealistic” with the tax currently set at where it is.

UK reconsiders EV sales targets, listening to automakers

Even still, without the adjustment, retailers are concerned that EVs are not at a spot where consumers truly can justify them as a purchase. One company said “cost, lack of incentives, and lack of a public charging infrastructure” are the biggest bottlenecks in the adoption of EVs.

Tesla has been hinting for a few months now that the flagship Model S and Model X would be getting some attention in 2025 as the vehicles continue to be sold in extremely low volumes.

Both models seem to be under the knife, especially as their newest versions were spotted in California earlier this week.

However, images of the vehicles seem to show that Tesla is not planning a major overhaul, which begs the question: why even do it in the first place?

Tesla makes a decision on the future of its flagship Model S and Model X

The Model S and Model X are grouped with the Cybertruck in Tesla’s quarterly delivery releases, and Q1 saw just 12,881 units of the three cars delivered. The Cybertruck likely made up the majority of this number, as some outlets reported around 6,400 deliveries of the all-electric pickup in Q1.

This is unconfirmed.

The Model S and Model X have stuck around for “sentimental reasons,” according to CEO Elon Musk, who said back in 2021:

“I mean, they’re very expensive, made in low volume. To be totally frank, we’re continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. They’re really of minor importance to the future.”

However, the cars seem to be in need of a serious refresh. As Tesla changed up the exterior aesthetic on both the Model 3 and Model Y, recent images captured of the Model X by The Kilowatts seem to show this is not the strategy with the Model X or Model S:

As we can see, the overall aesthetic of the X, if this is what Tesla plans to release, has literally no changes from a purely visual standpoint. There is the addition of the front bumper camera, which was first implemented on the Cybercab unveiled in October 2024, and then on the new Model Y this year.

There are some new 20″ wheels, and the interior has been fitted with ambient lighting.

The Model S looked to be relatively the same, other than these few hardware changes, including a rear diffuser on this Plaid that was spotted:

While these changes are welcome and should be beneficial, they don’t seem like they will encourage major sales growth, which might be something Tesla is okay with.

Admitting the two cars are low volume and not contributors to the company’s long-term goals, Musk is likely willing to just upgrade things to make these more compatible and better functioning with the Full Self-Driving suite.

Earlier this year, VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy said the S and X were not going anywhere and would get “some love” before the end of 2025:

“Just give it a minute. We’ll get there. The upgrade a couple of years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure of the car got a lot better, too. But, we’ll give it some love later this year and make sure it gets a little bit…you know, with the stuff we’ve been putting in 3 and Y. Obviously, with 3 and Y, the higher volume stuff, you’ve gotta focus there.”

It seems these strategies have held true — the S and X appear to be getting what the 3 and Y got with the ambient lighting and front bumper camera (at least on the Model Y).

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is set to kick off its own “golden age of autonomous growth” as its Robotaxi platform nears launch and a “dark chapter” for the company has evidently come to a close, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Ives has jostled his price target on Tesla shares a few times already this year, usually switching things up as the market sways and the company’s near-term outlook changes. His price target on Tesla has gone from $550 to $315 to $350 back to $500 this year, with the newest adjustment coming from a note released early on Friday.

As CEO Elon Musk has essentially started to dwindle down his commitment to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) altogether, Ives believes that Tesla’s “dark chapter” has come to a close:

“First lets address the elephant in the room…2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon’s role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story….but importantly those days are in the rear-view mirror as we are now seeing a recommitted Musk leading Tesla as CEO into this autonomous and robotics future ahead with his days in the White House now essentially over.”

Ives believes Tesla’s launch of Robotaxi should be the company’s way to unlock at least $1 trillion in value alone, especially as the Trump White House will fast-track the key initiatives the automaker needs to get things moving in the right direction:

“The $1 trillion of AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story and we believe the march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with FSD and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose.”

There are some concerns moving forward, but none of which relate to the AI/autonomous play that Ives primarily focuses on within the Friday note. Instead, they are related to demand in both Europe and Asia, as Ives said, “there is still wood to chop to turn around Model Y growth” in both of those markets.

Nevertheless, the big focus for Ives is evidently the launch of Robotaxi and the potential of the entire autonomous division that Tesla plans to offer as a ride-sharing service in the coming months. Ives also believes a 50 percent or more penetration of Full Self-Driving could totally transform the financial model and margins of Tesla moving ahead.

Aware of the setbacks Tesla could encounter, Ives still believes that Tesla will establish itself as “the true autonomous winner over” and that investors will recognize the AI vision the company has been so bullish on.

Ives pushed his price target to $500. Tesla shares are down just under 1% at the time of publication. They are trading at $337.88 at 11:45 on the East Coast.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Tesla-Cybertrucks-join-Jaliscos-police-fleet-before-2026-FIFA-World-Cup--1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-05-27 01:04:08.287946

Because of slower than expected adoption, Porsche will offer additional vehicles with combustion engines and plug-in hybrid powertrains. The company also announced a “realignment of battery activities.”

More notably, Porsche has launched an “extensive cost and rescaling program.” This will result in around 3,900 job cuts by 2029. The company is also planning to have discussions with their works council on a “structural package” that is “intended to make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term.”

Porsche CEO Dr Oliver Blume didn’t mince words as he said, “The world has changed” and “We are experiencing a fierce storm.” However, he said “We accept the challenge. We have a plan. We are acting. And we’re not wasting any time.”

Volvo Is Cutting 3,000 Jobs Globally

Over in Sweden, Volvo revealed a number of cuts as part of their previously announced “cost and cash action plan.” The latest effort targets redundancies and is slated to see the elimination of around 3,000 jobs globally. The automaker said these will “primarily affect office-based positions in Sweden and will represent around 15 percent of the total office-based workforce globally.”

The automaker went on to explain the figure includes approximately 1,000 consultants as well as 1,200 employees in Sweden. These eliminations are slated to occur this fall and the company expects the latest restructuring costs to total up to SEK 1.5 billion ($157.6 / £116.2 / €138.5 million).

Volvo CEO Håkan Samuelsson said, “The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars.” He added, “The automotive industry is in the middle of a challenging period. To address this, we must improve our cash flow generation and structurally lower our costs.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Porsche-Volvo-hgfgd.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 23:58:54.499994

The House bill, which must still be taken up by the U.S. Senate, guts key elements of the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats managed to shoehorn through Congress in 2022. Tax credits under the IRA were meant to continue through 2032, but Yale Climate Connections reports that the following measures will be phased out at the end of this year:

• For individuals: Credits for clean vehicles, used clean vehicles, alternative fuel vehicle refuelling, energy efficient home improvements, and residential clean energy;

• For businesses: Commercial clean vehicles, new energy-efficient homes, and clean hydrogen production.

“The bill has climate implications beyond gutting clean energy incentives,” Yale Climate Connection writes, with measures that eliminate the federal tax on methane pollution and speed up approval for new fossil fuel projects. “The bill also proposes major cuts to Medicaid, thus limiting access to health care for many vulnerable people, even as climate change increases health risks from weather disasters, insect-borne diseases, and extreme heat. And if passed, the bill would eliminate environmental and climate justice block grants.”

“This policy about-face couldn’t come at a worse time: Energy prices have surged 30% since 2020,” Ari Matusiak, CEO of the non-profit Rewiring America, said in a statement. “Maintaining these tax credits gives American households an opportunity to offset these price hikes.”

Climate author and Third Act co-founder Bill McKibben has a summary of the day on his The Crucial Years blog.

The House measure, literally titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, eliminates technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects that go into service after 2028, or begin construction more than 60 days after the bill is adopted, Utility Dive writes, while allowing longer lead times for nuclear projects. It also creates a “truly untenable” situation for renewable energy developers by tightening restrictions on “foreign entities of concern” like China, one analyst told the industry publication. And it shuts down a tax credit transfer arrangement under the IRA that helped small and medium projects arrange financing and previously had support from Republicans as well as Democrats.

The bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,” said Heather O’Neill, president and CEO of Advanced Energy United. “If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs, and ceding energy dominance to China.”

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. “If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

As recently as March, 21 House Republicans were urging their colleagues to protect the IRA tax credits from a premature phaseout. Last week, 14 of the original signatories were still standing behind the credits, Inside Climate News reports.

In the end, none of them voted against the bill. One of them, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) missed the vote, but had planned to support the measure.

“They’re feeling pressure to go along with whatever Trump wants and whatever the [Republican House] leadership wants,” David Spence, a professor and energy law specialist at the University of Texas at Austin, told Inside Climate. “What’s putting counter pressure on them is that for some of them that means giving up a lot of jobs and money” that their districts received thanks to the IRA. “And for others, it’s about how far they can be pushed away from their principles.”

“These clean energy tax credits have been a game changer for communities across the nation, including in the districts of the Republican representatives,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “The GOP caved to the MAGA extremists in their party so they could screw over America’s workers to stuff the pockets of billionaires.”

Princeton University associate professor and energy transition veteran Jesse Jenkins says the bill will:

• Increase U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 500 million tonnes per year in 2030 and more than a billion tonnes per year in 2035;

• Raise U.S. household and business energy expenditures by US$25 billion per year in 2030 and more than $50 billion in 2035;

• Increase average U.S. energy costs by roughly $100 to $160 per household per year in 2030 $270 to $415 per household per year in 2035;

• Reduce U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by a cumulative $1 trillion through 2035;

• Imperil $522 billion in announced but pending investments in U.S. clean energy supply and manufacturing;

• Reduce annual electric vehicle sales by roughly 40% in 2030 and “end America’s battery manufacturing boom”;

• “Substantially slow” new grid additions, raising national average retail electricity rates and monthly household electricity bills by about 9% in 2030, and up to 17% in states like Texas, Oklahoma, and swing state Pennsylvania;

• Kill off the country’s emerging clean hydrogen, carbon dioxide management, and nuclear power sectors.

Now, after Donald Trump campaigned last year against what he called the “Green New Scam”, Republicans in the U.S. Senate “must grapple with the reality behind the slogan: cutting hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy subsidies that are flowing to their own states,” the Washington Post reports.

“The majority of the government spending is creating jobs and manufacturing capacity in red states,” Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy y, told the Post. “So this puts Republicans, generally and now in the Senate, in the position of having to choose whether to support the party line or maintain support for government programs that are creating a lot of economic activity in their states.”

After the House adopted the bill, the U.S. fossil lobby weighed in in support of a measure it said would “help restore American energy dominance.”

“By preserving competitive tax policies, beginning to reverse the ‘methane fee,’ opening [oil and gas] lease sales, and advancing important progress on permitting, this historic legislation is a win for our nation’s energy future,” American Petroleum Institute President and CEO Mike Sommers said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the Senate to strengthen pro-investment provisions and keep America at the forefront of energy innovation.”

But despite the U.S. president’s loud mutterings about his “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda, the country’s fracking executives say the combination of higher costs due to Trump’s tariff wars and lower prices due to higher OPEC+ output will likely drive down U.S. production, the Financial Times reports this week.

“We’re on high alert at this point,” Devon Energy CEO Clay Gaspar told investors earlier in May. “Everything is on the table as we move into a more distressed environment.”

The experts recognized that the initiative achieved some successes, but noted that there have been debates on its overall effectiveness, with concerns raised on unmet targets, limited industrial impact, and overstated achievements.

Power Africa, launched by the US in 2013 aimed at improving access to electricity in Africa, was operated by USAID and terminated earlier this year, with the majority of its staff having been dismissed.

Nj Ayuk, the executive chairman of the African Energy Chamber, an energy advocacy group based in South Africa, said while the initiative had a good strategy, it accomplished few projects in the continent since its inception more than a decade ago.

He said the project didn't invest in natural gas, one of the continent's precious resources which is capable of powering entire Africa. In addition, it failed to implement major projects that could potentially generate a significant amount of electricity to ease the shortage of power in the continent. That includes the Inga Dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Similar sentiments were shared by Damilola Ogunbiyi, special representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All, who said even though any reduction in aid is unfortunate, the glass is seen as half full in the case of the closure of Power Africa.

""While reduced aid could potentially risk increasing the number of people living without electricity to well beyond the current 660 million people who mostly reside in Africa, we are also seeing signs of tremendous ambition in the sector,"" she said.

Lending support

She said China could help build Africa's renewable energy manufacturing capacity, lending support to existing projects such as the Africa Renewable Energy Manufacturing Initiative, while also bridging the financing gap.

Ogunbiyi noted that globally, from 2000 to 2020, Africa received less than 1.5 percent of the $2.8 trillion invested in renewable energy projects — with a downward trend indicated in subsequent years.

""Investments are critical for Africa to achieve a clean energy transition, estimated to cost over $200 billion annually,"" she said, adding that China could play a significant role in reducing the financing deficit while also helping build renewable energy markets.

She said African governments are committed to transitioning their energy systems, while tackling energy poverty.

""Because most African countries are on the front lines of climate change and its impacts, governments recognize that they need to build resilient structures and sustainable economies, but they require financing to achieve these goals. I believe China's knowledge, combined with their resources, could help,"" Ogunbiyi said.

The plan to build the reactors was approved at a State Council executive meeting in April. Eight will be third-generation Hualong One reactors, which China’s state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation and China General Nuclear Power Group claim to have independently developed based on US and French pressurized water reactors (PWR).

The remaining two reactors will be CAP1000 units based on the AP1000 PWR developed by US-based Westinghouse. The total power generation capacity of the 10 reactors is expected to reach around 12,000 megawatts.

The reactors will be built in the provinces of Shandong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, with all planned locations along the coast.

The power plants will be operated by the two nuclear energy companies, as well as such state-owned power companies as State Power Investment Corporation and China Huaneng Group.

The Chinese government has been promoting nuclear power plant construction since the 1980s, using technology from France and other countries. The disaster at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in 2011 led to the tightening of safety measures and Beijing halting new licenses for nuclear plants.

Approval for new projects resumed in 2019 and the pace quickened to about ten reactors per year from 2022.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has made nuclear power part of his efforts to cut air pollution.

Gasoline-powered vehicles contribute to air pollution and pose risks to energy security due to oil imports. China relies on overseas sources for about 70% of the crude oil it consumes. Beijing is pushing electric vehicles as an alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, creating a need to secure more electricity.

The nuclear push also serves as a measure against global warming. In 2020, Xi said China would strive to make carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions before 2060.

As a result, there were 57 nuclear reactors in operation in China at the end of 2024, with a total generating capacity of 59,760 MW, according to an April report by a Chinese government-affiliated nuclear power industry group. In terms of capacity, China is third in the world after the US and France, the report said.

Generating capacity of China’s nuclear power plants in 2030 will reach 110,000 MW, according to projections in the report, and that if the current construction pace around the world continues, China will overtake the US and France to become the leader.

Nuclear power accounted for 4.7% of China’s power mix based on generation in 2024, according to government statistics. Conventional power generation, which mainly uses coal and other fossil fuels, remains the highest at 67.4%.

The report predicts that the proportion of nuclear power will reach 10% by 2040.

In the US, construction costs for large nuclear power plants have soared, and new construction has stagnated. A large nuclear power plant built in Georgia led to the bankruptcy of Westinghouse and heavy losses for its parent company, Toshiba.

Construction costs are also rising in Europe. In China, state-owned enterprises build plants one after another, helping to increase proficiency and curb sudden cost increases.",https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nuclear-1.webp,N,,2025-05-26 22:04:39.056562

To the grief of the world, the US is reversing global endeavors against the common challenges facing humanity.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

Even highly modularized DAC units like those envisioned by Climeworks represent significant, capital-intensive systems, each processing hundreds of thousands to millions of cubic meters of air per ton of CO₂ captured.
The fundamental minimum energy required to capture CO₂ at the dilute concentrations found in ambient air sets a hard, non-negotiable energy floor.
Unlike digital technology or small-scale consumer goods, DAC units cannot shrink significantly or dramatically reduce material inputs without sacrificing performance.
More realistic projections settle higher, acknowledging inherent thermodynamic limits, persistent energy costs, and material constraints.","The remarkable cost declines in solar photovoltaic (PV) and lithium-ion batteries over the past several decades have fueled optimism in the climate policy and investment community, with many hoping direct air capture (DAC) technologies might follow a similar trajectory. Policymakers, investors, and industry proponents frequently draw analogies between DAC and these wildly successful clean-energy technologies, invoking Wright’s Law—a rule of thumb where costs fall predictably with cumulative doubling of production—to justify unjustifiably bullish projections for DAC’s future costs. Given the unrealistic scenarios requiring carbon removal to achieve net-zero emissions, the attractiveness of DAC scaling cheaply and quickly is understandable, yet such optimism demands critical scrutiny grounded in the realities of technology, markets, and physics.

I’m drawn back to this space, one I’ve been exploring for 15 years, doing technoeconomic assessments of Global Thermostat’s applicability in heavy rail, Carbon Engineering’s natural market of enhanced oil recovery and speaking to many of the leading researchers and entrepreneurs in the space. Why am I drawn back? Because I wrote about Climework’s ongoing trainwreck—105 tons total captured from a 40,000-ton annual homeopathy device and now 22% layoffs—recently, and many commenters made it clear that they thought DAC would follow solar and batteries into the nirvana of cheapness.

Solar PV and batteries achieved their cost revolutions through clear, consistent factors. Foremost was Wright’s Law itself: with each doubling of global cumulative production, solar PV saw about a 20% reduction in cost, while lithium-ion batteries experienced roughly a 19% drop per doubling. Historically, Wright’s Law saw 20% to 27% decreases, depending on the simplicity of the product. These impressive and predictable learning rates emerged for solar and batteries because both technologies quickly found mass-market applications with billions of end-users—solar panels across rooftops worldwide and lithium-ion cells powering consumer electronics and, later, electric vehicles. Such enormous, diverse markets spurred massive economies of scale, standardization of manufacturing processes, and continuous incremental innovation, driving down prices dramatically over relatively short periods.

In solar manufacturing, scale-up to gigawatt-scale factories allowed for unprecedented efficiency gains. Automation, production-line standardization, reduced material usage, and steady incremental improvements in cell efficiency combined to achieve a 99% reduction in costs since the 1970s. Batteries followed a similar pattern. Initially expensive lithium-ion cells rapidly benefited from global consumer electronics markets, then exploded in scale with the electric vehicle boom of the 2010s. Innovations in chemistry, manufacturing methods, and supply chain management drove battery costs down by over 90% since 2010 alone. Crucially, both technologies became genuinely commoditized, their costs falling sufficiently low to be attractive purely on market economics, independent of ongoing subsidies.

In stark contrast, DAC technology faces fundamental structural, thermodynamic, and market constraints that severely limit its potential to emulate these learning-curve successes. While DAC systems like those developed by Climeworks and Carbon Engineering also involve engineered modular units, their scale and replicability differ drastically from solar and batteries. Solar PV and battery units are small, identical, easily mass-produced components numbering in the billions, allowing rapid parallel production and iterative optimization. DAC, conversely, involves large, complex industrial-scale modules that process massive volumes of air. Even highly modularized DAC units like those envisioned by Climeworks represent significant, capital-intensive systems, each processing hundreds of thousands to millions of cubic meters of air per ton of CO₂ captured. Achieving large-scale global deployment would involve thousands of units—not billions—limiting opportunities for rapid learning through repetition and optimization.

Further compounding this problem, DAC relies heavily on mature, off-the-shelf technologies. Key components such as large industrial fans, chemical sorbents, heat exchangers, compressors, and pumps are already widely used across industries. Unlike emerging semiconductor processes or battery chemistries that initially featured substantial inefficiencies ripe for innovation, DAC’s hardware components are closer to their optimized cost floors, having already benefited from decades of engineering and scale in other applications. Incremental improvements in sorbent chemistry or component efficiency may yield modest savings, but the potential for radical cost reductions through fundamentally new approaches or extensive technological simplifications is inherently limited.

Perhaps the most stubborn barrier DAC faces in following a PV-like cost curve is rooted in basic physics: the energy-intensive nature of extracting CO₂ from the atmosphere. Unlike solar cells, whose primary cost drivers are fabrication efficiency and material utilization, DAC confronts unavoidable thermodynamic constraints. The fundamental minimum energy required to capture CO₂ at the dilute concentrations found in ambient air sets a hard, non-negotiable energy floor. Current DAC operations use energy at several times the theoretical minimum, but even highly optimistic scenarios still require substantial energy input, typically hundreds to thousands of kilowatt-hours per ton of CO₂. Thus, DAC will always incur significant operational energy costs that place a lower bound on achievable pricing, unlike solar panels and batteries, whose unit costs dropped rapidly with better manufacturing processes and materials science advances.

Adding complexity, DAC is physically and materially intensive. Capturing millions of tons of CO₂ per year demands enormous amounts of infrastructure—steel, concrete, sorbent materials, and sophisticated capital equipment. Unlike digital technology or small-scale consumer goods, DAC units cannot shrink significantly or dramatically reduce material inputs without sacrificing performance. Indeed, the large physical dimensions of air contactors, substantial volumes of sorbent material needed, and considerable infrastructure for regeneration and compression suggest that DAC systems will remain heavy, complex installations. As DAC scales, rather than benefit from continuously cheaper materials, increased demand for specialty chemicals and industrial materials may drive prices upward, potentially offsetting some manufacturing efficiency gains. This scenario contrasts sharply with the declining per-unit material intensity that helped accelerate solar and battery cost reductions.

Critically, DAC lacks the autonomous, self-sustaining market demand that propelled solar PV and batteries. Solar power and battery storage offered direct economic benefits to millions of end-users, enabling them to become cost-competitive with conventional energy sources over time. DAC, however, provides an environmental service—carbon removal—whose value remains purely policy-dependent. Without robust carbon pricing, governmental incentives, or regulatory mandates, DAC has no inherent private market demand, severely limiting its potential cumulative production growth. Whereas solar panels and batteries rapidly scaled through consumer and business demand, DAC expansion hinges exclusively on sustained public policy support. Such policy-driven markets are vulnerable to political shifts, budget constraints, and public sentiment, making exponential growth in DAC production far less predictable or assured.

Historical analogues from other large-scale industrial and environmental technologies underscore DAC’s challenging trajectory. Technologies such as nuclear power, large-scale carbon capture on fossil plants, and industrial chemical plants have all faced similar complexities and constraints, often resulting in slow, incremental cost reductions—or even cost escalation—as they scaled. These technologies offer more instructive benchmarks for DAC than solar or batteries, highlighting the cautious reality that DAC may experience only modest learning curves of around 10% per cumulative doubling, far slower than the 20% or more seen in clean-energy consumer markets.

All of this leads to 10% or less cost take out for a lot fewer doublings for DAC fan units, the only component which will have any volumes. The chart ends at just below 10,000 units. For context, a million ton per year Carbon Engineering system might have 250 contactor units, the basic module in a wall two kilometers long and 20 meters high. They’d have to build 64 km of their system to get to 8,000 fans, and that’s exceedingly unlikely. To get another 10%, they’d have to build 128 km of walls of their system with 16,000 units. To get another 10, 256 km with 32,000 units.

Meanwhile, a single one GW solar farm has around 1.8 million solar panels. The volumes are radically different, and the rate of cost decreases per doubling are radically different.

Looking forward, expert analyses from independent institutions like the International Energy Agency, Harvard’s Belfer Center, and the National Academies broadly agree: DAC costs will likely remain in the triple-digit dollar range per ton even after decades of scaling. Starry eyed scenarios predict DAC might achieve costs around $150 to $250 per ton by mid-century under aggressive deployment assumptions. More realistic projections settle higher, acknowledging inherent thermodynamic limits, persistent energy costs, and material constraints. Industry-driven forecasts that envision DAC below $100 per ton are simply delusional, hinging on technological breakthroughs that would require changing the laws of physics and ludicrously low energy cost assumptions as a result.

Given these realities, policymakers and investors must fundamentally rethink their near-term engagement with DAC. Aggressively reducing emissions through proven, lower-cost technologies such as electrification, renewable energy, and energy efficiency should remain the clear and unambiguous priority until energy systems are fully decarbonized and surplus renewable electricity is abundant—likely not until after 2040 and probably beyond 2050. DAC, due to its inherently high energy intensity and substantial infrastructure requirements, should not divert limited resources from direct emission-reduction strategies until we reach a point where clean energy is inexpensive and plentiful.

Policymakers and investors should limit current DAC involvement strictly to research and development, aiming to improve technology performance, reduce energy requirements, and better understand realistic long-term potential. Public spending on commercial-scale DAC deployment or infrastructure is premature and risks locking in inefficient, high-cost solutions before cleaner, lower-cost alternatives are fully exploited.

Carbon removal strategies in the immediate decades should instead emphasize nature-based methods and improved soil carbon sequestration—technologies with significantly lower energy demands and clearer short-term scalability. The belief that we can vacuum enough CO2 out of the atmosphere to reach 2050 goals should be abandoned, and more aggressive decarbonization scenarios driven through.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-26-2025-02_31_21-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-05-26 22:04:28.040266

It also shows how far Republicans are willing to go to defy congressional norms in the name of overturning Democrats' climate policies.

What would the rules have done? The first of the three rules would have required automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles through 2035, when all new-car sales would have to be zero-emission. The other two would impose zero-emission sales targets for heavy-duty trucks and require them to reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions. Ten other states are signed on to follow California's car rules.

Partisan breakdown: The Senate's vote Thursday came after weeks of Republican deliberations over whether to flout the opinion of the Senate parliamentarian, who had said that federal approval of California's standards shouldn't be subject to the Congressional Review Act. In previous Republican administrations, the U.S. EPA had tried to revoke the rules administratively. One Democratic senator — Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the vote against the car standards, compared with dozens of Democrats in the House.

What's next? Trump is expected to sign the bills in the coming weeks. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said last week they'll sue once he does.

GreenPower Motor Company sent a letter to multiple employees last week, stating “the imposition of new tariffs has significantly increased our operational costs and disrupted our ability to build and deliver buses in a timely manner.”

The letter said the financial impact will result in layoffs despite “best efforts to manage these challenges through cost-cutting and restructuring.”

The Canadian-based company at a South Charleston facility in early 2022. At the time, the operation was expected to generate 200 new jobs and create as many as 900 positions within two years.

The company launched later in 2022. Boone, Clay, Wirt and Wyoming counties were next in line thanks to .

Earlier this year, the company worked through along with dealer contract setbacks leading to delays.

Last week’s letter said the company evaluated multiple options, including reallocating resources, making internal transfers and offering voluntary separations, but none of those avenues would offset the financial burden.

“This is not a reflection of your performance, but rather an unfortunate consequence of external economic forces,” the letter said.

Eyewitness News reached out to the company for more information. A statement from GreenPower did not specify the number of employees affected, but it did detail “staggering” issues school bus manufacturers are facing:

Today, GreenPower Motor Company had to make a very difficult decision to pause manufacturing and layoff a portion of its workforce at its manufacturing facility in South Charleston, West Virginia. The imposition of new tariffs has significantly increased GreenPower’s operational costs and disrupted the company’s ability to build and deliver buses in a timely manner. Despite best efforts to manage these challenges through cost-cutting and restructuring, the financial impact has been too severe to sustain current workforce levels. This decision was not made lightly. GreenPower carefully evaluated all options, including reallocation of resources, voluntary separations and internal transfers. Unfortunately, none of these measures could fully offset the economic burden GreenPower is facing due to the tariffs.The recent implementation of trade tariffs is causing much harm to the entire school bus manufacturing sector. This business instability and the significantly increased costs impacts all school bus manufactures whether they are producing electric, diesel, propane or gas school buses. The implications are staggering.If a school bus manufacturer were able to pass these costs on to a school district, it would amount to a tax on the government as the cost would be paid by either local, state or federal government funding. But a school bus original equipment manufacturer (OEM) cannot pass on the increased cost since there are state contracts in place for the purchase of school buses. The new tariffs leave no pathway for a school bus OEM to build vehicles in the United States and it completely halts GreenPower’s efforts to on-shore and friend-shore the supply chain, especially non-Chinese battery cells and components.GreenPower is committed to supporting its employees during this transition. Employees will receive assistance from GreenPower with any questions regarding unemployment benefits or references.

The company announced final paychecks will be delivered at the end of the month for those affected by the layoffs.

This just a week before the controversial Guana Tomomato Matanzas Reserve land swamp proposal was posted online to the public.

No word if there's a connection between the two, but her resignation letter has some people scratching their heads.

Callie DeHaven is a well-respected person in conservation circles and very familiar with northeast Florida. She has abruptly resigned as the director of the Florida Division of State Lands within the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

Her resignation letter was a simple piece of notebook paper, written in pen, stating: To whom it may concern, I hereby resign my position... effective June 2nd, 2025 close of business.

This is the agency that would have been the second entity to approve the controversial land swap that would have given 600 acres of protected land inside the Guana River Wildlife Management Area in St. Johns County to a private and mysterious entity. That deal is now a no-go because the applicant -- The Upland, LLC -- withdrew the application due to public outcry.

First Coast News does not know if this issue had anything to do with DeHaven's decision to resign. We do know the letter is dated one May 6, which is one week before the land swap proposal was posted online inside a state meeting agenda.

DeHaven has been the Director of the Division of State Lands for eight years. According to her LinkedIn pages, she has also been the Manager of the Conservation Program with Rayonier and she's also worked with The Nature Conservancy.

The DEP sent us a statement saying DeHaven has dedicated “more than two decades to conservation planning, land acquisition and land stewardship. During her tenure, Florida Forever surpassed one million acres of conservation land acquired.”

“This isn’t just about one electric truck on the road, it marks a pivotal moment where we prove the viability, efficiency, and significant carbon reductions that electric freight can deliver at scale,” said Ofload CEO Geoffroy Henry.

“This is the future of logistics, and we’re leading the way.”

Jessica Renton, Head of Supply Chain ANZ At Kimberly-Clark said that as a major manufacturer of essential products found in many Aussie homes, KCA is committed to reducing its environmental impact.

“Our freight partnership with Ofload is a key lever within our supply chain and we’re proud to partner with them on this transformative project,” Renton said.

By replacing even one diesel truck with an electric alternative, Ofload and Kimberly-Clark Australia say they are proving that zero-emission freight isn’t a distant vision but a reality that can be scaled today.

Ofload and TR Group worked closely with Brisbane Transport to determine the financial viability, network integration, and operational efficiency of this transition.

Using detailed commercial modelling that factored in variables such as vehicle utilisation, kilometre range, driver hours and revenue margins, Ofload said it demonstrated the positive operational and sustainability impacts of introducing an electric truck to Brisbane Transport’s fleet.

This highlights how small and medium carriers can embrace electric freight solutions with the right logistics partners, utilisation guarantees, and financial support models, Ofload said.

KCA is already well advanced in reducing its carbon footprint, having adopted Ofload’s Carbon Analytics Platform (CAP) in May last year. CAP provides real-time visibility into its freight emissions, using Global Logistics Emissions Council – accredited calculations to accurately track, measure, and optimise its supply chain’s environmental impact.

KCA cut 5.23 per cent of its total emissions in 2024, saving 3544 tonnes of CO₂ – equating to emissions from the annual electricity usage of 670 Aussie households or nearly 22,000 car trips between Sydney and Brisbane.",https://bigrigs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ofload.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 20:02:06.831570

That’s because the construction machinery giants that grew fat off the country’s property bubble are looking for new markets to offset the downturn at home. Combined with looming electrification, the effects could be quite as dramatic as the other Made-in-China export booms which have so troubled trading partners.

Consider Sany Heavy Industry. In 2020, 83 per cent of its business was selling excavators, cranes, concrete mixers and the like to domestic developers. In the space of just four years, China’s property crash has caused its turnover in that market to shrink by two-thirds.

Overseas markets now account for more than 60 per cent of revenue. It’s hoping to raise US$1.5 billion via a Hong Kong initial public offering to help it double international sales to 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion), the South China Morning Post reported this month.

Sany isn’t alone. Its local rivals XCMG Construction Machinery, Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology, and Guangxi LiuGong Machinery are all facing the same collapse of activity on the home front, where housing starts in the first four months of 2025 fell to their lowest level since 2003.

That’s left dismal returns on all the assets they built to service a market that’s since disappeared – below 5 per cent, less than half what Caterpillar manages and well below the 7.7 per cent at Komatsu.

EXPORTS AND ELECTRIFICATION

The best way out of this problem is to find export markets to get the production lines for all those diggers, dozers, lifters and trucks humming again. Zoomlion’s international sales have followed Sany’s in becoming the largest element of its revenue, and XCMG and LiuGong aren’t far behind.

There’s plenty of work to go around. In the Persian Gulf, governments are using the windfall from the oil boom of the early 2020s to build a swath of major infrastructure projects, from the Middle East’s first Walt Disney theme park in Abu Dhabi to a new international airport in Riyadh and a US$22 billion five-year infrastructure plan for Qatar.

Construction markets are also booming across South and Southeast Asia and in parts of Africa. China’s export market share in major categories of work vehicles has soared in recent years.

As with passenger cars, electrification offers a potent route for further disruption. Batteries are often considered an ill fit for construction machinery, which has extreme power needs that diesel is particularly well-placed to deliver.

But that’s changing as lithium-ion cell-makers build cheaper and longer-lasting power packs that can often keep running as long as an eight-hour work day, according to IDTechX, a consultancy. Electric construction equipment sales will grow at 21 per cent annually up to 2044, when they’ll hit US$126 billion, IDTechX predicted last year.

Chinese manufacturers have an advantage here. Local battery-makers CATL and BYD are market leaders in LFP, the cathode chemistry that’s likely to be best-suited to site vehicles, thanks to its stability and low costs.

Already, local construction machinery manufacturers produce about two-thirds of the electric bucket loader models on the market.

RAISING THE DRAWBRIDGE INSTEAD OF COMPETING

Circumspect governments should be looking at ways to outcompete this shift. Instead, they’re raising the drawbridge.

The European Union last month set tariffs as high as 67 per cent on Chinese construction machinery, while the UK has more recently imposed duties of more than 30 per cent on excavators made by Sany, Liugong and XCMG. The Indian joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi Construction Machinery last year called on New Delhi to raise levies against imported Chinese products, saying they’d already grabbed 22 per cent of the market.

Things are even worse in the US, where the Trump administration is busy unpicking the heavy-duty vehicle emission standards introduced by former President Joe Biden. That removes much of the incentive for US-exposed manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo and Deere & Co to innovate and compete with the coming onslaught.

Work vehicles have tended to fly below the radar in discussions of urban emissions, but their vast size and power requirements give them a disproportionate share of engine pollution. China’s 10 million construction machines emit more particulates than its 417 million road vehicles, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation.

With low-emission zones spreading across cities worldwide and older diesel vehicles increasingly restricted on the roads of major cities such as London, Paris and Madrid, construction machinery is increasingly going to find itself in the crosshairs as one of the biggest contributors to urban pollution.

When that happens, Chinese manufacturers will have a solution ready to be driven from their parking lots. Will their incumbent overseas competitors be ready, too?","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--Zq0lXdKq--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/china_economy_64284.jpg?itok=Cc2rr0hm",N,,2025-05-26 20:02:12.488141

Just last week, the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant was working to shutter the facility, then DOE Secretary of Energy Chris Wright declared an emergency and ordered the plant to remain open temporarily.

Wright's order declares an emergency for portions of the Midwest grid after a report showed the potential for tight electric reserves for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which operates an electric grid across 15 states in the central United States. The DOE's order aims to increase reliability and reduce rates

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) released its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment and it forecasts that MISO is at an elevated risk of shortfalls during high-demand periods this summer, particularly in August.

The J.H. Campbell Complex—which is capable of generating 1,560 MW—was set to be retired this month, with operations ceasing on May 31.

Consumers Energy and MISO had planned for the reduction in electric capacity on the grid with the closure of J.H. Campbell and acquired a 1,200 MW natural gas power plant in Covert to supplement the reduction in electricity generated.

But despite the acquisition, the NERC Assessment still anticipates “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls.”

Wright's order, issued on May 23, 2025, takes immediate effect and requires MISO to ""take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers."" Consumers Energy is directed to comply with all orders from MISO.

The order has received both praise and pushback from lawmakers and official government bodies. The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) says that the order will do just the opposite of its intention, calling it ""unnecessary"" and claiming it will raise prices on customers.

Dan Scripps, Chair of the MPSC, issued the following statement in response to the order:

“The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the Midwest.

“Michigan is proud of its robust approach to resource planning which balances reliability and affordability. We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed. As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO.

“The MPSC will continue to work with MISO and Consumers Energy to assess the impacts of the DOE’s order and work to limit unnecessary cost increases imposed as a result of this order.”

Rep. Dave Prestin (R-Cedar River) issued a statement in support of the emergency order to keep the power plant open:

“I want to thank the administration and Secretary Wright for hearing our concerns and taking action to protect this critical energy asset and keep J.H. Campbell operational. The baseload energy produced there is crucial to tens of thousands of people who count on reliable and affordable energy.

“This facility is a regional asset, not just to Michigan, but to the entire Midwest. Its importance cannot be understated. If J.H. Campbell goes down, we enter into dangerous territory, where one bad day for any generation asset — whether it be baseload, wind, or solar — could mean widespread outages.

“The President and his administration continue to recognize the importance of safeguarding American energy production. I’m grateful for their never-ending commitment to protecting the American people’s access to affordable and reliable energy.”

According to the order, the power plant will remain open until August 21, 2025. Consumers Energy did not say if they plan to continue with the plant's retirement and closing after the order expires.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/WZZM/images/ef6619dd-5033-4fe1-b1e5-2de0dd17c8ca/20250526T181859/ef6619dd-5033-4fe1-b1e5-2de0dd17c8ca_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 20:01:53.171846

As climate disasters strain state budgets, a growing number of lawmakers want fossil fuel companies to pay for damages caused by their greenhouse gas emissions.

Last May, Vermont became the first state to pass a climate Superfund law, reports Grist. The concept is modeled after the 1980 federal Superfund law, which holds companies responsible for the costs of cleaning up their hazardous waste spills. The state-level climate version requires major oil and gas companies to pay for climate-related disaster and adaptation costs, based on their share of global greenhouse gas emissions over the past few decades. Vermont’s law passed after the state experienced torrential flooding in 2023. In December, New York became the second state to pass such a law.

This year, 11 states, from California to Maine, have introduced their own climate Superfund bills. Momentum is growing even as Vermont and New York’s laws face legal challenges by fossil fuel companies, Republican-led states, and the Trump administration. Lawmakers and climate advocates told Grist that they always expected backlash, given the billions of dollars at stake for the oil and gas industry—but that states have no choice but to find ways to pay the enormous costs of protecting and repairing infrastructure in the face of increasing floods, wildfires, and other disasters.

The opposition “emboldens our fight more,” said Maryland state delegate Adrian Boafo, who represents Prince George’s County and co-sponsored a climate Superfund bill that passed the state legislature in March. “It means that we have to do everything we can in Maryland to protect our citizens, because we can’t rely on the federal government in this moment.”

While the concept of a climate Superfund has been around for decades, it’s only in recent years that states have begun to seriously consider these laws. In Maryland, federal inaction on climate change and the growing burden of climate change on government budgets have led to a surge of interest, said Boafo. Cities and counties are getting hit with huge unexpected costs from damage to stormwater systems, streets, highways, and other public infrastructure. They’re also struggling to provide immediate disaster relief to residents and to prepare for future climate events. Maryland has faced at least US$10 billion to $20 billion in disaster costs between 1980 and 2024, according to a recent state report. Meanwhile, up until now, governments, businesses, and individuals have borne 100% of these costs.

“We realized that these big fossil fuel companies were, frankly, not paying their fair share for the climate crisis that they’ve caused,” Boafo said.

Recent bills have also been spurred by increased sophistication in attribution science, said Martin Lockman, a climate law fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. Researchers are now able to use climate models to link extreme weather events to greenhouse gas emissions from specific companies. The field provides a quantitative way for governments to determine which oil and gas companies should pay for climate damages, and how much.

Vermont’s law sets up a process for the government to first tally up the costs of climate harms in the state caused by the greenhouse gas emissions of major oil and gas companies between 1995 and 2024. The state will then determine how much of those costs each company is responsible for, invoice them accordingly, and devote the funds to climate infrastructure and resilience projects. New York’s law, by contrast, sets a funding target ahead of time by requiring certain fossil fuel companies to pay a total of $75 billion, or $3 billion per year over 25 years. The amount each company has to pay is proportionate to their share of global greenhouse gas emissions between 2000 and 2024. Both Vermont and New York’s laws apply only to companies that have emitted over 1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their respective covered periods. That would include Exxon Mobil, Shell, and other oil and gas giants.

Maryland Governor Reverses Course

Maryland’s law is so far the only climate Superfund-related legislation to pass a state legislature this year, although Governor Wes Moore vetoed the measure. The original draft of the bill would have required major fossil fuel companies to pay a one-time fee for their historic carbon emissions. But over the course of the legislative session, the bill was amended to instead simply require a study on the cumulative costs of climate change in Maryland, to understand how much money an eventual program would need to raise. The study would be due by December 2026, at which point Maryland lawmakers would need to propose new legislation to actually implement a climate Superfund program.

“I wish it wasn’t amended the way it was,” Boafo said, adding that lawmakers devoted much of their energy this legislative session to addressing Maryland’s $3.3 billion budget deficit.

In a veto letter, Moore stated that Maryland’s “budget situation” and “chaos from Washington, D.C.” mean that the state needs to reconsider any bills that require resource-intensive studies. “We face a real and present danger from a White House that continues to attack our economy with reckless abandon,” Moore wrote. “In this time of profound uncertainty, we must evaluate every expenditure with a critical eye towards our future.”

Climate advocates decried the governor’s decision, calling it “an inexplicable reversal of a position that threatens to stymie Maryland’s climate progress for negligible budget savings.” In a joint press release by three environmental groups, Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said, “This veto is not fiscal responsibility, it’s a definitive step in the opposite direction of our climate goals.”

California Tries to Build Consensus

In California, environmental groups are optimistic about the chances of a bill passing this year. This is the second year a climate Superfund bill has been introduced in the state, and the sponsors of the new bill have focused on building a broad coalition of environmental, community, and labor groups around the proposal, said Sabrina Ashjian, project director for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law. This year’s legislation was introduced shortly after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January, which could amplify lawmakers’ sense of urgency. The bill has now passed out of each legislative chamber’s environmental committee and is awaiting votes in their respective judiciary committees. If passed, the bill will next move to the full Senate and Assembly for a final vote.

Vermont, New York, and Other States Face Legal Pushback

In the meantime, legislators are keeping a close eye on ongoing legal challenges to Vermont’s and New York’s laws. In January, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, two trade groups, launched a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate Superfund law. In February, 22 Republican state attorneys general and industry groups filed a lawsuit against New York’s law. Both challenges claim that the laws violate interstate commerce protections and are preempted by federal law. Because the federal Clean Air Act regulates greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue, states cannot pass laws related to climate damages.

Now the Trump administration has joined the legal battle. On May 1, the Department of Justice sued the states of New York and Vermont over their climate Superfund programs, echoing the same arguments raised by the fossil fuel industry. The same day, the department also sued the states of Hawaiʻi and Michigan over their intentions to sue fossil fuel companies for climate-related damages. All four lawsuits frequently use identical language, Lockman pointed out. The lawsuits follow last month’s executive order by President Donald Trump that called for the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies, and directly targeted Vermont and New York’s climate Superfund laws. Shortly after the Justice Department’s lawsuits were filed, West Virginia and 23 other states announced they would join the existing lawsuit against Vermont’s law led by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.

Legal experts noted that Trump’s executive order itself has no legal impact, and that states have well-established authority to implement environmental policies. Patrick Parenteau, a legal scholar at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told the New York Times he expected the Justice Department’s cases to be dismissed. A court could end up consolidating the federal suits with existing challenges against Vermont and New York’s laws, although given that they raise the same arguments, “there’s really nothing new being added here,” said Lockman.

Climate experts told Grist that with huge amounts of money and liability at stake, lawsuits from the fossil fuel industry weren’t unexpected. Boafo said that given how much financial and political support the Trump campaign received from oil and gas corporations, it’s not a surprise that the Justice Department has sued New York and Vermont. Pursuing these laws invites inevitable opposition—but avoiding the growing costs of climate devastation is even riskier, advocates said.

Lawmakers are “passing these bills because in writing budgets, in dealing with the day-to-day operation of their states, they’re facing really serious questions about how our society is going to allocate the harms of climate change,” said Lockman. “I suspect that the lawmakers who are advocating for these bills are in it for the long haul.”

Both Vermont and New York’s laws apply only to companies that have emitted over 1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over their respective covered periods. That would include Exxon Mobil, Shell, and other oil and gas giants.

Maryland Governor Reverses Course

Maryland’s law is so far the only climate Superfund-related legislation to pass a state legislature this year, although Governor Wes Moore vetoed the measure. The original draft of the bill would have required major fossil fuel companies to pay a one-time fee for their historic carbon emissions. But over the course of the legislative session, the bill was amended to instead simply require a study on the cumulative costs of climate change in Maryland, to understand how much money an eventual program would need to raise. The study would be due by December 2026, at which point Maryland lawmakers would need to propose new legislation to actually implement a climate Superfund program.

“I wish it wasn’t amended the way it was,” Boafo said, adding that lawmakers devoted much of their energy this legislative session to addressing Maryland’s $3.3 billion budget deficit.

In a veto letter, Moore stated that Maryland’s “budget situation” and “chaos from Washington, D.C.” mean that the state needs to reconsider any bills that require resource-intensive studies. “We face a real and present danger from a White House that continues to attack our economy with reckless abandon,” Moore wrote. “In this time of profound uncertainty, we must evaluate every expenditure with a critical eye towards our future.”

Climate advocates decried the governor’s decision, calling it “an inexplicable reversal of a position that threatens to stymie Maryland’s climate progress for negligible budget savings.” In a joint press release by three environmental groups, Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said, “This veto is not fiscal responsibility, it’s a definitive step in the opposite direction of our climate goals.”

California Tries to Build Consensus

In California, environmental groups are optimistic about the chances of a bill passing this year. This is the second year a climate Superfund bill has been introduced in the state, and the sponsors of the new bill have focused on building a broad coalition of environmental, community, and labor groups around the proposal, said Sabrina Ashjian, project director for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the UCLA School of Law. This year’s legislation was introduced shortly after the devastating Los Angeles wildfires in January, which could amplify lawmakers’ sense of urgency. The bill has now passed out of each legislative chamber’s environmental committee and is awaiting votes in their respective judiciary committees. If passed, the bill will next move to the full Senate and Assembly for a final vote.

Vermont, New York, and Other States Face Legal Pushback

In the meantime, legislators are keeping a close eye on ongoing legal challenges to Vermont’s and New York’s laws. In January, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, two trade groups, launched a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate Superfund law. In February, 22 Republican state attorneys general and industry groups filed a lawsuit against New York’s law. Both challenges claim that the laws violate interstate commerce protections and are preempted by federal law. Because the federal Clean Air Act regulates greenhouse gas emissions, the groups argue, states cannot pass laws related to climate damages.

Now the Trump administration has joined the legal battle. On May 1, the Department of Justice sued the states of New York and Vermont over their climate Superfund programs, echoing the same arguments raised by the fossil fuel industry. The same day, the department also sued the states of Hawaiʻi and Michigan over their intentions to sue fossil fuel companies for climate-related damages. All four lawsuits frequently use identical language, Lockman pointed out. The lawsuits follow last month’s executive order by President Donald Trump that called for the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies, and directly targeted Vermont and New York’s climate Superfund laws. Shortly after the Justice Department’s lawsuits were filed, West Virginia and 23 other states announced they would join the existing lawsuit against Vermont’s law led by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute.

Legal experts noted that Trump’s executive order itself has no legal impact, and that states have well-established authority to implement environmental policies. Patrick Parenteau, a legal scholar at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told the New York Times he expected the Justice Department’s cases to be dismissed. A court could end up consolidating the federal suits with existing challenges against Vermont and New York’s laws, although given that they raise the same arguments, “there’s really nothing new being added here,” said Lockman.

Climate experts told Grist that with huge amounts of money and liability at stake, lawsuits from the fossil fuel industry weren’t unexpected. Boafo said that given how much financial and political support the Trump campaign received from oil and gas corporations, it’s not a surprise that the Justice Department has sued New York and Vermont. Pursuing these laws invites inevitable opposition—but avoiding the growing costs of climate devastation is even riskier, advocates said.

Lawmakers are “passing these bills because in writing budgets, in dealing with the day-to-day operation of their states, they’re facing really serious questions about how our society is going to allocate the harms of climate change,” said Lockman. “I suspect that the lawmakers who are advocating for these bills are in it for the long haul.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/flooding-cars.webp,N,,2025-05-26 18:03:49.410928

The Mahindra BE 6 was released in India, where the Redditor lives, just last year. The Redditor bought one of the only 3,000 road-registered BE 6s for $33,000 and added that ""it drives incredibly well!""

There's no joy quite like making your next car an EV. Those drivers can save thousands of dollars on fuel costs while enjoying next-gen features, like fast charging and autonomous driving.

Plus, they're more affordable than ever. The average price of a new EV is quickly approaching the average price of a gas-powered car, and that's before considering available government incentives like tax credits and rebates.

Driving an EV is better for the environment, too. A gas-powered car ""emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year,"" or about 5.1 tons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Electric vehicles, however, emit none, making them a great way of reducing your carbon footprint.

Because Hyundai just rolled out a three-row electric SUV with real range, real space, and no apologies. It’s called the 2026 IONIQ 9, and it’s not here to whisper sweet nothings about sustainability. It’s here to haul your entire family, your pets, your luggage—and your assumptions about what electric SUVs can do—across hundreds of miles of tarmac.

In a market choking on crossover clones and battery-powered compliance cars, Hyundai has gone in a refreshingly contrarian direction. They’ve built something useful.

EV Range Without the Handwringing

Let’s get the headline stat out of the way: the IONIQ 9 packs a 110.3 kWh battery, with an estimated WLTP range of 620 kilometers (about 385 miles) in its Long-Range Rear-Wheel Drive configuration. That shakes out to roughly 335 miles under the more conservative EPA estimates—putting it squarely in long-haul territory. You could drive from Portland to Seattle and back without breaking a sweat or plugging in.

And no, it’s not a sluggish eco-box. Performance AWD models hit 0–62 mph in just over five seconds, which is quick enough to startle the family dog and pass most gas-powered rivals. If you prefer range over rocket launches, the RWD variant still does the sprint in under ten seconds—plenty for suburbia.

Who’s It For—and Who Should Skip It?

This is not the EV for your minimalist friend who bikes to the farmer’s market and still refers to electricity as “the new coal.” The IONIQ 9 is for real families with real stuff and real road trips on the calendar. Think: parents who want to feel good about ditching gas, without sacrificing legroom, cargo space, or ride comfort.

If you’re looking for an electric Lotus Elise, look elsewhere. But if you’ve ever wished your SUV could double as a hotel room during soccer tournaments or a refuge on camping weekends—Hyundai has your number.

Interior That Works Like a Lounge (Minus the Bar Tab)

The IONIQ 9’s cabin is, for lack of a better word, thoughtful. Second-row seats swivel to face the third row when parked, which is perfect for board games, baby feeding, or simply arguing about directions like it’s 1996. The front and middle rows can be optioned with relaxation seats that recline fully—ideal for charging stops or momentary existential crises.

And in a stroke of marketing genius disguised as innovation, Hyundai’s optional Dynamic Body Care System gives you a massage on the go. That’s right: it’s the only three-row SUV where Dad can get a back rub and 335 miles of range in one go.

Charging Speed That Doesn’t Waste Your Time

The IONIQ 9 supports ultra-fast 350 kW charging. Translation? 10 to 80 percent in 24 minutes under ideal conditions. That’s enough time to grab coffee, answer a few emails, and contemplate how much money you’re saving by not buying petrol every week.

This matters. Range is only half the battle. Charging time is the rest—and Hyundai nails both.

Big Yet Aerodynamic. Somehow.

Despite being the longest Hyundai ever built (wheelbase: 3,130 mm), the IONIQ 9 doesn’t slice through the air like a barn. Its drag coefficient is a commendable 0.259 Cd with digital mirrors, thanks to aerodynamic trickery like dual-motion active air flaps. Even with traditional side mirrors, it stays slippery at 0.269 Cd.

In short, it’s not just a big box on wheels—it’s a smart one.

Safety and Tech: Of Course It’s Got That

Naturally, the IONIQ 9 comes loaded with the latest in alphabet soup: ADAS, OTA, NFC, you name it.

Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS): Think forward collision avoidance, blind-spot monitoring, and enough sensors to avoid a game of vehicular bumper cars.

Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates: No dealership visits just to get Apple CarPlay working.

Digital Key via NFC: Unlock your car with your phone. It’s 2025. Why not?

It’s not just tech for tech’s sake. It’s tech that makes sense.

When Can You Get It—and Where?

The IONIQ 9 launches in Korea and the U.S. in early 2025. Europe and the rest of the world will follow, assuming they don’t run out of battery cells first. Hyundai’s rolling this out deliberately, like a band that actually knows how to tour—starting with the fans who buy the tickets first.

What’s the Bigger Picture Here?

Hyundai’s aiming to launch 23 EVs by 2030. The IONIQ 9 is more than a new product—it’s a signpost. As rivals scale back EV plans, Hyundai is quietly doing the opposite. Not loudly. Not with Super Bowl ads and buzzwords. Just with smart cars that people actually want to drive.

The IONIQ 9 is a reminder that electric vehicles aren’t just about kilowatts or carbon. They’re about utility. And if that happens to come wrapped in clean lines and soft leather, all the better.

Final Verdict?

The 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 is the electric SUV Tesla should’ve built but didn’t. It’s practical, refined, and unpretentious—with just enough geeky engineering under the hood to keep enthusiasts entertained.

In the U.S., the differences of philosophy between the Democratic and Republican parties are perhaps starkest on the question of vehicle electrification. Joe Biden's Democratic administration promoted the shift to EVs with aggressive new measures, or extensions of ones introduced under the Obama administration.

The return of Donald Trump to the White House was seen as a threat to the incentives in place, and we’re about to see how the industry will be affected.

EV credits to be withdrawn

After months of the U.S. administration promising to eliminate the $7,500 USD credits for purchasing an electric vehicle, the Republican-controlled congress has adopted a version of President Trump's bill titled “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”. The wide-ranging piece of legislation is a repository of almost all of the president’s pet projects. Its very breadth will make getting it passed into law more complicated, but it also creates the risk that many of the provisions in it won’t be analyzed as closely as they should.

One of those provisions could potentially severely harm electric vehicle sales in the U.S.. If passed, the bill will eliminate the $7,500 USD credit, but it will also reduce subsidies for battery manufacturing.

A small consolation is that the provision calls for the credit program to end on December 31, 2026, which gives consumers some time. On the other hand, it specifies that for manufacturers who have sold more than 200,000 eligible vehicles, the program will end on December 31 of this year.

And that's not all. Hybrid and electric vehicles will, if the bill passes as is, be subject to annual fees of $100 and $250 USD, respectively. On this point, the question of EV owners' contribution is a subject of debate.

Safe to say, if all the proposed measures are applied, sales of electric models will decline significantly decline in the United States, which could potentially affect the supply in the Canadian market as well.

A Princeton University study, reported by the New York Times, predicts that if Republicans succeed in eliminating incentives, electric vehicle sales will only account for 24 percent of new vehicle sales in the U.S. in 2030, which is far from the targeted objectives.",http://picolio.auto123.com/auto123-media/articles/2025/5/72802/chrysler-pacifica-phev-2023_14fr.JPG,N,,2025-05-26 20:59:40.882904

Indonesia’s floating solar breakthrough is not just a startling feat of engineering – it is a signal to South America that good governance, sustainable innovation and cooperation can redefine what’s possible in the clean energy transition.","As the global race toward net-zero emissions accelerates, Indonesia’s landmark floating solar power plant on the Cirata Reservoir is illuminating a path forward for countries across Latin America – especially Colombia – where fractured geography, a post-conflict recovery, and social inequality pose challenges to energy access, food security, and climate resilience.

Inaugurated in late 2023 with a project cost of US$145 million, the Cirata Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) Project is Southeast Asia’s largest floating solar facility. The 192-megawatt plant – developed through a partnership between UAE-based renewable energy developer Masdar and Indonesia’s state-owned electricity utility PLN – now feeds 300,000 megawatt-hours annually into Indonesia’s national grid, enough to power 50,000 homes. Built on a 250-hectare reservoir with stunning views of the West Java mountain range, Cirata hydroelectric complex stands as a technical and political milestone in the country’s path to reach net-zero emissions by 2060.

Colombia, which has similarly pledged carbon neutrality by 2050, shares many of the environmental and developmental features that make the Indonesian model relevant: mountainous terrain, agricultural lowlands for staple food harvesting, tropical forests home to abundant biodiversity, and vast untapped water surfaces. But Colombia also faces a post-conflict reality where delivering reliable energy to remote, off-the-grid rural areas is crucial not only for economic development but also for peacebuilding and bridging income equality.

“Energy security is not just about powering households – it’s the foundation for agricultural productivity, local enterprise, and food sovereignty” claims a spokesperson from PLN. “Floating solar technology can help transform conflict-affected regions into self-sustaining zones by powering irrigation systems, refrigeration for perishable goods, and local food processing.”

In departments such as Caquetá, Guaviare, and Putumayo – where rivers meander through dense jungle and road access is limited – floating solar arrays on reservoirs or managed wetlands could provide a decentralized, climate-friendly energy supply to both homes and farms. This would reduce dependence on costly diesel generators and connect producers to markets with better storage, transport, and processing capacity.

The Cirata project with its 13 floating islands also showcases how infrastructure innovation can overcome complex geographical challenges. Engineers from PowerChina, the firm contracted to build the plant, designed a specialized anchoring system using metal shear keys and concrete counterweights to stabilize the floating panels against high winds and uneven underwater terrain.

Each solar island, measuring 10 hectares was tested through wind tunnel modeling and computational simulations and could be directly applicable to Colombia’s rugged Andean and Amazonian basins – where water bodies are often surrounded by steep or unstable slopes.

The potential for technology exchanges between Indonesia and Colombia is significant, particularly as both countries look to deepen Equatorial Belt cooperation and trade ties, ties that would positively benefit two other economic tigers in the hemisphere – Malaysia and Singapore.

As a founding member of the Pacific Alliance – a trade bloc that includes Chile, Mexico, and Peru – Colombia is exploring new linkages across the Pacific with Southeast Asian economies. Energy innovation, alongside agriculture and green infrastructure, could become a pillar of multilateral cooperation under emerging frameworks like the ASEAN-Pacific Alliance Action Plan.

“We must think of the energy transition as a shared regional agenda, not just a national one,” states Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Technology transfer, climate finance, and trade connectivity are ways we can learn from each other and scale solutions like floating solar.”

Indonesia and South America are also exploring stronger diplomatic ties through free trade agreements, academic exchanges, and investment forums aimed at renewable energy and environmental sustainability. Both regions are vulnerable to climate-related disasters – flooding, drought, sea level rise – and both possess biodiversity hotspots that demand an integrated approach to development.

The success of Cirata proves that large-scale clean energy infrastructure can be achieved in topographically complex nations with strong public-private partnerships. The $100 million investment was made viable through collaboration between Masdar, PowerChina, and the Indonesian government – a model Colombia could emulate as it accelerates its clean energy transition.

Floating solar parks in Colombia could also complement existing hydroelectric facilities- some of which are facing reduced capacity due to changing rainfall patterns. Hybrid systems that combine hydro and solar, like in Cirata, increase energy stability and reduce evaporation from reservoirs, enhancing overall efficiency.

Crucially, the deployment of such infrastructure in rural and former conflict zones reinforces social cohesion and post-conflict reconciliation efforts. Colombia’s Truth Commission has identified inequality in access to basic services, including electricity, as a key driver of the internal conflict. Closing this gap through non-extractive energy sources can transform isolated communities into hubs of food production and ecological leadership.

Indonesia’s floating solar breakthrough is not just a startling feat of engineering – it is a signal to South America that good governance, sustainable innovation and cooperation can redefine what’s possible in the clean energy transition. For Colombia and its closest allies, embracing such solutions could illuminate the way to a more equitable, climate-resilient, and food-secure future- one powered by the sun and floating on water.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment.
Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.
So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.
But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.","The Environmental Protection Agency has drafted a plan to eliminate all limits on greenhouse gases from coal and gas-fired power plants in the United States, according to internal agency documents reviewed by The New York Times.

In its proposed regulation, the agency argued that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions. Eliminating those emissions would have no meaningful effect on public health and welfare, the agency said.

But in the United States, the power sector was the second biggest source of greenhouse gases, behind transportation, according to the most recent data available on the E.P.A. website. And globally, power plants account for about 30 percent of the pollution that is driving climate change.

The E.P.A. sent the draft to the White House for review on May 2. It could undergo changes before it is formally released and the public is given the opportunity to offer comments, likely in June.

The proposed regulation is part of a broader attack by the Trump administration on the established science that greenhouse gases threaten human health and the environment. Scientists have overwhelmingly concluded that carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases from the burning of oil, gas and coal are dangerously heating the planet.

“Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States, and emit pollution levels that exceed the vast majority of countries in the world,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group.

She called the proposed regulation “an abuse of the E.P.A.’s responsibility under the law” and added, “It flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harms way to say the single largest industrial source of carbon dioxide in the United States is not significant.”

“We are seeking to ensure that the agency follows the rule of law while providing all Americans with access to reliable and affordable energy,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement.

Mr. Zeldin’s spokeswoman, Molly Vaseliou, declined to offer more information about the plan other than to say “the proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the administrator.”

The Trump administration is methodically uprooting policies aimed at curbing climate change, and the E.P.A. is at the epicenter of that effort. In recent weeks, Mr. Zeldin has shuttered offices responsible for regulating climate and air pollution, and has launched the repeal of more than two dozen regulations and policies.

The agency is feeling pressure from the White House to finalize its deregulations by December, according to two people briefed on internal discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe them. That would be an extraordinarily fast pace. Rewriting regulations can typically take more than a year.

Mr. Zeldin said deregulation would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

In proposing to lift regulations on power plants, the E.P.A. points to the fact that the U.S. share of global power sector emissions represented about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005. So, it argued, even if American power plants erased all their greenhouse gases from the power sector, the risk to public health would not be “meaningfully” improved.

But in the U.S., power plants were responsible for about 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022. They emitted about 1.5 billion metric tons of emissions in 2023, which is more than the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by most countries.

Just a year ago, when the Biden administration announced tough new limits on pollution from existing coal-fired power plants as well as some new gas-burning plants, the E.P.A. said the restrictions would mean that by 2035 the nation would annually avoid up to 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital visits, 1,900 cases of asthma, 48,000 school absences and 57,000 lost work days.

Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, noted that solving climate change means undertaking a large number of seemingly small measures, like curbing emissions from automobiles, oil and gas wells, air travel, landfills, buildings and more.

“Just because there are multiple contributors to a problem doesn’t mean we should excuse all but the top one,” Dr. Oppenheimer said. “Just because a polluter’s emissions are decreasing doesn’t mean that aren’t still far too high.”

Attorneys who represent utility companies said they agree that the sector is a small part of the global climate problem. “The argument is a solid argument,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell.

But he wondered if it would hold up under a legal challenge. “I just don’t know if you’re contributing 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions the court will say ‘that’s not significant’ when there’s hardly anybody that contributes more than that.”",https://governorswindenergycoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-wind.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 22:59:49.742694

In a groundbreaking move, these automakers are set to trial a new robotic system at Incheon International Airport in South Korea, aimed at automating the EV charging process. This development marks a pivotal step towards a more efficient and user-friendly electric vehicle ecosystem. But what does this mean for the future of EVs and the broader transportation infrastructure?

Revolutionizing EV Charging with AI

The introduction of the Electric Vehicle Automatic Charging Robot (ACR) by Hyundai and Kia is a game-changer in the realm of EV charging. This single-arm robot is designed to automatically plug a charging cable into an electric vehicle and disconnect it upon completion. The ACR employs a sophisticated 3D camera-based AI algorithm to accurately plug the charger into the port, ensuring seamless operation. This technology aims to make EV ownership more convenient, eliminating the need for manual intervention in the charging process.

To verify the efficacy of this cutting-edge technology, engineers have constructed a specialized outdoor test station at their R&D center. This station replicates various environmental conditions, allowing the ACR to be tested rigorously. The robot has achieved an impressive IP65 rating for water and dust resistance, demonstrating its capability to operate in harsh environments. With its advanced features, the ACR stands as a testament to Hyundai and Kia’s commitment to innovation in the EV sector.

Enhancing Transportation Infrastructure

In partnership with Incheon International Airport Corporation, Hyundai and Kia are deploying the ACR system in a high-security, high-traffic environment. This collaboration marks a significant step towards expanding automated EV charging infrastructure in Korea. Incheon Airport, known for its eco-friendly vehicle initiatives, serves as an ideal testing ground for this technology. The airport has already transitioned its entire business fleet to eco-friendly vehicles and is targeting 1,110 EV chargers by 2026, making it a hub for sustainable transportation.

As part of this collaboration, Hyundai and Kia will supply ACR units and customize service operation scenarios to fit the airport’s unique environment. The Robotics Lab will lead efforts to evaluate and enhance the technology under actual airport conditions, ensuring its reliability and efficiency. This initiative not only enhances the airport’s infrastructure but also sets a precedent for future deployments in other critical transportation hubs such as ports and railway stations.

A Step Towards Autonomous EV Services

The deployment of the ACR at Incheon Airport is part of a broader strategy to integrate autonomous services into the EV ecosystem. Hyundai and Kia plan to leverage the airport deployment as a model for wider application in other essential transport infrastructures. By refining the ACR technology in a real-world setting, the companies aim to create a scalable model that can be adopted globally.

Team member feedback will play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and user-friendliness of the ACR. The experience gained from previous installations at locations like ‘Factory Seongsu’ in Seoul and the ‘Jeju Savile E-pit Charging Station’ will inform future developments. This project is a testament to Hyundai and Kia’s vision of a future where EV charging is seamless, autonomous, and integrated into daily life.

Implications for the Future of EVs

The introduction of the ACR system is poised to have far-reaching implications for the future of electric vehicles. By automating the charging process, Hyundai and Kia are addressing one of the key challenges facing EV owners: the inconvenience of manual charging. This development is likely to encourage more consumers to consider switching to electric vehicles, thereby accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation.

Moreover, the success of the ACR system at Incheon Airport could pave the way for similar deployments worldwide, transforming how we think about EV infrastructure. As the technology becomes more widely available, it could lead to a more interconnected and efficient transportation network, where autonomous systems play a central role. The question remains: how will this innovation influence the global adoption of electric vehicles and the evolution of smart cities?

With headaches like these, public EV chargers are looking more and more attractive every day.","The longtime US convenience store and gas retailer Circle K has been planting new EV charging stations into its sprawling, 20-nation network, including here in the US. Saving the planet from car exhaust is not the only reason. Electrification is a bottom line benefit for retailers. It buffers the motorist-serving industry from headaches resulting from liquid fuel delivery interruptions, while reducing the risk of damage claims from the dreaded fuel “cross drop.”

Circle K & EV Charging In The US

Circle K began life as an iconic US brand of the 1950s, later to be transformed into a global presence after the Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard entered the timeline in 2003. The company has been introducing public EV chargers to its roster, taking advantage of its convenience store amenities and its own Circle K charging app.

Here in the US, several years ago Circle K also nailed down a federal EV charging award from the newly established NEVI (National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure) program, funded though a carve-out from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

One highlight of Circle K’s electrification efforts occurred in 2023 when the company installed a DC fast charging station at one of its stores in Wytheville, Virginia. The installation marked the first use of domestically manufactured DC fast chargers produced by ABB E-mobility at its new factory in South Carolina.

Last year Circle K also won accolades for installing the first EV fast charging station in Kentucky to be funded through the NEVI program. “The station, conveniently located at a centralized Circle K in Richmond, will help the Bluegrass State become a leader in building out reliable EV charging infrastructure and stay on track with its ambitious goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050,” enthused the US Joint Office of Energy and Transportation in a press release marking the occasion.

Trump Or No Trump, More EV Chargers For The USA

Much has changed since last year. The malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who currently occupies the White House summarily suspended the NEVI program in February, shortly after taking office. Tax credits for EVs and related technology are next on the chopping block.

Meanwhile, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation is a shell of its former self. The first-of-its kind electrification collaboration between the Energy Department and the Transportation Department, which helped coordinate the NEVI program, was “caught in the crossfire” of the Trump-Musk chainsaw. Its website is still active as of this writing, but its full time staff of 50 reportedly evaporated by the end of April.

Despite the White House buzz saw, though, EV charging stakeholders all over the US are moving forward with new charging infrastructure, including amenity-packed, lounge-type charging facilities, cost-cutting battery-integrated chargers, new fleet charging systems, and no-hassle charging solutions for multi-household residences, too.

What Is Cooking Over At Circle K?

On its part, Circle K has not made a major announcement about its EV charging plans for the US since 2022, when issued the 200-port pledge. That’s a drop in the bucket, as Circle K currently has thousands of US locations.

Another seemingly backwards step occurred last fall, when Couche-Tard promoted its former SVP of Global Fuels, Louise Warner, to the role of EVP of North American Operations and global commercial optimization, too. Warner came to Couche-Tard in 2021 with a long background in the Chevron subsidiary CalTex Australia.

However, appearances can be deceiving. “Fuels” is a loaded word these days, especially in the context of “Global Fuels.”

“One of Warner’s priorities as SVP of fuels was helping deploy Couche-Tard’s electric vehicle charging program in the U.S., which launched four months after she joined the company,” reported the news organization C-Store Dive last fall, further taking note of Couche-Tard’s commitment to “meeting its customers’ “evolving mobility needs” in all markets.

“As SVP of fuels, Warner was on Couche-Tard’s Sustainability Steering Committee, which meets quarterly to discuss the risks and potential impacts of climate change on the business,” C-Store Dive added.

EV Chargers Only At Circle K

In contrast to the pall of quietude settling over Couche-Tard’s charging plans for its US operations, last week the company grabbed the media spotlight when it announced the official opening of a new Circle K location in Sweden. Situated along the E6 route in Gårda, near central Gothenburg, the new location sports exactly zero liquid fuel pumps.

It’s not the first EV-only Circle K location, but Couche-Tard states that it is the biggest one so far. “With ten ultra-fast chargers and a 100 m² (1,076 ft²) convenience store, Gårda is the largest EV charging-only convenience location in Circle K’s global network,” Couche-Tard explained in a press statement.

“Our new location at Gårda marks a significant step in our ambition to win the EV customer – offering easy and convenient charging with a complete retail experience,” enthused the company’s EVP of European Operations and Global eMobility, Hans-Olav Høidahl.

“It’s a safe harbor on the road, and a clear step forward in our ambition to be the preferred on-the-go charging destination across Europe,” Høidahl added.

“Its ten ultra–fast 400 kW chargers power vehicles from zero to 80 percent in about fifteen minutes, while the store – which offers fresh pizza, kebab, and award–winning sausage,” Couche-Tard emphasized for good measure.

No Tesla, No Cross-Drops, No Driver Shortages

If the emphasis on EV fast charging sounds like Circle K is challenging the Tesla Supercharger network in Europe, that’s no accident. “The company’s European network now includes more than 3,000 Circle K branded chargers and continues to grow quickly to meet rising demand,” Couche-Tard noted in its Gårda EV charging announcement, taking an oblique swipe at the falling fortunes of the Tesla brand.

As everyone knows by now, the Tesla brand has become toxic among prospective EV buyers in Europe and elsewhere around the world. Apparently Couche-Tard sees an opening for Circle K to challenge the Tesla-branded Supercharger network as well.

Couche-Tard also emphasized that Circle K will continue to offer gasmobile options among its 17,000 locations worldwide, so don’t get too excited about a couple of all-electric locations here and there. Still, the opening of the Gårda station suggests that going all-in on EV charging can resolve at least two key issues bedeviling global retail businesses like Couche-Tard.

One issue is the risk of cross drops, which is industry-speak for what happens when a fuel truck driver mistakenly pumps a load of fuel into the wrong storage tank. Such mistakes are vanishingly rare but when they do happen, both financial and reputational damage are in store. Earlier this year, for example, Circle K locations in Ohio and Arizona had to deal with the fallout from cross drops, costing drivers thousands in damage repairs when they filled up with diesel instead of gas.

A related issue involves the risk of fuel delivery interruptions. Unlike severe weather events that can interrupt access to public EV charging stations and retail fuel pumps alike, fuel truck delivery shortages are specific to the liquid fuel industry.

One broad concern here in the US is a shortage of qualified truck drivers. The problem surfaced back in 2021 on the heels of the COVID-19 lockdown, when a lack of drivers resulted in a reports of fuel pumps running dry at retail locations around the US.

Additional shortage risks can occur due to accidents or outright malfeasance. A quick search of the Intertubes reveals multiple tanker truck fuel spills resulting from crashes here in the US so far this year. In one particularly egregious incident, a driver is alleged to have deliberately dumped 2,000 gallons of jet fuel along a five-moile stretch of road in Alabama, in an effort to empty the tanker before filling up with a load of gas.

With headaches like these, public EV chargers are looking more and more attractive every day. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.

And he warned that Republicans were giving China an economic advantage, as electric vehicles become essential around the world.","There is little question that California leaders already see fossil fuels as a relic of the past.

At the Southern California headquarters of the state’s powerful clean-air regulator, the centerpiece art installation depicts in limestone a petrified gas station. Fuel nozzles lie on the ground in decay, evoking an imagined extinction of gas pumps.

For more than half a century, the federal government has allowed California to set its own stringent pollution limits, a practice that has resulted in more efficient vehicles and the nation’s most aggressive push toward electric cars. Many Democratic-led states have adopted California’s standards, prompting automakers to move their national fleets in the same direction.

With that unusual power, however, has come resentment from Republican states where the fossil fuel industry still undergirds their present and future. When Republicans in Congress last week revoked the state’s authority to set three of its mandates on electric vehicles and trucks, they saw it not just as a policy reversal but also as a statement that liberal California should be put in its place.

“We’ve created a superstate system where California has more rights than other states,” Representative Morgan Griffith, who represents rural southwestern Virginia, said in an interview. “My constituents think most folks in California are out of touch with reality. You see this stuff coming out of California and say, ‘What?’”

California has used that authority to build one of the world’s most powerful environmental agencies, the California Air Resources Board. The board now regulates the airborne emissions released by everything from perfumes to power plants. Products that repeatedly fail to comply with its standards can be barred from sale in the state.

So many consumers live in California or in states like New York and Pennsylvania that adopt the same standards that manufacturers see little to be gained by making their products in two versions, one to satisfy those states’ rules and another for the rest of the country. So California’s requirements often become de facto national standards.

The policy that has drawn the most Republican opposition has been California’s mandate to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035.

Republicans, whose party has strong ties to the oil industry, spoke last week about why electric vehicles would be impractical for their constituents.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said on the floor that electric vehicles’ limited range made them unsuitable for farmers, ranchers and others in his rural state who must drive long distances each day.

Though California’s rules would not bar the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles anywhere else, Mr. Barrasso and other Republicans suggested that without the California market, manufacturers would curb their production.

“Every American would lose options — whether you live in California or not,” Mr. Barrasso said. “California’s E.V. mandates ban the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks. No more in America. Can you imagine that in Oklahoma or my home state of Wyoming?”

Their arguments also ventured into the ideological realm. In floor arguments and in statements to The New York Times, Republican lawmakers spoke of what the technology — and California — represented to the wider populace.

Other Republican lawmakers condemned what they called California’s “extreme environmental agenda.” Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, said in a statement that the “radical liberal state of California” should not be governing for the “hard-working patriots in my district.”

Mr. Nehls is the House author of the Stop California from Advancing Regulatory Burden Act of 2025. It is otherwise known as the Stop C.A.R.B. Act, an indication of just how large California’s air board — known by its initials, C.A.R.B. — looms in the eyes of Republicans. That bill, which would repeal the section of the Clean Air Act that lets California get waivers to set its own regulations, is pending in the House, as is a similar measure in the Senate.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the smog in Los Angeles was so thick that the giant Hollywood sign often could not be seen from just a few miles away. .

Over the years, C.A.R.B. sharply reduced the state’s pollution problem by enacting stringent rules, many of which were eventually adopted nationwide. California’s regulatory climate encouraged technical innovations like the low-emission engine that Honda produced in the 1970s; the three-way catalytic converter with an oxygen sensor that Volvo pioneered later that decade; and Tesla’s popularization of electric vehicles.

Ann Carlson, who helped write policies for the Biden administration on tailpipe emissions and now teaches law at the University of California, Los Angeles, recalled the severe smog that made her eyes burn and her lungs ache when she was a child in Southern California in the 1960s. The bad air was a product of the postwar explosion in population across a vast area of the Los Angeles basin, high rates of car ownership and topography that tended to trap smog, she said.

Her leadership was so influential that the agency dedicated its Southern California office to her. In 2022, Ms. Nichols and other California leaders christened the new building by cutting a gasoline hose with a pair of oversized shears.

On Friday, the day after the Senate vote, Ms. Nichols sounded sanguine about the fact that California — and the work of her former agency — was being targeted by federal lawmakers.

“That’s the price you pay for success, I suppose,” Ms. Nichols, who lives in Los Angeles, said in an interview. “We’re in a period of lashing out against all kinds of progress, and that’s what C.A.R.B. represents.”

She said that the federal government over the years had sent members of the board’s staff to India, China and Russia to help other countries with their smog problems. In turn, delegates from countries around the world have visited Sacramento to learn about what the state has done to reduce its emissions, she said.

Is California trying to influence national policy?

“There’s no question about that,” Ms. Nichols said. But she added, “It’s not a crusade to make the rest of the world look like California. It’s a recognition that we’ve been privileged to be able to pioneer some very good technologies, and we’re pleased to be able to share them with the world.”

Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, said that he thought Republicans were upset that so many states wanted to follow California’s lead.

“Their overarching goal was not energy independence,” Mr. Schiff said. “Their overarching goal was oil dependence, and California was making the country less dependent on oil.”

Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, suggested that Republicans were acting counter to the states’ rights philosophy that had been a core principle of their party. And he warned that Republicans were giving China an economic advantage, as electric vehicles become essential around the world.

“It’s wrongheaded that they have it in for California as badly as they do,” he said.

The three bills passed by the Senate Thursday had already been approved by the House, and President Trump is expected to sign them all. To pass the bills, though, the Senate acted against a ruling by its own nonpartisan parliamentarian, who said that it was inappropriate to use the provisions of the Congressional Review Act in the way the Senate did, to revoke California’s clean air waivers and to avoid a filibuster.

Rob Bonta, California’s Democratic attorney general, has said he would sue the federal government if the bills became law. Mr. Bonta and Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced the congressional moves at a news conference Thursday, and displayed a sign declaring that “Trump’s G.O.P. Is Making America Smoggy Again.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/26/multimedia/26nat-ca-enviro-01-wmcz/26nat-ca-enviro-01-wmcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 16:05:01.055902

What was once considered a stable and secure retirement system is now subject to significant fiscal pressures and political trade-offs.","Federal employees and retirees are facing the most significant proposed changes to their benefits in decades. A series of sweeping proposals targeting the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and associated benefits could reshape the financial future of millions of federal workers. From pension recalibrations to healthcare voucher reforms, and even the potential elimination of core benefits for future hires, the once-stable landscape of federal retirement is facing seismic shifts.

While it’s easy to feel both frustrated, angry and overwhelmed, it’s crucial to assess the actual implications. In this article, I’ll break down the proposed changes, anticipated timeline for implementation, and most importantly, what it could mean for your financial future.

Why is this happening?

The driver behind these proposed changes is House Concurrent Resolution 14 (H.Con.Res. 14), a budgetary framework aimed at cutting $2 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. Though the figure sounds staggering, it pales in comparison to the whopping $86 trillion projected to be spent over the same time. Notably, $50 billion of the proposed cuts target federal retirement and healthcare programs specifically.

Both chambers of Congress have passed their own versions of this bill and are currently in the reconciliation phase. The House Budget Committee failed to pass the bill at first and made significant changes to soften the blow in attempts to gain favor, leading to an approval late on May 18th. This isn’t finalized yet, so some additional changes may be made, but it’s anticipated to be voted on by both chambers in the next month. If approved, it will head to President Trump’s desk.

With so many changes being made, let’s dive into what’s still active and what’s been shelved.

What’s active:

Elimination of FERS supplement

The FERS Supplement is on the chopping block. It was created to provide Social Security-like income for eligible federal employees retiring before age 62. This income was used to bridge the gap until they are eligible to file for their actual Social Security benefits.

FERS supplement computation: (Years of service / 40) * Social Security at 62

The proposed changes would discontinue FERS supplement for future retirees. There’s a potential exception for special groups like law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers but details are still pending.

Proposed implementation date: This has been changed from being effective on the law’s enactment to January 1, 2028, and grandfather in current FERS Supplement recipients. (5 USC 8421a)

This is a HUGE victory for those who took the deferred resignation with the understanding they would receive the supplement or those who may be impacted by the ongoing reductions in force.

At-will employment or higher FERS contribution

New hires will get a choice: Pay 9.4% FERS contribution or pay 4.4% and be made “at-will.” It’s important to note that this would be a permanent election, so you can’t choose the at-will employment and then switch to the increased FERS contributions to get job security in the later years of employment.

Proposed implementation date: The bill’s enactment date

This will make it even more difficult for federal employees to save for retirement, as it’s likely most would opt for the increased contributions over at-will employment.

Audits of participants in the FEHB program

Mandates that the Office of Personnel Management develop a process to verify family member eligibility when adding coverage, qualifying life event, or removes a family member. OPM and employing agencies would also conduct audits of FEHB-enrolled family members to ensure they are still eligible. Finally, OPM would be required to keep records of eligible family members for a specified time period and to include a fraud risk assessment.

$350 fee to file appeals with the Merit Systems Protection Board

This would be a reimbursable fee if a claim or appeal is successful. This covers the federal district court filings under Section 1914(a) of Title 28.

What’s inactive (for now):

Reduction/elimination of COLA

Now for some good news! The proposal to reduce or eliminate cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for FERS retirees was shelved, for now. This would have been the most harmful change of the entire proposal, so for now, this is a sigh of relief.

The FERS annuity, while not tied to inflation, does a great job of keeping up — something that differentiates it from other sources like private annuities.

Current policy:

Inflation (CPI Index) COLA Under 2.0% Same as CPI 2.0 – 3.0% 2.0% Above 3.0% CPI minus 1.0%

For comparison, private annuities typically charge an extra fee, known as a rider, for inflationary adjustments — something that could be a decision at retirement in the future, much like having a cost to add a survivor benefit.

Increased FERS contributions

More good news! In the latest revision on May 18th, the new provision to force current federal employees to increase their FERS contribution to 4.4% was also shelved. However, it’s still important to understand what was being proposed as this could also resurface in the future.

Current system:

Retirement System Hire Date Employee Contribution FERS Before 2013 0.8% FERS-RAE During 2013 3.1% FERS-FRAE After 2013 4.4%

Example: To illustrate the cost, here’s a simple projection assuming a $100,000 salary, 2% annual COLA for salary, and no step increases or promotions. Additionally, let’s assume we invest that additional FERS contribution and earn a modest 5% per year.

Year Salary Additional Cost (3.6%) Opportunity Cost (5% return/year) 1 $100,000 $3,600 $3,600 2 $102,000 $3,672 $7,636 3 $104,040 $3,745 $11,950 4 $106,121 $3,820 $16,559 5 $108,243 $3,897 $21,479 6 $110,408 $3,975 $26,726 7 $112,616 $4,054 $32,319 8 $114,869 $4,135 $38,277 9 $117,166 $4,218 $44,620 10 $119,509 $4,302 $51,368

Over a decade, that’s nearly $40,000 in added cost. Not to mention, if you were to invest those funds at a 5% rate of return, you’d have over $51,000.

High-3 to high-5 salary

Currently, FERS annuities are based on your “High-3” average salary. This would be the highest-paid, consecutive 36 months of basic pay during your federal career. The proposed change would shift this to be based on your “High-5” average salary. A high-5 change would affect you the most if you’ve had step increases or a promotion recently as well as during periods of time with higher salary COLAs. Law enforcement officers are expected to be exempt and remain on the high-3 pension structure.

Proposed implementation date: Originally January 1, 2027 but changed to January 1, 2028, then finally shelved on May 21st.

Example: Let’s look at the impact in an example. Assuming someone earned a $100,000 salary in 2020 and had no step increases over the past 5 years.

FEHB voucher system

This was retracted on the House Committee meeting on April 30th. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they estimate this change would save $20 billion between 2026 and 2035.

Currently, the federal government covers approximately 72% of Federal Employee Health Benefit (FEHB) premiums. Under the previously proposed change, this system would be replaced with a voucher model, where the government provides a fixed-dollar contribution that increases only with general inflation. Since healthcare costs typically rise faster (~5% annually) compared to general inflation (~2.5% annually), this means the government’s share will shrink over time.

While the impact may not be immediate, the government’s contribution will gradually erode over time, leading to higher out-of-pocket costs in the future, especially in the years when you may need healthcare the most.

This makes a case that more federal employees should reconsider combining FEHB with Medicare Part B. This is a topic for another day but if you haven’t enrolled and you’re passed eligibility requirements, please be aware of the penalties.

There’s a 10% permanent penalty for each year you delayed Part B enrollment after when you were first eligible.

G Fund reform

The G Fund, widely known for its steady returns, may undergo a structural reform. The new proposal would change the composition of the G Fund to mirror short-term Treasury bills. This would slightly expose it to market volatility, varying returns, and while rare, the potential for a negative year.

This could change the foundation of retirement investing for many within the TSP. Additionally, one may want to reconsider the use of lifecycle funds due to the high concentration of G fund in the closer target date years such as L Income or L 2030.

What should you do now?

Monitor legislative developments: Final reconciliation votes are expected in the next few couple of months, if not sooner.

Run retirement scenarios: Evaluate early retirement options before certain rule changes may take effect.

Re-evaluate your investment strategy: With potential for less pension and higher healthcare costs, you may need to evaluate your investment risk.

Review Medicare decisions: If you’re near or above age 65, revisit your strategy for Medicare Part B and FEHB in case FEHB changes to a voucher system in the future.

Talk to a specialist: These changes are complex. Work with a federal retirement expert who can customize a plan for your situation and evaluate your options for you.

Final thoughts

The proposed reforms represent a turning point. What was once considered a stable and secure retirement system is now subject to significant fiscal pressures and political trade-offs. While the current proposal has been softened, the message is clear: Federal benefits are no longer safe.

While we may be safe for now, the inclusion of some of these items in the initial draft suggests they could resurface in future negotiations. Namely, the high-3 to high-5 salary, reduction/elimination of the COLA on FERS/CSRS annuities, increased FERS contributions, FEHB voucher system, and G Fund reform. It’s also worth noting the House Committee was supposed to cut $50 billion from federal benefits and the changes listed above would be closer to $15 billion.

With that, proactive planning is not just smart; it’s essential. Be sure to build flexibility into your retirement plan, stress-test it against multiple outcomes, and prepare not just for what is, but for what may come. The best defense against these systemic shifts is to have a plan.

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-26 19:11:54+00:00,Canary Media,A Michigan coal plant was about to close. Trump ordered it to stay open. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/politics/a-michigan-coal-plant-was-about-to-close-trump-ordered-it-to-stay-open,"Campbell plant, a 1,560-megawatt coal-burning power plant owned by Michigan utility Consumers Energy, must abandon its plans to shut down on May 31 and instead continue operating through at least late August.
They warned that keeping this coal plant open will worsen pollution, harm nearby communities, and increase costs for utility customers.
The DOE’s claims that the coal plant is necessary to ensure regional grid reliability do not hold up, he said.
​“Summer is now an emergency to the Trump administration.” Who will pay for keeping an unnecessary coal plant open?
That, in turn, makes it very probable that the coal plant will be losing money.","The Trump administration has followed through on a threat to use emergency wartime powers to force expensive and polluting coal-fired power plants to stay open — even if the utilities that own them, the states in which they operate, and the grid operators responsible for maintaining reliability all agree it’s safe to shut them down.

On Friday, the U.S. Department of Energy issued an order demanding that the J.H. Campbell plant, a 1,560-megawatt coal-burning power plant owned by Michigan utility Consumers Energy, must abandon its plans to shut down on May 31 and instead continue operating through at least late August.

The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former gas industry executive and a vocal denier of the climate change crisis, states that ​“an emergency exists in portions of the Midwest region of the United States due to a shortage of electric energy.” It cites this rationale to invoke the DOE’s emergency authority under the 1935 Federal Power Act to unilaterally order any power plant in the country to keep running.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said in a Friday press release. President Donald Trump issued a slew of executive orders in April aimed at ​“bringing back” the U.S.coal industry, including an order authorizing the DOE to cite grid reliability as justification for keeping coal plants open.

“A manufactured emergency”

Environmental and consumer watchdogs decried Friday’s announcement as an unlawful abuse of power that serves the administration’s pro-coal agenda. They warned that keeping this coal plant open will worsen pollution, harm nearby communities, and increase costs for utility customers.

“Donald Trump invoking the Federal Power Act is an illegal abuse of his presidential authority. Coal is expensive, outdated, and deadly,” Greg Wannier, senior attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, said in a Friday statement. “[A]ll of the relevant parties, including MISO, the grid operator ultimately responsible for keeping the lights on in Michigan, concluded years ago that J.H. Campbell could retire without causing any grid reliability problems.”

Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen, accused the DOE of ​“making up a manufactured emergency to accomplish a crass political outcome — Trump being able to say, ​‘I saved a coal-fired power plant.’”

Wright’s order comes just eight days before J.H. Campbell’s scheduled May 31 retirement under a plan that has been in the works since 2021. The planned shutdown is part of a broader agreement between Consumers Energy and state regulators to end coal use by 2025 and put the utility on a path to meeting the state’s mandate of 100% carbon-free power by 2040. Consumers Energy has estimated that the switch from costlier coal to cheap gas, solar, and energy storage will save customers $600 million through 2040.

Consumers Energy has bought a 1,200-MW gas-fired power plant to make up for the energy and grid support that the J.H. Campbell plant provided, and has continued to build and contract for utility-scale solar power and battery storage. The DOE’s order ignores this preparation for keeping Michigan’s grid reliable, Wannier said.

The DOE’s claims that the coal plant is necessary to ensure regional grid reliability do not hold up, he said. Michigan regulators, Consumers Energy, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the entity that manages grid reliability across Michigan and 14 other Midwest states, have had years to plan for losing the coal plant’s energy and capacity services, and have found no reason to delay its closure, he said.

MISO has the power to order power plants to stay open if it determines their closure could threaten grid reliability. MISO used that authority most recently during the Biden administration to order Missouri utility Ameren to keep its Rush Island coal plant open. To do so, it filed a ​“reliability must run” request that was approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission — the standard practice for such emergency stay-open orders.

The DOE’s emergency powers, by contrast, have historically only been used in rare cases to protect utilities, states, or regional grid operators from being penalized for violating air-quality regulations, contractual obligations, or other such barriers to keeping the plants running during emergencies, he said. The DOE’s order provided no evidence that either MISO or Consumers Energy had made such a request for J.H. Campbell.

MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris told Canary Media in a Monday email that MISO did not request that DOE issue the emergency order. ​“MISO will coordinate with Consumers Energy to support compliance with the federal order as we prepare to maintain grid reliability throughout the summer season,” he said.

The DOE justified its emergency order by citing a December 2024 report from North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit regulatory authority that includes utilities and grid operators in the U.S. and Canada. In that report, MISO was the only grid region in North America to rank as​“high risk” for future grid reliability challenges. Like many other parts of the country, MISO is struggling to add new generation resources to the grid fast enough to keep up with demand. The vast majority of projects waiting to connect are solar, wind, and batteries, which could help replace the aging and money-losing coal plants being shut down.

Wannier emphasized that such broad findings about potential future reliability don’t justify emergency stay-open orders. ​“DOE’s citation to NERC is definitely overbroad,” he said. NERC’s risk assessment for MISO ​“does not create an ​‘emergency’ sufficient to take an action as drastic as DOE has taken here.”

The DOE also cites statements MISO issued after its April capacity auction, which secures resources to keep the grid running during times of peak power demand. MISO said at that time that summer months present the ​“highest risk and a tighter supply-demand balance.”

But Wannier pointed out that MISO’s auction in fact ​“ensured that each zone within MISO has sufficient resources to meet its resource adequacy objectives for the summer, as it does every year.”

The DOE’s order appeared to acknowledge this fact, noting that MISO also stated that it had ​“demonstrated sufficient capacity” for all its regions.

Slocum said these gaps in the DOE’s explanation for taking this drastic step are evidence that the agency is ​“looking for an emergency, and looking for a chance to deploy it.”

“There’s no methodology here. There’s no fact-based assessment,” he said. ​“Summer is now an emergency to the Trump administration.”

Who will pay for keeping an unnecessary coal plant open?

The DOE’s order also fails to make clear how Consumers Energy, MISO, and state and federal regulators should determine the cost of forcing this coal plant to keep running over the summer, and who will end up paying for it, Wannier said.

Power plants operating in MISO rely on the grid operator’s energy market prices and dispatch signals to decide whether they should start up and run or stay idle from one hour to the next. The costs of running coal plants often exceeds the payments they can realize from selling electricity into these markets.

But many utilities operating in MISO territory, including in Michigan, are already pushing billions of dollars of unnecessary costs onto their customers by running coal plants at times when other power sources would be cheaper, according to studies of data conducted over the past half decade.

The DOE’s order directed MISO to take ​“every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant to minimize cost to ratepayers.” But the order also instructs MISO to ​“effectuate the dispatch and operation of the units for the reasons specified herein.”

The problem, Wannier explained, is that it’s highly unlikely that the prices being offered to generators on MISO’s energy market will be high enough to recoup the costs of running the aging coal plant. This lack of profitability is the main reason why so many coal plants are being shut down.

That means that the safest way for Consumers Energy and MISO to attempt to meet the DOE’s order that the coal plant be up and running through the summer is to allow it to ​“self-schedule,” or run ​“no matter what and accept whatever the clearing energy prices are,” Wannier said. That, in turn, makes it very probable that the coal plant will be losing money.

“DOE is saying Consumers and MISO need to work out how much Consumers has to get paid for operating the plant, and if they can’t work it out, DOE will impose something,” he said. ​“But none of this makes clear who DOE thinks should end up holding the bag if they can’t agree. And it’s bad news for whoever has to pay because there’s no way Campbell gets enough reimbursement from MISO energy markets to financially justify its continued existence.”

Slocum highlighted that utilities and grid operators have a legal obligation to operate power plants and markets in ways that do not unjustly or arbitrarily force costs onto utility customers. That’s the issue on which Public Citizen intends to launch its first challenge to the order — not against the DOE, but in the proceeding that the order requires Consumers Energy to launch before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/5282775793_cc38f2f84d_z.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=78ede8687f4e35abc029ed2b5016e7b1,N,,2025-05-26 16:04:40.507460

""The Public Ministry of the State of Pará has sought to take the lead in measures not only for COP30 but also for the consequences of COP30.","On this Monday (26), the Vice Governor of Pará, Hana Ghassan, participated in the 1st Congress on Climate Justice and Sustainability: Preparatory Dialogues for COP 30, promoted by the Public Ministry of the State of Pará (MPPA).

The meeting aims to discuss the central themes of the United Nations Climate Conference (COP 30), focusing on the importance of the Amazon and Brazil's watersheds in the balance of the global climate and the impacts of climate change, among other themes. The Vice Governor highlighted the state administration's preparation to host the event.

“The State Government has been preparing for two years to host what will be the largest global event on the environment on the planet. We are very happy to host this great event, to participate in this first congress that talks about sustainability, and we can talk a little about the actions of the State Government, not only for COP but the actions of the State Government in the area of preservation and production in the environment, since from the beginning of our administration, this has been a priority, a pillar of our administration,” said Hana Ghassan.

During the presentation, the Vice Governor spoke about the significance of COP 30 for the State and the positive impacts for the population. In addition to the legacy of infrastructure, COP30 influences job generation, training, and professional qualification, with the Capacita COP30 program. The State's actions for COP30 have an impact before, during, and after the conference.

Open to the public, the event brought together entrepreneurs, municipal managers, and students, such as law student Lucas Viana, who saw an opportunity to gain more knowledge on the subject.

""I saw, in this event, a great opportunity for both personal and professional development, and that was one of the main reasons I registered here today. I am sure it will contribute a lot to me, as we will discuss sustainability, given that COP30 will be held here in Belém. The more we talk about it, the better the development, not only for me but for society.""

Throughout the day, the meeting will discuss, dialogue, promote reflections, and build joint paths in the face of today's environmental challenges.

The Attorney General of Justice (PGJ) of MPPA, Alexandre Tourinho, highlighted the importance of the debate with society. ""The Public Ministry of the State of Pará has sought to take the lead in measures not only for COP30 but also for the consequences of COP30. We know that COP30, as an international event, is temporary, and afterwards we will continue here and will have consequences, most of them very positive, but opportunities are only useful if they are taken advantage of. So, we need, as the Public Ministry of Pará, to seize these opportunities and use them for the benefit of the population, making Pará an increasingly humane State,"" said the prosecutor.

COP 30 Volunteers - During the event, the Vice Governor announced the publication, in the State Official Gazette (DOE), of the opening of registrations for the Simplified Selection Process (PSS) aimed at selecting volunteers (4,000 vacancies) who will act in the institutional, logistical, and operational support activities of the 30th United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP30).",https://agenciapara.com.br/midias/2025/pequenas/20250526142356-GF00023791-F00406836.webp,N,,2025-05-26 17:03:46.846140

Currently, hydrogen production from fossil sources like gas dominates German production, with green hydrogen generated through electrolysis accounting for a mere 0.5 percent in 2023.
The new government is set to continue with the country's landmark energy transition, but is unlikely to increase the level of ambition compared to the outgoing one.
""A close partnership in hydrogen policy can give decisive impetus to the European debate,"" said the statement that included signatures by BDEW, chemical industry association VCI, car industry association VDA, local utility association VKU, and lobby group Hydrogen Europe.
Yet, in spite of an impressive set of goals to broaden industry cooperation, Franco-German efforts to revive European industry are being held back by unresolved energy policy differences.","Lagging buildout of electrolysers for green hydrogen production, as well as large uncertainties over the fuel’s price in the future, regulation and available infrastructure represent a “significant investment hurdle” for hydrogen projects, said the Energy Transition Progress Monitor 2025 by consultancy EY and the energy industry association BDEW.

The volume of hydrogen made using renewable electricity is stagnating in Germany, and falling production from fossil gas puts an additional risk on the country’s plan to build up a sizeable hydrogen market. Falling conventional production is primarily due to the ailing basic industries that consume or produce hydrogen, including refineries, ammonia production, methanol production and chlorine production, the report said.

Currently, hydrogen production from fossil sources like gas dominates German production, with green hydrogen generated through electrolysis accounting for a mere 0.5 percent in 2023. Of the 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser capacity for hydrogen production planned to be in place by 2030, only 1.6 GW have been secured so far, the industry group added.

While the energy transition had made important progress in 2024 especially on renewables expansion and emissions reduction, the journey to climate neutrality remained “a mammoth task” and there was a lot of pressure on the new government to be successful, said BDEW. Key tasks were speeding up planning and permit procedures for renewables and expanding these in line with grid development, and coming up with a new power market design which incentivises flexible demand and production.

Germany is nearly on track to achieve its 2030 emission reduction targets, with rapid progress in the expansion of renewables making up for the lagging transport and heating sectors. The new government is set to continue with the country's landmark energy transition, but is unlikely to increase the level of ambition compared to the outgoing one.

In a joint press release, BDEW and more than a dozen other industry associations said that the “restart” of Franco-German relations also on energy represented an opportunity for a European hydrogen alliance. “Seventy-five years after the Schuman Declaration establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, it is now time to rethink our key industries and energy supply,” they said.

The rules for green and low-carbon hydrogen production required an overhaul, the cross-border hydrogen grid had to be built out faster, and the EU needed uniform certification standards for the origin and quality of hydrogen. ""A close partnership in hydrogen policy can give decisive impetus to the European debate,"" said the statement that included signatures by BDEW, chemical industry association VCI, car industry association VDA, local utility association VKU, and lobby group Hydrogen Europe.

The European Union’s two largest economic and industrial leaders, Germany and France, have spearheaded efforts to put the EU ahead in the global scramble for green industry leadership and decarbonisation technologies. Despite differences in how they produce energy, Berlin and Paris have closed ranks in response to competition from the US and China.

As originally written, SB 607 would revise how lead agencies determine whether a proposed project has significant environmental impacts.
SB 607 raises the threshold, requiring an EIR only if the agency determines—based on substantial evidence—that a project is more likely than not to have such effects.
“Under the previous version of SB 607, we would face even more pollution.
“CEQA is critical to ensuring sustainable development.” Even some organizations open to CEQA reform believe SB 607, in its initial form, went too far.","SACRAMENTO – SB 607, a major proposal to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), has ignited an intense debate between state leaders pushing for streamlined development and environmental justice advocates warning of deep rollbacks to community and ecological protections.

Authored by Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and backed by Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire (D-North Coast), the bill passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee and now heads to the Senate floor for further negotiations.

“California’s housing shortage and cost of living crisis have driven too many out of the communities they love, into long commutes, or out of California entirely,” Senators McGuire and Wiener said in a joint statement after the committee vote. “Permitting challenges have also made it more and more challenging to build critical public infrastructure, to expand the production of clean energy, and to advance our state’s economic development goals.”

They stressed that SB 607 would provide California “the right tools to deliver not only more housing, but more clean energy jobs, economic development, and transportation projects for hardworking Californians.” The legislation is expected to be integrated into the broader state budget package over the coming weeks.

As originally written, SB 607 would revise how lead agencies determine whether a proposed project has significant environmental impacts. Under current CEQA rules, agencies must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) if there is substantial evidence that a project may cause a significant effect on the environment. SB 607 raises the threshold, requiring an EIR only if the agency determines—based on substantial evidence—that a project is more likely than not to have such effects.

The bill also redefines key terms such as “negative declaration” and “mitigated negative declaration,” and alters what documentation must be included in the administrative record during litigation. For example, internal communications such as emails or staff notes not presented to the final decision-making body would be excluded from the record—unless the project involves a distribution center or oil and gas infrastructure.

In an effort to support infill development, the bill directs the Office of Planning and Research to map eligible urban infill sites statewide and establish alternative compliance pathways for qualifying projects. Projects that meet all but one condition for a CEQA exemption would be subject only to environmental review of the disqualifying condition, not the full range of CEQA requirements. However, distribution centers, oil and gas projects, and developments on protected lands are excluded from these streamlined provisions.

Despite amendments and reassurances from Senate leadership, the bill’s original language triggered strong opposition from a broad coalition of environmental justice organizations, conservation groups, and labor unions. They argue that the bill, as introduced, would have gutted CEQA safeguards for most public and private development—including freeways, railyards, mining operations, and large-scale industrial projects—under the guise of housing reform.

“Environmental justice communities have long been disproportionately burdened by development that prioritizes profit over community health,” said Aleja Maria Cretcher of Communities for a Better Environment in a statement. “Under the previous version of SB 607, we would face even more pollution. We know developers can reduce the harmful impacts of their projects—and CEQA is the only mechanism that ensures frontline communities have a meaningful voice when advocating for those protections.”

Raquel Mason of California Environmental Justice Alliance Action praised Senate leadership for stepping back from the original bill. “Thank you to Pro Tem McGuire and Chair Caballero for recognizing that the language of SB 607 would have created significant unintended consequences on communities and new legal uncertainties,” she said, adding that CEJA Action looks forward to continued negotiations to ensure the final bill protects public health and environmental justice.

Labor leaders also expressed concern that weakening CEQA could backfire economically. “Degradation of the environment and public health can, and has, caused construction moratoriums and other restrictions on growth that, in turn, reduce future employment opportunities for construction workers,” said Chris Hannan, President of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, AFL-CIO. “CEQA is critical to ensuring sustainable development.”

Even some organizations open to CEQA reform believe SB 607, in its initial form, went too far. “The changes to review standards that 607 would impose will cause tremendous legal confusion, more litigation, and further uncertainty for developers,” said Matthew Baker, Policy Director of the Planning and Conservation League. “As originally drafted, SB 607 would not have sped things up—it would only slow things down.”

The bill’s attempt to narrow CEQA’s scope by excluding staff notes and internal agency communications from the legal record also alarmed some legal observers. These documents, they argue, are often critical for community groups seeking to challenge flawed environmental assessments.

With federal environmental laws under ongoing attack—particularly under the Trump administration’s second term—critics also argue that weakening CEQA now sends the wrong signal. “Our state’s robust environmental laws protect all Californians,” said Frances Tinney of the Center for Biological Diversity. “This is the wrong time to roll back environmental and public health protections that we all depend upon.”

Esther Portillo of the Natural Resources Defense Council echoed that view, stating, “We are living in unprecedented times where our environment and public health are under threat. Our state leaders must ensure that California continues to economically thrive without irreparably harming environmental protections.”

In response to the sustained pushback, the bill was significantly amended in the Appropriations Committee to remove its original content and replace it with placeholder language signaling continued negotiations. Chair of the committee, Senator Anna Caballero, indicated that conversations would continue with the Governor’s office and the Assembly as part of the ongoing budget process.

While that change has softened immediate opposition, it has not resolved the underlying tensions. For supporters like Wiener and McGuire, CEQA reform remains essential to removing bureaucratic barriers to housing and climate action. For opponents, any reform must be done with precision and care, preserving the law’s role as a safeguard for health, equity, and ecological integrity.

This would be the first utility-scale solar project in Clark County.
Future of Sloopy, other potential solar projects in Clark County After the passage of Senate Bill 52, Ohio counties have the power to pass resolutions banning wind and solar projects in unincorporated areas and any of its townships.
Clark County commissioners denied interview requests from WYSO.","A new solar project could be coming to Clark County.

It’s called Sloopy Solar, and it's planned for development in Harmony Township. It’s expected to generate enough power for over 33,000 homes annually.

Its developer is Chicago-based company Invenergy. The company has several other projects across the state either in operation or planned for construction.

It hasn’t yet submitted an application to the agency that permits energy generating projects, the Ohio Power Siting Board.

That’s because prior to its application submission, the developer must hold two public information sessions in the community, which it’s planning to do within the next few months.

Door knocking, public meetings

Invenergy staff are door knocking around the township to gain input in advance of these sessions to ensure they are as generative as possible, said Ryan Van Portfliet, director of renewable development for Invenergy.

“It is just noting that this is going to be slightly different from what has been done there for generations. But then also explaining to them what the process looks like, what the project is, and probably more importantly, what the project isn't,” Van Portfliet said.

Matthew Butler, spokesman for the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which oversees the OPSB, said they’ve already spoken with Invenergy staff.

“I believe it was back in March when the company reached out to us to set up what we call a pre-application meeting,” Butler said. “And that meeting then took place in April between the company and our staff here, where we learned a bit more about the project, but again, it's still very early.”

The project area is expected to span 1,600 acres. This would be the first utility-scale solar project in Clark County.

Invenergy has met some other markers needed for development: it’s already leased land from seven area landowners, and has established an interconnection agreement with Ohio’s regional grid operator, PJM, to supply energy to the network.

Van Portfliet said they want to reduce any negative environmental impact from the project.

“We've already committed to some wildlife corridors, wildlife fencing to allow for the ability for wildlife to traverse through and around the project. And really focusing on proper establishment of vegetation that aligns with the vegetation of the area,” he said.

Harmony Township trustees skeptical

Harmony Township trustee Jay Flax said it's been a few years since the developers have come to any trustee meetings.

There are 3,500 residents in Harmony Township, and it’s a largely agricultural community.

Flax said residents have come to trustee meetings very upset at the idea of the project, leading the trustees to oppose it.

“We feel like it'll (depreciate) value on people's properties around it and also we're concerned with the possibility of heavy metal content in the soil in the future,” he said.

Studies on solar farms’ impacts on property values often show minimal or nonexistent impacts. Solar panels in operation can leach metals into surrounding soil or water, but only if they’re improperly managed during their lifespan.

In lieu of property taxes, the developer wants to get approval for incentive payments to the county. Van Portfliet says they expect it to be millions of dollars annually but doesnt have a specific estimate yet.

The project will also bring hundreds of green jobs to the community, he said.

It’s still cause for hesitation for Flax.

“I don't know enough about that yet to know what that'll generate. This is all so new to us. We've never encountered all this. And we have very little control on what's happening with this,” Flax said.

Future of Sloopy, other potential solar projects in Clark County

After the passage of Senate Bill 52, Ohio counties have the power to pass resolutions banning wind and solar projects in unincorporated areas and any of its townships.

Clark County currently doesn’t have restrictions on these projects, but Flax says townships have been requesting that the county reconsider legislation to ban them.

When Senate Bill 52 happened, Flax said six of the ten townships requested to be restricted for both large solar and wind projects.

“The commissioners (wanted to) vote on them on a case by case basis. Well, since all of this has happened, many of the townships are sending resolutions again, asking to be restricted,” he said.

Since this project is already under agreement with PJM, it would not be subject to this ban.

Clark County commissioners denied interview requests from WYSO. But they did share a fact sheet containing commonly asked questions about Sloopy Solar.

Van Potrfliet said the company plans to submit its application for the project later this year. Once the application is filed, OPSB’s decision is typically processed within a year, said Butler with PUCO.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc01ab8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2Fab%2Faa6d176d42ddb0cf7d53b9c76c82%2Finvenergy-solar.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 15:05:55.377532

According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.
Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.
According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.
The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects.","SACRAMENTO, United States, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is advancing plans to eliminate all federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants across the United States, according to internal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents reviewed by The New York Times on Saturday.

The moves mark the most significant rollback of climate change regulations in decades.

The EPA drafted a proposed regulation arguing that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel power plants ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or climate change, the report said, citing the EPA's documents sent to the White House for review on May 2.

The proposal directly contradicted established climate science and the agency's own data. According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.

Moreover, these facilities emitted approximately 1.36 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023, exceeding the total emissions of most countries worldwide.

""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, to The New York Times.

She called the proposed regulation ""an abuse of the EPA's responsibility under the law,"" adding that it ""flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harm's way.""

The EPA's justification centered on the argument that U.S. power sector emissions represented only about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005, according to the draft regulation.

Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.

However, climate scientists overwhelmingly reject this reasoning. According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.

The power plant deregulation represents the latest phase in the Donald Trump administration's comprehensive assault on climate policies. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on March 12 what he called ""the most consequential day of deregulation in American history,"" targeting more than 30 environmental measures established during the Joe Biden administration.

The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects. However, a federal judge temporarily blocked this action, noting the EPA had failed to provide adequate legal justification.

Trump's budget plan, announced on May 2, would slash EPA funding by nearly 55 percent compared to 2025 levels and eliminate 15 billion in carbon capture and renewable energy funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law.

The proposed regulation would overturn Biden-era rules that required existing coal-fired units and some new gas-burning plants to cut or capture 90 percent of their climate pollution by 2032. ■",,N,,2025-05-26 14:07:24.581962

In 2025, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers face distinct market pressures and manufacturing challenges that set them apart from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) automakers. While both types of manufacturers share common issues like global supply chain volatility and regulatory pressures, EV makers deal with unique hurdles tied to the nature of their technology and rapidly evolving market dynamics. Increasingly, EV makers are turning to AI and automation for help.

EV Market and Manufacturing Challenges

EV manufacturers must contend with a number of market and manufacturing issues, which require great efficiency and flexibility to successfully overcome.

On the market front, they face great price competition from traditional automakers that have entered the EV market, as well as pure EV startups. Additionally, there are great regulatory uncertainties, with many manufacturers finding that EV subsidies are being reduced or eliminated, impacting demand.

Additionally, consumers expect an EV to have a comparable or better price than an ICE equivalent. They also expect EVs to incorporate the latest innovations in auto safety, comfort, entertainment, and more.

On the manufacturing front, many EV platforms are still evolving, making it hard to lock in efficient, repeatable manufacturing processes. Manufacturers must also manage the integration of thermal management systems, high-voltage safety features, and more that are not found in ICE manufacturing.

Also, EV makers are increasingly moving toward the in-house development of motors, inverters, battery management systems, and software. That approach is unlike ICE production, where outsourcing is more common. It adds complexity and strains engineering teams.

The Need for AI and Automation

Given such market pressures and manufacturing challenges, EV manufacturers are turning to newer technologies. That might include making use of robotics and automation for repetitive tasks, using AI-driven quality control and process optimization, and employing digital twins to simulate and manage production in real time.

Simply put, EV manufacturers are increasingly leveraging automation and AI to optimize production operations across nearly every stage of the manufacturing lifecycle. Some of the specific actions being taken and technologies used include:

Smart Factory Automation

EV factories are adopting Industry 4.0 principles to automate and connect production lines. This includes:

Robotic assembly for precise and repetitive tasks like welding, painting, and battery pack assembly.

Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to transport materials and parts within the factory.

Digital twins to simulate and optimize production environments in real time.

AI for Predictive Maintenance

AI analyzes sensor data from machines to predict failures before they happen. This:

Reduces unplanned downtime.

Extends the lifespan of equipment.

Improves overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).

Quality Control with Computer Vision

Machine learning and computer vision systems inspect parts and assemblies for defects far more accurately than humans. They’re used for:

Surface inspection of vehicle bodies.

Verifying weld quality.

Ensuring battery cell alignment and integrity.

Process Optimization with AI Analytics

Manufacturers use AI to analyze production data and:

Identify bottlenecks.

Adjust workflows in real time.

Reduce energy consumption, which is especially important in battery manufacturing.

Battery Production Enhancements

Battery production is a key differentiator in EVs. AI helps:

Optimize chemical mixing and cell formation processes.

Monitor thermal behavior during assembly.

Detect potential safety issues early.

In addition to these areas, EV makers are using AI models to forecast demand, manage inventory levels, and optimize logistics. This is critical for EV manufacturing due to the complexity of battery and semiconductor supply chains.

They are also using AI to provide help with customization and flexibility. AI enables mass customization by dynamically adjusting production parameters based on customer specifications—supporting personalized EV features without major disruptions to workflow.

Some notable examples of putting these new technologies into practice include:

Tesla uses a highly automated “Gigafactory” model, where AI and robotics handle everything from chassis assembly to battery module construction.

Volkswagen has implemented AI-driven visual inspection systems and digital twins to boost factory efficiency.

BMW uses AI in its EV plants to improve logistics and robot training, speeding up production while maintaining quality.

A Final Word

All automakers are using emerging technologies to speed the time from concept to production, improve operational efficiencies, and better meet changing customer demands.

The orders, which were signed on May 23 with industry leaders present, mark the Trump administration’s most aggressive push yet to redefine nuclear power as central to America’s energy, technological and defense future.

“We’re also talking about the big plants — the very, very big, the biggest,” Trump said during the signing ceremony at the Oval Office. “We’re going to be doing them also, but I think our focus today is the smaller module.”

Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale (NYSE:SMR), both of which are small modular reactor (SMR) developers, soared by 23 and 19 percent, respectively. Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), the nation’s largest nuclear operator, gained 2 percent, while Canada-based uranium producer Cameco (TSX:CCO,NYSE:CCJ) rose by nearly 11 percent.

US uranium-focused firms Uranium Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC), Energy Fuels (TSX:EFR,NYSEAMERICAN:UUUU) and Centrus Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LEU) saw gains ranging from 19.6 to 24.2 percent.

The Global X Uranium ETF (ARCA:URA), which tracks uranium-related equities, jumped more than 11.6 percent.

Reviving fuel supply chains and recycling

The administration is also attempting to reboot the US nuclear fuel cycle.

The DOE has been directed to release 20 metric tons of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) into a commercial fuel bank for private sector use. This move marks a significant policy shift in that it directs the DOE to identify usable plutonium and uranium in its inventory for potential recycling into nuclear fuel — a move that bucks decades of US reluctance toward commercial reprocessing due to proliferation risks.

There are currently no commercial nuclear fuel recycling facilities in the US, and the order’s provisions could encourage the creation of a domestic market for recycled fuel. This work could become especially important as international competitors like China and Russia continue to develop similar capabilities.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important.
That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

Nelson, www.latimes.com, seema-mehta, laura-j-nelson",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-26/oil-villaraigosa-fossil-fuel-governors-race,"Villaraigosa said Democrats are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good in their approach to fighting climate change.
Villaraigosa’s vocal support for the oil industry has upset some environmental groups that saw him as a longtime ally.
Miller said Villaraigosa signed a pledge during his unsuccessful run for governor in 2018 not to accept campaign contributions from oil companies and “named executives” at fossil-fuel entities.
“This is bear-hugging the oil industry,” she said.
Other gubernatorial candidates have also accepted fossil-fuel contributions, although in smaller numbers than Villaraigosa, state and federal filings show.","As California positions itself as a leader on climate change, former Los Angeles mayor and gubernatorial candidate Antonio Villaraigosa is pivoting away from his own track record as an environmental champion to defend the state’s struggling oil industry.

Villaraigosa’s work to expand mass transit, plant trees and reduce carbon emissions made him a favorite of the environmental movement, but the former state Assembly speaker also accepted more than $1 million in campaign contributions and other financial support from oil companies and other donors tied to the industry over more than three decades in public life, according to city and state fundraising disclosures reviewed by The Times.

Since entering the race last year to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, Villaraigosa has accepted more than $176,000 from donors with ties to the oil industry, including from a company that operates oil fields in the San Joaquin Valley and in Los Angeles County, the disclosures show.

The clash between Villaraigosa’s environmentalist credentials and oil-industry ties surfaced in the governor’s race after Valero announced in late April that its Bay Area refinery would close next year, not long after Phillips 66 said its Wilmington refinery would close in 2025.

Villaraigosa is now warning that California drivers could see gas prices soar, blasting as “absurd” policies that he said could have led to the refinery closures.

“I’m not fighting for refineries,” Villaraigosa said in an interview. “I’m fighting for the people who pay for gas in this state.”

The refineries are a sore spot for Newsom and for California Democrats, pitting their environmental goals against concerns about the rising cost of living and two of the state’s most powerful interest groups — organized labor and environmentalists — against each other.

Villaraigosa said Democrats are letting the perfect be the enemy of the good in their approach to fighting climate change.

He said he hoped no more refineries would close until the state hits more electrification milestones, including building more transmission lines, green-energy storage systems and charging stations for electric cars. The only way for the state to reach “net zero” emissions, he said, is an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, nuclear power and oil and gas.

“The notion that we’re not going to do that is poppycock,” Villaraigosa said.

Villaraigosa’s vocal support for the oil industry has upset some environmental groups that saw him as a longtime ally.

“I’m honestly shocked at just how bad it is,” said RL Miller, the president of Climate Hawks Vote and the chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, of the contributions Villaraigosa has accepted since entering the race in July.

Miller said Villaraigosa signed a pledge during his unsuccessful run for governor in 2018 not to accept campaign contributions from oil companies and “named executives” at fossil-fuel entities. She said he took the pledge shortly after accepting the maximum allowable contributions from several oil donors in 2017.

Miller said that more than $100,000 in donations that Villaraigosa has accepted in this gubernatorial cycle were clear violations of the pledge.

That included contributions from the state’s largest oil and gas producer, California Resources Corp. and its subsidiaries, as well as the founder of Rocky Mountain Resources, a leader of the oil company Berry Corp., and Excalibur Well Services.

“This is bear-hugging the oil industry,” she said.

Environmental activists view the pledge as binding for future campaigns. Villaraigosa said he has not signed it for this campaign.

The economy is dramatically different than it was in 2018, Villaraigosa said, and working-class Americans are being hammered, which he said was a major factor in recent Democratic losses.

“We’re losing working people, particularly working people who don’t have a college education,” he said. “Why are we losing them? The cost of living, the cost of gas, the cost of utilities, the cost of groceries.”

Thad Kousser, a political science professor at UC San Diego, said such statements are consistent with Villaraigosa’s messaging in recent years.

“Villaraigosa is squarely in the moderate lane in the governor’s race. That doomed him in 2018, when voters wanted to counterbalance President Trump and Villaraigosa was outflanked by Newsom,” Kousser said. “But today, even some Democrats may want to counterbalance the direction that they see Sacramento taking, especially when it comes to cost-of-living issues and the price of gas.”

He added that the fossil-fuel donations may not be the basis for Villaraigosa’s apparent embrace of oil and gas priorities.

“When a politician takes campaign contributions from an industry and also takes positions that favor it, that raises the possibility of corruption, of money influencing votes,” Kousser said. “But it is also possible that it was the politician’s own approach to an issue that attracted the contributions, that their votes attracted money but were not in any way corrupted by it. That may be the case here, where Villaraigosa has held fairly consistent positions on this issue and consistently attracted support from an industry because of those positions.”

Other Democrats in the 2026 governor’s race, including Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former state Controller Betty Yee and Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, have signed the pledge not to accept contributions from oil industry interests, Miller said.

Former California Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins, former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and businessman Stephen Cloobeck have not. (Cloobeck has never run for office before and has not been asked to sign.)

Other gubernatorial candidates have also accepted fossil-fuel contributions, although in smaller numbers than Villaraigosa, state and federal filings show.

Becerra accepted contributions from Chevron and California Resources Corp., formerly Occidental Petroleum, while running for attorney general. Atkins took donations from Chevron, Occidental and a trade group for oil companies while running for state Assembly and state Senate. And while running for lieutenant governor, Kounalakis took contributions from executives at oil and mining companies.

Campaign representatives for the two main Republican candidates in the race, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and conservative commentator Steve Hilton, said they welcomed oil-industry donations.

Villaraigosa is a fierce defender of his environmental record dating back to his first years as an elected official in the California Assembly.

As mayor of Los Angeles from 2005 to 2013, Villaraigosa set new goals to reduce emissions at the Port of Los Angeles, end the use of coal-burning power plants and shift the city’s energy generation toward solar, wind and geothermal sources.

The child of a woman who relied on Metro buses, he also branded himself the “transportation mayor.” Villaraigosa was a vocal champion for the 2008 sales tax increase that provided the first funding for the extension of the Wilshire Boulevard subway to the Westside.

But, he said, Democrats in 2025 have to be realistic that the refinery closures and their goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions could disproportionately affect low-income residents who are already struggling to make ends meet.

Villaraigosa’s comments underscore a broader divide among Democrats about how to fight climate change without making California even more expensive, or driving out more high-paying jobs that don’t require a college education.

Lorena Gonzalez, a former state lawmaker who became the leader of the California Labor Federation in 2022, said that while climate change is a real threat, so is shutting down refineries.

“That’s a threat to those workers’ jobs and lives, and it’s also a threat to the price of gas,” Gonzalez said.

California is not currently positioned to end its reliance on fossil fuels, she said. If the state reduces its refining capacity, she said, it will have to rely on exports from nations that have less environmental and labor safeguards.

“Anyone running for governor has to acknowledge that,” Gonzalez said.

Villaraigosa said that while the loss of union jobs at Valero’s Bay Area refinery worried him, his primary concern was over the cost of gasoline and household budgets.

His comments come as California prepares to square off yet again against the Trump administration over its environmental policies.

The U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to revoke a federal waiver that allowed California to set its own vehicle emission standards, including a rule that would have ultimately banned the sale of new gas-fueled cars in 2035. Villaraigosa denounced the vote, but said that efforts to fight climate change can’t come at the expense of working-class Americans.

President Trump has also declared a national energy emergency, calling for increased fossil-fuel production, eliminating environmental reviews and the fast-tracking of projects in potentially sensitive ecosystems and habitats. The Trump administration is also targeting California’s environmental standards.

Villaraigosa, an Eastside native, started his career as a labor organizer and rose to speaker of the state Assembly before becoming the mayor of Los Angeles. Now 72, Villaraigosa has not held elected office for more than a decade; he finished a distant third in the 2018 gubernatorial primary.

Over the years, donors affiliated with the fossil-fuel industry have contributed more than $1 million to Villaraigosa’s political campaigns and his nonprofit causes, including an after-school program, the city’s sports and entertainment commission and an effort to reduce violence by providing programming at city parks during summer nights, according to city and state disclosures.

More than half of the contributions and support for Villaraigosa’s pet causes, over $582,000, came during his years at Los Angeles City Hall as a council member and mayor.

In 2008, billionaire oil and gas magnate T. Boone Pickens donated $150,000 to a city proposition backed by Villaraigosa that levied a new tax on phone and internet use.

Pickens made the donation as his company was vying for business at the port of Los Angeles, which is overseen by mayoral appointees and was seeking to reduce emissions by replacing diesel-powered trucks with vehicles fueled by liquid natural gas.

The rest of the contributions and other financial support flowed to Villaraigosa’s campaign accounts and affiliated committees while he served in the Assembly and during his two gubernatorial runs. These figures do not include donations to independent expenditure committees, since candidates cannot legally be involved in those efforts.

Villaraigosa said that while such voters don’t subscribe to Republicans’ “drill, baby, drill” ethos, he slammed the Democratic Party’s focus on such matters and Trump instead of kitchen-table issues.

“The cost of everything we’re doing is on the backs of the people who work the hardest and who make the least, and that’s why so many of them — even when we were saying Trump is a threat to democracy — they were saying, yeah, but what about my gas prices, grocery prices, the cost of eggs?” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df30575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb0%2F11%2Fcc2697194f6f8c51a88455df31d9%2Fcalifornia-governor-villaraigosa-00029.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 13:14:51.037006

The proposed rule, which the agency said would be published once it has completed interagency review, would undo decades of progress on limiting US climate pollution and could drive up energy prices if expensive coal plants remain on the grid longer as a result.

At a minimum, it is a sharp reversal from the Biden administration’s policies to lower pollution from power plants and make the air around them healthier to breathe. The Biden EPA finalized new rules last year that would have compelled coal and new natural gas power plants to either cut or capture 90% of their climate pollution by 2032.

In a statement, an EPA spokesperson referenced a 2022 Supreme Court decision striking down the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and said there were “concerns” that the Biden administration’s “replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States.”

“As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule,” the spokesperson added. “The proposal will be published once it has completed interagency review and been signed by the (EPA) Administrator.”

The documents the New York Times acquired argue the US share of global power plant pollution has fallen, and that even if US power plants cut all of their emissions and pollution, it would not “meaningfully” improve public health in the US — a claim likely to be fiercely challenged by public health researchers and organizations.

Power plants are the second-biggest emitters of planet-warming pollution in the US, making up around a quarter of the country’s climate pollution. US power plants contribute 3% of total global climate pollution.

The proposed rule follows a March announcement from the EPA that it would overturn more than a dozen Biden-era air pollution and climate rules. Trump’s EPA announced in March it was preparing to reconsider and strike down a consequential scientific finding on the dangers of climate pollution that has served as the basis behind federal regulations to curb them. Dismissing the precedent would strip the EPA’s authority to manage the pollution that causes global warming.

Policy shift under Trump: The move aligns with broader efforts to dismantle green-energy subsidies and climate protections instituted under the Biden administration.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is preparing a sweeping regulatory rollback that would eliminate all federal greenhouse gas (GHG) limits on coal and gas-fired power plants, according to a draft proposal first reported by The New York Times. The document is currently under interagency review and expected to be published in the coming weeks.

In its draft, the EPA argues that emissions from these plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change because they represent a “small and declining share” of global emissions. The agency further asserts that eliminating such emissions would have “no meaningful effect on public health and welfare.”

These claims sharply diverge from global scientific consensus. The United Nations has stated unequivocally that fossil fuels account for more than 75% of global GHG emissions and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions, making them the primary driver of climate change.

An EPA spokesperson confirmed the draft rule in a statement:

“Many have voiced concerns that the last administration’s replacement for that rule is similarly overreaching and an attempt to shut down affordable and reliable electricity generation in the United States, raising prices for American families, and increasing the country’s reliance on foreign forms of energy.

This regulatory retreat aligns with a broader policy agenda under President Donald Trump. His administration has moved to unwind nearly all federal climate action efforts, including key components of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Bush presided over a golden age of environmental enforcement.
The answer is that what really matters is whether firms comply with regulations, and EPA enforcement actions are only one reason for compliance.
EPA may have become much more efficient in focusing its enforcement efforts on the most significant violations, getting more bang for the enforcement buck.
That includes all environmental regulations — especially air pollution regulations, given Trump’s desire to maximize production and use of fossil fuels.
We may have the opportunity to see how polluters respond to near-zero levels of federal enforcement.","Enforcement efforts peaked long ago and have been in long-term decline. Trump will accelerate that.

According to a recent report by the Environmental Integrity Project, “During the first Trump Administration, EPA inspections, penalties, and the enforcement of environmental laws fell significantly, worsening a long-term decline in enforcement activity that began approximately twenty years ago. The numbers bear out this conclusion but raise three questions: What’s behind the long-term trend? Why has pollution generally continued to decline despite weaker enforcement? And how bad will things be under Trump II?

The Long-Term Decline in Federal Enforcement

In retrospect, George W. Bush presided over a golden age of environmental enforcement. Before the financial crisis, there were about 3200 staff in EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance. Under Trump I, the number declined to 2400, but it rebounded only modestly under Biden, to about 2700. Declining staff levels efforts were reflected in

EPA sent markedly fewer cases to DOJ for civil actions in court. That number peaked at 327 in the first year of the Obama Administration declined precipitously during most of his Administration and was down to 81 when he left office. There was a bit of a bump under Biden, but by the time he left office, the number was down to an all-time low of 60.

The story for criminal enforcement is similar. There were 372 criminal enforcement actions in 2005. The number declined to 176 when Bush left office, bounced around under Obama but ended up at 183, hit a low of 108 under Trump I, and recovered only slightly under Biden. When Biden left office, there were 121 criminal actions, about a third of the peak under Bush.

EPA’s inspection actions have also gone down, but the pattern has been a little different. In 2013, there were 11,000 inspections under Obama, which fell to around 9500 in his final year. Prior to the pandemic, inspections were at about 8200 under Trump 1. The two worst pandemic years saw much lower inspection rates, but the number slowly recovered under Biden to 8500 in 2024. But that was till a lot lower than the level a decade earlier.

Why Has Air Pollution Declined Anyway Despite Low Enforcment Rates?

Some reasons for the decline in pollution could have been due to unrelated factors like the movement of manufacturing to China and the rise of fracking, which led to closures of many coal generation plants. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence is that federal air pollution laws have been a significant factor. But how can pollution laws have driven air pollution declines even though enforcement has gone down? The answer is that what really matters is whether firms comply with regulations, and EPA enforcement actions are only one reason for compliance.

To begin with, the numbers may exaggerate the significance of the enforcement decline. EPA may have become much more efficient in focusing its enforcement efforts on the most significant violations, getting more bang for the enforcement buck. The disconnect between trends in inspections and enforcement suggest that many inspections may result in informal resolutions that correct violations but are not included in the numbers. In addition, under Obama, there was an effort toward “Next Gen” compliance, based on the idea that regulations should be written in ways that will drive compliance, and this effort may well have born some fruit.

Moreover, EPA is not the only enforcer of federal pollution regulations. State governments also have enforcement authority. States vary in how much they care about the environment. Some, like Texas, may be fairly law, but others take pollution seriously and vigorously enforce regulations. Particularly under Democratic administrations EPA may be successful in pressuring laggard states to increase their efforts. In addition, federal law authorizes citizen suits to enforce pollution requirements, and organizations like Sierra Club have been active in this litigation.

Finally, the threat of enforcement is not the only reason that firms comply with regulations. Firms are required to report their emissions, which are publicly available, and it is not hard for environmental groups and ordinary citizens to determine whether a firm is complying. That information is of interest to the firm’s employees (who are themselves exposed to the pollution), local communities, and media. Consistent violations may draw the attention of consumers, investors, and lenders.

And What About Trump II?

Trump has been much more aggressive pursuing his goals in his second term, and we can expect that to hold true in terms of environmental enforcement. Trump plans huge cuts at EPA, touting efforts to cut EPA’s budget by 60%. I doubt that he will succeed in such draconian cuts, but he’s like to get some significant cuts, which could fall especially heavily on enforcement staff. He has already taken steps to hobble the Justice Department division that enforces environmental regulation.

One of Trump’s executive orders tells agencies not to enforce regulations running contrary to his policy goals. That includes all environmental regulations — especially air pollution regulations, given Trump’s desire to maximize production and use of fossil fuels. Indications so far are that enforcement is lower than ever under this Administration.

In short, don’t be surprised to see record low enforcement levels decline further under Trump. We may have the opportunity to see how polluters respond to near-zero levels of federal enforcement. The larger puzzle is the long-term decline in federal enforcement",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Environmental_Protection_Agency_building_15011151177-e1573849622267.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:57.907271

The court sentenced two of the former executives to prison for several years, while the remaining two received suspended sentences. The ruling concludes a major trial that spanned nearly four years.

The scandal known as Dieselgate first came to light in September 2015, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered that many diesel vehicles produced by German carmaker Volkswagen were equipped with illegal so-called defeat devices.

These devices detected when a car was undergoing emissions testing and altered performance to meet environmental standards — while in real-world driving conditions, the cars emitted pollutants far above legal limits.

In 2017, Volkswagen admitted to manipulating emissions data in the United States, sparking global backlash and triggering one of the biggest corporate scandals in automotive history. The fallout plunged the Wolfsburg-based carmaker into a deep crisis.

In 2019, German prosecutors charged then-CEO Herbert Diess, Chair Hans Dieter Pötsch and former CEO Martin Winterkorn — who resigned shortly after the scandal broke in 2015 — with market manipulation related to the emissions deception.

In 2020, a German court ended legal proceedings against Diess and Pötsch as VW coughed up a €9 million fine over the scandal.

Winterkorn was originally set to be part of this trial, but was removed for health reasons before it kicked off in September 2021. In his capacity as a witness and defendant, Winterkorn has continued to deny responsibility for the scandal.

Since the scandal erupted, Volkswagen has faced a barrage of lawsuits and legal proceedings.

The first form of an EV was a “crude electric carriage” developed almost 200 years ago in 1832, by a Scotsman - Robert Anderson.
Recently, BYD revealed its Super E-platform charging facility that can charge an EV battery in five minutes to achieve a 470-km range.
CATL alone holds about 38%, of the global EV battery market share, while BYD holds another 17%.
The late entrant Maruti Suzuki unveiled e-Vitara and Hyundai released Creta Electric, its e-version of the popular SUV Creta.","They are not just in the zeitgeist, but, increasingly, in our everyday lives too, as we find them whizzing past on the roads with green registration plates, making the familiar low-pitched humming sound. These are electric vehicles – cars, bikes, scooters, hauling three-wheelers, and even garbage collection carts.

But you might be surprised to know that this is not the first time electric vehicles (EVs) have gained in popularity. They were quite the rage more than 100 years ago in the early 1900s, with EVs constituting over a third of all vehicles sold in the United States. A timeline by the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) dates back the prototypes of the EVs to developments in the 1820s with the invention of the electric motor by the Hungarian engineer Ányos István Jedlik and other technological breakthroughs in the U.S., Netherlands, and Hungary. The first form of an EV was a “crude electric carriage” developed almost 200 years ago in 1832, by a Scotsman - Robert Anderson.

However renewed interest in EVs had to wait until the widespread adoption of electricity across cities in the U.S. and Western Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. EVs began sprouting across the Atlantic during this time. While William Morrison, an American chemist created what was a “little more than an electric wagon” in the 1890s, Ferdinand Porsche, who went on to form the iconic German sports car company by the same name, developed an electric car called the Egger-Lohner C.2 Phaeton in 1898. “The vehicle was powered by an octagonal electric motor, and with three to five PS it reached a top speed of 25 km/h,” states an article on the company’s website. Incidentally, Porche also designed the world’s first petrol-electric hybrid in 1900. The production-ready version of the vehicle was called the Mixte.

There are similarities in the reasons for the rise of EVs between now and then — the initial internal combustion engines (ICE) were noisy and polluting. They were difficult to drive, requiring the operation of a manual crank to power them on. Changing gears was not as smooth as they are today. This is why the early EVs became especially popular with women. A January 20, 1911, a New York Times article states, “Ever since the small electric runabouts were introduced, about ten years ago, they have always been popular with women. In the early days of motoring, the little electrics were about the only kind of motor car a woman could handle easily, as the early gasoline cars required more strength to crank than most women possess.” The Times went on to say that “the designers of the electric passenger carrying vehicles have made great advances in the past few years, and these machines have retained all their early popularity and are steadily growing in favour with both men and women.”

But three years before this article was published, Henry Ford had introduced the mass-produced Model T. By 1912, the petrol Model T car cost $650, while an electric sold for almost three times the price at $1,750. This and the electric starter, which did away with the hand crank, and the discovery of crude oil in Texas in the 1920s, leading to petrol refill stations coming up across rural Europe and America, pretty much put paid to the early EVs by 1935.

Cleaner choice

Some similarities between the rise of early EVs and those on the roads now remain. EVs continue to be easier to drive, and they do not pollute, while even the cleanest of ICE vehicles emit particulate matter. Moreover, the correlation between vehicle emissions that contribute to the formation of greenhouse gases, which in turn leads to global warming, drove technological advancements in EVs., mainly to address what limited their uptake in the early days – the inability to attain higher speeds and the modest range of the battery motor, allowing only for short trips within urban settings.

According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), the transport sector accounted for almost a quarter (23%) of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, making this sector the third biggest contributor to climate change after energy and industries. Of this, 75% of emissions were from road transport, and passenger cars alone accounted for almost half, that is 45% of total transport emissions in 2023. While aviation emissions were the next big chunk, they were way behind road transport at 11%, shipping was at another 10% and rail constituted the lowest at just 4%.

“Transport emissions grew at an annual average rate of 1.7% from 1990 to 2022, faster than any other end-use sector except for industry (which also grew at around 1.7%). To get on track with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 scenario, CO2 emissions from the transport sector must fall by more than 3% per year to 2030,” wagered the IEA in its Tracking Transport 2024 report. The IEA also highlighted the soaring uptake of ICE SUVs as an impediment to achieving the NZE goal, accounting for 46% of global sales and almost a third (31.4%) of total car emissions in 2022, compared with just 8.5% in 2010.

Aside from the now well-documented detrimental health-related consequences from vehicular pollution, many other reasons have propelled the resurgence in the popularity of EVs. Governments have introduced policies in the past decade that have supported the growth of the EV sector. In India, the government introduced the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, or FAME, in April 2015, with an outlay of ₹895 crore for five years. This allocation was increased more than ten times to ₹10,000 crore in the policy’s second iteration, FAME 2, between 2019 and 2024. While the policy intended to provide capital support to encourage the creation of a manufacturing ecosystem for EVs, a substantial subsidy to the buyer of an EV ended up being widely popular, leading to greater EV uptake, with calls for a third iteration of the scheme.

Technological disruption

It was a similar EV adoption scheme that led to Tesla receiving a $460 million loan from the U.S. DoE in 2010, that helped the then EV start-up build its manufacturing facility in California. And it was Telsa’s 2006 unveiling of a luxury electric sports car – the Roadster, with a range between 320 km and 390 km on a single battery charge that led to a resurgence in EVs’ popularity. The Roadster addressed what had come to be called “range anxiety” in common parlance. That is, the anxiety that one faces when they fear becoming immobile as the battery drains out without the facility to recharge on the go. The Roadster also had better pick-up than any of its ICE rivals with a range of 0-95 km in under four seconds.

The COVID-19-induced crippling of supply chains was another factor that helped propel EVs’ popularity, with all forms of transport coming to a grinding halt and global oil giants forced to stop pumping out crude. Countries like India, which imports more than 80% of its oil requirements took advantage of the rock-bottom crude prices - $20 a barrel in April 2020 - and stocked up its Strategic Petroleum Reserves and expanded domestic storage capacities. But the realisation that this disruption was a potential threat to energy security was not lost on any nation and led to a spurt in EV technology-related innovations globally.

The past 10 years have seen advancements in battery technology at break-neck speed. These advancements have significantly addressed most of the limitations to EV adoption, such as the distance one could travel on a single battery charge known as energy density; the life cycle of a battery; its charging speed, thermal stability, and most importantly, cost. The technology that has emerged as the mainstay now is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP), as it is cheaper, safer and more thermally stable than the others in the market.

While Telsa had a head start with the use of Japanese electronics giant Panasonic-manufactured lithium-ion cells for the Roadster in 2006, the company has largely switched to LFP batteries in the past five years, made by the Chinese behemoth CATL. Lithium-ion batteries power our everyday gadgets such as phones, laptops and earphones. They are mass-produced, cost-effective, compact and durable, and largely offer thermal stability, meaning the heat radiated while charging or being used can be controlled. But LFP’s energy density, and propulsion speed, which are valuable features in an EV, have far outstripped Lithium-ion’s use case.

Other battery technologies include a combination of Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NCM), or Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminium (NCA) that have double the energy density of LFPs. However, they have a shorter lifecycle and are more prone to overheating than LFPs. While NCMs can charge faster, they are also twice as expensive as LFPs as the resources required to make them are not as abundant. But NCM/NCA batteries are being mass-produced by group companies of the South Korean electronics giants Samsung and LG.

Aside from these battery technologies that are widely in use, there is ongoing research on what are called solid-state batteries that hold great promise on several parameters and could potentially upend the EV market, but it is still at the pilot stage. Panasonic and Japanese automobile giant Toyota are leading the research on these.

Chinese dominance

The two leading companies that make proprietary LFP batteries worldwide are both Chinese. Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd (CATL), and BYD – the EV behemoth that outnumbered Tesla in global sales in the past year. Both these firms have emerged not just as battery powerhouses, but energy technology giants, leading research and innovation in material, grid-scale energy storage systems, battery swapping, recycling and second-life applications, and have heavily invested in lithium mining and refining.

Recently, BYD revealed its Super E-platform charging facility that can charge an EV battery in five minutes to achieve a 470-km range. This pits EVs in direct competition with gasoline vehicles and could aid in widening BYD’s market share lead against Tesla. Auto trend trackers report Tesla sold 1.78 million units worldwide giving it a 10.3% market share in 2024, while BYD had more than double that at 22.2%, with 3.84 million units sold in the same period.

These innovations have led China to become an EV battery manufacturing powerhouse. In a research paper published in early March, the IEA states that “over 70% of all EV batteries ever manufactured were produced in China, creating extensive manufacturing know-how.” China has not only captured the overwhelming chunk of the EV battery market share, but its vertically integrated manufacturing ecosystem means that it also controls 70-90% of the value chain of EV batteries, which include mining and refining.

The high levels of investments in refining and mining in the past five years have led to an overcapacity of critical minerals. The global supply of cobalt, nickel and lithium exceeded demand by 6.5%, 8% and 10% respectively in 2023. This also led to a steep decline in battery prices. In 2024, the EV’s most expensive component, the battery, roughly cost $100/kWh compared with $1200/kWh in 2010. This has begun making EVs cheaper than ICE vehicles across China, and this cost arbitrage is being passed on globally, as EV makers worldwide adapt Chinese-made LFP batteries. CATL alone holds about 38%, of the global EV battery market share, while BYD holds another 17%.

It would be no exaggeration to state that China has been singularly responsible for ushering in an EV revolution in the automobile industry in the past five years, leading to global penetration of electric cars rising from 4% in 2020 to 18% in 2023, with sales crossing about 17 million in 2024 - a 25% rise from 14 million sold in the previous year. Of the 17 million, China alone accounted for the sale of 10.1 million electric cars, followed by Europe with 3.4 million, the U.S. with 1.7 million, and the rest of the world accounting for the remainder.

While Norway leads EV deployment with electric car sales reaching 93% in 2023, the China Passenger Car Association noted that EVs and hybrids crossed 50% of all vehicle sales for the first time in July 2024. Electric cars in India, on the other hand, accounted for only 2% of total sales, despite hatchback and sedan versions of EVs offered by Tata Motors and MG being priced competitively compared with ICE variations. This is largely influenced by range anxiety and the consumer’s desire to see charging infrastructure expansion on the ground.

India’s position

However, electric two-and-three-wheelers (e2w and e3w) have witnessed significant growth in India, with 1.2 million e2w sold in 2024, accounting for 60% total EV sales and representing a 30% year-on-year (YoY) growth from 2023. E3Ws which largely encompass commercial vehicles have witnessed even more impressive growth with the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers reporting an 18% YoY from 2023, to reach a market share that has crossed the half-way mark at 54.3% in 2024.

India’s EV policy emphasises the electrification of public transport and mobility, as passenger car sales do not yet constitute the per capita volumes witnessed in industrialised countries including China.

At the Bharat Mobility Global Expo held in Delhi in January this year, almost a third of more than 90 models unveiled were EVs, ranging from luxury e-SUVs to e-trucks, and even electric ambulances. Not surprisingly, e-SUVs were showstoppers, led by Chinese brands BYD’s Sealion 7 and its rival MG Motor’s Cyberster.

There was a frenzy of legacy automakers wanting to rush in with their EV offerings. The late entrant Maruti Suzuki unveiled e-Vitara and Hyundai released Creta Electric, its e-version of the popular SUV Creta. Speaking to reporters, MSIL’s MD and CEO Hisachi Takeuchi emphasised, the ‘newness’ of the e-Vitara. He said, “This is not just changing the ICE with a battery and a motor, from the ground up, this (e-Vitara) is all new.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who inaugurated the Bharat Expo, wagered EV numbers in India would increase eight-fold by 2030. He emphasised the government’s intent to procure about 14,000 e-buses by the end of fiscal 2026 through an EV support scheme called PM E-DRIVE. The scheme is the third iteration of FAME, but with an expanded scope to support the entire gamut of transport electrification – ranging from e-rickshaws to e-trucks; and enhancing charging infrastructure.

At least five Indian States have made budgetary allocations to add e-buses to their transport fleets. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation has inducted 1,027 buses with plans to scale e-buses in Bengaluru alone to 9,000 by the end of the next fiscal. Telangana’s State Road Transport Corporation operates 254 e-buses in Hyderabad with plans to double it by mid this year.

Based on current policies and trends, the IEA estimates that the EV revolution will offset about 6 million barrels of oil a day by 2030, which is just a fraction of the 103 million barrels produced per day as of March 2025, but enough to signal the beginning of the end of the oil era.

Changing landscape

Make no mistake, this is not just a technological shift toward decarbonising transport, but a social, cultural, economic, environmental and geopolitical transformation of the global transport landscape as we know it. It is arguably akin to the transformation that was witnessed across industrialised nations after the Second World War, only this time, it appears, this revolution would be led by Asian countries.

The signs are already visible. On March 12, Europe’s largest battery maker, the Sweden-based Northvolt filed for bankruptcy, as it struggled to compete against cheaper batteries from China. Batteries in China were cheaper than those produced in Europe and North America by over 30% and 20% respectively. This marks a setback for Europe to develop its own battery technology. More crucially, this means, Europe and the U.S. would likely not lead in global standard setting on EV battery technology. With European companies failing, and the EU’s general wariness towards China, Korean and Japanese makers, who have traditionally been the largest manufacturers of NCM batteries in Europe, are investing in making LFP batteries as well to compete against their Chinese counterparts. The IEA states that Korean firms lead overseas manufacturing capacity with nearly 400 GWh of the 3 terawatt-hour (TWh) global capacity in 2024, followed by a distant Japan at 60 GWh and China with another 30 GWh. Korean and Japanese firms also lead research and innovation on solid-state batteries.

Europe’s celebrated automobile industry is on the edge of a precipice, as demand for its cars in its largest market, China, has fallen precipitously. The overall market share of foreign auto brands in China fell to a record low of 37% just in the first eight months of 2024 from 64% in 2020, signalling a drastic shift in customer preferences. Global sales of German brands of the BMW and Volkswagen Groups, long viewed, not only as technological marvels but as a status symbol, fell by 13.4% and 11% respectively in 2024. Mercedes-Benz saw a 7% decline, while the luxury car Bentley lost 37% in its operating profit mainly on account of declining demand in China.

A direct correlation could be made with the rise of local brands from BYD, Geely and State-owned SAIC, and a shift to EVs as they become cheaper than ICE vehicles in China. Nearly 60% of all vehicular registrations in China were EVs in 2023. But this decline is not only in China. European ICE carmakers lost ground to Chinese EVs even in their home markets. Europe accounted for 25% of electric car sales in 2023. This led to the EU slapping import tariffs in early October last year. The tariffs could go up to 35.3% over and above a flat 10% customs duty for China-made EVs entering the 27-member nation block. The EU termed these duties as “anti-subsidy” tariffs, claiming China’s state support for its EV sector has defied the competitive logic of the industry globally.

The response from China speaks volumes about who today leads the global auto technology race. China initiated a similar anti-subsidy investigation into imports of European brandy, dairy and pork products, President Xi Jinping declined an invitation to attend a summit in Brussels to mark the 50th anniversary of EU-China relations and has formally complained to the World Trade Organisation, alleging the EU’s tariffs violate the global trade body’s rules and constitute protectionism. It does feel a bit like deja vu, doesn’t it? Well, that is because in the 1980s and 90s, industrialised nations railed against what they alleged were protectionist measures across poorer countries, which they claimed, denied those citizens access to superior technology from the developed world. It was a cloak to expand beyond their saturated home markets. The most apparent change on the ground following the lifting of import barriers and local manufacturing rules was the flood of American and European consumer durables and automobiles that upended domestic companies across the developing world.

Taking the hit

There have been planned plant closures across Europe’s auto sector, something that was unthinkable even about a decade ago. Stellantis, the amalgamated Dutch-headquartered company that owns iconic brands like Vauxhall, Opel and Peugeot, has planned closures that will cut jobs in Italy and France amid a 70% decline in profits in 2024.

Volkswagen had three weeks of labour unrest across nine plants in Germany in December last year, following proposed wage cuts and factory closure threats – the first in the firm’s 87-year history. It was resolved on December 20, 2024, with workers agreeing to modifications in staff bonuses, capacity reductions at five factories by 7,34,000 units annually and a planned 35,000 decrease in jobs by 2030 through retirements and voluntary redundancies.

One of the major economic disruptions that is expected with the rise of EVs is the significant reduction in jobs across the automotive sector, as the EV powertrain requires only 20 moving parts compared with 2,000 for ICE vehicles. A World Resources Institute, India, report estimates that this would mean a reduction in the share of the component suppliers in the value chain ranging between 15-20%. While the auto cluster suppliers, The Hindu spoke to, view this with some trepidation, they also wager that in the long term, the hit may not be as bad, as the transition, at least in India, would mean a growth of both the EV and ICE sectors as per capita vehicle ownership will continue to rise for some time to come.

The Europeans, however, have made a more sobering assessment. A study by the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) forecasts that the shift to EVs could result in a net loss of approximately 2,75,000 jobs by 2040 within the EU automotive sector. This projection accounts for the elimination of roles related to ICE powertrains, partially offset by new positions in EV manufacturing. While the U.S.-based United Auto Workers union has expressed concern about job losses due to the rapid adoption of EVs.

A few more characteristics of the EV powertrain are the high degree of vertical integration, automation and digitisation by automakers. This has also led to a skill gap between those that are required on the EV powertrain, and its ICE counterpart. These roles include coders, EV software managers and cloud engineers – positions that typically require higher education degrees, which have fewer requirements on ICE powertrains.

Environmental impact

Several other shifts have been understudied, as EV advocates have placed greater emphasis on the transition to electrification to meet global climate goals while side-stepping its environmental and social impact. While EVs aid reduction of carbon emissions during operation, the mineral extraction process for their batteries has shown to be severely detrimental. Chile’s Atacama Desert – the vast water-scarce and sparsely populated fragile ecosystem, is being mined for lithium through the evaporation of brines found beneath the salt flats. Chile is the second largest producer of lithium, the key component of the LFP batteries. “Miners pump salty lithium-containing water, called brine, into massive ponds, where it can take years for the evaporation process to separate the lithium. The technique drains already scarce water resources, damages wetlands, and harms communities,” reports the Natural Resources Defence Council. This has led communities that live in the Atacama to lose their access to potable water and instead rely on tankers to deliver it.

While in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 50% of the world’s cobalt reserves are found, child labour is rampant. The U.S. Department of Labour (DoL) reports, “Children routinely work in these mines, often under hazardous conditions. While mining is on the DRC’s list of hazardous activities for which children’s work is forbidden, the majority of cobalt mining in the DRC is done informally, where monitoring and enforcement are poor.” The DoL goes on to state that 5,346 children were registered in a Child Labour Monitoring and Remediation System database that has now been handed over to the DRC’s Ministry of Mines. Aside from rampant child labour, cobalt mining has also polluted local water resources, affecting the communities that depend on them.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Netherlands has reported that Indonesia’s nickel boom, where the world’s largest reserve of the metal is found, has led to deforestation, pollution, and loss of livelihoods for local communities, particularly in the islands of Sulawesi and the Moluccas.

In the end, we can safely say that no transition to a new technology has been without its detrimental impacts. But as we increasingly realise the finite nature of the world’s resources to support humanity, some transitions could be done so, with greater deliberations on ensuring the least all round damage, especially when it is being done on the premise of saving life on Earth from the disastrous impact of climate change. It is also safe to say, that this time, the electrification of transport is here to stay.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/et7ini/article69622283.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-05-08T095654Z_1862157918_RC22RAA2RXMH_RTRMADP_3_AUTOS-BYD-GLOBAL-SALES.JPG,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:21.866749

Could That Happen Again? - The New York Times,"Ivan Penn, www.nytimes.com, ivan-penn",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/business/electric-vehicles-history.html,"More than a century before Tesla rolled out its first cars, the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster rumbled down American streets.
In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics.
“Electric cars are good if you have a towing company,” President Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in October 2023.
Now, the decades-long tug of war between combustion engine and electric cars is intensifying again, and electric cars may be in trouble, at least in the United States.
While the Republican changes probably wouldn’t kill electric vehicles, they could set the industry back years.","More than a century before Tesla rolled out its first cars, the Baker Electric Coupe and the Riker Electric Roadster rumbled down American streets. Battery-powered cars were so popular that, for a time, about a third of New York’s taxis were electric.

But those early electric vehicles began to lose ground to a new class of cars, like the Ford Model T, that were cheaper and could more easily be refueled by new oil-based fuels that were becoming available around the country. Bolstered by federal tax incentives in the 1920s, the oil industry boomed — and so did gasoline-powered cars.

That history has largely been forgotten, and almost all of the early electric cars have disappeared so completely that most people alive today have never seen one — and many have no idea that they even existed. A few specimens are in museums and private collections, including a fully restored Baker Electric that Jay Leno keeps in his sprawling California garage.

Mr. Leno’s ancient electric car has a wooden frame and 36-inch rubber wheels. It looks like a stagecoach, but it is propelled by electric motors and batteries just like a current-day Tesla Model Y or Cadillac Lyriq. It elicited smiles and amazement from people on the streets of Burbank, Calif., when Mr. Leno drove it around town recently.

The car may be a novelty, but it is newly relevant because the United States may be poised to repeat history.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are working to undercut the growth of electric vehicles, impose a new tax on them and swing federal policy sharply in favor of oil and gasoline.

Scholars who have studied the earlier age of electric vehicles see parallels in their demise in the early decades of the 1900s and the attacks they are facing now. In both eras, electric cars struggled to gain acceptance in the marketplace and were undermined by politics. A big knock against them was they had to be charged and ultimately were considered less convenient than vehicles with internal combustion engines.

“Electric cars are good if you have a towing company,” President Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa in October 2023. At another appearance the next month, he said, “You can’t get out of New Hampshire in an electric car.”

Republican leaders say that electric vehicles do not deserve subsidies in the tax code and that their tax bill levels the playing field that Democrats had tilted in favor of one technology.

A hundred years ago, lawmakers also put their thumbs on the scale — and came down on the side of oil.

The oil industry has enjoyed numerous tax breaks. One was enacted in 1926 when Congress allowed oil companies to deduct their taxable income by 27.5 percent of their sales. The sponsor of the legislation later admitted that the incentive was excessive.

“We grabbed 27.5 percent because we were not only hogs but the odd figure made it appear as though it was scientifically arrived at,” Senator Tom Connally, the Texas Democrat who sponsored the break, was quoted as saying in a biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, “Sam Johnson’s Boy: A Close-Up of the President From Texas.”

That tax break lasted for decades. It was eliminated for large oil producers and reduced for smaller companies in 1975.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, crude oil became dominant. The Energy Department noted on a timeline on its website that electric cars “all but disappeared by 1935.”

The triumph of internal combustion made long-distance travel accessible to the masses and helped power the U.S. economy. It also led to deadly urban air pollution and has been a major cause of climate change.

Now, the decades-long tug of war between combustion engine and electric cars is intensifying again, and electric cars may be in trouble, at least in the United States.

Sales of electric cars are growing quickly in most of the rest of world, increasing 35 percent in China in the first four months of the year and 25 percent in Europe, according to Rho Motion, a research firm. But in the United States, sales were up a more modest 11 percent in the first three months of 2025, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Republican leaders are pushing legislation that would eliminate many Biden administration programs intended to promote electric vehicle sales, including a $7,500 federal tax credit. They also want to impose a new annual $250 fee on electric vehicle owners to finance highway construction and maintenance.

While the Republican changes probably wouldn’t kill electric vehicles, they could set the industry back years. “E.V. momentum in the U.S. has slowed, with policy uncertainty mounting,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note this month.

But electric cars have not just been hampered by politics. They also had to overcome gender stereotypes. Their benefits like quiet, smooth operation were considered by some men to be too feminine, and, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, many models like the Baker Electric were explicitly marketed only to women.

Advertisements for the early electrics hang on the walls of Mr. Leno’s Burbank garage. “Make This the Happiest Christmas — Give Your Wife an Electric,” proclaims one. On another, a young woman pleads, “Daddy Get Me a Baker.”

Men, by contrast, have long been pitched on the masculine virtues of gasoline vehicles that roar and thunder.

In the fall of 2022, Representative Majorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who is closely allied with Mr. Trump, pushed the notion that gasoline cars are more macho at a rally. “There’s nothing more American than the roar of a V-8 engine under the hood of a Ford Mustang or Chevy Camaro, an incredible feel of all that horsepower.” But Democrats, she said, “want to emasculate the way we drive.”

Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive who has been working with the Trump administration, has tried to broaden the appeal of electric vehicles. His company’s newest model is the Cybertruck, a massive pickup truck with lots of sharp angles.

“Musk has done everything he could to try to make a Tesla a manly vehicle,” said Virginia Scharff, an emeritus distinguished professor of history at the University of New Mexico and author of numerous books, including “Taking the Wheel: Women and the Coming of the Motor Age.”

But, Ms. Scharff added, Mr. Musk may have gone too far. His alignment with Mr. Trump’s conservative politics has alienated some of the most reliable buyers of electric cars — liberals and environmentalists who hope to move the world away from fossil fuels.

“Here’s like the gender flip: Tesla is so associated with a kind of toxic masculinity now as opposed to the electric car being associated with femininity in the early part of the 20th century,” Ms. Scharff said.

Mr. Leno, the former “Tonight Show” host, who now has an online show focused on cars, “Jay Leno’s Garage,” has a restored 1909 Baker Electric in his collection. It has a top speed of 25 miles per hour and can travel 80 miles on a full charge.

With a high-top cab decorated in Victorian flair, it has two fabric-cushioned bench seats facing each other and roller shades on the windows. The car was meant to accommodate fanciful women’s hats, which at the turn of the century were often big and bold. As an added touch, the car’s designers mounted a makeup case inside the car.

“What do men like?” Mr. Leno said. “Something that rolls, explodes and makes noise. That’s why men like the gasoline car, because it frightened children, you know, that type of thing.”

Mr. Leno said he loves the Baker, which he drives around Burbank at least once a year, to see holiday lights and decorations with his wife.

He said such vehicles had many merits, convenience among them. They are low maintenance, they’re fast and you can fuel them at home, particularly at night when electricity is generally much more affordable than during the day.

The concept of home charging isn’t new. Home car chargers also made their debut a century ago, only bulkier and a bit more frightful.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/27/multimedia/00biz-ev-history-tbgc/00biz-ev-history-tbgc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 13:14:27.282722

“The research shows us how materials science can be applied to simplify the manufacturing process,” Xiao continued.
Nickel-rich lithium cathode material tends to form as agglomerations known as “polycrystals.” Boundaries between the crystals become weaker as the battery discharges and charges.
“The movement can create cracks, which weakens the battery.” “Single-crystal cathodes don’t have the vulnerabilities that arise from polycrystal structures,” Xiao said.
However, Xiao noted that Li2O is easily produced by processing other lithium salts, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).","Scientists at the US Department of Energy‘s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have recently discovered that the sublimation of lithium oxide, when mixed with nickel-rich cathode precursors, creates a single-crystal structure that could be used in longer-lasting batteries.

In a new finding published in Nature Energy, the PNNL-led team showed that vapor from lithium oxide (Li2O) sublimation—the process whereby a solid turns directly into a vapor—accelerates a chemical reaction that forms single crystals when mixed with nickel-rich precursors. The sublimation happens at just one atmosphere of pressure, the everyday pressure felt at sea level. Single-crystal battery materials are thought to help batteries last longer and could help decrease the cost of battery manufacturing.

“The discovery offers a potentially faster, more efficient, and cheaper way to scale up the manufacturing of nickel-rich lithium-ion batteries,” said Jie Xiao, co-author on the paper and a Battelle Fellow who holds a joint appointment with PNNL and the University of Washington. At UW, Xiao is the university’s Boeing Martin Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department. “The research shows us how materials science can be applied to simplify the manufacturing process,” Xiao continued.

Nickel-rich lithium cathode material tends to form as agglomerations known as “polycrystals.” Boundaries between the crystals become weaker as the battery discharges and charges. Over time, these weaknesses lead to cracking, which degrades the battery and shortens its lifetime.

“You can imagine all those tiny particles are agglomerated together, and they get pushed and pulled as the battery charges and discharges,” Xiao said. “The movement can create cracks, which weakens the battery.”

“Single-crystal cathodes don’t have the vulnerabilities that arise from polycrystal structures,” Xiao said. “So, we hope single crystals will mitigate and eventually eliminate all the big challenges in nickel-rich cathode materials.”

However, the team has more work to do before any batteries can be produced, Xiao said. Because Li2O is not broadly used for materials synthesis, the cost to use it commercially is currently too high. However, Xiao noted that Li2O is easily produced by processing other lithium salts, such as lithium hydroxide (LiOH).

Xiao and her team are now working with industry partners to scale up the process while maintaining lower manufacturing costs and aim to provide single crystals to their strategic partners in 2026.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/LiO2-sublimation-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 12:18:24.986353

This legislative amendment effectively opens the door to restarting nuclear power plants in the country.","Taiwan will hold in August a referendum on whether the just-shuttered last nuclear reactor should be restarted once safety checks are completed, in a major reversal of the country’s policy amid energy security concerns.

Taiwan, which is being threatened by China with Beijing claiming it is a “sacred and inseparable part of China's territory”, has decided to phase out its nuclear reactors by this year.

Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party elected in January 2016, and re-elected in 2020, has a policy of phasing out nuclear power by the end of 2025.

Taiwan shut its last nuclear reactor, Maanshan, earlier this month.

Since 2018, Taiwan has shut down four other nuclear reactors and cancelled construction of two others following a referendum in 2021.

However, pro-nuclear opposition parties have submitted a motion for a referendum to restart the Maanshan nuclear reactor if thorough inspections find that it is safe to do so.

Taiwan’s Central Election Commission has approved the proposal for the referendum which will be held on August 23.

“This referendum proposal is about energy policy, and it is about whether the third nuclear power plant, which stopped operating on 17 May 2025, should be put to a referendum to decide whether to continue operating,” the commission said.

Earlier this month, Taiwan’s Parliament amended the country’s nuclear power act to allow plant operators to apply for a 20-year license renewal beyond the existing 40-year limit. This legislative amendment effectively opens the door to restarting nuclear power plants in the country.

Still, even if the referendum to reverse the phase-out is successful, safety checks will take at least three years—therefore, the Maanshan reactor will not be reactivated soon.

Taiwan is looking to bolster its energy security – and to reduce its trade surplus with the United States – by pledging to buy more U.S. oil and gas.

Earlier this year, Taiwan’s state-held oil and gas company CPC Corporation signed a letter of intent to invest in the $44-billion Alaska LNG export project in the U.S. and buy LNG from it. But as Taiwan saw firsthand, commitments and contracts to buy more U.S. energy will not necessarily spare any buyer from tariffs.

The IRA was a huge boon to Republican districts: In just two years, it added nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs and more than $286 billion in clean energy investments to congressional districts represented by Republican House members.","President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) bill was a landmark move for the economy. One year after it was signed into law, it had already created more than 170,600 clean energy jobs and spurred private companies to announce at least 210 major new clean energy and clean vehicle projects across 39 states, representing more than $86 billion in investments.

Now the House Republicans’ reconciliation bill is poised to also have a drastic impact on the economy and clean energy landscape, but by gutting the IRA’s gains. Instead of fostering jobs and clean energy development, the bill—which passed the House this week and has now moved to the Senate—could erase those monumental investments and lead to fewer jobs, reduced clean energy capacity, and a drop in the national GDP.

The GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” will increase some things, experts say, like Americans’ household expenses; it will also give tax benefits to billionaires. “House Republicans just voted to jack up prices, kill jobs, and rip away basic lifelines from working families by taking a sledgehammer to programs and investments that make life more affordable,” Lena Moffitt, executive director of the nonprofit Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “If passed into law, Americans will wake up to find the GOP quietly reached into their wallets and handed their hard-earned cash to corporate polluters and billionaires like Elon Musk and Donald Trump.”

Here’s a look at the impact of the Republican reconciliation bill by the numbers, specifically around jobs, clean energy, and household costs.

The GOP’s reconciliation bill could cost the U.S. more than 830,000 jobs in 2030, according to an analysis from Energy Innovation. (That includes both direct job cuts from less EV production and clean energy manufacturing, as well as indirect losses from higher fuel costs and other economic impacts.)

It would also lead to less new electricity generation, especially at a time when electricity demand is growing. Over the next four years, the bill would decrease additions to new electricity capacity by 302 gigawatts. That’s the same power capacity that the entire U.S. coal fleet had a decade ago. For context, 1 gigawatt can power 100 million LED light bulbs.

With less new electricity being generated, wholesale power prices will increase about 50% by 2035, particularly because solar and wind are cheaper energy sources than fossil fuels. Across all American households, consumer energy costs will increase by more than $16 billion in 2030, and by more than $33 billion by 2035. “This increase happens even if oil and gas production rise and help reduce fossil fuel prices, as envisioned by the bill,” Energy Innovation notes. Between 2026 and 2034, the bill would cumulatively reduce the national GDP by nearly $1.1 trillion.

For individual households, that could mean a $110 increase to electricity costs per year, beginning in 2026, which could then rise to $290 more in annual energy costs per household by 2035.

The GOP bill will drive up household costs for Americans in other ways, too. The price of gasoline will increase between 25 and 37 cents per gallon, which, on the higher end, would mean more than $200 per year for the average gas vehicle. Without the IRA’s EV tax credits, Americans will also essentially see the cost of electric vehicles go up by at least $7,500 (and for used EVs, $4,000).

The Republican bill also eliminates a tax credit for energy-efficient home improvements like heat pumps and water heaters. That credit has so far allowed households to save up to $990 each year on their utility bills, but Americans will now miss out on those savings.

The bill has broader impacts on emissions and how climate change will worsen. Without tax credits to spur investments in clean energy and efficient appliances, the bill could increase greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 130 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2030—like adding 30 million gas-powered cars to the road for one year. By 2035, that could grow to nearly 260 million metric tons, equivalent to the annual energy use of nearly 35 million homes—or the entire annual CO2 emissions from Spain.

With more emissions and air pollution come more deaths. According to Energy Innovation, that could mean nearly 350 additional premature deaths annually by 2030, and nearly 670 more every year by 2035.

Many of these impacts will be concentrated in Republican states. The IRA was a huge boon to Republican districts: In just two years, it added nearly 200,000 clean energy jobs and more than $286 billion in clean energy investments to congressional districts represented by Republican House members. Now those districts will likely see job losses and less economic investment because of their Republican representatives’ votes. “In their crusade to rig the system for their fossil fuel backers,” Moffitt said prior to the House bill passing, “it’s people living in Trump states—their own voters—who will pay the steepest price: lost jobs, higher energy costs, and missed economic opportunities.”",,N,,2025-05-26 15:05:59.569520

These solar projects are located in Texas and Kansas cities in the United States.

AES’ Presence in the Solar Market

AES is actively scaling up its solar power initiatives to reap the benefits of the rising demand trend of the U.S. solar market, backed by significantly expanding investments, especially from large corporate clients. Notably, in the first quarter of 2025, the company completed the construction of 643 MW of solar and energy storage projects.

With solar accounting for 66% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2024 (per the Solar Industries Association’s report) amid rapidly growing energy demand from renewable sources across the nation, AES is more aggressively bolstering its renewable energy generation capacity, with solar at the center of focus. As of March 31, 2025, the company signed 7.7 gigawatts (GW) of long-term PPAs to build renewable capacity that supports the energy needs of data centers.

Meanwhile, the company’s AES Indiana subsidiary received final regulatory approval for the 170 MW Crossvine solar-plus-storage project during the first quarter, which is expected to come online in 2027. It is also making progress on the 295 MW Petersburg Energy Center, a solar-plus-storage facility expected to go live by the end of 2025. Looking ahead, AES Indiana aims to bring up to 1,300 MW of new wind, solar, and storage capacity online by 2027.

Rising Solar Prospects and Utilities

The solar market provides significant growth opportunities, primarily driven by favorable government policies, declining prices of solar panels and the rising adoption of clean power sources.

Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, solar power is expected to drive the largest increase in electricity generation, with output projected to grow 34% in 2025 and 18% in 2026. This offers a significant profit incentive to utilities like AES to significantly enhance their solar generation capacity.

Other utilities expanding their solar generation capacity include the following:

CMS Energy Corporation CMS: It plans to add 9 GW of solar generation to its portfolio during the 2025-2045 period. The company also collaborated with the Muskegon County Resource Recovery Center to develop consumers’ first large-scale, self-developed solar project, a 250 MW solar energy center, expected to be fully operational by 2026.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CMS’ 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $3.59, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.5%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.11 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 8%.

Ameren Corporation AEE: Its Cass County, Huck Finn and Boomtown solar projects were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2024. These projects are expected to collectively generate 500 MW of clean energy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AEE’s 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $4.93, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.5%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.41 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.4%.

PPL Corporation PPL: Its subsidiaries, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company, requested the Kentucky Public Service Commission for approval of nearly 1 GW of solar generation by 2028 as part of the companies' generation replacement strategy.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PPL’s 2025 earnings per share is pinned at $1.82, indicating year-over-year growth of 7.7%. The consensus estimate for 2025 sales is pinned at $8.85 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 4.6%.

According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.
Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.
According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.
The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects.","SACRAMENTO, United States, May 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is advancing plans to eliminate all federal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired power plants across the United States, according to internal U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) documents reviewed by The New York Times on Saturday.

The moves mark the most significant rollback of climate change regulations in decades.

The EPA drafted a proposed regulation arguing that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel power plants ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or climate change, the report said, citing the EPA's documents sent to the White House for review on May 2.

The proposal directly contradicted established climate science and the agency's own data. According to the EPA's Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions website, power plants were responsible for roughly 25 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, making them the second-largest source of heat-trapping gases behind transportation.

Moreover, these facilities emitted approximately 1.36 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023, exceeding the total emissions of most countries worldwide.

""Fossil fuel power plants are the single largest industrial source of climate destabilizing carbon dioxide in the United States,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, to The New York Times.

She called the proposed regulation ""an abuse of the EPA's responsibility under the law,"" adding that it ""flies in the face of common sense and puts millions of people in harm's way.""

The EPA's justification centered on the argument that U.S. power sector emissions represented only about 3 percent of worldwide greenhouse gases in 2022, down from 5.5 percent in 2005, according to the draft regulation.

Agency officials contended that even if American power plants eliminated all their greenhouse gas emissions, global public health risks would not be ""meaningfully"" improved.

However, climate scientists overwhelmingly reject this reasoning. According to the United Nations Climate Action website, fossil fuels account for more than 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.

The power plant deregulation represents the latest phase in the Donald Trump administration's comprehensive assault on climate policies. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on March 12 what he called ""the most consequential day of deregulation in American history,"" targeting more than 30 environmental measures established during the Joe Biden administration.

The Trump administration has already moved to terminate 20 billion U.S. dollars in grants for climate and clean-energy projects. However, a federal judge temporarily blocked this action, noting the EPA had failed to provide adequate legal justification.

Trump's budget plan, announced on May 2, would slash EPA funding by nearly 55 percent compared to 2025 levels and eliminate 15 billion in carbon capture and renewable energy funding from the bipartisan infrastructure law.

The proposed regulation would overturn Biden-era rules that required existing coal-fired units and some new gas-burning plants to cut or capture 90 percent of their climate pollution by 2032. ■",,N,,2025-05-26 12:19:31.058498

The decision by House Republicans to pass a tax bill that would do away with many of the incentives contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition.
The bill agreed by House Republicans is even “worse than feared” for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.
The “sledgehammer” that House Republicans have taken to the IRA “is just one more example of the new volatility and uncertainty in US policy,” Christie said.
Wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle sectors are now pinning hopes on the more deliberative Senate, where improvements could come.","Inside one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, there’s growing concern that Republican efforts to gut legislation supporting key industries such as clean energy may result in the US losing its status as a destination for investor capital.

“For investors, the message is clear: The US may no longer offer the reliable investment runway it did just months ago,” said Alex Bibani, a London-based senior portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors, which oversees some $650 billion in assets.

The decision by House Republicans to pass a tax bill that would do away with many of the incentives contained in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act threatens to upend investment strategies premised on the clean energy-transition. Even if the Senate votes to block some of the House proposals, European asset managers still have to contend with a new level of uncertainty and volatility that may ultimately force them to turn elsewhere, Bibani said.

“Project economics, supply-chain commitments, and capital flows may now pivot toward more stable jurisdictions like Canada or the EU, unless clarity is quickly restored,” he said.

It’s the latest wedge dividing Europe, where emissions reductions are anchored in law, and the US, where the Trump administration has mounted a full-throated attack on net zero policies. The bill agreed by House Republicans is even “worse than feared” for investors committed to energy transition strategies, according to equity analysts at Jefferies.

A repeal of the IRA “would mark a sharp reversal in US clean-tech policy,” Bibani said. That would inject “significant regulatory and political risk into the market, undermining the policy certainty and financial predictability that made the US the world’s leading destination for clean tech capital post-IRA.”

Key Republican senators have already signaled opposition to the House bill. But if passed without revision, it would be the biggest blow to clean power yet from the Trump administration.

The S&P 500 Index fell last week, while the yield on 30-year US Treasuries rose as high as 5.1% as markets digested news of the Republican bill, amid estimates it will add trillions of dollars to the deficit. President Donald Trump then ended the week by injecting further uncertainty into markets as he escalated the tariff war with the European Union, even declaring he’s “not looking for a deal.” The dollar fell.

US hostility toward energy-transition policies has already sent a chill through European investing circles, where such strategies are a major driver of flows. Amundi SA, Europe’s largest asset manager, said last month it was seeing evidence that clients had “massively repositioned” to avoid the US market, amid concerns over everything from a lack of stewardship to a degradation of key climate policies. UBS Group AG also said it was aware of sizeable flows out of US equity exchange-traded funds.

Tyler Christie, who previously invested in climate and the energy transition at BlackRock Inc. as part of its Decarbonization Partners venture with Temasek Holdings Pte, said the concern now is that “extreme volatility in US policy is creating uncertainty that’s rippling through the financial system.” At the same time, “European policy is arguably more aligned and predictable than ever” as it tackles “existential challenges around energy, security and resources.”

The upshot is that asset managers, both in Europe and the US, “are starting to direct more capital into European projects where they can see policy is more consistent and reinforced by fundamental demand,” he said.

The “sledgehammer” that House Republicans have taken to the IRA “is just one more example of the new volatility and uncertainty in US policy,” Christie said.

What BloombergNEF Says:

The final version of the tax and spending bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday represents the nightmare scenario for US clean energy advocates and defenders of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Wind, solar, battery and electric vehicle sectors are now pinning hopes on the more deliberative Senate, where improvements could come.

Donate Now Still, the criticisms prompted Xi to pledge in 2021 that China would stop financing and building new coal power plants overseas.","China’s overseas investments in renewable energy sources have overtaken fossil fuels for the first time since Beijing began backing foreign power projects in the early 2000s.

The shift—which has international ripple effects on everything from climate change to geopolitics—highlights China’s growing dominance in renewable energy technologies and the critical mineral and metal supply chains that support them.

Historically, China’s state-backed Belt and Road Initiative and its predecessor program had been dominated by coal power plants. But from 2022 to 2023, 68 percent of China’s investments in overseas power went to solar and wind projects, according to a new analysis from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center.

Only 13 percent of China’s overseas power investments went to solar and wind from 2000 to 2021.

China’s state-backed overseas investment program has poured hundreds of billions of dollars into infrastructure and energy projects in Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. Its overseas wind and solar investments have largely been in countries in Asia and the Americas, with only 4 percent flowing to African countries, according to Diego Morro, a co-author of the analysis and data scientist at Boston University.

The analysis says China has stuck to its 2021 pledge not to finance new overseas coal power plants, though there is no indication that coal power investments in the works as of 2021 will be jettisoned. Those investments “are still coming online and will emit carbon dioxide for decades going forward,” the researchers said.

If those planned coal power plants are completed, they will emit roughly the same amount of carbon emissions annually as the country of Austria, according to the analysis.

The swing toward financing renewable power in China’s overseas portfolio is also tempered by the fact that overall Chinese foreign direct investment is down from its peak in 2016.

“This shift does not represent a significant ramp-up in renewables, as the scale of financing remains relatively small,” the researchers said. Only 3 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity were funded between 2022 and 2023. By comparison, China’s annual overseas power investments from 2013 to 2019 averaged a capacity of 16 gigawatts.

While coal power dominated those earlier investments, hydropower and gas projects came in second and third.

The analysis drew on the Global Development Policy Center’s database that tracks Chinese state funding through its development finance institutions and other government-directed channels into global power plants outside of China. It does not account for private Chinese overseas investment or for so-called captive coal projects, which aren’t connected to the electric grid because they are built specifically to power industrial projects like mines or steel mills.

Domestically, China continues to lead the world with new coal plant development. Last year, construction started on 94 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in China, compared to 7.4 gigawatts in the rest of the world combined, according to Global Energy Monitor.

Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013. The program is a continuation of China’s “going out” policy from the early 2000s, and has more recently been called China’s Global Development Initiative.

While the programs have given Beijing unprecedented geopolitical sway over more than 150 countries around the world, they have drawn fierce criticism for environmental and human rights harms linked to the ports, mines, railways, highways and other projects financed and built by Chinese firms.

Environmentalists have also criticized China, the world’s current largest emitter of greenhouse gases at home, for funding dozens of coal power plants in developing countries—effectively locking those countries into carbon-intensive forms of power for decades to come. In 2023, Chinese-funded power plants overseas spewed about as much carbon pollution as the country of Malaysia, according to the Boston University analysis.

Beijing and its allies have argued that these investments have brought energy access and economic growth to some of the world’s poorest populations, people who have contributed very little to global warming.

Still, the criticisms prompted Xi to pledge in 2021 that China would stop financing and building new coal power plants overseas. The new Boston University analysis says Beijing has so far stuck to that promise in the context of state-funded projects.

China’s shift toward low-carbon overseas investments is strategic, some analysts say. With a slowing domestic economy and a surplus of solar and wind technology, Beijing is seeking new markets abroad to absorb its renewable energy exports.

“They need to export, they don’t have any choice,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific at the investment bank Natixis. “It is basically an economic argument.”

Morro attributes Beijing’s overall decrease in spending on investments abroad, compared to earlier Belt and Road Initiative levels, to the country’s faltering domestic economy. Following shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been grappling with a real estate crisis, widespread youth unemployment and high local government debt.

Even so, there are signs that Beijing may increase its overseas wind and solar investments, according to Morro. He pointed to China’s $51 billion commitment, made in 2024 during a China-Africa forum, to support African development and build 30 low-carbon energy projects over the next three years.

And while Chinese state finance agencies have reduced overseas spending in recent years, data released by the Chinese government shows that private companies and other state-owned corporations have picked up the slack, with record levels of new investments and construction contracts last year. That spending has also begun to trend more toward renewable energy and appears to have largely hewed to Xi’s no-coal mandate, too.

China has sought to position itself as a global leader on climate change, with Xi recently telling other world leaders at a United Nations conference that China has built “the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy system as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain.” He urged other governments to support the free flow of “quality green technologies and products,” especially for developing countries.

U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a starkly different approach to both climate change and foreign relations. Since returning to office in 2025, Trump has ordered the U.S. government to pull out of the Paris Agreement, has emphasized new fossil fuel production and has sharply slashed U.S. foreign aid.

The Trump administration has, however, pursued U.S. investments in critical minerals and infrastructure abroad through the International Development Finance Corp., an agency launched in 2019 under the first Trump administration. The agency was created with bipartisan support by combining portions of the U.S. Agency for International Development and other governmental offices and is largely seen as the U.S. government’s response to the Belt and Road Initiative.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2157975118-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 16:04:52.462210

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has drafted a proposal to eliminate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, arguing U.S. emissions are too minor to impact global climate change. The administration seeks to repeal public health regulations by dismantling past EPA research, including a 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.

The IEA’s 2025 Global Critical Minerals Outlook warns that despite stable prices and increased supply, rising concentration of mineral production threatens global energy security. Critical minerals like copper, lithium, and rare earths are increasingly subject to export controls, particularly in China and Indonesia, while investment and exploration momentum has slowed. Investment momentum in critical minerals has weakened, as spending grew by just 5% in 2024, down from an increase of 14% in 2023. Copper faces especially severe supply risks, with a projected 30% deficit by 2035. The report emphasizes the urgent need for diversified, resilient supply chains to support energy transition technologies.

States and environmental groups sue the Trump Administration over EV funding freeze

Sixteen states, the District of Columbia, and more than half a dozen environmental groups are suing the Trump Administration for freezing $2.7 billion in congressionally approved funds meant to build a national EV charging network. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) program, created by the 2021 infrastructure law, was designed to build a network of EV charging stations along designated Alternative Fuel Corridors. Defunding U.S. EV infrastructure plans widens infrastructure disparities, worsening pollution in the most underserved communities, and greatly slowing climate progress.

What’s Next: Eyes on Hydrogen Startups If you’re working in or following hydrogen technologies, this is a development worth watching.","Hyundai Motor Group is stepping up its game in future mobility and clean energy with the launch of its newest startup accelerator, ZER01NE Fund III. Announced on May 26, 2025, the fund comes with a hefty KRW 125 billion (roughly USD 93 million) backing—aimed at supporting cutting-edge startups that are shaking things up in AI, robotics, cybersecurity, and especially hydrogen energy technologies.

Doubling Down on Hydrogen Innovation

This latest move makes it crystal clear: Hyundai isn’t just dabbling in hydrogen—it’s going all in. The focus includes everything from advanced hydrogen fuel cells to smart solutions for hydrogen production and storage. With the global push for cleaner energy gaining serious momentum, Hyundai’s timing couldn’t be better. It’s answering the call for industrial decarbonization and sustainable infrastructure with serious action, not just talk.

Building on the solid results from its previous funds—ZER01NE Fund I (2018) and Fund II (2022)—this new version is bigger and bolder. The funding has shot up by 150% compared to Fund II, and the number of participating affiliates has grown from seven to ten. Heavy hitters like Hyundai Motor Company, Kia Corporation, Hyundai MOBIS, and Hyundai Rotem are all on board, giving this initiative some serious muscle.

What Technologies Are in the Spotlight?

There’s a lot of exciting stuff in the mix. Hyundai’s got its eye on hydrogen fuel cells and electrolysis-driven hydrogen production paired with renewable energy. But that’s not all—the fund is also targeting startups that are pushing boundaries in AI-powered robotics, especially those combining large language models with simulation-based learning to train intelligent machines.

Rather than just tweaking what’s already out there, Hyundai’s aiming for the big leaps forward—the kind that can transform entire industries and kickstart the future of zero-emission energy and transportation. They see the sweet spot where automation, AI, and hydrogen infrastructure all come together—and they’re betting big on it.

Connected to South Korea’s Bigger Picture

This initiative isn’t happening in a vacuum. It aligns perfectly with South Korea’s national drive toward clean energy leadership, especially under the Digital New Deal. The country’s shooting to grab a 20% share of the global clean energy tech market by 2030, and with Seoul ranking among the top five most innovative cities worldwide and pouring $70 billion a year into R&D, Hyundai’s move feels right on cue.

Past Successes Fuel Confidence

Let’s not forget—Hyundai’s not new to this game. The first two ZER01NE funds pumped around $66 million into over 100 startups, leading to more than 200 joint projects and five IPOs. That’s the kind of track record that builds real confidence. With several Hyundai affiliates getting involved again, these startups aren’t just getting funding—they’re tapping into deep industry knowledge and hands-on experience, which is priceless when you’re trying to bring bold ideas to life.

Big Goals: Jobs, Innovation, and a Greener Future

It’s not just about tech. Hyundai sees serious economic and environmental upside, too. They estimate that initiatives funded by ZER01NE Fund III could generate more than 50,000 new high-tech jobs by 2030. On top of that, there’s a clear focus on circular economy models—like EV battery recycling with POEN and carbon reuse initiatives with LD Carbon—core pillars of South Korea’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

What’s Next: Eyes on Hydrogen Startups

If you’re working in or following hydrogen technologies, this is a development worth watching. By putting both money and mentorship behind some of the most forward-looking startups out there, Hyundai is helping shape what tomorrow’s energy and mobility landscape will look like. The companies backed by Fund III could very well be the ones turning point-of-concept innovations into scaled-up, real-world solutions in the very near future.

Expect ripple effects—especially where hydrogen fuel cells, electrolysis, and sustainable manufacturing practices are concerned. This could represent a major turning point not just for Hyundai, but for the entire energy and transport sectors.

This move, expected to be published after an interagency review, comes amidst concerns that previous regulations were overreaching and could lead to increased energy prices and reliance on foreign energy sources.

An EPA spokesperson said: “As part of this reconsideration, EPA is developing a proposed rule.”

The draft plan, initially reported by the New York Times, suggests that the EPA does not view emissions from power plants as significantly contributing to pollution or climate change due to their small and declining share of global emissions.

The proposed regulation also argues that eradicating these emissions would not meaningfully impact public health and welfare.

Shanghai Nio Automobile Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nio Holding Co., Ltd., updated on Monday its business registration to include battery production, battery sales, and the manufacturing of battery components.

According to corporate data provider Tianyancha, the entity was founded in May 2015 and lists Nio co-founder and President Qin Lihong as its legal representative.

Nio was founded by Qin Lihong and William Li in November 2014.

The move follows reports in early April that Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), Nio’s key supplier, was “in talks to acquire a controlling stake” in Nio’s battery services arm, Nio Power — Reuters reported.

“Nio and CATL will deepen collaboration on capital and business and further consolidate the strategic partnership to jointly build the largest battery swapping network globally,” the EV maker said in a statement to Reuters on April 7.

Three weeks earlier, Nio said CATL had committed to invest up to 2.5 billion yuan ($347 million) in Nio Power to co-develop battery swap infrastructure across China, further cementing the alliance.

Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.
Executives at Southern and the TVA are already backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates.
It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit.
During Trump's first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs.","For nearly four decades, owners of the Baldwin power plant in southern Illinois managed to avoid the most stringent requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.

The gargantuan coal burner, built during the early to mid-1970s, became the nation's largest source of sulfur dioxide, which creates acid rain and lung-damaging soot. It was also among the top emitters of climate-changing carbon dioxide, smog-forming nitrogen oxide and brain-damaging mercury.

After Baldwin's owners kept the Randolph County plant running for years while skipping the installation of modern pollution controls, a 2005 legal settlement with the U.S. Justice Department forced them to begin reducing noxious emissions that contribute to dirty air in Chicago, and other downwind cities as far away as New York.

Yet the coal plant remains one of the biggest polluters in the Midwest.

By 2020, competition from cleaner, less-expensive energy sources prompted the current owner, Houston-based Vistra Corp., to announce it would close Baldwin this year, and retire the rest of its Illinois coal fleet by 2027.

Now Vistra is hedging its decisions.

In November, the company said it would keep Baldwin running until 2027. Then last month, in an attempt to revive the nation's dwindling coal industry, President Donald Trump threw a lifeline to Vistra and a few dozen other energy companies, encouraging them to apply for exemptions from the latest federal limits on soot, mercury and other toxic air pollution.

Vistra took Trump up on his offer, getting at least a two-year break from tougher regulations at Baldwin and six of its other coal plants: Kincaid south of Springfield, Newton in Jasper County, three in Texas and one in Ohio.

Howard Learner, president and CEO of the nonprofit Environmental Law and Policy Center, noted that regulators during the 1970s exempted dozens of coal plants like Baldwin from the toughest provisions of the Clean Air Act after utilities said they wouldn't be running much longer. Decades later, Vistra bought its Illinois coal plants betting they could still profit from selling their electricity.

""Like others before them, they're kicking the can down the road to keep running Baldwin and these other plants as long as they can,"" Learner said. ""People in Illinois and other Great Lakes states shouldn't have to suffer the pollution consequences just because President Trump gave them a 'get-out-of-jail-free' card.""

Others benefiting from Trump's exemptions include NRG's Powerton coal plant near Pekin in Tazewell County, scheduled to close in 2028, and several owned by Southern Company and the Tennessee Valley Authority, two of the biggest energy companies in the Southeast.

Executives at Southern and the TVA are already backing off plans to retire coal plants or extending previously announced closure dates. They have told shareholders they are motivated by opportunities to cash in on a projected need for more electricity to power data centers.

It is unclear whether the Illinois coal plant owners will follow suit. Vistra and NRG told the Chicago Tribune they plan to adhere to previously announced retirement dates.

""But they have an escape hatch that goes all the way up to the president,"" said John Walke, a senior clean air attorney at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council. ""In our view, President Trump is breaking the law by abusing his authority, which appears to be designed to bide time while his administration attempts to roll back the regulations altogether.""

All told, the 69 coal plants Trump exempted from the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule emitted 2,650 pounds of mercury into the atmosphere in 2023, the last year for which federal records are available. The plants accounted for about 10% of all industrial mercury emissions during the period.

Just a teaspoon of the toxic metal can contaminate a 20-acre lake. If certain types of fish are a large part of a mother's diet, studies have found, mercury passed to her baby in the womb can irreversibly damage the developing brain.

The exempted coal plants also are responsible for nearly half of sulfur dioxide emissions and about a third of nitrogen oxide pollution from the nation's electricity generators, according to federal records.

Under regulations from former President Joe Biden's administration, now targeted by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, the power plants are required to improve the performance of mercury-reducing equipment, and in some cases upgrade filters that screen soot from billowing out of smokestacks. The more stringent standards effectively limit emissions of other toxins, including benzene, lead and arsenic.

For the first time, coal plant owners must install equipment to constantly measure mercury emissions, similar to what they already do for carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year the regulations will provide up to $3 billion in health benefits by 2037, while costing industry up to $330 million.

Republican attempts to roll back the mercury rule and dozens of other environmental regulations come as lower prices for natural gas have prompted many investor-owned companies to abandon coal. Prices for renewable energy have dropped so dramatically that it now costs 45% less to build a new wind farm than operating a coal plant with the same capacity, according to the investment firm Lazard.

During Trump's first term in office, 79 coal plants closed and 13,000 industry workers lost their jobs. Last year coal plants generated just 15% of the nation's electricity, the Energy Information Administration reported, down from nearly half in 2011.

Despite economic realities, Trump touts coal as a linchpin of his second-term policies.

""We're bringing back an industry that was abandoned despite the fact that it was the best, certainly the best in terms of power, real power,"" Trump said last month while flanked by coal miners and corporate executives wearing hard hats at the White House.

Though he has said it should be up to states to protect the environment, Trump ordered the Justice Department to target clean energy laws enacted by Illinois and several other states.

""American energy dominance is threatened when state and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,"" Trump said in his missive.

If the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act survives Trump's promised legal challenge, the coal plants owned by Vistra and NRG would need to shut down by 2030 at the latest.

Pritzker, a prominent Trump critic, has vowed the president's actions won't survive court challenges.

Asked for comment, a Pritzker spokesman directed the Tribune to the governor's interview last month with David Roberts, a clean-energy podcaster.

""We're continuing to make progress even now, even with the headwinds that the federal government is putting in our way,"" Pritzker told Roberts. ""And let's face it, all of what they're doing is irrational. It truly makes no sense. We're creating jobs, we're growing our economy, in part, based on our focus on climate.""

With the Trump Clean Air Act exemptions, Vistra and NRG would still be able to sell electricity from their coal burners for a few more years without spending more money on pollution controls or improving those already in place. It is also possible they could lobby the Illinois General Assembly to extend the 2030 deadline, a common tactic in Springfield.

The result would be more toxic emissions and climate-changing pollution endangering everyone on the planet.

​​ForeFront Power complete 1 MW solar carport at Fullerton College

Fullerton College in California has installed a new 1 MWdc solar canopy system on the campus. Developed in partnership with ForeFront Power, the solar parking canopy array, located in Student Parking Lot 5 adjacent to Sherbeck Field, is projected to save the college nearly $6 million in energy costs over the next 20 years. The solar carport system will generate 1.8 million kWh of renewable energy. This energy output will offset roughly 19% of the College’s electrical consumption.

“After over a century of being in operation, Fullerton College is moving into the future by implementing clean energy solutions that will allow us to reliably produce clean energy, reduce harmful emissions, and reinvest energy savings into student success,” said Dr. Cynthia Olivo, president of Fullerton College. “What better time than during Earth Week to reaffirm our responsibility to the planet and future generations.”

Cool factor: This is a pilot solar project for North Orange County Community College District to help demonstrate how solar can benefit other campuses in the district. The project is the culmination of an initial Solar Feasibility Study completed in 2021, which helped the College identify the project site, as well as implement the College’s 2023-2026 Campus Sustainability Plan, which approved the development of the project through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with ForeFront Power.

The PPA with ForeFront Power enabled Fullerton College to develop its project at no upfront cost and without using bond funds. Under the terms of the PPA, ForeFront Power develops, owns, and maintains the solar energy portfolio and charges the College a fixed, lower rate than the utility for electricity, locked in for the 20-year duration of the agreement. ForeFront Power will continue to operate and maintain the system at no cost to the college.

A kind of hybrid, e-Power comes equipped with both an electric motor and gasoline engine, much like the Toyota Motor Corp. Prius. It’s different from a Prius in that it doesn’t switch back and forth between the motor and engine during the drive.

That means the car always is running on its EV battery, ensuring a quiet, smooth ride.

“Nissan has a proud history of pioneering innovative technology that set us apart,” Chief Technology Officer Eiichi Akashi told reporters on the sidelines of a test drive at its Grandrive course outside Tokyo.

The advantage of e-Power vehicles is that they never need to be charged like EVs do. The owner just fuels up at a gas station and the car never runs out of a charge.

Nissan Motor Corp., which racked up a $4.5 billion loss for the fiscal year through March, sorely needs a hot-seller, especially in the lucrative North American market. But the U.S. market is proving a big headache for all the Japanese automakers because of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

To achieve a turnaround, Nissan is working on reducing costs, strengthening business partnerships and redefining its lineup. That's where e-Power fits in, according to Akashi.

Yokohama-based Nissan announced earlier this month that it’s slashing about 15% of its global work force, or about 20,000 employees, and reducing the number of its auto plants to 10 from 17, under an ambitious recovery plan led by its new Chief Executive Ivan Espinosa.

Nissan officials did not give a price for the upcoming e-Power models. The only other automaker offers a similar technology is “kei,” or tiny car manufacturer Suzuki Motor Corp.

E-Power is already offered on the Nissan Qashqai and X-Trail model in Europe, and the Note in Japan. The upgraded version will be offered in the new Rogue in the U.S.

Nissan, a pioneer in EVs with its Leaf, which went on sale in 2010, is also preparing beefed up EV models. It's also working on a solid-state battery which is expected to replace the lithium-ion batteries now widely used in hybrids, EVs and e-Power models.

Analysts say Nissan is in danger of running out of cash and needs a partner. Speculation is rife its Yokohama headquarters building will get sold, or one of its Japan plants will be turned into a casino.

Nissan started talks last year with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. for a business integration but announced in February that it was dropping the talks.

On Friday, President Trump signed a sweeping set of executive orders aimed at accelerating the deployment of nuclear energy as AI data centers demand massive energy loads.

Trump signed four executive orders targeting the nuclear industry, including one directive for “total and complete reform” of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Under the new mandate, the NRC must issue reactor license decisions within 18 months.

Nuclear industry executives joined Trump in the Oval Office for the signing, including Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez.

Constellation Energy operates the largest fleet of nuclear power plants in the U.S. and recently inked a 20-year deal with Microsoft to restart Three Mile Island.

“We're wasting too much time on permitting and we're answering silly questions — not the important ones,” Dominguez said.

The revival of Three Mile Island is especially symbolic. It’s the site of America’s worst nuclear accident in 1979. It also became a turning point in regulatory overreach, many in the industry argue.

On Friday, U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgman didn’t hold back.

“This is a huge day for the nuclear industry. Mark this day on your calendar,” he said. “This is going to turn the clock back 50 years on over-regulation of this industry.”

Trump himself called nuclear “a hot industry, a brilliant industry” but emphasized that “you have to do it right.” He described modern nuclear tech as safe, clean, and essential to American leadership.

“This will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” he said.

After the news broke, Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE) soared 30.07%. Oklo (OKLO), which went public earlier this year via a SPAC linked to OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, jumped 23.04%. NuScale Power Corp. rallied 19.43%.

Shares of Constellation (CEG) gained just over 2% because it’s a more mature company that has less direct leverage to new SMR projects.

This is not just about SMRs

The Trump administration’s nuclear push is largely a response to Silicon Valley’s pursuit of cheap energy.

With artificial intelligence development exploding across the board, tech companies are hunting for power sources that are clean, stable, and cost-efficient.

Former Oklo board member Chris Wright, now serving as U.S. Secretary of Energy, has called the AI race “the next Manhattan Project,” invoking the top-secret effort that gave the world its first atomic bomb.

“We led post-World War II in all things nuclear, but then we’ve been stagnated,” Burgman said. “We choked it with overregulation.”

Even Trump, who once voiced concerns on the Joe Rogan Experience about nuclear being “too big and too complex and too expensive,” now appears to be all in.

“There’s a little danger to nuclear... we had some really bad nuclear,” he said back in October.

But on Friday, he changed his tone entirely.

While most headlines focused on small modular reactors (SMRs), Trump made clear that the administration is also embracing legacy nuclear projects.

“We’re also talking about the big plants, the very, very big, the biggest,” he said. “We’re going to be doing them also.”

With the NRC’s licensing process now under a political microscope, and bipartisan support growing for grid-scale energy reform, the U.S. nuclear revival might finally be more than just a talking point.

And for SMR developers, legacy plant operators, and power-hungry tech giants alike, the opportunity is enormous.",https://media.investorsobserver.com/images/750w/2025/02/nuclear-energy.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 14:09:56.154286

The Government Accountability Office (GAO), a nonpartisan, independent agency, issued a non-binding legal decision on Thursday stating that the Department of Transportation (DOT) violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA) by pausing new obligations to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grant program.

Vought took to X, to denounce the GAO, stating, “Just so we are all clear over the next several months. The Government Accountability Office or GAO is a quasi-independent arm of the legislative branch that played a partisan role in the first-term impeachment hoax. They are going to call everything an impoundment because they want to grind our work to manage taxpayer dollars effectively to a halt.”

The dispute centers on the Trump DOT’s announcement in February to halt new funding for the $5 billion NEVI program. The program, established under President Biden’s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was intended to foster the nationwide deployment of EV charging infrastructure. The Trump administration justified the pause by citing a need to review the program’s “inefficient guidance and failed performance.”

Current Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had previously highlighted implementation issues, alleging in February that states like California had spent a minuscule portion – just 1% – of their allocated funds. The program’s slow rollout under former Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has been a point of criticism, with a majority of funding remaining unobligated.

In its ruling, the GAO concluded that the administration’s actions constituted an illegal impoundment. “DOT is not authorized to withhold these funds from expenditure and DOT must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program,” the GAO wrote. The agency suggested that if the DOT wished to alter the program, it “could propose funds for rescission or otherwise propose legislation to make changes to the NEVI Formula Program for consideration by Congress.”

The GAO, led by Obama appointee Gene Dodaro, has reportedly initiated numerous investigations into the Trump administration’s handling of congressionally appropriated funds. Dodaro informed senators in April that at least 39 such investigations are currently underway.

Vought, however, downplayed the significance of the GAO’s findings. “These are non-events with no consequence,” he stated. “Rearview mirror stuff.”

This is not the first instance of the GAO finding fault with a Trump administration’s fiscal actions. In 2020, the GAO determined that the administration illegally withheld military aid to Ukraine, a finding that featured in President Trump’s first impeachment proceedings.

The GAO itself has recently faced criticism from Republicans.

Last week, Senate Majority Leader John Thune accused the watchdog of “improperly intervening to protect Biden-era rules” after it determined that Biden administration waivers allowing California to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035 were not eligible for review under the Congressional Review Act.

A GAO spokesperson defended the agency’s work in a statement, asserting, “GAO’s Impoundment Control Act (ICA) decision does not take a position on the policy goals of electric vehicle charging infrastructure program. Our legal decisions only examine the procedural issues and compliance with the law.” The spokesperson emphasized the GAO’s mission “to provide non-partisan, fact-based information to Congress… We stand behind the quality of our work.”

A Breakthrough in Battery Chemistry

The battery, developed under the guidance of Prof. Premkumar Senguttuvan and Ph.D. scholar Biplab Patra, leverages a NASICON-type structure and a uniquely engineered anode:

Na₁.₀V₀.₂₅Al₀.₂₅Nb₁.₅(PO₄)₃

Key innovations include:

Nanosizing particles to reduce ion travel distance

Carbon coating for enhanced conductivity

Aluminium substitution for improved electrochemical stability

These refinements allow the battery to charge up to 80% in just six minutes and deliver over 3,000 charge-discharge cycles—with over 80% capacity retention.

Why It Matters for India

India largely depends on imported lithium for battery manufacturing, making the country vulnerable to geopolitical risks and supply chain volatility. Sodium, on the other hand, is abundantly available in India, making this discovery crucial to the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiative.

This sodium-based battery technology offers a cheaper, safer, and scalable alternative to lithium-ion batteries—especially suited for:

EVs and electric 2-wheelers

Solar grid energy storage

Emergency backup systems

Rural clean energy projects

High-temperature environments (thanks to its thermal stability)

Rigorously Tested and Ready for Scaling

The prototype has already undergone electrochemical validation and quantum-level simulations, showing strong promise for safety, efficiency, and longevity. Although commercial deployment will take time, the innovation has already captured attention in scientific and policy circles.

As the global lithium market remains uncertain—with China, Chile, and Australia dominating the supply—India’s sodium-ion alternative positions the country to become a technology leader in next-gen battery innovation.

Looking Ahead

Housed under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), the JNCASR’s advancement not only boosts indigenous R&D but also strengthens India’s role in the global clean tech movement. If commercialized at scale, this battery could power India’s journey towards a sustainable, electrified, and self-reliant future—free from critical mineral dependency.",https://trak.in/stories/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-26-at-8.05.09 AM.png,N,,2025-05-26 10:11:14.390483

Committed to delivering clean energy globally, the Initiative aims to strengthen sustainability across the entire value chain — promoting green mineral sourcing from the source, protecting ecosystems and biodiversity, building an equitable society for common good, and driving inclusive growth.

Aligned with the UNGC Ten Principles and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Initiative outlines 9 actionable pathways across three pillars, advancing ESG progress across the solar value chain and promoting its positive impact on the international market.

The GSSA initiative has garnered strong endorsement from the UNGC. Meng Liu, UNGC China Representative, stated: ""We commend the global solar industry, particularly Chinese photovoltaic enterprises, for their contributions to advancing the global energy transition, and we welcome the launch of this initiative. Closely aligned with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the Initiative underscores corporate responsibilities in environmental protection, human rights safeguards, and sound governance. We look forward to the solar industry setting an exemplary model for global sustainable development through collective action.""

Jing Li, Vice President of Branding and Sustainability Officer of JA Solar, officially launched this GSSA Initiative at the event, and introduced JA Solar's newly constructed responsible supply chain strategy with the theme of ""Together Towards Tomorrow"", which aims to promote the multi-stakeholders along the industry's value chain to evolve towards a sustainable future.

UNGC encourages more solar companies and supply chain partners to join this initiative and jointly advance the sustainable development of the industry. To truly fulfill the summit's vision of 'Better Business, Better World: Accelerating the SDGs', the first co-signatories pledge to collaboratively develop a concrete action roadmap with stakeholder engagement, to ensure effective implementation of the Initiative.

Appendix : Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA)

As the backbone of renewable energy, the global solar sector provides consumers, industries, and society with affordable and reliable clean energy. It has made remarkable contributions to advancing global energy transition and promoting sustainable development, with immense potential yet to be realized.

On the other hand, after decades of growth, the social and environmental footprints of the solar industry, particularly the associated risks across its supply chain—have increasingly emerged. These challenges pose significant obstacles to unleashing the industry's full potential and achieving its own sustainable development.

In light of this, we, as the undersigned photovoltaic enterprises and supply chain participants, guided by the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), hereby launch the Global Solar Sustainable Alliance (GSSA). We call on all companies in the industry and its supply chains to adopt sustainability principles and strategies, and actively undertake the following actions:

I. Just Transition: Safeguarding the green ecosystems and environment

a) Reduce pollution, conserve resources, improve environmental management, implement clean production, and promote a circular economy.

b) Cut energy consumption and carbon emissions, adapt to climate change, establish science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets, and achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible.

c) Protect biodiversity and ecosystems, promoting green mining from origins of materials, ensuring zero deforestation and no net loss of biodiversity.

II. People-Centric Development: Building an Equitable Society for Common Good

a) Respect and protect workers' fundamental rights, create gender-responsive, diverse, inclusive, safe, and healthy workplaces, and enhance employees' skills and development potential.

b) Advance responsible procurement and marketing practices, implement human rights due diligence in supply chains, improve value chain transparency, traceability, and collaborative mechanisms, and strengthen supply chain resilience.

c) Plan PV projects in alignment with local conditions, respect the rights of communities and residents, and leverage industry expertise to support community and social development.

III. Governance Enhancement: Driving Inclusive Growth

a) Optimize corporate governance structures, enhance professionalism and diversity in governance mechanisms, improve investor relations management, and protect the rights of minority shareholders.

b) Operate with integrity and compliance, oppose all forms of unfair competition practices, proactively uphold a sound market order, and foster the healthy development of the industry.

c) Strengthen internal and external oversight systems, conduct standardized information disclosure and regular tracking of progress and targets, and establish multi-channel stakeholder engagement and dialogue mechanisms.

Building on the above consensus, we will pool wisdom and resources, engage in full collaboration, and establish a concrete action roadmap with the participation and support of multi-stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of the GSSA Initiative.

Cleantech manufacturing is booming worldwide, with significant expansions in capacity and investment in recent years.","Investments in cleantech manufacturing have soared worldwide, with these technologies set to play a pivotal role in the world’s global push toward decarbonization, energy security, and economic development. Manufacturing capacities of key energy transition technologies are also expanding rapidly. The manufacturing capacity of solar PV alone has risen more than tenfold in the past decade to five gigawatts in 2024. With China currently dominating the market by far, other regions are now trying to bridge the gap and boost their domestic capacities.

Investments in cleantech manufacturing

In 2024, global investment in cleantech factories totaled 112 billion U.S. dollars. Although this was a year-on-year decline of 14 percent, global annual investments in factory facilities for clean technologies, including solar, batteries, wind turbines, and hydrogen electrolyzers, have risen roughly tenfold since 2018. In 2024, three-quarters of this investment went toward manufacturing facilities in mainland China, a slight drop from the country’s record investment share of almost 90 percent the previous year.

China dominates clean tech manufacturing

A combination of governmental action, increased investment , and a focus on research and development has seen China rise to become the undisputed leader in cleantech manufacturing. As of 2024, “the world’s factory” dominated the supply chains of the main energy transition minerals, such as gallium, graphite, and silicon, as well as the production capacity of most key clean technologies and their components. This was particularly the case within the solar power segment, with China accounting for more than 90 percent of the global PV wafer and polysilicon manufacturing capacity that year and around 80 percent of PV cells and module capacity. The manufacturing powerhouse also controls the majority of the world’s production capacity for lithium-ion battery cells, a key technology for electric vehicles. A big contributor to China’s dominance in the cleantech sector is its low production costs. For example, it is roughly 30 percent cheaper to manufacture electrolyzers in China when compared to the U.S. and 41 percent cheaper to manufacture batteries.

The cleantech race

With China currently dominating manufacturing capacities, the United States and Europe are now playing catch up in the cleantech race. To become more competitive in the global market and less dependent on China, the U.S. has implemented a range of policies and measures in recent years to scale up domestic manufacturing. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), for example, has spurred a boom in cleantech manufacturing facility announcements since it was passed into law in August 2022. Meanwhile, the European Union has set the target for the manufacturing capacity of strategic net-zero technologies to meet at least 40 percent of the region’s annual deployment needs by 2030 under the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) and increase its share of global production to 15 percent by 2040. Nevertheless, China is poised to remain the dominant force in cleantech manufacturing over the coming years, and to continue attracting the most investment for cleantech factories.

Under the waiver given to California, states are allowed to choose whether they will follow the federal standards for emissions, or California’s.
Known as Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks, these rules within DEM would have phased out gas-powered cars in Rhode Island by 2035.
It’s not the first time a multistate strategy for tackling vehicle emissions has failed in recent years.
That loss of funding is almost certainly felt in Rhode Island today, especially as the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, the state’s only transit network, faces a $32 million deficit.","PROVIDENCE — Rhode Island’s electric vehicle transition may have been given a near death blow last week, after the U.S. Senate voted, 51-44, to rescind a waiver that allows states to have more control over their emissions standards.

Specifically, Congress has voted to rescind the waiver given to the state of California under the Clean Air Act that banned the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, as well as two additional mandates on zero-emission trucks, and stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks in the Golden State.

Why does a waiver in California impact what happens in Rhode Island? Under the waiver given to California, states are allowed to choose whether they will follow the federal standards for emissions, or California’s. Rescinding the waiver given to California means the states aren’t allowed to push for greater zero-emission vehicles in their own jurisdictions.

State policymakers in recent years have passed a number of agency rules within the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management that had the state following the California standards. Known as Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks, these rules within DEM would have phased out gas-powered cars in Rhode Island by 2035.

Buying a gas-powered car on the used car market would have still been allowed, but no new models of such cars would be for sale within the Ocean State.

In a statement emailed to ecoRI News, a DEM spokesperson said the department had been following the issue for weeks and is “deeply disappointed that Congress took this action.”

“In accordance with the RI Act on Climate, we remain committed to developing our Climate Action Strategy, which is due at the end of this year,” said Kim Keough, DEM’s chief of public affairs. “Since transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to a clean electric vehicle fleet remains a critical component of our strategy for that sector.”

The move by Congress potentially leaves Rhode Island without a clear, holistic strategy for tackling transportation emissions. That sector, made up of cars, trucks, buses and other large motor vehicles, accounts for 36.6% of all emissions produced by the Ocean State, the single biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions statewide, followed by the buildings and then the electricity sectors.

It’s not the first time a multistate strategy for tackling vehicle emissions has failed in recent years. In 2021, Massachusetts and Connecticut dropped their support for the Transportation & Climate Initiative in the face of soaring gas prices and overall inflation, leaving Rhode Island alone at the altar. The program as proposed required fuel operators to buy carbon allowances for emissions produced by their products, and was expected to raise $3 billion over the next decade for its participating governments.

If implemented in Rhode Island, the program was expected to raise $20 million annually for cleaner transit projects, with at least 35% set aside for communities hit hardest by transportation-related pollution. That loss of funding is almost certainly felt in Rhode Island today, especially as the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, the state’s only transit network, faces a $32 million deficit.

In the meantime, on Friday the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan climate action coalition made up of 24 governors around the country, announced the launch of a new initiative in the face of Congress rescinding California’s waiver.

Called the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, 11 of the participating states, including Rhode Island, as well as Massachusetts, New York, and California, have committed to collaborating on how to reduce vehicle emissions, and defend state powers under the federal Clean Air Act.

In a statement to the press, the 11 governors said the federal government had chosen to put polluters over people, and reaffirmed their commitment to reducing emissions.

“We will continue collaborating as states and leveraging our longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act, including through state programs that keep communities safe from pollution, create good-paying jobs, increase consumer choice, and help Americans access cleaner and more affordable cars,” according to the coalition. “As we consider next steps for our clean vehicle programs, our states will engage stakeholders and industry to provide the regulatory certainty needed while redoubling our efforts to build a cleaner and healthier future.”

Congress’ actions have come at a time when electric vehicles were slowly on the rise. According to industry data, there are 5.7 million EVs on roads around the country today, and EV sales account for just under 10% of all vehicles sold in the United States.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/electric-vehicle.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 11:07:25.229914

The Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM) was established under Article 6.4 of the 2015 Paris Agreement to enable countries and organisations to collaborate on emissions reductions through high-integrity carbon credits. The mechanism allows countries to raise climate ambition and implement national action plans more affordably by identifying and encouraging opportunities for verifiable emission reductions, attracting funding to implement them, and enabling cooperation among countries and other groups to conduct and benefit from these activities.

Unlike existing carbon markets, the PACM aims to provide a UN-supervised framework that directly supports national climate commitments and raises global ambition. The mechanism is designed to generate and trade high-integrity carbon credits in support of global climate goals, offering countries and other actors a structured way to work together on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The development comes after years of criticism over the integrity of carbon credit systems, with concerns that many projects have overstated their environmental benefits or failed to deliver genuine emissions reductions. The UN-backed standards are hoped to help boost the integrity of the new market and combat fears over 'greenwashing'.

The new standards represent a decade-long effort to create a robust, internationally recognised carbon trading mechanism that can support global climate goals while avoiding the pitfalls of previous schemes. The establishment of the PACM has been ""a decade in the making"" according to reports, designed to address integrity concerns that have plagued existing carbon credit systems.

The PACM Supervisory Body agreed two key standards that will govern how carbon credit projects measure their actual emissions reduction impact. The rules aim to ensure credits issued under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement are, ""ambitious, real, additional and verifiable.""

The first standard establishes new requirements for measuring baseline emissions, what would have happened without the project. It includes an initial downward adjustment, such as setting baselines 10% below business-as-usual emissions, plus a minimum 1% annual reduction across all approaches. These measures are designed to prevent over-crediting and drive continuous improvement.

The second standard addresses ""leakage"", unintended emissions increase elsewhere due to project activities. It clarifies that forest protection projects must align with host countries' national strategies to qualify for credits.

Martin Hession, Chair of the Supervisory Body, said the agreement ensures ""crediting levels are set consistently with a pathway to net neutrality."" The body also agreed measures for equitable benefit-sharing with host countries and enhanced capacity building support.

However, fewer projects than expected are transitioning from the previous Clean Development Mechanism, creating a short-term funding gap until new PACM projects begin in 2026. The first methodologies are expected for approval by year-end.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/x3gcbjha/energy-and-climate-policy.jpg?mode=pad&rnd=133440407058470000,N,,2025-05-26 11:07:12.875412

The congress will convene the world’s foremost utility and energy leaders under the theme Innovating for a New Age of Utilities.

The strategic conference at this year’s World Utilities Congress will serve as a key platform for high-level dialogue and international cooperation, addressing the rise in global energy demand and the need for more diversified utility systems.

With electricity demand expected to grow by 3.4% annually until 2026, and the rising importance of the energy-water nexus, utility leaders are being called upon to design systems that are smarter, cleaner, more resilient, and equitable.

With a strong emphasis on transformation, the event is designed to fast-track the shift to a digitally enabled and collaborative global utilities ecosystem.

More than 130 international speakers will participate in over 30 sessions alongside ministers, policymakers, CEOs, and senior decision-makers to define the path toward a low-carbon, tech-driven, and water-secure future.

2025 programe

This edition will spotlight digital transformation, artificial intelligence, smart grid flexibility, and sustainable financing. Global energy leaders will examine critical issues, from deploying AI while managing its energy consumption to unlocking the US$1.5 trillion needed annually for renewable energy via new investment models and enhancing flexibility in an increasingly solar and wind-powered world.

Christopher Hudson, president of dmg events, said, “As utilities evolve to meet rising demand and climate objectives, the World Utilities Congress offers a focused environment for global leaders to assess priorities, share insights, and align on the actions needed to deliver tangible progress. This year’s strategic conference brings a stronger emphasis on practical outcomes, with ministers, CEOs, and technology pioneers gathering to strengthen partnerships and help shape a more connected, efficient, and sustainable future.”

Looking ahead to her global leadership panel on transforming water scarcity into opportunities, Hebah Abbas, chairwoman of the sustainability committee at the Kuwait Water Association, said, “The World Utilities Congress is a unifying force for collaboration, ushering in a new era of regenerative practices and systems innovation. This event gathers visionary leaders and forward-thinkers, where digital, circular, and decentralised solutions converge to redefine energy, water, and utilities. To tackle the systemic challenges in water management, we must forge effective multi-stakeholder partnerships that drive meaningful progress.

“By designing water infrastructure beyond traditional pipes and pumps, we create climate-resilient, inclusive systems that adapt to future shocks. This holistic approach is essential for turning obstacles into opportunities and securing a sustainable future in water management and utilities.”

The 2025 programme will also reexamine water’s crucial role in climate adaptation, the promise of AI in operational optimisation, and how capital reallocation and financial innovation can accelerate investment in grid and clean water infrastructure.

Through these themes, the strategic conference continues to guide the global utilities sector through uncertainty toward a future that is sustainable, inclusive, and interconnected.

While congress is not moving towards a full repeal of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act which Democrats herald as one of the Biden presidency’s signature achievements, the version of the reconciliation bill passed by the House last Wednesday - the One Big Beautiful Bill Act - places some of the heaviest subsidies for intermittent wind and solar generation and electric vehicles clearly in congress’s sights, with a new focus on nuclear power gaining favor.

While that bill severely limits the ability of wind and solar developers to access the investment tax credit for new projects, it simultaneously expands the credit for the builders of new nuclear power facilities. That alone signals a major shift in policy priorities: Taken together with the four executive orders designed to boost nuclear generation signed by President Donald Trump on Friday, the shift becomes a rising sea change.

Out is the Biden era’s focus on conforming U.S. energy and climate policies to the strictures of international agreements ostensibly designed to fight climate change. In is the Trump focus on creating a new era of American dominance in not just energy but also AI technology advancements and leveraging both to facilitate the energy and commerce-base foreign policy doctrine the President laid out in his speech in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia two weeks ago.

What Trump’s Nuclear Executive Orders Do

Energy Secretary Chris Wright signaled the intent of the Trump executive orders in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development last Wednesday. During an exchange with Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, Wright said nuclear is “the critical technology that could scale wildly beyond where it is today, which is just electricity production into huge scale…I am all in with you on advancing nuclear…Nuclear is the [energy source]

that could burst through.”

Trump’s decision in one of Friday’s executive orders to invoke the Defense Production Act declaring a national emergency over America’s heavy reliance on imports of uranium – much of it from Russia – is an extension of his Day 1 declaration of a national energy emergency related to what he views as a dangerously low level of national energy security.

“When President Trump declared a national emergency on his first day in office it was, in large part, because of what we're facing with our electrical grid and making sure that we’ve got enough power to be able to win the AI arms race with China,” Burgum said last week, as first reported by RealClearPolitics. “That is absolutely critical.”

That second of four orders signed by Trump aims to boost domestic production and processing of uranium by prioritizing domestic supply chains and using presidential emergency powers to help streamline the permitting process for qualifying projects. The third order authorizes the secretaries of Defense, Energy, and interior to utilize federally owned lands and laboratories to accelerate research and testing, and to serve as sites for rapid development of both nuclear generation facilities and AI datacenters.

Since its first day in office, the Trump administration has made a top priority of searching for ways the Administration could streamline permitting processes for energy projects without the need for congressional legislation. The leveraging of federal facilities and lands will serve to avoid many of the common factors that tend to delay permitting for energy projects of all kinds.

Examples include fights over landowner rights, rights of way, multi-jurisdictional traffic and noise restrictions, and even some endangered species and archaeological considerations. It is a truly ingenious approach which could have national application given federal ownership of large tracts of land in almost every state.

The fourth Trump order sets an ambitious goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity from approximately 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050, a target some experts deem unlikely given historical construction timelines and costs. For context, the addition of 300 gigawatts of generating capacity would equate to adding three Texas power grids in just 25 years. This order would promote both traditional large-scale plants and the new generation of modular reactor technology currently being developed, with a goal of incentivizing such development by U.S. companies performed in the U.S.

All of those orders tie in with the first order signed by Trump on Friday. That order seeks to reform the immensely bureaucratic and outdated processes of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a regulatory body established in 1974 and designed to deal with 1970s-era technologies and issues. No domestic revolution in nuclear power can take place without a full modernization of the NRC and its processes, which have made it near-impossible to obtain the permits needed to build new facilities.

To help speed the permitting process, this Trump order requires the NRC approve new reactor licenses within 18 months and existing reactor operations within 12 months. It also mandates the NRC to propose a comprehensive revision in its regulatory structure within 18 months, a very ambitious timeline.

The Bottom Line: A Nuclear Future

From charging electric vehicles to bitcoin mining to AI and its related datacenters popping up all over the nation, the major new power demands on the U.S. grid will be impossible to meet in a regulatory environment in which permitting of new generating facilities under current rules and procedures can take as long as 15 years. The need for those datacenters to have 99.999% uptime means that the preferred rent-seeking client industries of the Biden era – wind and solar – cannot fill the bill.

In April 2025, TVS Motor overtook Ola Electric as the market leader in the electric two-wheeler segment, according to data from the government-run Vahan portal.
So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?
Ola Electric may be at risk from this.
Considering Ola Electric’s focus on owning the entire EV stack, this is without a doubt one of the company’s largest obstacles.","With great excitement, Ola Electric Datalabs went public on the stock exchanges in August 2024, raising over INR 5,500 Cr to fund future expansion and the development of its entire electric vehicle stack. A few days later, Bhavish Aggarwal presented Ola Electric’s ambitious intentions, laced with some dubious allegations. This is significant because of what we shall see subsequently.

However, Ola Electric is now thinking about raising additional money not even a year after that IPO in an attempt to get back on track following months of sluggish growth, growing regulatory scrutiny over sales claims, and a significant decline in the stock price. Additionally, the company run by Bhavish Aggarwal has lost its leading position in the EV market.

In April 2025, TVS Motor overtook Ola Electric as the market leader in the electric two-wheeler segment, according to data from the government-run Vahan portal. With a market share of 21.46%, the Bengaluru-based business registered 19,709 automobiles last month, a 42% decrease from the previous year.

The second rise in ten months for Ola Electric

The present plans to raise INR 1,700 Cr in one or more tranches through non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and other acceptable debt securities have been authorised by Ola Electric’s board. Other specifics, such as the intended use of the profits, were not disclosed, though.

So, what brings Ola Electric back to the fundraising table so soon after its massive IPO raise?

It’s unclear what the answer is. According to ratings agency ICRA, Ola Electric has not even used all of the money from their initial public offering (IPO) as of March 2025.

For one, the company earned around INR 54 Cr in interest income in ten months, with over half of the INR 5,500 Cr obtained in the IPO remaining in bank accounts and fixed deposits.

Specifically, INR 1,200 Cr of the amount raised was to be used to increase Ola Electric’s battery cell production plant’s capacity from the 1.4GWh test capacity to 5GWh by February 2025. By April 2025, the company promised to further expand capacity to 6.4GWh.

The start of commercial production is delayed, according to ICRA. “Risks of timely execution of subsequent expansion phases, demand/offtake, supply chain, and technology obsolescence” still affect the project.

Ola Electric may be at risk from this. By the end of 2026, the company must raise its operational capacity to 20GWh under the production-linked incentive system for cell manufacturing. It might forfeit its portion of the INR 18,000 Cr PLI scheme if this doesn’t happen.

In addition, Bhavish Aggarwal made lofty statements in August of last year, just after the IPO, including the goal of constructing the largest 100 GWh gigafactory in the world in India. The business has had difficulty approaching even 5% of this figure thus far. Considering Ola Electric’s focus on owning the entire EV stack, this is without a doubt one of the company’s largest obstacles.

Since Ola Electric’s plans to boost its profit per unit sold depend on its in-house cells and batteries, scaling up cell and battery manufacturing is essential.

In light of all of this, ICRA reduced Ola Electric’s credit rating for short-term loans and bank guarantees from A (NEGATIVE) to BBB+ (NEGATIVE), which does raise investor risk, even for NCDs.",https://www.evmechanica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ola-Electric-Initiates-Another-Round-of-Fundraising.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 10:11:20.700038

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.
To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important.
That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.","The House of Representatives of the United States passed a bill last week, which advanced a sweeping spending package that would roll back Biden-era tax credits for renewable energy projects. They include an early phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles, moving up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well as requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028.

At the same time, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced on Saturday that it is working on a proposal to remove all existing restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants in the country.

The EPA was reported as arguing in its proposed regulation that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from power plants that burn fossil fuels ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution"" or to climate change because they are a small and declining share of global emissions.

It should be no surprise for the world what the Donald Trump administration will do on climate change since he signed an executive order for the US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on his first day in the White House on Jan 20, as he did during his first term.

""It is the policy of my administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in the development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American economy,"" said Trump's day-one executive order on global environmental deals.

As part of Trump's first day orders, the US also halted all financial contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, leaving the UN climate body with a 22 percent shortfall in its core budget. In 2024, US contributions totaled $13.3 million.

Washington has not only turned a blind eye to the international obligations it has because of the huge amount of CO2 it has contributed during its industrial development, it has now also started to encourage the use of coal and gas in generating electricity by scrapping the limits on gas emissions from such plants.

Furthermore, it is trying to make things hard for renewable energy power plants, and even starts to add annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners. The fee will be $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.

As one of the largest contributors of green house gas emissions and definitely the largest on a per capita basis, the US' withdrawal of its financial aid to emissions cutting projects will greatly compromise global climate actions. What the US government has done to roll back clean energy projects and encourage the use of fossil fuel in power generation represents a huge disservice to what the world has achieved in its fight against climate change.

""Interest of the US and American people first"" has become a pretext for the Trump administration to shirk its due international responsibility as the world's sole superpower. With ""make America great again"" as the guide for its policymaking, Trump's US has become an irresponsible superpower without a smattering of vision about the future of humanity.

Without making its due contribution to the global fight against climate change and to global endeavors to address other common challenges facing humanity, how can the Trump administration put the interests of the US and American people first?

The extreme climate conditions caused by climate change such as droughts and flooding will not exempt American people from their devastation, nor will environmental pollution.

To address common challenges such as climate change and ecological destruction, joint endeavors of all countries are important. This is common sense.

That explains why China has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative. China has also proposed the building of a community with a shared future for humanity, which is meant to mobilize global resources for addressing common challenges in order to make human development sustainable.

""Without sufficient home and public EV charging, we risk straining the grid and stalling progress.""","To meet rising EV adoption and future energy demands, the City of Frisco is calling for a rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure. These initiatives aim to future-proof Frisco's transportation network, support clean energy goals, and ensure reliable charging access for all residents--positioning the city as a regional leader in smart energy infrastructure.

As electric vehicle (EV) ownership surges and North Texas faces increasingly extreme weather conditions, the City of Frisco is officially calling for a city-wide energy infrastructure expansion. City leaders are urging public and private stakeholders to accelerate the deployment of home EV charging systems and backup power solutions, such as Generac generators, to protect homes, businesses, and critical services.

This initiative comes amid warnings that Frisco's current grid infrastructure is not prepared to handle projected energy demand, fueled by explosive population growth, rising EV adoption, and weather-related blackouts.

EV Charging: A Rapidly Growing Need

Frisco is experiencing one of the highest EV adoption rates in the state. However, the city lacks a coordinated plan to ensure every resident has convenient access to home and public charging infrastructure. With over 15,000 EVs now registered in Collin County and that number expected to triple by 2030, city officials say proactive planning is critical.

""Our residents want to embrace clean transportation, but they need the infrastructure to do it,"" said a Frisco Energy Task Force representative. ""Without sufficient home and public EV charging, we risk straining the grid and stalling progress.""

The city is encouraging:

Residential Installation of Level 2 EV Chargers

As EV adoption accelerates in Frisco, access to Level 2 residential chargers is becoming essential for daily convenience and grid efficiency. Level 2 chargers (240V) offer significantly faster charging than standard outlets, providing 25-40 miles of range per hour and enabling overnight full charges.

The City of Frisco encourages:

New construction mandates requiring EV charger-ready wiring in all single-family and multi-family developments

HOA policy revisions that prevent unreasonable restrictions on EV charger installation in townhomes and condos

Public-private partnerships with local electricians, such as ABR Electric, to offer installation packages that include permitting, code compliance, and homeowner training

Low-income support programs to help make residential EV charging more accessible to all residents

Incentives and Rebates for Homeowners and Developers

To promote faster adoption, the city is proposing a localized EV Charging Incentive Program to complement federal tax credits and utility rebates.

Proposed elements include:

Rebate vouchers of up to $1,000 for homeowners who install a Level 2 charger with a licensed contractor

Permit fee waivers for EV charger installations within city limits

Green building certification incentives for developers that pre-wire garages and parking spaces for future EV charging

Partnerships with local dealerships to bundle charger installations into EV purchases

Coordination with CoServ and Oncor to align residential incentives with regional grid needs and peak-load planning

Strategic Placement of Public Charging Stations

Public charging availability plays a key role in both equity and convenience, especially for apartment residents, renters, or commuters without private garages.

Frisco's proposed charging expansion plan recommends:

Installation of Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers at high-traffic public locations including:

City parks and recreation centers

Public libraries and civic buildings

Downtown parking areas and entertainment districts

School campuses, universities, and park-and-ride locations

Partnering with major retailers, malls, and grocery chains for semi-public charger hubs

Integrating chargers into future zoning and transportation planning for mixed-use developments

Deploying solar-powered charging stations in city parks to align with clean energy goals

Permitting Reform to Accelerate Charger Deployment

One of the primary bottlenecks in EV infrastructure development is the time and complexity of securing permits. The City of Frisco is actively exploring reforms to streamline this process for both homeowners and contractors.

Key initiatives under consideration include:

A ""Fast Track"" permit process for residential Level 2 EV charger installations under 80 amps

Pre-approved installation guidelines for electricians to speed up approval times

Same-day virtual inspections for simple installations to reduce wait times

An online portal allowing homeowners and contractors to apply, pay fees, and schedule inspections in one place

Backup Power: A Lifeline During Texas Weather Extremes

With Texas increasingly prone to extreme weather--like ice storms, tornadoes, and summer grid overloads--Frisco leaders are emphasizing the importance of automatic standby generators for residential and commercial properties.

""Backup power is no longer optional in Texas,"" said a spokesperson from ABR Electric, a Frisco-based licensed electrical contractor. ""We're seeing rising demand for Generac generator installations from homeowners who want peace of mind during outages.""

Key Facts:

Winter Storm Uri (2021) left millions without power for days

The 2024 heat wave triggered rolling blackouts across North Texas

Frisco's grid is already operating near capacity during peak months

ABR Electric and other local contractors are calling on the city to:

Streamline permitting for generator installations

Educate residents on backup power solutions

Incentivize energy resiliency upgrades in new construction

Powering Frisco's Future: Citywide Energy Action Plan Underway

In partnership with local experts, the City of Frisco is drafting a 2025 Energy Resiliency Plan, focusing on:

EV Infrastructure Expansion

Home & Business Generator Accessibility

Public-Private Energy Grid Modernization Task Force

Educational Campaigns for Energy-Savvy Living

""This is about future-proofing our community,"" said a city council member. ""We want Frisco to be a model city--powered, prepared, and progressive.""

Elliott, www.nytimes.com, rebecca-f-elliott",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/26/business/energy-environment/trump-tariffs-tax-batteries.html,"Tristan Doherty, chief product officer for LG Energy Solution’s U.S. energy storage unit, Vertech, compared tariffs to a drug that can be deadly at high concentrations.
They love oil, gas and critical minerals but have dim views of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy.
Around that time, the company now known as LG Energy Solution, one of the world’s biggest battery manufacturers, began making cells for cars in Holland.
Another company, AESC, also started making LFP batteries for storage systems this spring, in Tennessee.
During the recent tour of the LG factory, operators were adjusting a machine designed to wind giant sheets of aluminum foil, like thread around a bobbin.","The robots were doing practice runs.

It was the day before production was set to begin, and every few seconds, machines folded a stack of paper-thin battery cells into a metallic sheath. Then they sealed the pouch around the edges.

This tightly choreographed assembly line is the result of yearslong American efforts to match China’s industrial policy in areas like battery manufacturing. Ultimately, the batteries produced at this Michigan factory by LG Energy Solution, a South Korean company, will help balance the supply and demand for power on U.S. electric grids.

The silver-colored pouches — roughly the size of two computer keyboards set end to end — will be placed into large battery containers that can be more than 20 feet wide. In the last few years, electric utilities and other energy companies have begun spending billions of dollars to install scores of such big batteries around the country in parking lots, at old industrial sites and on what used to be farmland.

The batteries play an increasingly central role in the electricity business, especially in states like California and Texas, which have lots of solar and wind farms that produce energy at relatively low cost but only some of the time. The batteries serve as a sponge, soaking up energy when a lot of it is available and dispensing it when homes and businesses need it most.

But President Trump’s tariffs on China may knock this fledgling industry off course. Another threat is brewing in Congress, where House Republicans, with Mr. Trump’s blessing, have passed a budget bill that analysts say would drastically restrict access to subsidies for making and using rechargeable batteries.

Tristan Doherty, chief product officer for LG Energy Solution’s U.S. energy storage unit, Vertech, compared tariffs to a drug that can be deadly at high concentrations.

“The dose makes the poison, right?” Mr. Doherty said during a recent visit to the LG factory in Holland, Mich. “A little bit of tariff metered out on the right time scale, at the right level, can get us to a much better place. But too much too fast can kill us.”

What happens to the companies that make batteries and install them on American grids will affect how quickly the country is able to meet rising power demand and how much that energy will cost.

Without such batteries, utilities would have to invest a lot more in expensive power plants and transmission lines to be prepared for scorching summer afternoons or frigid winter mornings when power use soars. Such spending would drive up electricity prices significantly, energy experts say.

If the Republican budget bill took effect in its current form, it would be “something of a kill switch” for the tax credits available for making batteries, said Antoine Vagneur-Jones, an analyst at BloombergNEF. It also would quickly end tax credits for installing them on the grid.

Businesses are worried. Tesla, which sells energy storage systems in addition to cars, warned in April that the levies would have an “outsized” effect on its energy business, which relies on Chinese batteries. That was before Mr. Trump partly rolled back tariffs on China for 90 days.

This month, Fluence Energy, a company in Arlington, Va., that buys, packages and installs energy storage batteries, lowered its annual revenue forecast by around 20 percent, saying it was delaying projects and putting off new contracts because of unpredictable U.S. trade policy.

“It’s not the absolute price that’s so much the issue as it’s the uncertainty around where the price will be,” said John Zahurancik, the company’s president of the Americas.

Mr. Trump and his aides have expressed strong opinions about the energy sector. They love oil, gas and critical minerals but have dim views of electric vehicles and wind and solar energy. Batteries appear to occupy something of a middle ground.

Chris Wright, the energy secretary, seemed ambivalent about them in a March interview with The New York Times. “Batteries have a role. Solar is growing rapidly,” he said. “These are things of interest. I think we’re just a little bit more sober about it.”

Asked for comment for this article, the Trump administration did not directly address batteries but criticized wind and solar energy.

“The wind and solar industries in the United States have lived on more than three decades of subsidies,” an administration spokesman said. “Despite those subsidies, those energy sources still don’t come close to the affordability, reliability and security found in other sources of energy such as nuclear, coal and natural gas.”

The science behind LFP batteries was developed in the 1990s by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. But it was China that recognized the technology’s commercial promise. Most manufacturers in the United States make batteries with nickel and cobalt.

“For a long time, we were not paying too much attention here in the U.S.,” said Arumugam Manthiram, a University of Texas engineering professor whose research helped pave the way for LFP batteries.

One company, A123 Systems, briefly produced LFP batteries in the United States, only to file for bankruptcy protection in 2012. A Chinese automotive supplier eventually bought most of the company’s assets.

Around that time, the company now known as LG Energy Solution, one of the world’s biggest battery manufacturers, began making cells for cars in Holland. Its light gray factory is less than 10 miles from Lake Michigan.

LG had planned to expand the factory to supply Toyota’s vehicles. But electric vehicles are not taking off as quickly in the United States as many companies anticipated. Electricity demand, on the other hand, is rising rapidly. As a result, the company changed its expansion plan and outfitted a new wing of the factory for LFP production, a $1.4 billion undertaking.

When the new assembly lines are running at full tilt, they will make enough cells to satisfy more than a quarter of current U.S. demand for LFP batteries, according to data from LG and Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a research firm. The investment decision predated Mr. Trump’s trade policy announcements, Mr. Doherty said.

“There was already an understanding that the cost of importing cells from China was going to be going up,” he said, citing Biden-era tax and trade policy aimed at encouraging companies to buy U.S.-made batteries.

Another company, AESC, also started making LFP batteries for storage systems this spring, in Tennessee.

During the recent tour of the LG factory, operators were adjusting a machine designed to wind giant sheets of aluminum foil, like thread around a bobbin. The foil was coated on both sides in a thin layer of dark gray material containing iron and phosphate, the cathode. Machines would later press and slice that coated foil into strips to be paired with their other half, the anode.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/22/multimedia/22biz-tariffs-batteries-vbmj/22biz-tariffs-batteries-vbmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-26 09:14:21.922556

Why it matters: The move to remove California's authority to set vehicle-emissions rules will deprive the state of a major tool in its pollution-reduction toolbox. It also shows how far Republicans are willing to go to defy congressional norms in the name of overturning Democrats' climate policies.

What would the rules have done? The first of the three rules would have required automakers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles through 2035, when all new-car sales would have to be zero-emission. The other two would impose zero-emission sales targets for heavy-duty trucks and require them to reduce their nitrogen oxide emissions. Ten other states are signed on to follow California's car rules.

Partisan breakdown: The Senate's vote Thursday came after weeks of Republican deliberations over whether to flout the opinion of the Senate parliamentarian, who had said that federal approval of California's standards shouldn't be subject to the Congressional Review Act. In previous Republican administrations, the U.S. EPA had tried to revoke the rules administratively. One Democratic senator — Elissa Slotkin of Michigan — joined Republicans in the vote against the car standards, compared with dozens of Democrats in the House.

What's next? Trump is expected to sign the bills in the coming weeks. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said last week they'll sue once he does.

As the country seeks to meet its growing energy needs, it must also confront the challenges posed by climate change and the imperative for environmental sustainability.

The recently announced plans by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development to resume operations at the historic Kilembe Mines in western Uganda present a unique opportunity.

Kilembe Mines, once the backbone of Uganda’s copper and cobalt industry, has been dormant for over four decades. Its revival is now driven by the surging global demand for critical transition minerals like copper and cobalt, essential inputs for renewable technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicle batteries.

If responsibly harnessed, these minerals can support Uganda not only in global decarbonisation efforts but also in local energy security and resilience. However, despite these opportunities, the resumption of mining raises serious environmental and social concerns. Since the mine’s closure in 1982, many displaced individuals, including those affected by insurgencies and the expansion of Mount Rwenzori National Park resettled on the mine land.

These communities have lived there for over 40 years. According to Uganda’s Land Act (1998) and Constitution (1995), many qualify as bona fide occupants, entitled to secure tenure and protection from forced eviction.

Failure to recognise and compensate these residents through a transparent, participatory, free, prior, and informed consent could pose serious risks, triggering legal disputes.Furthermore, mining operations, if poorly managed, could exacerbate environmental degradation.

For instance, River Nyamwamba, already prone to destructive flooding, faces increased risks from potential disruption from the mining activity, which could also accelerate soil erosion, pollution, jeopardise biodiversity, and endanger the livelihoods of thousands. It is, therefore, very critical for the government and the mining company to take all necessary precautions and comprehensively assess the social, environmental, and economic impacts of resuming operations at Kilembe Mines.

This process must go beyond box-ticking exercises. A thorough, participatory Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) should be conducted as a genuine mechanism to safeguard public interest. Secondly, it is important to obtain Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from the surrounding communities.

This must be done through transparent, inclusive, and culturally appropriate consultations, free from coercion, intimidation, or undue pressure. Communities must be meaningfully engaged, empowered with accurate information, and given the opportunity to accept or reject the project based on a clear understanding of its potential risks and benefits.

Third, the government and mining company must ensure robust mechanisms for transparency, accountability, and equitable benefit-sharing, while prioritising local value addition over the export of raw materials in crude form.

The extraction of critical minerals like copper and cobalt should not follow the historical pattern of exporting unprocessed ores, which deprives Uganda of job opportunities and industrial growth. It is through such a comprehensive and inclusive approach that reopening of Kilembe Mines catalyse broad-based development while advancing Uganda’s clean energy transition in a just and sustainable manner.

The sight of empty electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) in Philippine shopping malls and commercial buildings is now a thing of the past. When once upon a time nobody took much notice of these seemingly innocuous small public setups, EV owners today line up from early morning at free charging stations as the Philippine EV industry finally sees long-awaited record growth.

From sales of only 214 units in 2019, 378 units in 2020 and 843 units in 2021, EV sales surged to 3,091 units in 2022, 10,602 units in 2023 and 18,690 units in 2024 – which is about time, given that a Philippine Congress study in 2024 found that Metro Manila has the worst traffic congestion among metro areas in the world.

Out of 387 cities across 55 countries, the congested capital also registered the longest average travel time for a 10-kilometre route at just over 25 minutes.

Addressing challenges

The current transportation model in the Philippines heavily relies on fossil fuel-based combustion engines. The transportation sector is the largest source of air pollution and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 34% of the total, with road transport contributing to 80%. Some 74% of air pollutants come from cars, motorcycles, trucks and buses.

Aside from pollution, the price volatility of oil products and heavy dependence on imported fuel pose a challenge to energy security and independence.

To address these challenges and push for sustainability in the transport sector, Republic Act No.11697 – or the Electric Vehicle Industry Development Act (EVIDA) – was passed into law in 2022, followed by an executive order that modified rates of import duty on electric vehicles, parts and components. In 2024, the government expanded this executive order to eliminate tariffs on EVs and their components for five years.

The Comprehensive Roadmap for Electric Vehicle Industry (CREVI) has since set targets and strategies for high-level government action plans to develop the EV industry.

The CREVI has four components: (1) EV and EVCS; (2) manufacturing; (3) human resource development; and (4) research and development.

The Department of Energy (DOE) has issued EVCS policy guidelines to promote adoption of EVs by developing a robust charging infrastructure. The CREVI has attracted investments in EV assembly, including strategic parts and components such as charging stations, automotive electronics, battery manufacturing and mineral processing.

Looking ahead

The CREVI has set targets for the year 2040 intro three sections: short-term, medium-term and long-term. By 2040, on a business-as-usual basis, the government hopes for at least 2.5 million EVs and 20,400 EVCS.

As of April 2025, the government has recognised and accredited 687 battery electric vehicles, 55 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, 88 hybrid electric vehicles, and 80 light electric vehicles.

Among suppliers, China’s BYD brand has so far captured a remarkable 69% market share in the battery EV segment, and 82% of the new energy vehicle market. With its comparatively low prices, BYD is the leading player.

Government initiatives to promote EVs such as the public utility vehicle modernisation programme and the DOE electric tricycle project have meanwhile been successful in increasing the number of electric jeepneys and tricycles on the road.

Collaboration between government agencies, Manila Electric Company and city governments for the “e-Sakay” route and a trial of electric jeepneys in Iloilo City are also positive developments.

Private companies such as DHL Express Philippines and Mober are also re-fleeting with EVs. DHL Express has expanded its EV fleet with13 e-UVs and five e-MCs, which can travel up to 250km and 140km, respectively, on one charge. Meanwhile Mober, Ikea’s delivery partner in the Philippines, has introduced 10 electric vans and two electric trucks, setting the pace for other companies to set their own green goals in transportation.

Takeaway

As the EV industry continues to surge, the government must improve the infrastructure required – including more charging stations nationwide – and expand local EV manufacturing and assembly capabilities to accelerate adoption.

To drive momentum, fiscal incentives and other support mechanisms must also be enhanced.

These efforts will hopefully contribute to creating more jobs, generating export revenues and transitioning to sustainable, clean transportation – perhaps making the Philippines a hub for green technology in mobility.

How do energy and policy work together to support economic development in Michigan?
DAMOOSE: Frankly, you can’t attract economic development to Michigan if you don’t have enough power to run factories and corporations.
About the authors Charles Marshall, President, ITC Michigan Charles Marshall is Vice President, ITC Holdings Corp., and President, ITC Michigan.
About ITC ITC Michigan is composed of two operating companies: ITCTransmission and Michigan Electric Transmission Company (METC).","Michigan’s economic stability demands a reliable energy infrastructure, and industry leaders and policymakers are working together to unlock a more resilient energy future. Crain’s Content Studio recently spoke with Charles Marshall, president of ITC Michigan, and Senator John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) about their shared vision to fuel Michigan’s economic prosperity.

What are the biggest energy challenges facing Michigan?

MARSHALL: The electricity generation market is rapidly changing as legacy dispatchable resources are nearing the end of their useful life and retiring. With these retirements, we need access to new generation to fill the vacancies created. Wind and solar play a critical role and may become the most economic solution, but our state also needs access to dispatchable generation more than ever.

We're seeing increased demand on our system with changes like electrification and data centers needing large amounts of power. Also, we're experiencing challenges with severe weather, such as the northern Michigan ice storm earlier this spring that caused significant damage to our power grid. However, the portions of our grid that we upgraded and invested in, withstood the storm.

In support of these changes and challenges, ITC is currently developing electric transmission solutions that will provide Michigan greater access to generation resources across our state and the Midwest to keep our lights on.

SEN. DAMOOSE: A lot of people are concerned with the clean energy legislation package that passed in 2023. We all want clean energy, but the pace of these policies needs to be reconsidered.

We’d all love to see more renewable energy, but frankly, solar doesn’t work well in Northern Michigan in the winter, which is a concern. I don’t want to see farmland plowed up for solar fields when we aren’t sure how productive they are. While the goals of these regulations may be honorable, it was way too far, way too fast.

Chuck mentioned the ice storm and my constituents were at the epicenter of the damage. Continued investment in our power grid is critical to sustain our way of life.

What policies, or lack thereof, are threatening Michigan’s energy security?

DAMOOSE: A problem we’ve seen across every industry, not just the energy industry, is that Michigan has very little consistency in how we formulate policy. ITC gave a presentation to our energy committee about the massive effort, expense and time that go into building our power grid. They’re looking 10 to 15 years out, and they need the assurance that we’re going to stick with a policy to make long-term plans and investments.

By working together collaboratively, we’re keeping power flowing to provide the residents, businesses and industries in Michigan with the most cost-effective and reliable electric transmission services and access to the lowest-cost energy.”

- Charles Marshall, President, ITC Michigan

MARSHALL: As we develop future plans for our transmission grid, we need a stable vision of our future. If the policy creates instability that makes it very difficult for us to develop rightsized system solutions. The biggest threat is shortsighted solutions and delays in implementation. Policy barriers in developing and building this critical infrastructure threaten the reliability of our grid. In many instances the construction takes 12 to 18 months while the remaining 80 percent of project development is the pre-construction work, such as securing real estate and permitting. Michigan has an opportunity to take a step forward by removing barriers that slow down the development of critical infrastructure.

What steps are you taking to stabilize the state’s energy grid?

MARSHALL: ITC has been diligently investing in Michigan’s transmission system over the last 22 years. We’ve invested in our grid, and now it’s performing among the best in the country; but with our rapidly changing energy landscape we’re still not where we need to be. ITC has partnered with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) to develop a Long Range Transmission Plan (LRTP). The first stage, Tranche 1, is focused on shoring up the existing system and was approved in July 2022 to deploy $10 billion of transmission infrastructure across the Midwest including $850 million of Michigan investment. Tranche 1 reinforced our current grid and paved the way for the needed regional backbone infrastructure that would become Tranche 2.1. Approved in December 2024, Tranche 2.1 introduces a new voltage of 765 kV to eastern Michigan, dramatically increases our access to generation resources across the Midwest and develops transmission infrastructure to support our energy future.

DAMOOSE: From a policy standpoint, we need to commit long-term, be willing to spend the money, streamline the permitting process, and commit to providing adequate power for our people and corporations.

I’m working across the aisle with Senator Mallory McMorrow to develop a framework for a long-term economic development strategy for the state. Energy is going to be a big part of it. If we are going to bring in big industries, we need to be able to provide significantly more power than we do right now.

How do energy and policy work together to support economic development in Michigan?

DAMOOSE: Frankly, you can’t attract economic development to Michigan if you don’t have enough power to run factories and corporations. If we want to have a viable economy, we need to be willing to invest in our energy infrastructure.

MARSHALL: If you’re an outside industry looking to make Michigan your home, you want to know how quickly you can get your facility online, and whether you have reliable infrastructure—not just the electric transmission system, but roads, gas, rail, etc. That’s why these LRTP projects are so important, because the value stream associated with these investments is going to live on for decades and attract economic growth.

What else do Michiganders need to know about the current state of the energy grid?

MARSHALL: As mentioned, we are prudently investing in Michigan’s transmission system. By working together collaboratively, we’re keeping power flowing to provide the residents, businesses and industries in Michigan with the most cost-effective and reliable transmission services and access to the lowest-cost energy.

DAMOOSE: We need to be practical. It’s expensive and time-consuming to do anything in this industry, so we have to be willing to make the investment. Remember, we’re not doing it for ourselves; we’re doing it for our children and our children’s children to keep Michigan economically viable.

In today’s rapidly evolving world, energy demand is growing at an unprecedented rate. This is driven by advances in artificial intelligence, the continued expansion of data centers, and the resurgence of manufacturing across industries. Keeping pace with these demands—and doing so with an energy mix that is reliable, secure, and affordable—requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both traditional and renewable energy sources. The solution isn’t one-dimensional; it’s multifaceted.

The bottom line? There’s no single energy solution

The reality of energy demand is staggering. Data center energy requirements are set to surpass 1,000 TWh by next year. This is a load growth that has tripled in the past decade, with projections to double or even triple again in just the next three years. Semiconductor factories now consume as much energy as an entire town, and global manufacturing capital expenditures are expected to increase by more than 5%.

Meanwhile, emerging economies are continuing to grow, and they’re contributing to about 85% of the additional global energy demand.

“It’s our long-held view that growing energy demand fundamentals mean that all forms of energy are going to be needed for decades to come,” says Ebel. “Enbridge’s diversified business mix is ideally positioned to meet this growing demand in oil and natural gas, lower-carbon opportunities, and renewable power.”

Enbridge’s role in Michigan’s energy future

Every day, Michiganders depend on secure, reliable energy to heat their homes, fuel businesses, and power industries. Enbridge proudly helps deliver 55% of the propane used in Michigan. We remain committed to modernizing our energy infrastructure and further protecting the Straits of Mackinac crossing.

With this tunnel, we’re further safeguarding one of the most critical energy infrastructure projects in the state, while continuing to support Michigan’s growing economy.

A balanced energy mix for a secure future

Combined, oil and natural gas are expected to make up nearly 50% of the global energy mix over the next 25 years. In the U.S., demand for natural gas alone is expected to rise by double digits through 2040. This growth is driven by natural gas’s critical role in electricity generation, industrial use, and its ability to provide affordable heating for homes and businesses.

Natural gas is a safe, reliable, and affordable energy source that helps meet the needs of industries from manufacturing to chemicals, steel, and cement. North America’s abundant natural gas supply not only supports local energy needs but also helps replace higher-emission coal, improving air quality and contributing to our climate goals.

Furthermore, natural gas is also a vital enabler of electrification, the process of transitioning from fossil fuel-powered technologies to electricity-driven alternatives. It’s the second-largest source of electricity generation globally, contributing to 20% of global electricity. And it complements renewable power generation, providing stability and reliability when solar and wind resources are unavailable, ensuring energy security even during times of low renewables output.

Investing in Michigan's energy future

To continue meeting growing energy demand, we must invest in all forms of energy. This includes investing in oil, natural gas, renewables, and lower-carbon opportunities.

Toyota is finally playing catch-up in the EV world

After lagging other car manufacturers in bringing EVs to market, Toyota recently announced a completely overhauled version of its original crossover EV, the bZ4X, called the bZ.

Plus, the Japanese juggernaut also announced production of a smaller, sportier crossover, the CH-R, due to go on sale next year. The company says the vehicle will feature 338 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and a solid 290-mile range.

Tesla is in legal turmoil over its 'Robotaxis'

The legal battle to trademark terms is heating up fast in the world of self-driving taxis — and Tesla is on the losing end.

The company's attempt to trademark the term ""Robotaxi"" was recently rejected for being too generic, while its applications for the term ""Cybercab"" were stalled after other companies applied for similar trademarks. The company's ""Robobus"" trademark application is still being considered, though.

The end of the EV tax credit could cause a boom in sales

That $7,500 credit you get when you buy a new EV is about to be history, if the newly proposed federal budget gets approved.

According to Car and Driver, ""The budget would completely kill the tax credit after 2026. However, models from automakers such as GM and Tesla, which have sold more than 200,000 EVs, won't be eligible for the credit after December 31, 2025.""

The proposed bill would also do away with tax credits for used EVs, which are currently as much as $4,000. If the cuts are approved, it will likely cause a rush by consumers to buy or rent before the tax benefits go away — the boom before the bust.

Research shows that Americans still want to buy EVs

According to the J.D. Power Electric Vehicle Consideration Study recently released, 24% of U.S. buyers are ""very likely"" to buy an EV, while 35% are ""somewhat likely"" — both figures remaining basically the same as last year, despite the fluctuating news about electric alternatives.

In accordance with the latest Govt Resolution (GR) issued on the Electric Vehicle Policy 2025, the state on Friday announced plans to encourage the establishment of adequate recycling centres for electric vehicle batteries while simultaneously promoting the production of new batteries and electric vehicles in Maharashtra.

The GR specifies that special emphasis will be placed on the collection of used electric vehicle batteries from charging stations, battery swapping centres, authorised dealers, and similar facilities. Potential locations identified for these recycling centres include the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Nagpur, and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar.

Directions contained in the GR, under the aegis of the urban development department, advise local municipal bodies to designate convenient locations within their jurisdiction for the collection of used electric vehicle batteries. These may consist of charging stations, battery swapping centres, authorised dealers, and service centres. They are also advised to identify and reserve areas near solid waste processing and disposal centres for the development of battery segregation and disposal facilities. Collaboration with nearby recycling facilities is encouraged to guarantee the safe collection, segregation, and reuse of electric vehicle batteries.

The new policy sets out that the govt aims to attract investors for building a strong system for electric vehicle production in Maharashtra. Industries ranging from large to micro enterprises that establish manufacturing units for electric vehicles, their batteries, and other components will be eligible for various incentives. The GR states these benefits will be managed by the industry department, which will issue the necessary guidelines.

Further, the policy mandates that all new residential buildings in Mumbai and throughout the state must designate a dedicated charging hub for collective electric vehicle charging. This provision requires the approval of at least 50per cent of the members of the housing society and adherence to all safety and operational standards, with space set aside for shared electric vehicle charging. Likewise, at least 50per cent of parking spaces in all new commercial developments are to be made suitable for electric vehicle charging, with the infrastructure for future charging points to be installed as per the GR.

Transport Minister Pratap Sarnaik stated that the govt would be requesting municipal corporations in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, and other parts of Maharashtra to earmark 1per cent of their budget for the creation of EV infrastructure. He added that petrol pumps in city areas would be required to implement mandatory 5 EV charging points rather than merely departmental stores, cautioning that a robust charging infrastructure is necessary for the success of any state govt EV policy.

The policy further targets 30per cent of new vehicle registrations to be electric vehicles in the coming years, with specific targets of 40per cent for two and three wheelers, 30per cent for cars/SUVs, 50per cent for aggregator cabs like Ola and Uber, and 15per cent for private buses. A senior official asserted that by 2030, the aim is to reduce 325 tons of PM 2.5 emissions and 1 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector in Maharashtra.
