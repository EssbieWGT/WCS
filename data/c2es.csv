By Pihu Yadav

Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Saturday blasted the Senate’s latest draft of a sweeping budget bill, calling it “utterly insane and destructive” for slashing clean energy incentives and introducing new taxes that could hamper the growth of wind and solar energy projects in the US.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,” Musk posted on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter). “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

The criticism comes as renewable energy advocates raise alarm over last-minute changes to the Senate’s budget megabill—expected to go to a vote as early as Saturday—that they say would amount to a de facto repeal of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the 2005 Production Tax Credit and expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

According to a summary of the draft legislation, the bill would eliminate the use of IRA tax credits for wind and solar projects that haven’t started construction yet—unless they are completed by the end of 2027 and meet complex new requirements proving that no Chinese components were used. Projects failing to do so would be subject to a new tax—effectively the first federal tax penalty on renewable energy development.

Simultaneously, the bill introduces fresh tax breaks for coal production and accelerates the phase-out of clean energy manufacturing credits, a move that could upend billions of dollars in investment and jobs tied to the sector, particularly in Republican-led states.

Jesse Jenkins, a Princeton University energy policy researcher, flagged the implications on X, saying the bill “raises taxes on all wind and solar projects” unless they meet the stringent timeline and sourcing criteria—conditions he deemed “likely unworkable.”

Environmental groups and clean energy industry leaders have condemned the draft, warning it will raise household energy costs, derail US climate goals, and slow the expansion of power infrastructure just as demand spikes due to AI-driven data center growth.

SAFE, an energy security nonprofit, warned the bill could cede ground to China—already a dominant force in clean energy and AI—by cutting off critical financing for energy storage, mineral processing, and grid expansion.

“Where the original Senate version was a recipe for energy stagnation, this is outright energy surrender,” Reuters quoted Avery Ash, SAFE’s head of government affairs, as saying.

On the other side, fossil fuel proponents welcomed the changes. Former President Donald Trump, speaking Friday evening, called for an end to renewable subsidies, while Tom Pyle of the American Energy Alliance said, “If repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place.”

Environmental Bills Highlight Tensions Within Legislatures,Not Available,,,,,https://www.governing.com/politics/n-y-environmental-bills-highlight-tensions-within-legislatures,"Tensions are still simmering among state lawmakers and advocates after the Assembly closed its 2025 session last week without passing any of this year’s flagship climate and environmental bills.
Each measure had passed the Senate, and an Assembly vote was the final hurdle.
Three of the bills passed the Senate by a four-to-one margin, with bipartisan support; the testing bill passed unanimously.

The bill passed the Senate unanimously in January and the Assembly at the end of March, with only one no vote.","Tensions are still simmering among state lawmakers and advocates after the Assembly closed its 2025 session last week without passing any of this year’s flagship climate and environmental bills.

Legislators shelved measures to cut packaging waste, transition homes off fossil fuels, and ban toxic “forever chemicals” from everyday products. Each measure had passed the Senate, and an Assembly vote was the final hurdle. But most of them never came to a vote.

A fierce blame game has ensued. Since last week, advocates backing those bills have slammed the Assembly and particularly Speaker Carl Heastie, the chamber’s top Democrat, who has the final say over which bills come to a floor vote. Heastie has shot back, accusing his critics of “lazy advocacy” that failed to gain the support needed for their bills. Meanwhile, some assemblymembers have pointed to structural issues in the chamber, which has more members and longer debates than the Senate, but the same tight calendar.

This is hardly the first year that climate groups have faulted the Assembly speaker for holding up climate action. But this year some of the anger is coming from groups that have not criticized the speaker publicly in the past.

“The speaker does not seem to be as environmentally conscious as he should be, and certainly his level of environmental awareness is not reflective of the public support for these issues we work on,” said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Long Island–based Citizens Campaign for the Environment. “What we don’t want to do is establish a pattern where the Assembly is where all good environmental bills go to die.”

“I’ve been very consistent in my 11 sessions,” Heastie told New York Focus in an interview Monday. “I do not bring bills to the floor that don’t have enough Assembly Democratic votes, and maybe a little cushion, because to see a bill come to the floor and potentially have some strain in passing — that’s just never something I’ve done.”

“I don’t force members to vote on bills,” he continued. “I’m a consensus builder.”

Easily Passed the Senate

Some of the bills on environmentalists’ roster this year passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support, and advocates expected the same would be true in the Assembly.

Among them was a suite of bills to limit the use of PFAS “forever” chemicals, which have been linked to health issues ranging from reduced immune function to hormone disruption to cancer.

One of the measures would have banned PFAS from beauty products; another from a variety of consumer goods, including cookware; a third would have blocked sewage sludge, which often contains the chemicals, from being spread on farmland; and a fourth would have required certain facilities to step up PFAS testing for water that they discharge into the environment.

Three of the bills passed the Senate by a four-to-one margin, with bipartisan support; the testing bill passed unanimously. Each had Republican support in the Assembly, too. But none reached the Assembly floor.

The only PFAS bill to pass the full legislature this year was one banning the chemicals and other toxic substances in menstrual products. The bill passed the Senate unanimously in January and the Assembly at the end of March, with only one no vote.

Kate Donovan, northeast director of environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council — one of the most prominent environmental groups in the country — said that Assembly leadership showed a “lack of compassion” when it failed to advance the other PFAS bills after they passed the Senate twice in a row.

“Ultimately, the speaker is in control of what comes to the floor,” she said. “Last year, we kind of chalked it up to the congestion pricing debacle [and] inability for the Assembly to manage their time towards the end of session because of a late budget. But I think this year, it became more obvious that we have a more political, structural problem.”

Climate groups, for their part, left Albany this June with just one notable win: a measure requiring building owners, rather than utility customers in general, to cover the cost of connecting new buildings to the gas system. Even that bill represented only a small fraction of what they had hoped to achieve — a sweeping proposal known as the NY HEAT Act, which charted a path off fossil fuels for New York’s millions of existing homes.

The Senate passed the full HEAT Act in 2023 and 2024, and getting the bill to the finish line was a top priority for climate groups this year. In the final days of session, the Senate rushed to pass a compromise measure that was designed specifically to mollify critics in the Assembly. But the Assembly did not take up the full compromise, instead passing only the one key provision — a repeal of the so-called “100-foot rule” — that had been carved out into a backup bill.

Backers of the HEAT Act cheered the final result, which had eluded them for years and achieved at least one of the headline goals of the wider legislation.

The activists who fought for the plastic packaging legislation, meanwhile, are still fuming.

Monique Fitzgerald, a co-founder of the Brookhaven Landfill Action and Remediation Group — a group fighting to close a landfill in a predominantly Black and Latino Long Island town — said it was “shameful” that lawmakers had bought into industry claims about the costs of adopting the law, “instead of listening to community members talking about their real life concerns, their real life health being put at risk.”

She called Heastie’s grip on floor votes “a barrier to democracy.”

“There’s no reason to shield people from accountability with their constituents,” she said. “If they were going to vote no, then let’s see it.”

Heastie, who said he supported the bill, is firing back.

“What legislative body just throws a bill out on the floor and hopes that it gets passed?” he asked New York Focus. “They don’t do it in Congress. They don’t do it in the state Senate. They don’t do it in City Council. And I’m being asked to just throw bills out on the floor and hope they pass?” (Votes do routinely fall short in Congress, though more often on procedural motions and amendments than on full bills.)

How Do You Explain PFAS?

Esposito said she understood Heastie’s reticence with close votes. But the failure of the PFAS legislation, which appeared widely popular in the Assembly, suggested a different problem, she said.

“There’s no reason it didn’t come to the floor, except the speaker prevented it from coming to the floor,” she argued. “Environmental bills … get left to the last day, and then the Assembly claims to run out of time, when, if the bills had been a priority in the first place, they would have passed.”

Esposito said she could see only one good explanation for the Assembly’s limited progress on environmental issues this year: the historic sums that business interests spent lobbying against the legislation, in particular the packaging bill.

“It’s a classic case of the corporate interests being given a higher value by elected officials than the public interest,” she said. “And that is a pretty tragic statement.”

Within the chamber, reactions have been more mixed.

Assemblymember Phara Souffrant Forrest, a strong supporter of the plastic packaging bill, argued that Heastie and his team are very effective at whipping votes when they choose to.

“Literally, a vote is on the floor, I have put down ‘no,’ and then they call you into the office and basically strong-arm you into putting a yes on that board,” she said. “They didn’t do that in this case.” (Heastie said he only whips votes for the budget, which the state is constitutionally mandated to pass.)

Other champions of the plastics bill were less quick to blame Heastie for its failure.

“I think my frustration is broader,” said Assemblymember Deborah Glick, the bill’s sponsor. She said that some of her colleagues told her they would vote for her bill, but appear to have told Heastie’s team otherwise: “I certainly think that members need to be honest with each other.”

Moreover, she said, “it is a major disappointment that so many people were susceptible to corporate misinformation.”

Time Constraints

Assemblymembers also highlighted structural differences between their chamber and the Senate. For the last 15 years, the Senate has consistently passed hundreds more bills than the Assembly; this year, 1743 passed the upper house, compared to 995 in the “People’s House” — one of the biggest gaps in recent history, according to a review by the advocacy group NYPIRG.

Among the reasons why: The Assembly is more than three times the size of the Senate, and members bring a more diverse range of priorities. Debates often last longer in the chamber, with Republicans sometimes pushing debates up to the four-hour limit — as they threatened to do with the packaging bill.

“That means that if the Republicans want to debate three bills in a day, that’s 12 hours, if they want to debate the full time,” said Assemblymember Sarahana Shrestha. “And we had long debates on so many bills that are not worth long debates at this point. … So this sense of time being against us is real.”

Heastie blamed those time constraints for the failure of the PFAS legislation, among others.

The crunch was particularly severe this year, after state leaders finalized the state budget more than five weeks past the deadline.

One assemblymember, who requested anonymity to discuss the chamber’s internal workings, noted that the legislature rarely takes up controversial bills while the budget is still being negotiated, in part because of staffing constraints. The Assembly’s central staff work hard to prepare members for debates, but generally can’t while they’re still tied up with the budget, the lawmaker said. That leaves all the big-ticket, non-budget items to the final weeks of session.

Shrestha said that the demands of the electoral calendar are also a factor in blocking important bills. Albany’s two-year terms require lawmakers to juggle campaigning with legislating for the bulk of their time in office, she said, “and that is really bad for democracy.”

“A lot of decisions that politicians make come from fear of losing their election, which … is obviously very self-destructive for the mandates that we are responsible for,” Shrestha said.

Shrestha noted that climate and environmental bills can be especially challenging to pass, because lawmakers are often less familiar with them than they are with other issues, giving industry lobbyists a greater opportunity to shape the debate. And there were added hurdles this year, with Albany scrambling to respond to the chaos coming from Washington as well as to a crisis in state prisons.

Should Have Been Banner Year

For many in the climate and environmental world, President Donald Trump’s onslaught of cuts and policy rollbacks have only made it more urgent for New York to lead.

“This should have been a breakthrough year for environmental action in New York,” said Vanessa Fajans-Turner, executive director of Environmental Advocates NY, in a statement last week. “The Senate did its part… But the Assembly? Once again, it left the job unfinished,” she continued, calling the end result a “dereliction of duty.”

Heastie bristles at the sentiment.

“Look at everything that we have done,” he said, pointing to the state’s 2019 climate law, the 2022 Environmental Bond Act, the Build Public Renewables Act, funding for electric buses, and last year’s Climate Superfund. “People can’t just say, if we didn’t do what they want this year — you can’t erase everything else that we’ve done.”

But the latest version of the Senate bill would go much further.
Even some of those who lobbied to end federal support for clean energy said the Senate bill went too far.
For utilities and tech companies, adding solar, wind and batteries has often been one of the easiest ways to help meet soaring electricity demand.
And the bill would impose new restrictions on tax breaks for factories that manufacture wind turbines, solar panels and batteries.","WASHINGTON – Senate Republicans have quietly inserted provisions in President Donald Trump’s domestic policy bill that would not only end federal support for wind and solar energy but would impose an entirely new tax on future projects, a move that industry groups say could devastate the renewable power industry.

The tax provision, tucked inside the 940-page bill that the Senate made public just into Saturday, stunned observers.

“This is how you kill an industry,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders and investors. “And at a time when electricity prices and demand are soaring.”

The bill would rapidly phase out existing federal tax subsidies for wind and solar power by 2027. Doing so, many companies say, could derail hundreds of projects under development and could jeopardize billions of dollars in manufacturing facilities that had been planned around the country with the subsidies in mind.

Those tax credits were at the heart of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022 in an attempt to nudge the country away from fossil fuels, the burning of which is driving climate change. Trump, who has mocked climate science, has instead promoted fossil fuels and demanded that Republicans in Congress unwind the law.

But the latest version of the Senate bill would go much further. It would impose a steep penalty on all new wind and solar farms that come online after 2027 – even if they didn’t receive federal subsidies – unless they follow complicated and potentially unworkable requirements to disentangle their supply chains from China. Since China dominates global supply chains, that measure could affect a large number of companies.

“It came as a complete shock,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers. Soon after the Senate bill was made public, Grumet said phones started ringing at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday with “everyone saying, ‘Can you believe this?’”

The new tax “is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,” Grumet said.

Even some of those who lobbied to end federal support for clean energy said the Senate bill went too far.

“I strongly recommend fully desubsidizing solar and wind vs. placing a kind of new tax on them,” wrote Alex Epstein, an influential activist who has been urging Republican senators to eliminate renewable energy subsidies. “I just learned about the excise tax and it’s definitely not something I would support.”

Wind and solar projects are the fastest growing new source of electricity in the United States and account for nearly two-thirds of new electric capacity expected to come online this year. For utilities and tech companies, adding solar, wind and batteries has often been one of the easiest ways to help meet soaring electricity demand. Other technologies such as new nuclear reactors can take much longer to build, and there is a multiyear backlog for new natural gas turbines.

The repeal of federal subsidies alone could cause wind and solar installations to plummet by as much as 72% over the next decade, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. The new tax could depress deployment even further by raising costs an additional 10% to 20%, the group estimated.

The Senate bill, which is being debated Sunday, would also eliminate federal tax credits this year for consumers to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels and heat pumps in their homes. And the bill would impose new restrictions on tax breaks for factories that manufacture wind turbines, solar panels and batteries.

In a statement, the White House praised the Senate legislation for “eliminating wasteful environmental policies” and said that “failure to pass the bill would be the ultimate betrayal.” On June 21, Trump wrote that green tax credits are “a giant SCAM” and should be eliminated, referring to wind turbines “and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Some conservatives voiced support for the bill. If “repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative research group that supports fossil fuels. “Extending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful.”

The latest draft of the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for sources of emissions-free electricity that can run at all hours – such as nuclear reactors, geothermal plants, hydroelectric dams and industrial-scale batteries – through 2036. The bill would also expand tax breaks for biofuels and would enlarge subsidies for companies that capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks and use it to extract oil from underground.

But wind and solar power do not fare well. Projects would only qualify for a federal tax credit worth at least 30% of project costs if they finish construction by the end of 2027. Developers say that deadline could be difficult to meet, even for projects that are already underway, since companies often face delays in obtaining government permits or other obstacles beyond their control.

The bill also creates a complex set of rules requiring developers to prove that they are not using components that can trace back to China or other “prohibited foreign entities.” And, starting in 2027, the bill would impose new excise taxes on companies that fail to meet those requirements, even if they are no longer receiving federal subsidies.

Renewable energy companies say that they have been shifting away from Chinese components and toward using domestically made parts, but that the new restrictions are so opaque that it could be tough for many businesses to prove they are in compliance.

The pair then spent a day flinging personal attacks and criticisms at each other on social media.

The GOP legislation would renew expiring tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay. It would also boost spending on defense and immigration enforcement. It is partly paid for by slashing safety net programs like Medicaid and green energy tax credits.

The bill's treatment of clean energy programs is the magnet attracting Musk's criticism. A newer version of the bill released early Saturday would gut incentives for solar and wind projects and impose a new tax on existing wind and solar farms if they rely on foreign materials. It aligns closer to the original House GOP version which was more drastic and punitive towards the renewable energy sector.

""They’re proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries,” Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Saturday statement. Some industry observers had hoped the Senate would temper the House GOP's fervor against renewables. The bill might still change at the 11th hour to sway Republican holdouts in the Senate and House as it nears final passage in the upper chamber.

Some business groups criticized the late revisions as well, arguing it would spike electricity prices. ""Taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables,"" Neal Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on X. ""Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.""

Senate Republicans are in the middle of muscling through their bill over united Democratic opposition. On Saturday, the legislation cleared a key test vote that ended with only two GOP defections: Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/Elon%20Musk%20in%20White%20House,%20DOGE.jpg",N,,2025-06-30 01:02:05.179926

As Terry L. Jones explains in a piece for Floodlight, “When completed, Whisper Valley will consist of approximately 7,500 owner-occupied and rental homes and multi-family units ranging in price from $350,000 to $750,000; three schools, 2 million square feet of commercial space and 700 acres of park and outdoor community spaces.” The community is also slated to include affordable housing built by Habitat for Humanity.

Residents who already live in the completed parts of the community say they have seen major cost savings on their heating and cooling bills. “The developer calls geothermal a “common sense” way to preserve the planet by cutting the use of fossil fuels to power the homes and businesses here.”

Not every developer building homes in Whisper Valley is using the geothermal HVAC system due to the high up-front cost of installing heat pumps, which runs roughly $40,000 per home. Although geothermal cooling has been around for centuries in one form or another, modern heat pumps have higher costs than some solar or wind infrastructure.

However, like with all new technology, costs will come down as more geothermal projects are implemented, experts say.

The plant’s conversion aligns with global trends, as automakers like Mercedes-Benz invest heavily in EV supply chains.
However, the Trump administration’s review of Energy Department programs, aimed at aligning with “American Energy Dominance,” could delay or derail such transitions.
Looking Ahead Mace’s push for the $285 million grant highlights the complex interplay of politics, economics, and clean energy.
For South Carolina’s EV sector, the funding could reportedly cement the state’s role in producing next-generation vehicles, supporting 800 workers and regional growth.","In a move highlighting the tension between Republican fiscal priorities and local economic benefits, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) has privately urged the Trump administration to release $285 million in federal funding for a Mercedes-Benz Vans plant northwest of Charleston to shift to electric vehicle (EV) production.

The funds, part of a $1.8 billion grant program under the Biden administration’s 2022 climate legislation, aim to support at-risk auto plants transitioning to EV manufacturing, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Economic Stakes for South Carolina

Mace’s letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright emphasizes the economic upside of the grant, which would enable Mercedes-Benz to produce a light-duty electric van prototype at its North Charleston facility. The project is expected to create 800 jobs and draw additional investment to the region.

“We believe that federal investments should continue to prioritize projects with sustained economic growth,” Mace wrote, noting the plant’s role in ensuring “America-made options remain available in the commercial vehicle sector.”

The Charleston-area plant, located in Mace’s district, underscores the local significance of the funding. The $285 million grant is seen as a lifeline for autoworkers and a boost for South Carolina’s economy, with Sydney Long, Mace’s spokeswoman, calling it a “major opportunity” for the state.

Long added, “Congresswoman Mace has repeatedly stated South Carolina’s tax dollars matter just as much as anyone else’s.”

Tensions in Republican Policy

The request comes as the Trump administration seeks to freeze or repeal funding tied to Biden’s clean energy initiatives, including the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. This push has disrupted many climate-related programs, with federal courts ordering some restorations, though tracking the full scope remains challenging.

“Most of it has been disrupted, as far as we can tell, though it’s very piecemeal and hard to track down,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy modeler at Princeton University.

Mace’s appeal reflects a broader dilemma for GOP lawmakers. While many support Trump’s drive to cut what they call wasteful spending, such as Biden’s “Green New Deal” programs, as noted by Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the cuts risk jobs in their districts. An E2 analysis found 85% of investments from the 2022 law have flowed to Republican districts, amplifying the stakes.

“These funds were appropriated specifically to help autoworkers stay in their jobs at plants at risk of closing and devastating entire communities,” said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative.

Industry and Regulatory Outlook

For the EV industry, the Mercedes-Benz project signals growing demand for electric commercial vehicles, a segment poised for expansion as businesses prioritize sustainability. The plant’s conversion aligns with global trends, as automakers like Mercedes-Benz invest heavily in EV supply chains. However, the Trump administration’s review of Energy Department programs, aimed at aligning with “American Energy Dominance,” could delay or derail such transitions.

The Senate’s tax bill, which proposes phasing out clean energy incentives, adds uncertainty. While some Republicans, like Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Virginia), have pushed to preserve these credits, warning of “significant disruption to projects under development,” Mace did not join their effort. Her letter, however, shows a pragmatic approach, balancing support for Trump’s fiscal goals with advocacy for local jobs.

Looking Ahead

Mace’s push for the $285 million grant highlights the complex interplay of politics, economics, and clean energy. For South Carolina’s EV sector, the funding could reportedly cement the state’s role in producing next-generation vehicles, supporting 800 workers and regional growth. Yet, with the Trump administration’s broader agenda to scale back climate programs, the outcome remains uncertain, leaving the future of such projects—and the jobs they promise—in limbo.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/img_3814-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 22:04:14.153885

Musk made headlines with his criticism, labeling the bill a “disgusting abomination” and saying it would lead to a surge in the federal deficit.
At the same time, the tax credits for purchasing used and commercial electric vehicles will also expire.
Additionally, the legislation accelerates the phasing out of clean energy manufacturing tax credits that have previously attracted billions of dollars in investment, especially in Republican states.
However, Trump justified the end of tax credits for clean energy initiatives, saying that they no longer need government support.","Technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has slammed the latest version of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill, calling it “utterly insane and destructive.”

In a post on his social media platform X, Musk lambasted lawmakers, saying the Senate’s new draft bill would eliminate millions of jobs in the U.S. and cause “immense strategic harm” to the country. He added that the bill will result in “outdated industries” receiving millions of dollars in subsidies, while “severely damaging” future industries.

The SpaceX Corp. and Tesla Inc. founder’s criticism could reignite a public feud with Trump, which kicked off last month after he quit the White House’s federal cost-slashing team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency.

The latest draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which needs the backing of both the Senate and Congress to come into law, will reduce financial support for clean energy projects that tap into wind and solar power, as well as electric vehicle tax credits, while providing incentives for the coal industry.

Musk has criticized earlier forms of the bill. In December, he complained bitterly about the government’s spending plans, leading many Republicans to withdraw support for it, almost causing a government shutdown.

The billionaire Musk had more influence back then as he was still seen as one of Trump’s closest allies, having been the biggest donor of his reelection campaign. But nowadays, it’s thought that he has a lot less sway after stepping down from DOGE and clashing with Trump over an earlier version of the bill, which was passed by Congress in May. Musk made headlines with his criticism, labeling the bill a “disgusting abomination” and saying it would lead to a surge in the federal deficit.

However, a number of fiscally conservative Republicans in the Senate appeared to support Musk’s latest posts, which might make it tricky for the bill to pass when it goes up for vote in that chamber, possibly as soon as Saturday.

In a flurry of posts on X, Musk reeled off a laundry list of complaints he has about the bill, saying in one that Trump is making a “massive strategic error” that will damage the solar and battery industries and “leave American extremely vulnerable in the future.” He also retweeted polls that indicate how unpopular the bill is amongst U.S. voters:

Of particular concern to Musk is that the bill will end tax credits that incentivize the purchase of new electric cars after Sept. 30. At the same time, the tax credits for purchasing used and commercial electric vehicles will also expire.

According to Reuters, the bill will also impose a new tax on wind and solar projects completed after Dec. 31, 2027, if they cannot show they have not used any Chinese components. It also offers tax breaks for companies involved in coal production. Additionally, the legislation accelerates the phasing out of clean energy manufacturing tax credits that have previously attracted billions of dollars in investment, especially in Republican states.

Musk was joined by a number of clean energy proponents and environmental groups in decrying the revised bill, which argue that it will ultimately raise household energy costs and deprive the country of new, fast energy capacity, which could be vital as more power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers come online.

However, Trump justified the end of tax credits for clean energy initiatives, saying that they no longer need government support. He was supported by Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, who said that “if repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place.”

Musk has threatened to finance primary challengers to Republican supporters of the bill. Earlier, there has been talk of a possible reconciliation between Trump and the world’s richest man, but White House officials said today that the president has no plans to speak with him anytime soon.",https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2025/06/musk.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 23:02:24.818443

Despite hopes earlier in the week that the Senate would rework the budget megabill’s language about the future use of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to extend their use and make them more usable, the new version of the bill introduced by Senate leadership overnight will effectively repeal the incentives for solar and wind immediately.

The clean energy industry and environmental groups decried the last-minute changes to the bill, saying that it will raise household energy costs and deprive the US of new, necessary and fast electricity capacity at a time of massive power demand amid a rush of construction of power-hungry data centers to power AI development.

Trump’s former advisor and head of DOGE Elon Musk blasted the bill on his social media platform X on Saturday, warning that the bill will “destroy millions of jobs in America” and cause “strategic harm.”

“It is utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” he said.

Energy security organization SAFE said in a statement that the bill, as written, would give an advantage to China, which dominates the clean energy and electric vehicle industries and is racing to outpace the US in AI development by taking away financing for energy storage, mineral processing and power projects.

“Where the original Senate version was a recipe for energy stagnation, this is outright energy surrender—all but guaranteeing Chinese dominance of critical minerals, industrial supply chains, and AI development,” said Avery Ash, head of government affairs for SAFE.

Green energy opponents praised the bill for ending support for renewable energy. Trump on Friday evening called for the end of the credits and said they no longer need support.

“If, as supporters of the IRA are complaining, repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance.

But this bill erases the target entirely — and with it, a key motivator to keep energy costs down and pollution in check.","North Carolina lawmakers have voted to roll back a key pollution-reduction target that was once hailed as a major step toward a cleaner, more affordable energy future. The move could significantly delay the state's transition away from dirty energy sources — and shift billions in costs to everyday residents.

What's happening?

On June 20, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill eliminating the 2030 benchmark to reduce power plant pollution by 70% from 2005 levels, according to The Daily Reflector. That goal was part of a landmark 2021 bipartisan law aimed at driving the state toward cleaner, more reliable energy.

Supporters of the new bill, including Duke Energy and several Republican legislators, argue that removing the target gives the utility more flexibility to build projects — like nuclear and gas plants — at a slower, less expensive pace. The bill also allows Duke to start charging customers for those plants while they're still under construction.

But critics say the rollback undermines progress, delays the clean energy transition, and sticks residents with higher bills in the long run. ""This bill is bad for all North Carolinians, whether they're Duke Energy customers or simply people who want to breathe clean air,"" said Chris Herndon, director of the North Carolina Sierra Club, per the Reflector.

Why is this concerning?

Without the 2030 deadline, there's less urgency for Duke Energy to phase out polluting fuels and invest in more affordable, cleaner energy sources like wind and solar. Experts warn that the longer this transition is delayed, the more vulnerable people become to rising utility costs and the health impacts of dirty air.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission had already pushed the 2030 deadline back by four years, citing feasibility concerns. But this bill erases the target entirely — and with it, a key motivator to keep energy costs down and pollution in check. While supporters estimate this could save $13 billion over 25 years, that number is based on unpredictable factors like future fuel prices and construction costs.

Critics also worry the bill allows Duke to recover costs from customers even if expensive projects never get completed — adding risk without much reward for residents.

What's being done about it?

The bill is now on Gov. Josh Stein's desk. The Democrat has voiced concerns about the measure but hasn't confirmed whether he will veto it. Even if he does, lawmakers may have the votes to override him.

Still, there's power in local action. Residents can support clean energy by joining community solar programs, upgrading home energy systems through Inflation Reduction Act incentives, and backing local leaders who prioritize affordable, less polluting power.

Because while the law may change, the need for healthier, more reliable energy doesn't.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/North-Carolina-pollution-rollbackimage-recEQac5hJr47xSC5.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 00:01:47.341825

Company leaders shared their vision during a presentation before Louisiana’s Clean Hydrogen Task Force on June 23, outlining a roadmap that connects steel production, clean energy, and long-term economic development.

Green Steel Mill to Anchor Louisiana’s Hydrogen Push

Slated to be operational by 2029, the proposed mill in Ascension Parish is designed to run on hydrogen fuel, reducing emissions and setting the stage for Louisiana to become a national hub for clean energy innovation. Hyundai representatives emphasized that this is not just a steel facility—it is a launchpad for a “statewide hydrogen ecosystem.”

“This project is not just about producing steel—it’s about producing a better future,” the company said in its presentation.

Three-Phase Strategy to Build Hydrogen Infrastructure

Hyundai laid out a phased approach to hydrogen integration:

Phase One: Use hydrogen in steel production at the mill.

Phase Two: Expand hydrogen applications to surrounding industrial sectors.

Phase Three: Establish a statewide hydrogen supply and demand network.

The project will begin with blue hydrogen—produced from natural gas with carbon capture—and eventually transition to green hydrogen, derived from renewable energy with near-zero carbon emissions.

Economic Benefits: Jobs, Training, and Emissions Cuts

The development is expected to bring thousands of jobs and new workforce training opportunities to the region. Hyundai also stressed its focus on inclusive economic development, citing state programs like the Industrial Tax Exemption Program and the Quality Jobs Program as key drivers for attracting green investment.

“If you want to really develop economically and have more companies join the party, those types of incentive packages do work,” said Jim Park, Senior Vice President of Hyundai North America.

Hydrogen Cost Challenges and Federal Uncertainty

Despite the promising outlook, energy experts warned of major cost barriers. Mark Zappi, executive director of the Energy Institute of Louisiana, noted that green hydrogen remains significantly more expensive than traditional fossil-fuel options.

Gray hydrogen (from natural gas) is cheapest.

Blue hydrogen adds 50–75 cents per kilogram due to carbon capture.

Green hydrogen is currently 3–4 times more expensive than gray.

“Until we get these prices down, a smart investor or businessperson can’t make some of these investments,” Zappi said.

Uncertainty also surrounds federal hydrogen production tax credits, which could be reduced or repealed under pending federal legislation. Hyundai, however, said its commitment remains firm, regardless of policy changes.

Market Outlook: U.S. Green Steel Growth Outpaces Conventional Steel

Hyundai projects that the U.S. green steel market will grow at an annual rate of 8.5% through 2034—more than double the pace of traditional steel. The company sees this as a generational opportunity to lead the transition to low-carbon manufacturing.

In its final remarks, Hyundai called on Louisiana leaders to provide long-term regulatory and economic stability to secure the state’s place at the forefront of the global energy transition.",https://www.brweeklypress.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/06/Hyundai-sign.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 23:02:28.485326

As Prepared for Delivery

Watch a video of Wyden deliver his remarks here

In just a moment I’ll get into the specifics on this horrifying bill -- all the details on the health care carnage and the clean energy bloodbath Republicans are dragging us toward.

First let’s talk about the state of the Senate -- and our democracy. As of a few hours ago, the rules of the Senate are whatever Republicans feel like when the day begins. It’s democracy-defying, plain and simple.

This bill before the Senate is loaded with fraudulent budget math that hides trillions in handouts to corporations and the rich. It’s a violation of the rules we’ve followed for reconciliation for decades. It’s a violation of the Congressional Budget Act. It’s a violation of common sense.

Republicans decided none of that matters, and they have gone nuclear to advance this bill. Apparently in this chamber, if the Republican chair of the Budget Committee says so, one plus one equals three.

That’s just unsustainable. We will be a sicker, poorer and weaker country if this bill becomes law, and the Republicans have gone nuclear to pass it. But these moves cut both ways, and there’s going to be a lot of cleanup for Democrats to handle down the road.

In all my time in public service, I’ve never seen a more destructive, regressive, common-sense defying bill debated in the United States Senate.

This bill is going to determine the future of health care in America. Millions of Americans will lose their health insurance if Republicans pass this bill. My colleagues seem to be ignoring the fact that rural hospitals are the anchor of life in rural communities. This bill will sever that anchor and set rural health care adrift.

Here’s how flawed the Republican plan is.

The danger they’re causing for rural hospitals is so great, Republicans have had to create a “rural hospital relief fund.”

It’s a band-aid on an amputation.

I can tell you one thing: only in Washington, D.C. would you create a “relief fund” to address a problem you caused. How about you just not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place?

I wanted to get a sense of what rural America thought of this legislation, so last weekend I held four town halls in three Eastern Oregon counties. It’s as rural as it gets. Trump carried those counties overwhelmingly.

One of them was Malheur County, where Trump received more than 70 percent of the vote. Malheur County also happens to have one of the highest Medicaid enrollment rates in the country. The message I heard was loud and clear: this bill will be a disaster for rural health in Oregon. Health care is the biggest employer in America. If these cuts go through, the healthcare workforce in rural areas of the country will be decimated. Nurses, doctors, and support staff will lose their jobs, and rural economies will suffer.

Many of the Americans that will feel the consequences of this bill are walking an economic tightrope. Many have multiple jobs. Millions more Americans will lose health care benefits like home care and mental health care that already fall short of what Americans expect.

These are overwhelmingly children, people with disabilities, and seniors. All to pay for their tax cuts to billionaires and corporations.

It’s not just cuts, it’s also a whole lot more red tape making it harder for people to get care. At the center of these Medicaid changes is a bunch of bureaucracy designed to entrap people in a never-ending maze of AI chatbots and phone trees that make it impossible for them to get the coverage they need.

And even if you manage to get through all that bureaucratic water torture and sign up for Medicaid, the Republican plan says if you lose your job, you lose your health care.

Why would Congress want to inflict that on more people?

No one wants these cuts, no matter their political persuasion. I’m sure most of us can agree there’s a real debate to be had about how we can make care more affordable and accessible for patients, but this bill achieves none of that.

I’ll turn now to seniors.

Two in three nursing home beds in America are covered by Medicaid.

If Republicans pass this into law, conditions will deteriorate, seniors will be forced out their nursing home, or forced to move in with family members that don’t have the necessary nursing skills to care for their aging parents or grandparents. Nursing homes will be forced to shut their doors as a result of these cuts, during a time when states are in desperate need of more nursing home options, not fewer.

The bill also repeals nursing home safety standards that were just put in place last year. That’s going to mean fewer nurses in nursing homes. You would think that would be a concern to Senate Republicans and the Trump administration.

But when the Finance Committee was considering the nomination of CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz, he told me, quote, “I believe we can provide quality of care equivalent to having a nurse in that nursing home using tools and technologies.” He’s gone on to be a big booster of Artificial Intelligence. So I’m deeply troubled about what the Trump Administration has in store for America’s seniors.

That’s on top of the fact that home-based care that most seniors prefer will be one of the first benefits states are forced to cut, because it’s an optional benefit rather than mandatory.

Hundreds of thousands of seniors are going to see a premium increase of about $200 dollars a month.

This bill also applies the worst forms of corporate red tape to the Affordable Care Act. Shorter enrollment periods, more verification forms and more hoops for Americans who just want affordable health care.

And the health care carnage might get even worse after Republicans make amendments. It’s my understanding that Senate Republicans will be offering an amendment that would lower the federal Medicaid match for new enrollees in what’s known as the Medicaid expansion, a marquee piece of the Affordable Care Act that delivered affordable health care to roughly 21 million Americans last year.

If this amendment were adopted, taken together with the other awful policies in this bill, it would amount to repealing the Affordable Care Act and making good on the 15-year Republican crusade to dismantle the law. Millions more working Americans would lose their health insurance, and it would break a promise to the 41 states that have expanded Medicaid - many of them deep red states.

These health care cuts aren’t just going to be felt by Americans with Medicaid and those who buy health insurance on their own. Emergency room wait times are going to skyrocket and premiums are going to spike.

Families will be one lost job or financial calamity from getting tossed onto a safety net that has rips and tears everywhere you look. Many will fall through the cracks.

I’ll also touch briefly on another horrifying provision buried in this bill: the defunding of Planned Parenthood, which is essentially a backdoor, nationwide abortion ban.

This provision will strip clinics of their funding and make it impossible for them to provide life-saving health care. Cancer screenings. STI screenings. Annual exams. All of that will disappear for the people that rely on these clinics for basic care.

The health care cuts are getting a big focus here, but the clean energy bloodbath deserves attention too.

In the middle of the night, Friday into Saturday, this bill that was already a disaster for clean energy got a whole lot worse.

What Republicans have on offer doesn’t just repeal the tax credits I wrote for wind and solar energy. Now we’ve got an actual massacre on our hands. This Republican plan actually TAXES wind and solar. A new tax on the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid.

At the same time, somebody tucked into this bill a brand new tax break for coal!

So here we are, it’s the year 2025, and the Senate is about to pass a bill that taxes wind and solar while subsidizing coal. It’s so backward it leaves you slack-jawed.

When you look at this bill, it’s awfully clear that the Republican goal is to destroy our key sources of clean energy.

This is a death sentence for the wind and solar industries in America.

It’s a total abandonment of hundreds of thousands of workers who are about to lose their jobs as a direct result of this bill.

The head of a group called North America’s Building Trades Unions that represents millions of construction workers issued a barn-burner of a statement on the bill yesterday. I’ll read a few select lines from his statement.

He called this Republican plan:

""The biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country…""

""...staggering and unfathomable job loss…""

A threat to “an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs … the equivalent of terminating 1,000 Keystone XL pipelines.”

""...another lifeline and competitive advantage to China in the race for global energy dominance.""

""...critical infrastructure projects ... sacrificed at the altar of ideology.""

Hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy investments are going to disappear. Not government subsidies or handouts -- private-sector investments. And even worse, this is a guaranteed way to hike utility bills for families and businesses of all sizes, all over the country. I’ve never seen this kind of economic self-sabotage. The demand for energy is booming in America right now. Even the heads of companies involved in fossil fuels are saying we need solar to get more electrons on the grid.

But Republicans apparently aren’t listening, because this plan risks plunging us into an energy crisis. It would be a disaster -- and a total surrender to China on clean energy manufacturing.

It’s clear as a sunny, breezy morning that all the talk from Trump and Republicans about American “energy dominance” was a fraud. Nothing but a hollow campaign slogan.

I’ll close with this. The American people voted for cheaper groceries, utilities and gas.

They didn’t vote to kick 16 million people off their health care so Republicans could give more tax breaks to billionaires and corporations. They didn’t vote for an energy crisis that benefits no one except Big Oil investors.

There is a real cost of living crisis facing American families right now. This body should be focused on finding ways to further lower drug prices, expand access to quality and affordable health care, and bring down the cost of living.

Instead, Republicans are using every ounce of their power to jam through another round of tax breaks for those at the very top on the backs of everybody else.

When Democrats retake power, we will have a serious mess to clean up. But until then, countless Americans will suffer and die as a direct result of losing their health care under this bill.

The American people will not forget that.

Released just before midnight on Friday, the new draft is even worse for the renewables sector than the previous House bill, which was widely criticized. It would sharply phase out existing tax credits for both wind and solar power by the end of 2027, earlier than precious drafts.

But more alarming: It would impose an excise tax on certain wind and solar projects placed into service after that date, whose construction began after June 16 of this year. To avoid the tax, companies would have to source a specified number of components from countries that aren’t on the U.S. list of prohibited foreign entities, which includes China. And they would have to prove it via fulfilling complex reporting requirements.

Epstein — who runs a pro-fossil fuel think tank devoted to the morality of spreading coal, oil, and gas — has risen in Trump’s second term. The once-obscure activist has become a key architect of the reconciliation bill’s energy sections, pushing Republican lawmakers to remove federal subsidies for renewables.

As Jigar Shah, former director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, pointed out on the latest episode of the Open Circuit podcast, Epstein has never worked in energy.

“There’s not a single investor who’s like, ‘What does Alex Epstein think?,’” Shah said. “But Lord Almighty, he’s the one that [White House Chief of Staff] Susie Wiles brought to a Republican Senator breakfast.”

But even Epstein, writing Saturday evening on X, renounced the last-minute Senate amendment: “I just learned about the excise tax and it’s definitely not something I would support.”

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and President Donald Trump’s former “first buddy,” also expressed alarm. “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” the billionaire wrote on X, in response to a post about the excise tax. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

According to a preliminary analysis by the Rhodium Group, the new tax would increase the cost of wind and solar by between 10% and 20% over the next decade, “depending on the pace of cost reductions for these technologies. (This comes on top of losing the tax credits themselves, which would already decrease the installation of new renewables on the grid by between 57% and 72% by 2035.)

“Combined with the likely onerous administrative reporting burden this provision puts in place, these cost increases will lead to even lower wind and solar installations,” the Rhodium Group analysts shared via email. “The impacts of this tax would also flow through to consumers in the form of higher electricity rates.”

The pushback, and the politics

The weekend has seen a rush of industry commentators — and even lawmakers themselves, including Sen. Brian Schatz, the Democrat from Hawaii— expressing existential dread over the new provision. As Bob Keefe, executive director of industry group E2 put it, “this is how you kill an industry.”

It’s unclear whether the pushback, either from Epstein or from the clean energy industry, will have much of an impact as lawmakers enter a frantic “vote-a-rama” over the coming days. (For context, the vote-a-rama over the Inflation Reduction Act that expanded and fortified the very tax credits that are now under threat lasted roughly 16 hours in 2022.)

The tax is still only vaguely rendered. It’s such a recent addition to the 940-page bill that there isn’t yet a calculated budget impact, which could make it easier for Democrats to throw out during the vote-a-rama expected to begin later tonight. But the bill has so many other renewable energy provisions — from an accelerated expiration of clean vehicle credits to adding tax credits for metallurgical coal production — that it’s possible that even the most renewables-friendly lawmakers have other priorities.

After Senate Republicans voted to advance the latest bill draft late last night, debate is expected to begin early tomorrow morning.

The industry’s hope rests now on a few key Republicans, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). A reconciliation bill requires just a simple majority to pass, and the GOP holds 53 to the Democrats’ 47 seats.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-06-29T202810.590.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 22:03:49.139415

The “Big Beautiful Bill” would eliminate tax credits for building clean energy projects and the $20 billion Tribal Guaranteed Loan Program under the Department of Energy.
In letters to congressional leaders, tribal leaders and advocates warned the cuts seriously undermine Indian Country's growing clean energy transition.
“Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,” the GOP senators wrote.
That's good — we ask them to prioritize trust and treaty responsibilities and what's right over tax cuts for billionaires,” Smith said.","More than 100 tribes and Native-serving organizations are warning Congress that the Senate budget bill would severely damage tribal clean energy efforts across Indian Country.

The “Big Beautiful Bill” would eliminate tax credits for building clean energy projects and the $20 billion Tribal Guaranteed Loan Program under the Department of Energy. The Senate's budget reconciliation bill cleared a key procedural hurdle Saturday and appears headed to debate on Monday.

New estimates from the Congressional Budget Office show the Senate measure would add more than $3.3 trillion to the national debt over a decade — nearly $1 trillion more than the House version. The bill extends tax cuts passed by the Trump administration in 2017, while cutting roughly $1.3 trillion from Medicaid, SNAP, and green energy programs to offset the resulting tax deficit.

In letters to congressional leaders, tribal leaders and advocates warned the cuts seriously undermine Indian Country's growing clean energy transition. Robert Blake, owner of solar development company Solar Bear, said it would “devastate” his efforts to build renewable projects for Minnesota's Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians.

“If these cuts happen, then all that work that has gone into putting these projects together will essentially be for nothing,” Blake told Tribal Business News. “That's going to be devastating for tribal communities who planned to rely on solar power for their tribes and their economies.”

Blake outlined plans for the tribe to utilize the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program to help cover costs of building a 20-megawatt, utility-scale project. If built, the project would be community-scale, with enough extra power to create revenue for the tribe by selling excess energy.

The project would impact nearly every facet of tribal life, according to Blake: energy savings at the tribe's casinos would allow them to invest more money in their employees, many of whom are rural Minnesotans. Maintaining the energy facility would provide career paths for Red Lake students interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. The tribe's plans also include a business that would use agrovoltaic farming practices, which involve utilizing solar panels and farmland to both generate electricity and grow food.

None of this would happen if the cuts are enacted, Blake said.

“It just doesn't happen — we can't get this off the ground without these programs. It would do irreparable harm to our community,” Blake said. “If the money stops, so does the energy transition that so many tribes like ours have banked on.”

The Senate bill would rapidly phase out existing federal tax subsidies for wind and solar power by 2027 and impose a steep penalty on all new wind and solar farms that come online after 2027. The tax provision, tucked inside the 940-page bill that the Senate made public just after midnight Friday, stunned observers, according to the New York Times.

While the loan program and direct pay tax credit programs are both critical for wider Indian Country energy, a range of more specific programs are also at risk, potentially undermining decades of work. At the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority (OSPA), proposed cuts to programs that support grid connectivity could derail all of their work, said OSPA general counsel Jon Canis.

OSPA, which also wrote letters in support of the endangered programs, is a cooperative organization composed of seven midwestern member tribes. The group is building a 1-gigawatt, utility-scale energy project, but that project has stalled because of massive costs associated with connecting the wind farms to the larger power grid, Canis said.

Federal programs could help OSPA pay for those costs, such as the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnerships grant, or the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor, both of which are under the Department of Energy. That money may disappear under the reconciliation bill however — and could end OSPA's lead project as well, Canis said.

“These programs mean so much to what we're doing, and people are talking about getting rid of them,” Canis said. “These are some of the best ways to get transmission costs paid for, and they could just go away.”

The letter campaign was highlighted in a joint press release from Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii). The senators called the tax cuts part of a “big, beautiful betrayal” that would prove “particularly harmful to tribal nations.”

""Together, the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program and our Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax credits have cleared pathways and removed significant barriers for tribes to finance and build their own resilient energy infrastructure,"" the Democratic senators wrote. ""The bill would pull the rug out from under projects that would strengthen their energy sovereignty and power local communities.""

The “Big Beautiful Bill” is still being debated and discussed in the Senate, where Republicans remain divided on how to approach any cuts to clean energy program funding. Some senators, such as Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), want to see the tax credits phased out more quickly, while others, such as Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), have called for a “targeted approach.”

Tillis was also part of a group statement issued by him and Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), John Curtis (R-Utah) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan) that warned against fully repealing the tax credit program.

“Many American companies have made substantial investments in domestic energy production and infrastructure based on the current energy tax framework,” the GOP senators wrote. “A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.”

Cheri Smith, founder and CEO of energy advocacy nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, encouraged those senators to examine the proposed cuts. Smith told Tribal Business News that the cuts would impact roughly 500 megawatts of potential energy projects among western tribes alone.

“We're hearing some Republican senators are concerned that the cuts go too deep. That's good — we ask them to prioritize trust and treaty responsibilities and what's right over tax cuts for billionaires,” Smith said. “All those economic and climate resilience benefits, all those jobs and economic development — this would slow all that way down, or stop it completely.”

President Donald Trump, who has strongly supported the bill's passage, has set a July 4 deadline for signing the bill. The bill's final form in the Senate — and how any changes will be received in the House — remains unclear.

That’s because the Guardian has posted a lot of stories featuring groups opposed to the legislation.

The podcast had featured a conversation on the organizations that do not like key provisions in the bill, such as the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, McAllen Boys & Girls Club, Hidalgo County Community Service Agency, and Starr County Memorial Hospital. All have said their funding will be dramatically cut under the bill.

No sooner had Taylor made the request, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn issued a press release saying he supports the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Cornyn’s analysis of the bill contrasts with that of most border lawmakers.

“There’s nothing beautiful about a bill that slashes health care, increases hunger, and lowers the income of every American earning less than $51,000 per year,” said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar of El Paso.

Citing analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of McAllen said the Republican bill would cut health insurance coverage for nearly 12 million Americans and add $3.3 trillion to the national debt.

“There is nothing ‘beautiful’ about a bill that lowers taxes for the ultra-rich on the backs of our senior citizens, our children, and our veterans,” Gonzalez said. “Ripping away health insurance, raising food prices nationwide, increasing the cost of education, harming our senior citizens, and hurting federal workers’ retirement is shameful and I will not stand for it.”

Appearing on Fox Business’ Kudlow show, Cornyn said the legislation provides an historic opportunity to prevent a more-than $3,000 tax hike on Texas families and bend the spending curve. Here are excerpts from his appearance:

“We’ve got to continue the current tax provisions so we don’t see a multi-trillion-dollar tax increase.”

“President Trump understands that the real key here is getting our economy growing again, and his deregulatory agenda, his focus on American energy production, and lowering taxes, and expensing equipment, and things like that, is going to see this economy boom – just like it did after the 2017 tax bill up until the time the pandemic hit. It was the best economy I’ve seen in my lifetime, and I think this promises to be even better.”

“If you don’t vote for the bill, you’re going to see a multi-trillion-dollar tax increase. That does nothing for the deficit and debt.”

“So we’re making good, incremental change – a good first start.”

“We need to get this bill done so people don’t experience a huge tax increase.”

Cornyn followed up with another press release that listed the benefits of the legislation. The second press release came after the Senate voted to proceed to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“Senate Republicans are one step closer to delivering on President Trump’s agenda by advancing the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will avoid a massive tax increase on Texas families, secure our southern border, remove burdensome taxes on Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights, and chart our country on a path toward fiscal sanity after years of frivolous spending in Washington under Joe Biden,” Cornyn said.

“This significant legislation includes key provisions I have championed that put Texans first, and soon we will vote to send it over to the House and on to President Trump’s desk to become law.”

Cornyn said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act contains the following provisions that he has championed:

$13.5 billion to reimburse states like Texas for stepping up and trying to secure the southern border during the Biden-Harris administration;

Language that would result in the consideration of movement of the Space Shuttle Discovery from Virginia to its rightful home near the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston;

His Stop Funding Genital Mutilation Act, which would prohibit federal funding from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) from going toward gender transition procedures at any age;

A modified version of his Small Business Investment Act, which would make it easier for small and start-up businesses to access the financing they need to grow and succeed;

Provisions from his Feral Swine Eradication Act to provide $105 million to the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program;

And the reduction of burdensome taxes on certain firearms and silencers to $0.

Cornyn said the legislation also includes the following tax provisions to benefit Texas families:

Prevents a more-than $3,000 tax hike on the average Texas family;

Protects more than half a million Texas jobs from being lost;

Ensures more than 3.7 million Texas households’ child tax credit is not cut in half;

Shields more than two million Texas small business owners from a massive tax hike;

Makes sure more than 12 million Texas families’ standard deduction is not cut in half;

Establishes work requirements for able-bodied adults who are choosing not to work and do not have dependent children or elderly parents in their care;

And ensures no taxes on tips or overtime for millions of tipped and hourly workers.

Cornyn said the bill also makes historic investments in border security through the following provisions:

$46.5 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) to build the border wall and associated infrastructure like access roads, cameras, lights, and sensors;

$4.1 billion for a border personnel surge;

$45 billion for the detention of illegal migrants;

$6 billion for improvements to surveillance at the border;

Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to increase staffing and enhance migrant screening and vetting processes;

Resources for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to increase recruitment, onboarding, and retention of ICE staff;

Funding for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to hire more immigration judges and staff to address the yearslong backlog of immigration petitions, cases, and orders of removals and investigate and prosecute immigration matters;

And additional resources for police and law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe.

Rep. Cuellar’s analysis

State Rep. Henry Cuellar has a different view to Sen. Cornyn on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Cuellar made clear his views in a roundtable meeting with Starr County Memorial Hospital executives and doctors.

One of the participants at the roundtable was Thalia Muñoz, administrator at Starr County Memorial Hospital. Muñoz said:

“We truly appreciate, Congressman, you coming to visit us, and we appreciate the work you do,” Muñoz said.

“(The federal legislation) would be extremely detrimental to small hospitals like ours. Our population very much depends on Medicaid, and it would be extremely difficult for small hospitals like ours to keep surviving (without Medicaid funding for the poor). We are the sole community provider within a 50-mile distance. So survival of hospitals like ours is vital. I mean, it’s vital. Our population has grown and grown, and again, the indigent population continues to grow.”

Here is a video from the event:

And here is a video recording of an interview the Guardian secured with one of the doctors at the roundtable discussion, Dr. Javier Margo:

LRGVDC stands ready to defend the aging and disabled communities

The board of directors of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council has a very different view to Sen. Cornyn when it comes to the federal budget proposals.

Here is a letter the group sent to members of Congress:

May 28 2025,

Subject: Unified Support to Protect and Strengthen Old American Acts (OAA), Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) and Adult Protective Services (APS) Amid Fiscal Year 2026 Federal Restructuring.

Dear Congressman/Senator:

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council (LRGVDC) – which administers the Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and Aging & Disability Resource Center (ADRC) for Cameron Hidalgo and Willacy counties in Texas – we write to express our strong concerns regarding proposed changes to the Fiscal Year 2026 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) budget that would negatively impact services to the elderly and most vulnerable population.

The LRGVDC AAA is one of 28 Area Agency on Aging programs designated in Texas, and serves as critical link in the statewide Aging Network under the OAA. The proposed restructuring, if enacted, would dismantle core elements of the aging and disability service infrastructure that has supported our elderly and region since it was enacted by Congress in 1967.

Specifically, the draft budget would negatively impact services as follows:

Fragment the OAA by moving programs away from the Administration for Community Living (ACL) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or the Administration for Children and Families(ACF), undermining the integrity and coordination of the Aging Network. Eliminate essential programs such as:

Title III-D Health Promotion & Disease Prevention.

Title VII Elder Rights and the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program.

State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) and Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA; Medicare benefits counseling, ADRC funding, critical for respite, housing, navigation and Medicare benefits counseling.

Cut nearly $900 billion from Medicaid, jeopardizing Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) that enables aging in place and eliminate funding for Adult Protective Services (APS), leaving vulnerable older adults unprotected.

This would hinder our ability to conduct outreach and deliver services, as we employ staff that’s strategically placed to cover our entire region. We maintain a vital presence in medical facilities, including hospitals and clinics throughout the region.

In FY 2023-2024, the LRGVDC delivered services to 11,165 older resident, older adults and caregivers: Cameron County: 4,532 – Hidalgo County 6,155 – Willis County 395 – Other 83

We also routinely assist residents from outside our tri-county region who contact our offices in Weslaco and Harlingen.

The elimination of these programs would directly harm our most vulnerable residents, threatening their ability to age safely at home and placing additional pressure on institutional care systems. The potential impacts also extend to our workforce and economy, threatening staffing and outreach capacity across the region.

We have seen firsthand the vital role of these services. The Ombudsman Program has prevented unsafe discharges, protected residents from abuse and exploitation, and ensured that medically fragile adults retain access to care and dignity. These are not theoretical risks – they are daily realities that our team works to resolve. We respectfully request and highly urge Congress to consider the following:

Keep all OAA programs unified under ACL, as per original statutory intent.

Reject the elimination of Titles III-D and VII, SHIP, MIPPA, and ADRC funding.

Protect and increase Medicaid HCBS allocations.

Preserve and expand APS.

Provide necessary increases to Titles III-B, III-E, and Title VI to meet rising local needs.

We’ve enclosed supporting documents that include regional data, personal testimonials and national advocacy briefs to further illustrate the urgent need for congressional support. These documents reflect the lived experiences of older adults with caregivers in our region, and the indispensable nature of the services your decisions uphold.

In advance, we thank you for your service and your commitment to your constituents. I hope you will support and urge your colleagues to support the FY 2026 funding bill that includes protection or increases funding for critical OAA and other aging programs. The LRGVDC Board of Directors stands ready to collaborate in defense of aging services that reflect our community’s values and needs.

Sincerely,

Norma Sepulveda, Mayor

LRGVDC Board President

Turkey, located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, has been transforming its energy sector to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, cut carbon emissions, and meet growing electricity demand. The government’s ambitious targets—increasing renewables to 38.8% of total generation by 2030, and reaching nearly 120 GW of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035—have attracted strong local and foreign investment.

This transformation is driven by competitive YEKA (Renewable Energy Resource Zones) auctions, large-scale utility projects, growing hybrid (solar+wind) plants, and rapid deployment of battery storage. This article explores the latest data, projects, and policy mechanisms shaping Turkey’s renewable energy journey.

1. Solar & Wind Power: Accelerated Growth

Solar Power

• As of late 2024, Turkey’s installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity has nearly doubled in just 2.5 years, reaching 19.6 GW, beating the 2025 target ahead of schedule (Balkan Green Energy News).

• Notable projects include the Karapınar YEKA solar farm, which alone produces 1.3 GW, powering over 600,000 homes and cutting ~1.7 million tonnes of CO₂ annually (Wikipedia).

Wind Power

• Turkey has reached over 13 GW of wind capacity, mainly onshore, already supplying around 10% of annual electricity demand (Wikipedia).

• Recent investments of ~$1.5 billion in 2025 are projected to add 1.5 GW of new wind capacity, with major plants coming online in Geyve, Atares-2, Uygar, and Kayseri (Balkan Green Energy News).

The roadmap aims to raise wind capacity to ~30 GW by 2035, including 5 GW of offshore wind, and solar to ~53 GW in the same timeframe.

2. YEKA Auctions: Driving Scale & Local Content

YEKA (Renewable Energy Resource Zones) is the government’s flagship program designed to:

Enable large-scale renewable projects.

Attract foreign capital.

Enforce domestic content rules to support local manufacturing.

Recent Wind Auctions – YEKA-4 (2024)

• 1.2 GW awarded across five onshore projects (Rüzgar Enerjisi).

• Requirements: ≥ 55% local content; winning bidders sell electricity at market price initially, followed by 3.5 ¢/kWh guaranteed tariff for up to 20 years.

• Attracted over 40 bidding groups, signaling strong investor confidence.

Recent Solar Auctions – YEKA GES-2024

• On February 4, 2025, six projects totaling 800 MW were awarded in Konya, Malatya, Van, Antalya, Karaman, and Kütahya (Balkan Green Energy News).

• Local content requirement: ≥ 75% for modules.

• Electricity sold on the free market for 5 years, then under a fixed PPA of ~3.25 ¢/kWh for 20 years(Taiyang News).

• Expected investment: ~$500 million, supplying ~1.5 TWh/year—enough for ~600,000 homes, cutting gas imports by 300 million m³.

To date, YEKA auctions have tendered over 7.8 GW (3.8 GW solar, 4 GW wind). Annual auctions of ~2 GW are planned until 2035 (Renewables Now).

3. Energy Storage & Hybrid Systems

To stabilize the grid and balance variable renewables:

• Turkey has pre-licensed 14.6 GW of storage-integrated solar projects by 2024—well above the official 2030 target of 2 GW (AA.com.tr).

• Landmark deal: Polat Energy & Rolls-Royce signed Turkey’s largest battery project—132 MWh paired with the Göktepe wind farm (Reuters).

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “will hurt people with disabilities.” FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens Medicaid for Americans with disabilities.","While Democrats spend the day launching desperate, hollow attacks in a last-ditch effort to block President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, the FACTS speak for themselves.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill is “just a tax break for billionaires.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers the largest middle- and working-class tax cut in U.S. history. The President’s legislation will put more than $10,000 a year back in the pockets of typical hardworking families. This is the most pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family legislation ever crafted.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “takes from the poor to give to the rich.”

FACT: The lowest-income workers receive the largest percentage tax cuts. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers the largest tax cut in history for working-and -middle class Americans.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “makes life more unaffordable.”

FACT: The bill delivers bigger paychecks, expanding take-home pay by over $10,000 per year for a typical family.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “hurts low-income families.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill is the most pro-family legislation ever crafted. It will deliver bigger paychecks, giving more than a $10,000 boost annually to everyday families. We are also expanding Opportunity Zones, expanding childcare access, increasing the child tax credit, and creating newborn savings accounts.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “is just a handout to corporations.”

FACT: This bill drives a Blue-Collar BOOM with tax relief for workers, support for small businesses, and investments in American manufacturing. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers the largest middle- and working-class tax cut in U.S. history.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “leaves American workers behind.”

FACT: This is the most pro-American worker bill in history. The One Big Beautiful Bill boosts pay for millions—and with no tax on tips or overtime, those working hourly and service jobs receive additional tax relief.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “hurts small businesses.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill will make the Trump Tax Cuts permanent, including the small business deduction—helping Main Street grow and hire. Failure to pass this legislation would result in a $4 trillion tax hike.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “kicks American families off Medicaid.”

FACT: As the President has said numerous times, there will be no cuts to Medicaid. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens Medicaid for those who rely on it—pregnant women, children, seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income families—while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse. The One Big Beautiful Bill removes illegal aliens, enforces work requirements, and protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “cuts Medicare.”

FACT: Medicare has not been touched in this bill— absolutely nothing in the bill reduces spending on Medicare benefits. This legislation does not make a single cut to welfare programs—it safeguards and protects these programs for all eligible Americans.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “will close rural hospitals.”

FACT: Rural hospitals comprise just 7% of all hospital spending on Medicaid, illustrating that they have not benefited from the massive increase in waste, fraud, and abuse under the Biden administration. By strengthening Medicaid, we are making more resources available for vulnerable populations and safety net providers, like rural hospitals. We are expanding rural hospital protection, providing targeted funds for rural care, and giving states flexibility to support local providers.

MYTH: “People will literally die” from the One Big Beautiful Bill — “and millions will be kicked off their healthcare.”

FACT: This is one of the most egregious, deranged attacks from the Left peddling fear over the facts. The One Big Beautiful Bill protects eligible Americans on federal welfare – including Medicaid. By strengthening the integrity of Medicaid by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, its resources can be refocused on providing better care for those whom the program was designed to serve: pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, low-income seniors, and other vulnerable low-income families.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “will hurt people with disabilities.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens Medicaid for Americans with disabilities. Rest assured, those with disabilities receiving Medicaid will receive no loss or change in coverage.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “punishes vulnerable Americans with work requirements to receive their benefits.”

FACT: Not true. The 20-hour weekly work requirement applies only to able-bodied adults without young children and promotes dignity, stability, and better health outcomes for families. The One Big Beautiful Bill restores the dignity of work with historically bipartisan work requirements for able-bodied Americans. We are implementing commonsense, Clinton-era work, volunteer, education, or training requirements with broad bipartisan support.

MYTH: “There’s no fraud in Medicaid — Republicans are just taking coverage away from vulnerable populations.”

FACT: In the last 10 years, CMS admitted that improper payments for Medicaid have exceeded HALF A TRILLION dollars. In just the past year, taxpayers spent $56 billion on benefits for able-bodied adults abusing the system—and over a million illegal aliens are receiving free health care on the backs of taxpayers. The One Big Beautiful Bill removes illegal aliens, enacts work requirements for able-bodied adults, and protects Medicaid for the truly vulnerable.

MYTH: “SNAP work requirements are unnecessary.”

FACT: Only 28% of able-bodied adults on SNAP work. The One Big Beautiful Bill promotes work, responsibility, and restores SNAP to serve the truly needy. SNAP enrollment remains high even in a strong economy, including millions of able-bodied adults who could work. In fact, almost three-quarters of able-bodied adults without dependents on SNAP have no earned income. The mission of the program has failed. SNAP was intended to be temporary help for those who encounter tough times—we are strengthening this program to serve those who need it most.

MYTH: “Illegal aliens don’t get federal benefits.”

FACT: Illegals burden taxpayers with billions in costs for free health care and welfare benefits. The One Big Beautiful Bill ends Medicaid and SNAP fraud and ensures these programs serve only eligible Americans.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “doesn’t actually end taxes on Social Security.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers historic tax relief to seniors, with a new tax deduction that, combined with other deductions, ensures the average Social Security beneficiary will pay zero taxes on Social Security.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “increases the deficit.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill reduces deficits by over $2 trillion by increasing economic growth and cutting waste, fraud, and abuse across government programs at an unprecedented rate. This legislation delivers historic levels of mandatory savings. President Trump’s pro-growth economic formula will reduce the deficit, increase wages, deliver American jobs, and drive down the cost of living.

MYTH: “But the CBO says….”

FACT: The Crooked Budget Office has a terrible record with its predictions and hasn’t earned the attention the media gives it. The CBO misreads the economic consequences of not extending the Trump Tax Cuts. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers real savings that will unleash our economy and prevent the largest tax hike in history, resulting in historic prosperity, while lowering the debt burden.

MYTH: “There’s too much ‘pork’ in this bill.”

FACT: There’s no pork in the bill. Every single provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill is a campaign promise the American people elected President Trump to deliver. The only new spending in the bill is to secure the homeland of the United States and save American sovereignty — which is fully paid for by increased visa fees on foreigners.

MYTH: “The One Big Beautiful Bill won’t strengthen national security.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda by funding the Golden Dome missile defense system and modernizing our military to prioritize lethality and readiness. It fully equips our war fighters with the resources they need while modernizing and revolutionizing our equipment and technology.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “helps ‘Big Oil’ and locks up U.S. energy resources.”

FACT: Quite the opposite. It unleashes American energy, refills the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and repeals the Green New Scam policies. The One Big Beautiful Bill unleashes clean, American-made energy and will reduce the cost of living for Americans nationwide.

MYTH: “Manufacturing jobs will still go overseas.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers 100% expensing for new domestic factories, revitalizes Opportunity Zones, and incentivizes companies to keep jobs in America.

MYTH: The One Big Beautiful Bill “neglects rural America.”

FACT: This bill invests in rural communities, expands market access, and delivers historic support to farm families. The One Big Beautiful Bill provides the certainty America’s farm families need to continue operating and producing the affordable, safe, and abundant supply of food, fuel, and fiber that our nation relies on.

MYTH: “SNAP is being gutted and cutting food stamps for families, causing them to go hungry.”

FACT: The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens SNAP. Right now, almost three-quarters of able-bodied adults without dependents on SNAP have no earned income and the fraud rate is high. The mission of the program has failed: SNAP was intended to be temporary help for those who encounter tough times. Now, it’s become so bloated that it is leaving fewer resources for those who truly need help. We are committed to preserving SNAP for the truly needy.

MYTH: “Republicans are shutting Democrats out of the legislative process.”

FACT: This is not a partisan bill—Democrats shut themselves out by supporting higher taxes, open borders, and giveaways to illegal immigrants. The One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on Republican promises to lower taxes, secure the border, cut spending, and put Americans first.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 22:03:56.014962

Large organisations certainly cannot ignore their fleet emissions – Security and Exchange Commission reporting requirements now mandate that publicly traded companies must disclose their greenhouse gas emissions to stakeholders.
Optimists might argue, however, that the landscape for EVs in the US may not be as gloomy as headlines have painted.
Fleets need consistency But the on-off nature of EV support and counter-EV measures does hinder fleet planning.
“Despite current market and policy hurdles, leading companies are staying the course in their commitment to transitioning to EVs over time.","Fleet decision makers are having to deal with an entirely different environment in the US, in the face of disappearing EV incentives, tariffs on foreign imports, and the dilution of vehicle emissions legislation.

The new administration made no effort to hide its disdain for its predecessor’s Inflation Reduction Act, which played a pivotal role in the uptake of EVs through the $7,500 federal Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and leasing incentives.

Tax credits and tariffs

Under the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress and now being scrutinised in the Senate, the tax credit for new EVs would phase out after 2026.

The administration has also challenged California’s emissions waiver, including the state’s plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, and attempted to withdraw federal financial support for charging infrastructure.

Moreover, the introduction of 25% tariffs on automotive imports unduly impacts EVs, with the vehicles and their traction batteries more likely to be manufactured overseas than their gasoline equivalents.

The President appears intent on levelling the playing field between powertrain technologies with his executive orders and budget, but despite his “drill, baby, drill” rhetoric, has not signed the death warrant of EVs.

Companies remain committed to EVs

His policies may slow down EV adoption, especially in the price-sensitive retail sector, but multiple reports indicate that large companies remain committed to their sustainability goals, which include electrifying their fleets.

Research by Cox Automotive last year found that only 14% of fleets operated EVs, but the majority expected to have some battery-powered vehicles on their books within five years. The study said fleets with both gas and electric vehicles reported higher satisfaction with their EVs and said they had a 90% likelihood of acquiring additional EVs in the next acquisition cycle.

Zo Rahim, senior manager of Research and Market Intelligence at Cox Automotive, said: “In many ways, electric vehicles can be an ideal solution for many fleet operations, which often have set routes of known distances, vehicles that routinely overnight in the same location, and operations that prioritize the cost of ownership. The fleet business is significant in the U.S. market, and we expect the EV share of the fleet market to expand in the coming years.”

Fleets pursuing climate goals

Element Fleet Management already has 101,000 electric or hybrid vehicles on its 1.5 million vehicle fleet, and has set an ambitious goal to transition 350,000 client vehicles to electric by 2030.

“With the right tools, insights, and support, we are helping to empower our clients as they reduce emissions, lower costs, and pursue their climate goals,” said Sheri McGrath, VP of Sustainability at Element.

Wheels sees growing green momentum

The most recent Sustainability Benchmark Report by Wheels identified growing fleet momentum towards lower emission solutions, although it warned that wider industry trends, such as the softening of EPA standards and year-over-year waning in some electrification metrics could influence the pace of green progress.

“This doesn’t indicate a shift away from environmental sustainability; rather, it shows that companies are taking a more measured, informed approach,” said the report.

Earlier this month, 15 delegates from the NAFA Fleet Management Association went to Washington to present the practical needs of fleets to lawmakers, raising issues such as EV incentives, and charging infrastructure funding.

Large organisations certainly cannot ignore their fleet emissions – Security and Exchange Commission reporting requirements now mandate that publicly traded companies must disclose their greenhouse gas emissions to stakeholders.

Wheels says transitioning to battery electric vehicles is the number one strategy for fleets to achieve more sustainable operations, although hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles also feature as part of solutions.

EV sales to plateau this year

J.D. Power forecasts that EV sales in the US will plateau this year, accounting for about 9.1% of new vehicle sales, and representing about 1.2 million registrations. This is the same share they achieved in 2024, with New York, Florida and Colorado joining California as EV hotspots.

Longer term, J.D. Power projects that the EV market is on track to account for about a 26% retail share by 2030, approximately half of the market share targeted by the Biden administration. Its data shows that by the end of last year, the average cost of a battery electric vehicles was $1,000 cheaper than a comparable gas-powered vehicle, thanks to federal and state incentives, as well as a raft of new mainstream models (the first BEVs were largely premium cars with premium prices). This price advantage would disappear with the withdrawal of the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, and is likely to have a negative impact on sales.

Optimists might argue, however, that the landscape for EVs in the US may not be as gloomy as headlines have painted. Last week, a judge blocked President Donald Trump's administration from withholding about $1 billion in funds awarded to 14 states to develop EV charging infrastructure, and California Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed to challenge President Trump’s resolution to repeal the state’s mandate that at least 80% of new vehicles sold have to be electric in 2035.

Fleets need consistency

But the on-off nature of EV support and counter-EV measures does hinder fleet planning.

“Businesses — both manufacturers and fleet operators — need policy certainty as they plan to build and adopt cutting edge, cost-saving vehicles,” said Michael Kodransky, senior director of transportation, Ceres, a nonprofit advocacy organization working to accelerate the transition to a cleaner economy. “In this period of uncertainty, businesses that have committed to transitioning to clean fleets must redouble their efforts to ensure they can access these innovative vehicles.”

He said that in 2020 the average price of an EV was 42% higher than the average price of a car – at the end of 2024 the differential had closed to 12%.

“Despite current market and policy hurdles, leading companies are staying the course in their commitment to transitioning to EVs over time. For businesses looking to reduce costs, improve efficiency and stay ahead of market shifts, investing in fleet electrification isn’t just about sustainability — it’s a strategic business decision,” said Kodransky.

So long as it is not weakened, this Senate text will be a victory for Americans and demonstrates that the swamp doesn’t always win.","The U.S. Senate will soon start debate on H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The latest version of this reconciliation bill includes many provisions addressing the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) “green” subsidies that will help to undo the Green New Deal.

Daren Bakst, Director of CEI’s Center for Energy and Environment, stated:

The IRA includes a centrally-planned scheme to radically change how Americans produce and use energy. To their credit, not a single Republican in the House or Senate voted for the IRA.

Many Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have rightfully stressed the importance of dismantling the Green New Deal. There’s no way to do so without getting rid of the IRA “green” subsidies that are at the heart of the Green New Deal.

The latest version of the Senate reconciliation bill that is now on the Senate floor is better at addressing these IRA subsidies than the previous Senate language. The bill is more aggressive at getting rid of the litany of tax credits that would encourage the country to shift to unreliable sources of electricity, like wind and solar. It also repeals harmful tax credits that would try and help kill off gas-powered cars and natural gas appliances.

The bill rescinds unobligated funds for the numerous IRA programs at the Environmental Protection Agency and repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, containing a particularly infamous agency slush fund the Biden EPA used to create billion-dollar handouts for the use of a handful of favored nonprofit organizations.

The Senate reconciliation text in its current form preferably would be stronger in getting rid of the IRA subsidies, but it is a meaningful step towards helping to dismantle the Green New Deal. Now the Senate and then the House need to get this legislative text addressing the IRA subsidies across the finish line.

Much more will be needed to undo the Green New Deal, including repealing IRA text for programs that could not be addressed due to Senate procedural rules. Further, much of the Green New Deal is regulatory in nature, and while the Trump administration is being proactive in addressing these Biden administration rules, Congress should identify what it can to undo these rules.

Hopefully, the Senate’s IRA subsidy text will only get stronger through amendments. So long as it is not weakened, this Senate text will be a victory for Americans and demonstrates that the swamp doesn’t always win.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2164052442-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 22:04:11.547254

per year, more than triple the original target of 1.5 million tonnes.
According to the experts, Canada’s proposed $16.5B CCUS project by the Pathways Alliance hangs in the balance after the resignation of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.","Global research and consultancy group Wood Mackenzie has predicted that the global Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) market will surge 28-fold by 2050 to 2,061 million tonnes per annum, surpassing trillions of dollars in value. According to WoodMac, countries across the globe led by U.S., Canada and Europe have committed $80 billion for CCUS so far, with just 50 CCUS projects with a capacity to store 51 million tonnes of CO2 per year currently operational. WoodMac has also predicted that the gap between capture capacity and storage capacity will narrow from nearly 50% in 2030 to 20% in 2050.

However, the analysts are less optimistic about near-term growth prospects for CCUS, and have revised their 10-year forecast down by 22% due to policy uncertainty in the U.S. coupled with slow policy evolution in Asia. Further, WoodMac has predicted that most countries that have set carbon capture targets will only be able to achieve 50-70% of their goals by 2050. Even more alarming: WoodMac says point-source capture will only be capable of abating 4% of total emissions by 2050, short of the 6% required to restrict global warming to 2.5C by 2050.

Nevertheless, the explosive growth will offer fresh opportunities for oil and gas companies. Previously, we reported that Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ will handicap the nascent hydrogen sector bill but still provides tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration under Section 45Q.

“We expect our investment into the Donaldsonville CCS project will increase our free cash flow in the range of $100 million per year due to the United States’ 45Q tax credit for permanently sequestering CO2,” CF Industries (NYSE:CF) said in its latest annual report.

Big Oil has invested billions of dollars in CCUS projects, including Exxon Mobil’s (NYSE:XOM) latest project targeting power-hungry U.S. data centers. Exxon recently unveiled a groundbreaking plan wherein the company will provide low-carbon power to the U.S. data centers powering the AI boom. Exxon’s proposal outlines a first-of-its-kind facility that will use natural gas to produce electricity while capturing more than 90% of the CO2 emissions. The captured emissions will then be stored deep underground. ExxonMobil’s current CCS technology supports industries involved in steel, hydrogen and ammonia production, with the company having secured agreements to store up to 6.7 million tons of CO2 annually for these sectors.

Last year, Exxon acquired CCUS specialist Denbury Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $4.9B, or $89.45/share. Denbury recycles CO2 through its Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations and uses it to produce environmentally-friendly, carbon-negative Blue Oil. The company owns the largest CO2 pipeline network in the U.S. at 1,300 miles, including nearly 925 miles of CO2 pipelines in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi, as well as 10 onshore sequestration sites. According to Exxon CEO Darren Woods, the company’s Low Carbon business has the potential to outperform its legacy oil and gas business within a decade and generate hundreds of billions in revenues.

Meanwhile, last month, Shell (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) expanded their Northern Lights CCS project with $714 million in total investments. The decision comes after a deal with Swedish energy company, Stockholm Exergi, which has pledged to send up to 900,000 tonnes of CO? each year over a 15-year span. Northern Lights is now capable of storing at least 5 million tonnes of CO? per year, more than triple the original target of 1.5 million tonnes.

Canada’s CCUS outlook is, however, less rosy. According to the experts, Canada’s proposed $16.5B CCUS project by the Pathways Alliance hangs in the balance after the resignation of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The giant project would capture harmful carbon dioxide emissions from the Canadian oilsands, the country’s heaviest-emitting sector.

“I can’t imagine a huge project like that could really move forward in a time like right now,” Michael Bernstein, executive director of the non-profit group Clean Prosperity, told Bloomberg. “When you’re looking at a project that has at least a 15-year time horizon, you want as much certainty as possible. And there’s just more uncertainty than I can remember in my whole time doing this work right now,” he added.

A lack of pipelines and heavy emissions has been weighing heavily on the Canadian heavy crude sector for years, with several companies exiting the country after coming under pressure to invest in ‘cleaner’ projects. According to research firm Rystad Energy, oil sands production in Alberta generates ~160 pounds of carbon per barrel of crude pumped, the highest of any oilfield in the world.

With energy providers, tech companies, energy regulator Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) convening, this second meeting will discuss how to work together to forecast how much energy will be needed to deliver a twenty-fold increase in compute capacity over the next 5 years.

Compute represents the key building block of AI development. It captures the vital resources which make AI models work, such as the processing power which allows them to be trained on data and process information. By increasing the UK’s capacity, it will give scientists and AI companies from across the UK access to the systems they need for their cutting-edge research - making the next big breakthrough from personalised medical treatments, more sustainable air travel, or developing new tools in the fight against climate change.

The meeting is also expected to cover which sectors are likely to quickly adopt AI and how this could drive significant shifts in energy demand. Discussions will focus on what assumptions need to be made to accurately forecast that demand, ensuring the energy system is prepared for AI.

Chaired by the Technology and Energy Secretaries, the meeting comes hot on the heels of the UK government announcing £2 billion to deliver the AI Opportunities Action Plan.

The Action Plan serves as a blueprint to turbocharge the use of AI, whether it’s in hospitals to help diagnose patients more quickly, in schools to help with lesson planning so teachers have more time in front of the whiteboard, or delivering new AI Growth Zones which will unlock scores of new investment and jobs to revitalize local communities and deliver the economic growth driving the government’s Plan for Change.

Secretary of State for Science, Innovation, and Technology, Peter Kyle said:

Giving our researchers and innovators access to the processing power they need will not only maintain our standing as the world’s third-biggest AI power, but put British expertise at the heart of the AI breakthroughs which will improve our lives, modernise our public services, and spark the economic growth which is the cornerstone of our Plan for Change.

We are clear-eyed though on the need to make sure we can power this golden era for British AI through responsible, sustainable energy sources. Today’s talks will help us drive forward that mission, delivering AI infrastructure which will benefit communities up and down the country for generations to come without ever compromising on our clean energy superpower ambitions.

Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband said:

We are making the UK a clean energy superpower, building the homegrown energy this country needs to get bills down for good and create new jobs as part of our Plan for Change.

Bringing together the biggest players in AI and energy will help us discuss the role AI can play an important role in building a new era of clean electricity for our country, and meeting the power demands of new technology as we build a clean power system for families and businesses.

With energy providers, tech companies, energy regulator Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) convening today, they’ll discuss how to work together to forecast how much energy will be needed to deliver this twenty-fold increase in compute capacity over the next 5 years. The meeting is also expected to cover which sectors are likely to quickly adopt AI and how this could drive significant shifts in energy demand.

The meeting will consider the future energy needs of the AI sector more widely, as the government also continues to move forward with its plans to roll out AI Growth Zones across the country. These hotbeds of AI development will unlock billions in investment and deliver scores of new jobs across the country, with communities throughout the UK having already expressed an interest in being home to future growth zone sites.

Since establishing the AI Energy Council in January, government has been deepening its work both Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to deliver fundamental reforms to the UK’s connections process. Once final signoffs from Ofgem are in place, this could mean more than 400GW of additional capacity is freed up from the grid connection queue - turbocharging the AI projects which are vital to economic growth.

The signs have already moved Louisiana into the intensive care unit.","When assessing patients’ health, doctors distinguish between “symptoms” and “signs.”

Symptoms are subjective, the feelings a patient has indicating something’s wrong.

Signs are objective, the results of X-rays and scans, and call for immediate action.

Now, five months into President Donald Trump’s reign of terror on our environment, the symptoms of trouble that were flooding Louisiana have been joined by signs requiring urgent action.

First, a respected environmental researcher at Tulane University felt compelled to resign, claiming the school had placed her and her work under gag orders because politicians and the petrochemical industry didn’t like the results.

Next, researchers at Southeastern Louisiana University found alarming levels of toxic metals and pollution in Lake Maurepas.

Finally, for the second year in a row, U.S. News and World Report declared Louisiana the worst state to live in, a finding heavily influenced by our ranking as the second most polluted state.

Each of those signs result from Trump’s unprecedented two-pronged assault on America’s environment.

He has issued 145 orders rolling back or killing regulations currently protecting Americans. Those changes could lead to premature deaths of more than 200,000 over the next 25 years due to increased heart and respiratory illnesses, studies show. It’s Trump's opinion that protection for humans should not interfere with business profits. But he knows regulations can only become law if they are based on the factual findings from scientific research.

So, like the autocrats and dictators he admires and wants to emulate, King Donald doesn’t want his subjects to know the truth. That’s why he’s trying to make those facts disappear and prevent any future findings.

Thus, he has ordered environmental agencies to remove results of studies from their websites, and proposed dramatic cutbacks in their funding that includes shuttering entire sections.

This includes reducing funding at the National Science Foundation (57%); the National Institutes of Health (40%); NASA's science budget (47%); the Department of Energy's Office of Science (14%) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (28%).

A massive 40% reduction for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was no surprise. NOAA has been at the forefront of research explaining the current and future catastrophic impacts of climate change such as sea level rise and larger hurricanes — all of which are caused largely by fossil fuel emissions.

But the cuts at NOAA — designed to protect oil and gas from being blamed for their role in climate change — would also leave Louisiana and other coastal states without some of the lifesaving information on hurricanes the agency provides. Maybe he’ll use his Sharpie to change their paths?

In fact, any program related to climate change — including the billions Congress authorized two years ago — may be rolled back. Trump has already ordered more than 100 climate studies to be shut down.

And he is using the massive power of the federal purse to reach outside federal agencies and into the world of academia because America’s universities conduct much our environmental research using federal grants.

Some of the nation’s elite universities, such as Columbia, have folded to his demands. Others, notably Harvard, are fighting for academic freedom.

Tulane has chosen to wave the white flag. It’s worried funding from petrochemical giants could be jeopardized. It apparently believes in that old saying, “The problem with tainted money is “‘Tain’t enough of it!’”

But the real problem is that Trump’s war on science and universities is really a war on the freedom of truth, the kryptonite feared by all autocrats.

And the truth for Louisiana is that Trump’s war on science is setting our state up for a permanent place at the bottom of the list of best places to live in the United States.

He is doing all of this with the support of Louisiana’s GOP congressional delegation.

The signs have already moved Louisiana into the intensive care unit. Unless he is stopped, we’ll eventually be in hospice care.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b8/fb86d370-3e1a-11ee-9a65-575f6aa0ec63/64dfb650f293f.image.jpg?crop=1754%2C921%2C0%2C130&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-29 20:05:07.190595

According to recent reports, the i3 will offer an impressive range of up to 560 miles and a performance-focused M60 xDrive trim boasting 630 horsepower, positioning BMW to compete head-on in the premium electric sedan market.

Redefining EV Performance

The i3 lineup, internally coded NA0, includes trims like the i3 20, i3 40, i3 50, and the high-performance i3 M60 xDrive. The M60 xDrive aims to outmuscle the Tesla Model 3 Performance, which delivers 510 horsepower and a 0-60 mph sprint in 2.9 seconds. With 630 horsepower from its dual-motor all-wheel-drive system, the i3 M60 xDrive is engineered to match or exceed these figures, though BMW has yet to release exact acceleration data. Lower trims, such as the i3 40 and i3 50, will target Tesla’s rear-wheel-drive and Long Range all-wheel-drive variants, balancing daily efficiency with spirited performance.

Advanced Gen6 Battery Technology

BMW’s sixth-generation (Gen6) battery technology is central to the i3’s appeal. Using cylindrical cells, it achieves 20% higher energy density than the current Gen5 pouch cells, boosting range by 25% while reducing weight and cooling demands. The i3 50 could achieve a range of 560 miles per the WLTP cycle, surpassing the Tesla Model 3 Long Range’s 360 miles. “BMW’s Gen6 battery packs could set a new standard for luxury EVs by 2027,” industry analysts note, highlighting the potential to redefine efficiency in the segment.

Fast charging is another strength. The i3 will support 300–400 kW charging, adding up to 217 miles of range in just 10 minutes—outpacing the Model 3’s 250 kW capability, which adds about 175 miles in 15 minutes. This makes the i3 a compelling choice for EV owners prioritizing quick turnarounds on long trips.

Seamless Integration with Charging Networks

BMW’s adoption of the North American Charging Standard (NACS) port for its Neue Klasse models, including the i3, ensures compatibility with Tesla’s Supercharger network. This move levels the playing field, as Tesla’s infrastructure advantage diminishes. For EV owners, this translates to greater flexibility and access to over 12,000 Supercharger stalls across the U.S., alongside other public charging options.

Industry and Consumer Implications

The i3’s debut, with production starting in July 2026 at BMW’s Munich plant, signals a shift in the luxury EV landscape. Priced competitively in the premium sedan segment (likely starting around $50,000 based on current i3 models, though exact figures are unconfirmed), it could attract Tesla buyers seeking German engineering and longer range. Regulatory trends favoring EV adoption, such as U.S. tax credits up to $7,500, may further boost its appeal.

However, challenges remain. Tesla’s software ecosystem, including over-the-air updates and autonomous driving features, sets a high bar. BMW must deliver a polished user interface and advanced driver-assistance systems to compete. Additionally, while the i3’s range and charging speeds are impressive, real-world performance will depend on factors like temperature and driving habits.

Looking Ahead

BMW’s i3 sedan is poised to redefine expectations for luxury EVs, blending cutting-edge battery tech, robust performance, and charging convenience. As the 2027 launch approaches, it could reshape the competitive landscape, offering EV enthusiasts a compelling alternative to the Tesla Model 3.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMW-M3-Neue-Klasse-EV-Marvel-0108.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 20:04:37.853815

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said today that he and two Democratic colleagues have written to Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders about the risks to K-12 funding posed by the Republican budget reconciliation proposal.

Projects supported by tax credits, which Republicans want to eliminate, have saved communities tens of thousands of dollars annually. Any cuts could delay or disrupt important, ongoing solar projects, prevent schools and school districts from having access to a tool to save on energy costs, and waste state and school district investments.

“By cutting federal clean energy incentives, the Republican budget reconciliation bill would interfere with K-12 school funding across the United States,” wrote Wyden, U.S. Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

“Clean energy projects can reduce monthly energy costs, allowing schools to spend more on supporting students, faculty, and staff,” Wyden, Markey and Schumer wrote to Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La. “With its draconian cuts to solar energy incentives, the Republican reconciliation bill promises to stall ongoing state and school district solar projects, disrupt their investments, and eliminate an essential cost-saving tool. We urge you to reconsider cuts to clean energy incentives that provide cost saving benefits to schools.”

Several stakeholders joined Wyden, Markey and Schumer in voicing their opposition to the proposed cuts.

“Across the country, school districts have been saving taxpayers money by taking advantage of clean energy tax credits through direct pay. These projects have created jobs, reduced energy costs, and opened up opportunities for school building improvements out of reach for too long. Rolling back the clean energy tax credits would stop that progress in its tracks and increase costs to local communities. It is critical that these important initiatives remain available to our schools,” said Jason Walsh, Executive Director of BlueGreen Alliance.

“School districts across the country have been using clean energy tax credits to lower their energy costs and upgrade their facilities. Investments in things like cleaner running buses and new HVAC systems are reducing both indoor and outdoor air pollution, all while creating good paying jobs. We urge Republican leaders to abandon their efforts to end these tax credits,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers.

“School districts across the country are attempting to move forward on sorely needed repairs and update their school buildings, and solar energy contributes important cost stability and resilience,” said Ally Talcott, Executive Director of the BASIC Coalition. “Our school leaders do not need whiplash amid the important work to finance improvements to our schools; they need support and stability. The cuts to solar energy incentives pull one more resource away from school districts trying to provide safe, modern, and healthy school buildings for their communities.”",https://www.wyden.senate.gov/themes/wyden/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 19:04:16.775663

In fact, oil prices fell sharply June 24, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict.

West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, fell 6% to $64.37 a barrel.

Don’t expect to see that drop in prices reflected immediately at the pump.

On June 26, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.22, 2 cents higher than last week and 27 cents cheaper than this time last year, according to AAA. The average in Texas is $2.82 per gallon.

Texas continues to play a key role in the nation’s and the world’s energy markets.

According to the Texas Oil and Gas Association’s estimates, Texas crude oil production remained steady at 5.7 million barrels per day in May 2025, while natural gas production reached a record 34.4 billion cubic feet per day.

In March, Texas exported $19.8 billion in energy products, a 2.6% increase year-over-year. Europe received 61% of Texas liquified-natural gas exports and 40% of crude oil exports.

From January through May 2025, Texas accounted for 42.2% of total U.S. crude oil production and 29.2% of U.S. marketed natural gas production.

One person involved in helping increase the state’s share of the energy market is longtime Fort Worth oil and gas executive Vaughn O. Vennerberg II. He was a former president and founder of Fort Worth-based XTO Energy who helped turn the company into the nation’s top domestic gas producer before it was eventually acquired by ExxonMobil in a $41 billion acquisition in 2010.

“A lot of the gas produced in Texas is actually exported, and that eats up a pretty good chunk of what we produce,” he said. “That’s a good thing, because you may be exporting that gas, but the revenues are generally staying in Texas.”

But there is still plenty for Texas consumers, businesses and power generation, he said.

“We produce a lot of dry gas, and that’s an even better gas because you don’t have to do much to it,” he said. That gas is sold to consumers for industrial uses and for energy production.

New data from the Texas Workforce Commission indicates that oil and gas employment related to drilling and production climbed by 2,200 in May compared to April and by an increase of 3.6% through the first five months of 2025.

Vennerberg said while much of the production is taking place in West Texas, Fort Worth benefits from all that activity.

“One reason XTO remained headquartered in Fort Worth was that people wanted to live here, and that’s still the case,” he said. “Yet, we still had access to West Texas and to our properties in East Texas. Fort Worth is seeing a lot of benefit from this increase in Texas production.”

Banking on wheels

First Bank Texas has rolled out a high-tech mobile banking branch across North and West Texas. The mobile branch will bring full-service banking and financial education directly to communities — from senior centers and schools to sports events and emergency response zones.

First Bank Texas cut the ribbon on the new mobile branch at its Willow Park location.

The bank on wheels is more than just a rolling cash dispenser. The high-tech mobile branch comes outfitted with full-service account support and instant-issue debit card printing — including mascot-branded cards at athletic events — as well as real-time video banking when more in-depth support is required.

First Bank Texas has locations in Bedford and Grapevine, as well as in 12 other locations around the area.

Pizza from the sky

DoorDash and Flytrex have launched drone delivery services in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. So far, drones are serving customers in parts of Little Elm and Frisco from dozens of local and national restaurants.

This marks Flytrex’s first third-party app integration, enabling customers to place orders directly through the DoorDash app. Eligible customers can select drone delivery at checkout, with orders prepared at restaurants and flown to their homes. The service currently reaches over 30,000 households and the company promises more sites in the area soon.

Currently, Flytrex drones can carry up to 6.6 pounds and next-generation models will increase capacity to 8.8 pounds.

More pickleball!

Fort Construction has announced it is the general contractor for a new pickleball center in Fort Worth: City Pickle USA. This facility is part of a 148-acre mixed-use development known as North City, located near Interstate 35W, Highway 287 and North Tarrant Parkway and near the Andretti Indoor Karting & Games.

The site will have 10 indoor courts and six outdoor courts as well as a sports bar, a pro shop, a gym, a private party room, locker rooms, an infrared sauna and a cold plunge. According to information filed with the state, the project will cost $2.8 million.

Tax breaks, part II

On June 24, the city of Fort Worth approved tax breaks for Wistron Corp., a Taiwan-based electronic manufacturer looking to open plants to support Nvidia’s artificial intelligence efforts.

Wistron is considering two plants valued at $687 million and creating 888 jobs in north Fort Worth, but other cities are also competing for the plants.

Denton County commissioners are expected to vote on tax breaks at their July 8 meeting.

Musk warns of massive job losses and EV industry collapse as key tax credits face sudden expiration.

Political fallout deepens as Musk breaks ranks with Trump, signaling a shift in GOP-tech alliances.

Elon Musk has ignited a fresh political storm, blasting the U.S. Senate’s latest version of former President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill as “utterly insane and destructive.” In a strongly worded post on X, Musk warned that the legislation could eliminate millions of American jobs and severely harm emerging industries crucial to the nation’s economic future.

The contentious bill, which reconfigures funding priorities across energy and industrial sectors, significantly slashes support for clean energy initiatives such as solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs). At the same time, it reintroduces tax breaks and incentives favoring coal and other traditional energy sources, an apparent nod to Trump’s longstanding support for legacy industries.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, did not hold back. “This bill is a disgusting abomination,” he wrote, accusing lawmakers of “betting on the past instead of building the future.” He argued that the new provisions would derail U.S. leadership in clean technology and cripple the electric vehicle market, noting that key tax credits are set to expire abruptly on September 30.

Elon Musk Political Fallout as Trump Alliance Crumbles

This latest outburst marks a dramatic turn in Musk’s political trajectory. Once considered a key ally to Trump, with close ties to the GOP during the 2024 campaign season, Elon Musk’s influence has waned following a controversial tenure leading the now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency.

His past involvement in derailing a major spending bill in December 2024 nearly triggered a federal shutdown after his criticism pushed several Republican lawmakers to withdraw support.

But with his political capital diminished and his relationship with Trump frayed, Musk’s latest pushback may be more symbolic than strategic. Even so, some fiscally conservative Republicans in the Senate echoed his concerns online, potentially complicating the bill’s path to passage.

“Shame on those who supported it. Deep down, you know it was wrong,” Musk posted in another fiery comment, rallying public opinion against what he sees as short-sighted policymaking.

Trump Ignores Musk as GOP Feud Grows

The feud has added new volatility to Republican politics just as Trump tries to consolidate his influence in Washington. Trump, for his part, has brushed off the conflict. “We’ve got more important things to focus on,” he said in a recent statement, redirecting attention to economic negotiations and a new round of trade talks with China.

Meanwhile, insiders say Trump has no intention of reaching out to Musk, despite the tech mogul’s apparent hope for reconciliation. In the background, Musk has reportedly considered backing primary challengers to GOP lawmakers who vote in favor of the bill, a move that could reshape key midterm battles.

For now, the standoff between Trump and Musk underscores the growing rift between old-guard conservatism and a new wave of tech-driven economic priorities. With the fate of clean energy subsidies hanging in the balance, the next few weeks in Washington may determine whether that gap widens or begins to close.","https://spcdn.shortpixel.ai/spio/ret_img,q_cdnize,to_auto,s_webp:avif/www.tronweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Tronweekly-image-2-1.jpg",N,,2025-06-29 22:03:33.675093

Nuclear: A Delicate Balancing Act While nuclear retains its tax credit, the FEOC restrictions complicate its path.","The U.S. Senate's revised megabill has ignited a seismic shift in the energy sector, transforming tax policy into a weapon that reshapes investment landscapes overnight. By accelerating the phaseout of wind and solar tax credits, imposing punitive excise taxes, and favoring geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen projects, the legislation has created a high-risk, high-reward environment for investors. This article dissects the policy's implications and outlines actionable strategies to capitalize on its fallout.

The Megabill's Dual Edges: Punishment and Preference

The megabill's most immediate blow targets solar and wind energy. The repeal of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for these sectors—effective immediately—eliminates critical financial incentives just as global demand for clean energy surges. Projects must now be operational by December 31, 2027, to qualify for any remaining credits, a sharp contrast to earlier timelines. Meanwhile, an excise tax (30% for solar, 50% for wind) penalizes projects using components from “Foreign Entities of Concern” (FEOCs), primarily China.

For investors, this creates a stark bifurcation:

- Solar/Wind Firms Dependent on Chinese Supply Chains: High risk. Companies relying on FEOC-linked materials face soaring costs and compliance hurdles.

- Geothermal, Nuclear, and Hydrogen Projects: Suddenly advantaged. These sectors retain tax credits until 2036 and are exempt from the excise taxes, though they must navigate FEOC restrictions after two years of the bill's enactment.

Geothermal: The Quiet Powerhouse

Geothermal energy, often overlooked, emerges as a sleeper play. Unlike intermittent renewables like solar or wind, geothermal provides baseload power with minimal supply chain exposure. The megabill's Nuclear Tax Credit (45U) now includes FEOC restrictions but retains its value for projects avoiding prohibited entities.

Key Plays:

- Ormat Technologies (ORA): A leader in geothermal power plants and recovered energy systems. Its diversified portfolio and focus on U.S. projects position it to benefit from tax credits without FEOC entanglements.

- Calpine Corporation (CPN): Though not purely geothermal, its diversified energy assets and existing geothermal infrastructure offer exposure to this underappreciated sector.

Hydrogen: The Race Against the Clock

The megabill's Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V) now requires projects to begin construction by January 1, 2028, a seven-year acceleration from prior deadlines. This creates urgency—and opportunity—for companies capable of rapid scaling.

Top Picks:

- Plug Power (PLUG): A pioneer in hydrogen fuel cells and green hydrogen production. Its partnerships with industrial giants and early-mover advantage could pay off if it meets the 2028 deadline.

- Bloom Energy (BE): Specializes in hydrogen-based solid-oxide fuel cells. Its technology is primed for industrial decarbonization, a key megabill beneficiary.

Nuclear: A Delicate Balancing Act

While nuclear retains its tax credit, the FEOC restrictions complicate its path. Imported nuclear fuel from prohibited nations after 2027 is banned, forcing reliance on domestic or approved suppliers.

Risks vs. Rewards:

- Westinghouse Electric (a subsidiary of Brookfield Business Partners): Faces challenges in securing uranium and components, but its small modular reactor (SMR) projects could thrive if supply chains adapt.

- NuScale Power (a subsidiary of Fluor Corporation (FLR)): Its SMR technology, designed for U.S. supply chains, may avoid FEOC pitfalls.

Solar/Wind: Proceed with Extreme Caution

The megabill's excise taxes and credit phaseouts have turned solar and wind into high-risk bets unless companies meet two criteria:

1. Supply Chain Independence: Firms like First Solar (FSLR), which uses domestically produced panels, may weather the storm.

2. Diversification: Companies with revenue streams beyond the U.S. (e.g., NextEra Energy (NEE) in international markets) could soften domestic policy blows.

Immediate Investment Actions

Rotate Out of Solar/Wind: Reduce exposure to firms with FEOC-linked supply chains. Use the excise tax penalty as a screening tool.

Embrace Geothermal and Hydrogen: Allocate 20–30% of energy portfolios to these sectors. Target companies with clear 2028 construction milestones (e.g., Plug Power) or FEOC-free supply chains (e.g., Ormat).

Monitor FEOC Compliance: Prioritize companies with transparent supply chain audits.

Avoid Methane-Related Stocks: The decade-long delay in methane fees undermines investments in methane-reduction tech (e.g., Aeroflex (TCI)).

Conclusion: Policy as a Catalyst for Disruption

The Senate's megabill isn't just a tax shift—it's a market realignment. Geothermal and hydrogen, once niche plays, now sit at the intersection of policy tailwinds and investor demand. Meanwhile, solar and wind firms face a reckoning over their supply chain choices. Investors who pivot quickly to tax-advantaged, FEOC-compliant sectors can turn regulatory chaos into profitable advantage.

The energy sector has reached its crossroads. The question now is: Which path will your portfolio take?",,N,,2025-06-29 19:04:31.757921

“Again, $1.6 trillion in spending cuts by eliminating the Green New Deal tax credits.","Key Republican senators pushed back Sunday against criticism of cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill, including Medicaid work restrictions and the elimination of many green energy subsidies.

The Senate version of President Trump’s signature tax and spending legislation imposes 80 hours a month work requirements on able-bodied adults, including those with children ages 15 and up. It also reduces the health care provider tax, which helps fund state Medicaid plans.

Critics argue that those changes could result in millions of people losing access to Medicaid, which provides health care to over 70 million low-income Americans.

“There’s 35 million people under the poverty line inside the United States, and there’s 70 million people that are signed up for Medicaid,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday.

“What we are focused on is making sure that Medicaid is there for people in the future that need it and get rid of the fraud, waste and abuse.”

Medicaid reform is the largest source of savings in the megabill, with the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimating the legislative bundle would reduce Medicaid costs by about $930 billion over the next decade.

Several senators have been uneasy about the Medicaid reform in the Senate bill, which goes further than the House version of the megabill. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), for example, voted against proceeding with the bill Saturday, citing Medicaid as his top concern.

“I cannot support this bill in its current form. It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities,” Tillis said in a statement Saturday.

“This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) had raged against the Medicaid provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, but stopped short of opposing the measure.

“We can’t be cutting health care for working people and for poor people in order to constantly give special tax treatment to corporations and other entities,” Hawley told NBC News last week.

The Senate bill includes bigger cuts to business taxes, including a permanent deductions for R&D spending.

Despite those concerns, key senators defended the Medicaid reforms on the Sunday shows as the Senate forges ahead with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“The entitlement spending in this nation is absolutely out of control. You can rewind back to the 1960s, when actual mandatory spending, which is what these entitlements are, only made up about a third of federal spending,” Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday.

“Now, if you take that, plus the interest on our debt, it’s about 73 percent of what we spend.”

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) also touted plans to consider an amendment that would ensure illegal immigrants don’t get access to Medicaid.

“Remember, the Medicaid reforms in this bill are about work requirements and taking illegals off of Medicaid,” Banks told “Fox News Sunday.”

Another closely watched amendment from Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) would lower the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which determines the percentage of Medicaid costs covered by Uncle Sam.

Scott’s amendment would lower FMAP for able-bodied, childless adults. The amendment has been used to win over fiscal hawks such as Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who had threatened to vote against the megabill due to concerns about the deficit.

In addition to the Medicaid reform, senators also defended the cuts to Biden-era renewable energy subsidies, something that has infuriated tech mogul and one-time Trump “first buddy” Elon Musk.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk fumed on X Saturday. “Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

The Senate version of the megabill significantly rolls back tax credits for green energy in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and requires key projects to go into service by the conclusion of 2027 to qualify.

It also features an excise tax that takes aim at solar and wind projects.

“Again, $1.6 trillion in spending cuts by eliminating the Green New Deal tax credits. Those scams that were passed during the Biden administration,” Banks added. “Much of it is phased out in a quick period of time over the next two or three years.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/newspress-collage-690ljf9uz-1751223146374.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1751208757&w=1024,N,,2025-06-29 18:06:10.882737

The Senate’s 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” largely mirrors the House’s version, stuffed with an Utz Pub Mix of Republican priorities. The centerpiece is $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts that extend Trump’s cuts from 2017 and tack on new ones, including deductions for taxes on tips and overtime. Among other measures, the bill would also ramp up spending for defense and immigration enforcement, scale back Medicaid, and wind down tax credits for EVs and other renewable energy projects more quickly than the House version.

Musk called that “utterly insane and destructive”

In a series of X posts on Saturday, Tesla CEO and top Trump campaign donor Elon Musk ripped into the bill as giving “handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging the industries of the future.”

The Senate’s bill would strip tax incentives for wind and solar projects that aren’t “placed in service” by the end of 2027—and adds a tax that would burden new developments. It would also eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs by Sept. 30, an earlier deadline than the House version. Trump has called green energy tax credits “a giant SCAM” and said the money should be redirected to other uses. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently labeled technologies such as wind and solar a “parasite on the [power] grid, because you just make the other sources turn up and down as you come and go.”

Musk and other renewable energy advocates say that cutting off tax credits for solar and wind development would raise electricity prices, cede energy dominance to China, and hamstring the US’ electrical grid at a time when AI data centers are supercharging demand for power. The construction industry is also concerned about significant job losses: North America’s Building Trades Unions said the bill “stands to be the biggest job-killing bill” in US history, “equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f7b192ee5adb825c3fd87f5c8c243be9d61282d-4500x3000.jpg?rect=0,318,4500,2363&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-06-29 17:05:04.239449

“If you get rid of the tax credits, you are increasing the capital costs that utilities will have to pay to get new power,” Flakoll said.","(Bloomberg) —

The current version of President Donald Trump’s centerpiece tax and spending bill would winnow the amount of renewable energy capacity the US adds over the next decade, according to a report released Wednesday by BloombergNEF.

Wind, solar and storage capacity overall would drop by 10% by 2035 relative to a baseline scenario, the research firm finds. The bill would also result in 3.8 million more tons of carbon emissions from the country’s power sector by 2050.

The impact on wind power would be most severe, with new capacity shrinking by 35% and no offshore wind additions after 2028. Solar and energy storage capacity stand to fare better, falling 5% and 7%, respectively.

Initially, there would be a short-term rush to get projects under construction to claim tax credits before they expire. Then, in 2029, the new capacity would fall off, BNEF says.

On a longer-term horizon, though, the forecast for the renewables sector improves. New capacity for wind and solar collectively would only be 1% lower in 2050. That’s due in part to the rise in power demand from data centers and EV adoption.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill,” passed by the House of Representatives last month, has now gone to the Senate, where changes are expected. The final House version of the legislation includes a swift phaseout of the clean electricity tax credits in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

For new, non-nuclear clean power projects, the credits would only be available if a project begins construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law and if it also starts operating before the end of 2028. A 30% credit for residential solar would expire at the end of this year.

Building less new clean energy “would have negative effects on the US power system,” the BNEF authors write. “In most regional power markets, renewables can be added to the system more quickly than other generation sources like gas-fired power plants. In addition, it is very challenging to simply build a new gas plant given the market shortage of turbines.”

One result would be higher electricity prices for US households and businesses, said Derrick Flakoll, a BNEF senior policy associate and an author of the report.

“If you get rid of the tax credits, you are increasing the capital costs that utilities will have to pay to get new power,” Flakoll said. “That’s going to be passed down to the consumers, who are going to have higher rates.”

The initial draft released by Senate Republicans earlier this month cut the credit for any wind and solar projects that did not “begin construction” by certain dates, while the latest version bases incentives on when projects actually begin producing electricity — a much higher bar to clear.

The first draft gave any project that began construction this year full credit, any project that began construction next year 60 percent credit and any project that began construction in 2027 20 percent of the credit, before phasing out thereafter.

The new legislation instead says that the credits will only apply to facilities that begin producing electricity before the end of 2027.

In addition, it imposes a new tax on some wind and solar projects that are placed in service after 2027.

The projects will be taxed if a certain percentage of the value of their components come from China.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including renewable energy. These subsidies were expected to massively reduce the U.S.’s planet-warming emissions.

The GOP’s cuts to the credits are expected to severely curtail those gains.

If they pass, the cuts represent a win for the party’s right flank, which has pushed for major cuts to the credits, and a loss for it’s more moderate wing, which has called for a slower phaseout.

The renewables lobby slammed the changes as hampering the sector.

“In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry. It is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a written statement.

“These new taxes will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment,” he added.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/06/AP25106132156416-e1745956554264.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-29 19:04:36.655688

While, President Donald Trump threatened Senate Republicans who defy him and his “Big, Beautiful Bill” as the legislation cleared a key test vote in a dramatic night in the upper chamber of Congress.","Elon Musk has slammed the Senate version of President Donald Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" as support for the motion to proceed with the legislation in the upper chamber comes down to the wire. ""The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!"" Musk wrote on X on Saturday afternoon. ""Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" Senate Republicans dropped the final text of the sprawling 940-page bill late on Friday evening.

Trump has said he wanted the Senate to pass the legislation — which would include sweeping spending cuts to pay for the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017, increased spending for the military, oil exploration, and immigration enforcement —before the July 4th weekend. Republicans, who have 53 seats, plan to pass the bill using the process of budget reconciliation. That would allow them to sidestep a filibuster from the Democrats as long as the legislation relates to the budget. For the past week, the Senate parliamentarian's office has issued advisories about which parts do not comply with the rules of reconciliation. The biggest sticking point was major changes to Medicaid. Specifically, the legislation would require that Medicaid recipients who are able-bodied and without dependent children would have to work or participate in community service or education for 80 hours a month. In addition, the legislation limits the amount of money states can tax health care providers like hospitals and nursing homes to raise money for Medicaid.

But the American Hospital Association said this would devastate rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid dollars. The parliamentarian removed the provider tax provision, but the new version of the bill simply delays when the cap goes into effect. Before the text dropped, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who hails from a state with a large number of rural hospitals and that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act in 2023, said he was a ""no"" on the motion to proceed because of Medicaid. ""It will cause a lot of people to have to be moved off of Medicaid,"" he told The Independent on Friday evening. ""Is just inescapable. The price tag's too high, and the transition protocol, even if you agree with the ultimate target."" In addition, the legislation also rolls back some of the renewable energy tax credits implemented in the Inflation Reduction Act, the legislation former President Joe Biden signed that used the same budget reconciliation process.

If the bill passes the Senate, it will return to the House of Representatives, which passed it last month. But plenty of conservatives have made objections to the Senate's changes. Trump lobbied senators on Saturday while playing golf with Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. Tillis, who's up for re-election in 2028, outlined his opposition to the bill again on Saturday, saying in a statement that ""It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.""

Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana wrote on X ahead of the vote on Saturday, ""I have just concluded productive discussions with leadership. I will be leading an amendment to strip the sale of public lands from this bill. I will vote yes on the motion to proceed. We must quickly pass the Big Beautiful Bill to advance President Trump's agenda."" While, President Donald Trump threatened Senate Republicans who defy him and his “Big, Beautiful Bill” as the legislation cleared a key test vote in a dramatic night in the upper chamber of Congress. After negotiations dragged on for hours Saturday evening, the Senate voted 51 to 49 to open a debate on the legislation, moving one step closer to landing the bill on Trump’s desk by his self-imposed Fourth of July deadline.",https://www.gulftoday.ae/gulftoday/uploads/images/2025/06/29/977693.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 19:04:24.291488

After Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough blocked Sen. Mike Lee's (R-Utah) initial public land sale policy earlier this week, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources chair tried to sneak in an amended version late Friday. However, as the chamber's Republicans scrambled to generate enough support for a procedural vote Saturday night, Lee announced the withdrawal of his provision from the package.

""This is a momentous win for conservation and a powerful reminder that Americans deeply value our public lands and waters. That was made crystal clear by the remarkable, bipartisan outcry opposing the liquidation of our natural heritage,"" said Tom Kiernan, president and CEO of American Rivers. ""Future generations should be able to continue to use these lands for fishing, rafting, hiking, and swimming, and to enjoy the clean water that begins in these priceless places. It is our responsibility to protect that legacy.""

Athan Manuel, director of the Sierra Club's Lands Protection Program, said that ""from the moment Mike Lee first introduced this proposal, Americans across the political spectrum have made it clear they oppose selling off the natural heritage of our public lands to fund tax cuts for billionaires—not now, not ever. This is a victory for everyone who hikes, hunts, explores, and cherishes these places, but it's not the end of the threats to our public lands.""

U.S. President Donald Trump ""and his allies in Congress have made it clear they will use every tool at their disposal to give away our public lands to billionaires and corporate polluters, whether it's Mike Lee's fire sale, leasing them to Big Oil CEOs for pennies on the dollar, or gutting the permitting and oversight process for industrial development,"" Manuel warned. ""This fight isn't over, and we are going to keep working to keep the 'public' in public lands.""

Anna Peterson, executive director of the Mountain Pact, which works with over 100 communities on climate, outdoor recreation, and public lands policy, said that ""as millions of Americans and western communities have reminded people again and again over the past few weeks, public lands are bipartisan, deeply revered, sustain our communities, power our economies, and serve as the cornerstone of our outdoor way of life. We must remain steadfast in our commitment to defending public lands, and continue to fight to make sure they remain where they belong forever: in public hands.""

The Natural Resources Defense Council had criticized both the axed public land sale provision and attacks on renewable energy, which remain in the megabill. NRDC executive director Christy Goldfuss said that ""the new budget reconciliation bill text is a shocking fossil fuels industry fever dream come to life. The corruption on display is galling.""

""The bill has gone from fossil fuels boosterism to an active effort from Congress to kill wind and solar energy in the United States. This cannot be viewed as anything other than a 'Trump energy tax,'"" Goldfuss said, blasting Republican plans to not only end incentives for renewable energy, but also impose new taxes on wind and solar generation.

""This bill was already going to force the biggest utility bill increase in history, but the new language can only be interpreted as a corrupt effort to advance oil, gas, and coal on the backs of everyday Americans,"" she continued. ""This is a shocking effort to manipulate energy markets, siphon money from every household in the country, kill jobs, and shut down the fastest growing segment of the energy economy--all to enrich the barons at the helm of the most profitable enterprise in history.""

Referencing one of Trump's early executive orders, Goldfuss added that ""the administration claims that we are in an energy emergency, making it the wrong time to choke off the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy sources of energy.""

Adrian Deveny, founder and president of policy advisory firm Climate Vision and a former policy director to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), toldPolitico: ""It's a kill shot. This new excise tax on wind and solar is designed to fully kill the industry.""

Costa Samaras, a clean energy leader in former Democratic President Joe Biden's White House, also warned on the social media network Bluesky on Saturday that the policy would kill Americans.

""The new bill in Congress puts a new tax on wind and solar. They're taxing clean energy to give your money to billionaires,"" Samaras said. ""Taxing clean energy and making it harder for new clean energy to be built in the U.S. at a time when the grid is under increasing stress from extreme weather, will lead to people dying in heatwaves.""

""They are taxing wind and solar power. Not just taking away the credits in Biden's climate law. But actively taxing wind and solar. My god this bill is terrible,"" he continued. ""If you have a [Republican] representative, call and leave a message saying you don't want to raise taxes on clean energy... If you're a reporter, there's a story here. Why is the Senate putting the grid and Americans' lives at risk?""

Senate Democrats are also speaking out about the GOP assault on renewable energy. Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) are among those sounding the alarm.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61118532&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C43%2C0%2C44,N,,2025-06-29 20:04:51.492833

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans are moving forward on President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill that includes major elements of his domestic agenda.

The Senate advanced the bill and is set to consider numerous amendments before final passage. The bill will then return to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. Here are some details of what is in the bill:

TEMPORARY VS. PERMANENT TAX BREAKS

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the version of the bill the Senate moved ahead on Saturday night will add about $3.2 trillion to the nation’s debt over the next decade. That’s higher than the estimated $2.8 trillion cost of the version of the bill passed by the House last month, largely because the Senate version makes permanent an array of tax cuts that the House version would have allowed to expire in a few years.

STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION

The Senate version raises to $40,000 the maximum deduction for state and local tax payments, with annual inflation adjustments. That deduction will revert to its current $10,000 level after 2029. An earlier version agreed to in the House would have kept the deduction at $40,000 after 2026.

DEDUCTION FOR OLDER AMERICANS

The Senate bill would provide a federal income tax deduction of $6,000 per year for people over 65, the earlier House version would have offered a $4,000 deduction. Both would end after 2028.

NO TAX ON TIPS

The Senate bill would provide a deduction of up to $25,000 for tipped income through 2028. The House version would not cap the deduction.

RETALIATORY (SECTION 899) TAX

Both the House and Senate initially included a provision that would have allowed the U.S. to impose new taxes on residents, businesses and other entities from countries that are found to impose ""unfair foreign taxes.""

However, this section was removed after advice from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said his tax negotiations with G7 nations were progressing.

DEBT CEILING

The Senate bill would raise the nation’s debt ceiling by $5 trillion; the House version had called for a $4 trillion increase. Congress must act on this by sometime this summer or risk triggering a default on the nation’s $36.2 trillion in debt.

CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS

The Senate bill would roll back clean-energy incentives created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, effectively repealing the incentives for solar and wind immediately. The Senate language also proposes a new tax on these projects if they cannot prove their products are made without Chinese parts, as well as a new tax break for coal production.

MEDICAID

Both bills would clamp down on ""provider taxes,"" which states levy on Medicaid providers as a way to boost federal funding. The Senate version delays the implementation of these changes until 2028, when these provider taxes would start to gradually decrease. The Senate also included an extra $25 billion for rural hospitals after several Republican senators balked at how these changes could impact providers in their states.

SPORTS TEAMS

The Senate version does not include language from the House bill that would have cut a tax break for sports-team owners in half.

COURTS

The current version of the Senate bill omits language meant to limit U.S. judges’ power to block federal policies nationwide, after the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian ruled the policy does not align with the chamber’s rules for this specific budget process.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXMPEL5H0R3_L.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 19:04:28.517592

Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.
The budget reconciliation bill has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.","A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.

“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code.

The budget reconciliation bill has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota.

Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota.

The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.”

Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate.

The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate.

“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline.

In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland.

“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read.

Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety.

According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually.

The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter.

“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read.

A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion.

The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.”

Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.

The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.

The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher.

“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”

Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

While the legislation risks stranding over $500 billion in planned investments and triggering job losses, it also creates opportunities for investors to target resilient subsectors poised to thrive amid the policy overhaul. Here's how to navigate the chaos.

Geothermal and Nuclear Power: The Last Standing Tax Credit Winners

The Senate bill's most striking omission is its relative leniency toward geothermal and advanced nuclear energy. Unlike solar and wind, which face full credit eliminations by 2028, geothermal credits sunset in 2032—a three-year reprieve. Nuclear's Production Tax Credit (PTC) also survives until 2031.

This creates a rare investing angle: geothermal and small modular reactors (SMRs). Companies like Ormat Technologies (NYSE: ORM), a geothermal leader with 700 MW of operational capacity, could see renewed interest. Meanwhile, NuScale Power (backed by Fluor Corporation) is advancing SMR projects with federal support.

Energy Storage: The Silent Powerhouse

While the bill eliminates credits for wind and solar, it leaves energy storage largely unscathed. Storage systems (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) remain eligible for credits if paired with non-solar/wind projects. This creates a two-pronged opportunity:

Flow Battery Innovators: Companies like Form Energy and EnerVenue are developing long-duration storage technologies that don't rely on volatile lithium markets.

Grid-Scale Software: Firms like Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) dominate software solutions for integrating storage with fossil fuels or nuclear plants.

Tesla's Powerwall and grid-scale Megapacks are already deployed in projects with utilities like Pacific Gas & Electric.

Critical Minerals and Domestic Manufacturing: The China Play

The bill's ""prohibited foreign entity"" (PFE) rules—which restrict tax credits for projects using materials from nations like China—have backfired. Instead of stifling clean energy, they've created a domestic manufacturing boom for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths.

Investors should focus on U.S.-based miners and recyclers:

- American Manganese (AMYNF) is developing lithium extraction from Nevada's Clayton Valley.

- American Rare Earths (AREC) aims to supply domestic neodymium (key for wind turbine magnets).

- Redwood Materials (backed by Toyota) recycles battery metals, reducing reliance on Chinese imports.

The Bipartisan Bet: Offshore Wind Survives the Ax

Though onshore wind faces credit eliminations, offshore wind—a priority for coastal Republicans and Democrats—retains eligibility. The bill's domestic content rules even incentivize U.S. manufacturing of turbines.

Investors should track:

- Ørsted (ORSTED.CO): A Danish leader in U.S. offshore projects, partnering with Dominion Energy.

- General Electric (GE): Its Haliade-X turbine is central to Virginia's 2.5 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.

The Contrarian Play: EVs After the Credit Cliff

The bill's elimination of EV tax credits by early 2026 has spooked investors, but it also accelerates a market reality check. Companies with strong balance sheets and non-U.S. markets (e.g., Europe's robust subsidies) will outlast weaker peers.

Focus on:

- Rivian (RIVN): Its $5 billion in cash and focus on luxury off-road EVs may weather the storm.

- NIO (NIO): A China-based firm already succeeding without U.S. subsidies.

Investment Strategy: Buy the Dip, Target Resilience

Short-Term Volatility: Expect market swings as the bill's details sink in. Use dips to buy companies with domestic supply chains and non-solar/wind revenue streams.

Long-Term Themes: Geothermal, nuclear, and energy storage are structural winners. Pair these with critical minerals plays for a diversified portfolio.

Avoid the Obvious: Steer clear of pure-play solar and wind developers (e.g., NextEra Energy's solar divisions) unless they pivot to storage or geothermal.

The Senate bill isn't a death knell for clean energy—it's a reshuffling of the deck. Investors who focus on policy-resistant subsectors and U.S. manufacturing resilience will find value in the chaos.

Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, posted on his social media platform X about the bill, which the Senate advanced in a contentious vote late Saturday. Musk recently left Trump’s side after working for several months as the head of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

The bill would destroy millions of U.S. jobs and give “handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Musk said.

The tech billionaire’s latest criticism of the package threatens to reawaken his public rift with Trump that began after the world’s richest man left his cost-cutting job in the administration.

Trump was asked about Musk in an interview that was recorded on Friday before the billionaire’s most recent posts.

“I haven’t spoken to him much, but I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he’s going to do well always,” Trump said on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” with Maria Bartiromo, which aired Sunday. “But he got a little bit upset, and you know that wasn’t appropriate.”

The Senate tax bill would bring a quicker end to a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles.

While the earlier proposal would have ended the incentive at the end of this year for most EV sales, the new version terminates the credit after Sept. 30. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.

These shifts are creating fertile ground for investment in renewable energy infrastructure, from solar farms in the Sahara to lithium mines in Chile. Yet the path to resilient growth is fraught with complexity, requiring investors to navigate policy shifts, supply chain risks, and regional disparities.

The Geopolitical Catalyst: Energy Security Over Climate Ideals

The Ukraine war, the Gaza conflict, and rising U.S.-China tensions have redefined energy priorities. Once a climate-centric issue, renewables are now a tool for geopolitical stability. Countries are pivoting to secure energy supplies, favoring diversified mixes of LNG, nuclear, and renewables. The U.S. National Energy Emergency Declaration of 2025 and the EU's revival of coal imports highlight this shift.

This has paradoxically boosted renewables. Fossil fuel volatility and climate risks are pushing governments to double down on clean energy. The World Bank's revised energy strategy, now open to natural gas projects in developing nations, reflects this pragmatism. For investors, this means opportunities in regions where energy poverty meets strategic mineral wealth.

Regional Hotspots for Renewable Growth

China: The manufacturing powerhouse is projected to install nearly 60% of global renewable capacity by 2030. Its solar panel output capacity hit 1,100 GW by late 2024, but overproduction has slashed prices and strained margins. Investors should focus on firms with exposure to advanced technologies like perovskite solar cells or those pivoting to energy storage.

The U.S.: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is reshaping the landscape. Tax credits and grants under the IRA could deploy 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030. However, U.S. solar manufacturing costs remain 3x higher than China's. Look to firms like First Solar, which is scaling cadmium-telluride panels, or storage innovators like Tesla's Megapack.

Africa: Over 600 million people lack electricity, yet the continent's solar and hydro potential is vast. The African Union's endorsement of natural gas and nuclear energy opens doors for gas-to-power projects and hydropower (e.g., the Grand Inga Dam). Risks include financing gaps and resource nationalism. Investors should pair with partners like the African Development Bank or Gulf nations for risk mitigation.

Latin America: Chile's lithium reserves and Brazil's biofuel capacity are magnets for EV and renewable developers. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy and China's Belt and Road Initiative are competing for influence here. Look to firms like SQM (lithium) or AES (wind/solar) with diversified regional portfolios.

Critical Sectors to Watch

Solar Manufacturing: China dominates, but U.S. reshoring via firms like 1366 Technologies (silicon innovation) offers niche opportunities.

Energy Storage: Long-duration storage (LDES) is critical for grid stability. Iron-air batteries (e.g., Form Energy) and green hydrogen projects in Australia and the Middle East are key.

Critical Minerals: Lithium, cobalt, and copper are the new oil. Firms like Albemarle (lithium) and First Quantum Minerals (copper) benefit, but ethical sourcing and ESG compliance are non-negotiable.

Carbon Removal: Renewables-powered direct air capture (DAC) is emerging. Carbon Engineering and Climeworks are early leaders, but scalability and policy support (e.g., IRS Section 45Q tax credits) are critical.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies

Policy Volatility: The U.S. election in 2024 could reverse IRA subsidies. Diversify across regions with stable frameworks, like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive.

Supply Chain Bottlenecks: Critical minerals shortages could delay projects. Invest in recycling startups like Li-Cycle or firms with vertically integrated supply chains.

Financing Barriers: Africa and Latin America need $400 billion annually for energy SDGs. Engage with blended finance instruments (e.g., World Bank guarantees) or green bonds.

Investment Recommendations

Equity Plays:

First Solar (FSLR): U.S. leader in thin-film solar with IRA tailwinds.

NextEra Energy (NEE): U.S. renewables giant with 60 GW of wind/solar capacity.

Albemarle (ALB): Lithium supplier to EV manufacturers.

ETFs:

Invesco Solar ETF (TAN): Tracks global solar stocks.

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN): Diversified exposure to renewables.

Infrastructure Funds:

BlackRock Global Renewable Power Fund: Focuses on developed-market projects.

African Infrastructure Investment Manager (AIIM): Targets sub-Saharan grid and solar initiatives.

Conclusion

Renewables are no longer just a climate solution—they're a geopolitical imperative. Investors must prioritize resilience: diversify geographically, bet on storage and minerals, and favor firms with ESG rigor. While risks like overcapacity and policy whiplash persist, the long-term trajectory is clear. The energy transition is here to stay, and those who align with its geopolitical and environmental drivers will reap rewards.",,N,,2025-06-29 22:04:33.149772

But in Q2 2025, its earnings report revealed a stark truth: even a logistics giant is vulnerable to the cascading effects of energy cost volatility and geopolitical turbulence. With adjusted EPS guidance slashed to $19–$20 and fuel-related costs squeezing margins, FedEx exemplifies a broader vulnerability—businesses unprepared for the energy demands of the AI revolution.

Why Energy Infrastructure is the New ""Toll Booth"" for Tech Growth

Modern nuclear power plant supporting data centers, symbolizing the synergy between energy infrastructure and AI growth

As AI systems like OpenAI's GPT-5 consume energy equivalent to small cities, the world faces a looming crisis: how to power this transformation without destabilizing economies. Here's where nuclear and LNG infrastructure companies—often overlooked—step into the spotlight. Unlike FedEx, which is a passive victim of external shocks, these firms are positioned as active beneficiaries of AI's energy crunch.

The FedEx Paradox: A Cautionary Tale

FedEx's Q2 struggles highlight three existential risks for non-infrastructure plays:

1. Energy Cost Sensitivity: Rising jet fuel prices (driven by Middle East tensions and supply constraints) eroded margins, despite $540M in cost savings from its DRIVE program.

2. Geopolitical Whiplash: The expiration of its U.S. Postal Service contract and trade disputes with China cut revenue by 1%, while regulatory shifts in data privacy and labor costs added headwinds.

3. Demand Volatility: AI-driven industries like e-commerce and cloud computing require baseload energy stability, which FedEx's variable-cost model can't guarantee.

The Winners: Infrastructure Plays with AI Tailwinds

The real opportunity lies in companies building the energy “rails” for AI's growth. These firms offer three critical advantages:

- Regulatory Tailwinds: Trump's “America First” energy policies fast-track LNG exports and nuclear approvals.

- Inelastic Demand: Data centers and AI labs require 24/7 power, creating “toll booth” revenue streams.

- Hedge Fund Validation: Institutions like Coatue and Viking Global are quietly accumulating stakes in this sector.

1. Dominion Energy (D): The Grid's Unsung Hero

Why It's Undervalued: Trading at 17x forward P/E with a 4.2% dividend, Dominion has 20-year contracts supplying nuclear power to hyperscale data centers.

Cramer's Angle: “Dominion isn't a gamble—it's a sure bet for the energy backbone of AI,” the Mad Money host recently noted.

Growth Catalyst: Its Cove Point LNG terminal is expanding capacity, tapping into Europe's post-Ukraine war energy needs.

2. Oklo (OKLO): Nuclear's Disruptor

The AI Connection: Backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, Oklo's small modular reactors (SMRs) can be deployed near data centers, offering carbon-free power at 50% lower costs than traditional plants.

Valuation Play: At $9B valuation, Oklo is 30% undervalued compared to peers like NuScale (SMR), which surged 100% in Q2.

Policy Boost: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission fast-tracked permits for Oklo's Idaho plant, a first for SMR technology.

3. Vistra Corp (VST): The LNG/Nuclear Hybrid

Hedge Fund Play: Despite a 7M-share reduction by some funds, Vistra's 21% stake in Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi LNG terminal positions it to profit from Europe's LNG demand.

AI's Appetite: Its 1.2GW nuclear fleet supplies Alphabet's data centers in Texas, locking in long-term pricing.

Risk Mitigation: Unlike FedEx, Vistra's 4.5x debt-to-equity ratio is half that of traditional utilities.

Cramer's Contrarian Call: FOMO on Infrastructure, Not Tech

Jim Cramer's recent warnings crystallize the shift: “Don't chase overhyped AI stocks—buy the energy enablers.” While investors flock to nebulous “AI concepts,” infrastructure plays offer:

- Stable Cash Flows: Dominion's 2.5% yield vs. FedEx's 0.9% dividend.

- Geopolitical Hedge: LNG exporters like Dominion and BWX (notably absent from FDX's supply chain) benefit from U.S. energy dominance.

- AI's Hidden Costs: Every data center needs 24/7 power—making nuclear/LNG firms the unsung heroes of this revolution.

The Investment Thesis: Pivot to Energy Toll Booths

Buy Now or Pay Later:

- Dominion Energy (D): Target $85/share (20% upside from $70.50).

- Oklo (OKLO): Early-stage, but a $12B valuation by 2026 is achievable.

- Avoid: FedEx's stock, which faces a 15% downside risk if energy costs spike again.

Final Analysis: Energy is the New Gold

FedEx's struggles underscore a truth: in the AI era, energy infrastructure isn't a backwater—it's the new gold standard for growth. As global tensions and data demand collide, investors ignoring nuclear/LNG plays risk missing the next megatrend. The time to buy “boring” infrastructure stocks is now—before the FOMO crowd catches on.

Action Plan:

1. Add Dominion Energy (D) to your portfolio for steady income and growth.

2. Take a speculative position in Oklo (OKLO) for exponential upside.

3. Avoid chasing FedEx (FDX) until energy costs stabilize—a move that may never come.",,N,,2025-06-29 17:05:13.749860

After the disagreement between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, attention in Washington shifted to how this rift might impact the Republican tax bill and the billionaire's changing political agenda.","Billionaire Elon Musk criticized the latest version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill in the U.S. Senate on Saturday, June 28. Musk called the bill ""completely insane and destructive.""

In a post on X, Musk accused that the latest Senate bill would wipe out millions of jobs in the U.S. and severely harm the nation. He also claimed that the bill benefited outdated industries while greatly harming future industries.

The recent criticisms from the tech billionaire risk reigniting his public conflict with Trump, which began after the world's richest man stepped away from his cost-cutting role in the administration.

Musk strongly condemned Trump's tax and spending bill.

The new bill significantly cuts financial support for clean energy initiatives like wind, solar, and electric vehicle tax credits, while offering new incentives for the coal industry.

Musk had previously intervened to block a major spending bill. He opposed a government spending plan by posting about it online last December, causing many Republicans to withdraw their support and nearly triggering a government shutdown.

At that time, Musk had more power as Trump's close ally and the largest donor to Trump's reelection campaign. However, his influence within the Republican Party diminished after a controversial period when he led the Office of Government Efficiency, which created ongoing issues for the White House.

Additionally, in the tech entrepreneur's speech at the congressional debate on President Donald Trump's comprehensive tax and spending bill, he called the bill ""an abhorrent disgrace"" that could cause the federal budget deficit to soar.

Some fiscally conservative Republicans in the U.S. Senate have supported Musk's social media posts, which could make the bill harder to pass in that body.

Musk shared a post on X stating that he was truly fed up with this. Based on his argument, this gigantic, unreasonable spending bill from Congress is terrible.

He continued, “It is shameful for those who support it: deep down, you know it’s wrong. You know that.”

Although previous proposals would phase out incentives by the end of this year for most electric vehicle sales, the new version will end the credit after September 30. The tax credit for purchasing used electric vehicles and commercial electric vehicles will also expire simultaneously.

Musk threatened to fund primary challenges against supporters of the GOP tax bill.

After the disagreement between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, attention in Washington shifted to how this rift might impact the Republican tax bill and the billionaire's changing political agenda.

Trump and his team claimed that the president had shifted his focus to more important issues. The dispute with his former benefactor has caused both Washington and Wall Street to closely monitor every update.

Trump directed his anger at Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the better-than-expected jobs report for May. On Truth Social, he wrote, ""Say it all, Rocket Fuel!""

He also announced that his chief trade advisers would meet with their Chinese counterparts in London. He said the meeting would go very well.

Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans sided with Trump on the bill, betting that loyalty to the president was a smarter move even as Musk threatened to help fund primary challenges against anyone who voted for it. However, it is notable that they did not agree on specific details.

Two White House officials familiar with the situation revealed that Trump had no plans or intention to talk to Musk, although they hinted that the tech mogul had hoped for such a call.",https://public.bnbstatic.com/static/content/square/images/c04149c6686f41298025767951cb57ce.png,N,,2025-06-30 02:02:02.757763

Former Texas governor and US energy secretary Rick Perry’s company Fermi America has joined with the Texas Tech University System (TTU System) for the collaboration near Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle.

The Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus will be 5,800 acres and include 18 million square feet of data centres and generate up to 11GW of IT capacity from natural gas, solar, wind and clean nuclear energy.

Fermi America will provide critical infrastructure energy solutions.

It says geotechnical work has already begun on the campus and it is expected to deliver 1GW of power by the end of 2026.

A big deal and a very big project

With its location in Texas, everything about the project is appropriately big and bold.

Fermi says the campus will combine the “largest nuclear power complex in America, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power and battery energy storage” into one development serving hyperscale data centre companies.

The location is strategic, lying close to Pantax, the US’s main nuclear weapons assembly facility, at the intersection of several of the nation's largest gas pipelines and on one of the nation's largest known natural gas fields.

Fermi has submitted a federal application to build a nuclear power complex with four 1GW reactors.

It is understood to be looking to start construction next year and launch the first phase of the nuclear plant by 2032.

‘The energy-AI capital of the world’

Ben Sooter, Program Manager, Electric Power Research Institute, says: “This isn’t just a data centre – it’s an energy megahub, built from scratch to power the next era of AI.

“With global tensions rising and compute demand exploding, this is Texas staking a claim as the energy-AI capital of the world.

“Is this the moment AI infrastructure goes sovereign-scale? Or is Texas simply leading the charge?”

Make America energy dominant

Alongside being planned to address rising energy and data centre demand, there is also a geo-political edge to the campus.

Former Texas Governor Rick says: “The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today,” added Perry. We’re behind, and it’s all hands on deck.

“President Trump’s first executive order spoke to the energy issue and how we must continue to make America energy dominant.

“No one does energy better than Texas and Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System are answering the call.”

Powering minds as well as data centres

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavour,” says TTU System Chancellor Tedd L. Mitchell.

“Texas is the energy capital of the world and this campus will not only be the largest energy and data complex of its kind, but also a testament to the unshakable spirit of our system, the Texas Panhandle and this great state.”

The campus plan also includes an academic and research facility featuring office, classroom and conference spaces.

TTU System says the project will provide academic and research opportunities for faculty and students, including internships, employment and workforce training and placement programmes that will benefit all five TTU System institutions.

“This collaboration will not only position Texas Tech to address the evolving demands of the energy and technology sectors but will also create meaningful educational opportunities for our students and research possibilities across many disciplines for our faculty,” says TTU President Lawrence Schovanec.

The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60 per cent of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process.
A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that’s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat.
Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.
They remain in the US Senate Finance Committee’s draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.","Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.

The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.

But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.

Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.

Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped – usually through a pipeline – to a location where it’s injected deep underground for long-term storage.

Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.

Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp, which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.

The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves – meaning it’s not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency, IEA, and the US Environmental Protection Agency.

How much carbon dioxide is captured? The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60 per cent of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.

Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90 per cent or more, “in practice, that has never happened,” said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project’s Oil & Gas Watch.

That’s because it’s difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it’s emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.

Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it’s less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.

A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that’s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.

About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide – a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.

It’s an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world’s largest carbon capture utilisation and storage projects, ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.

Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.

“It’s not a substitution for renewables ... it’s just a complementary technology,” Nepal said. “It’s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.”

Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the US Gulf Coast, likely won’t be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial US global competitiveness.

For Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN), the stakes are particularly high as federal EV tax credit policies—now in legislative limbo—could either supercharge its growth or slam the door on its ambitions. Let's dissect how Rivian's future hinges on Washington's whims and why investors must parse the political chessboard as closely as the financials.

The EV Tax Credit Crossroads: Rivian's Golden Window

Rivian's eligibility for the federal EV tax credit is a lifeline it can't afford to lose. As a newer automaker with ~90,000 EVs sold through late 2024, it remains under the 200,000 sales threshold that excludes giants like Tesla and GM. This means buyers of its R1T pickup and upcoming R2 SUV could still qualify for up to $7,500 in tax credits—a critical price break in a market where Rivian's vehicles start at $67,000.

But here's the catch:

- Senate Republicans' bill would terminate the credit for all new EVs by September 30, 2025, stripping Rivian of this incentive just as it ramps up R2 production.

- The House version extends the credit through 2026, giving Rivian a 12-month reprieve.

- By 2027, the credit vanishes entirely, even if the bill stalls.

Political Risks: A Game of Legislative Chicken

The Senate's abrupt deadline creates a “use it or lose it” scenario for Rivian. Buyers must act fast to claim credits, potentially spiking Q3 sales while risking a post-September sales cliff. Meanwhile, Honda's Prologue—a smaller automaker's EV—could poach customers if Rivian's vehicles become pricier post-credit.

The policy battle also exposes deeper partisan divides:

- Republicans are weaponizing EV credits to favor fossil fuels, repealing CAFE fines and subsidizing gas vehicles.

- Democrats view EVs as climate lifelines, but their leverage wanes as the 2026 elections loom.

A worst-case scenario: If the Senate bill passes, Rivian's $15 billion valuation could crumble as its price-competitive edge evaporates. Even if delayed, the credit's 2027 expiration leaves Rivian racing to scale production before the incentive well runs dry.

Competitor Dynamics: Tesla's Exit, Honda's Play

While Tesla's ineligibility removes a direct rival for luxury EV buyers, Honda's Prologue—with its $44,000 starting price—now sits in Rivian's crosshairs. Honda's slower EV rollout keeps it under the sales cap, letting it offer credits Rivian may soon lose. Meanwhile, GM's Hummer EV and Ford's F-150 Lightning are already locked out of the credit, but their established dealer networks still threaten Rivian's market share.

Investment Takeaways: Navigate the Policy Fog

Buy Rivian if…

The House prevails, extending the credit to 2026.

Rivian's R2 SUV meets the stricter battery sourcing rules (60% U.S./FTA minerals by 2025).

It can undercut Honda's pricing while maintaining margins.

Avoid Rivian if…

The Senate's September deadline holds, triggering a sales crash.

Rivian fails to secure cobalt/lithium supplies from North America, losing eligibility.

China/Europe outpace U.S. EV manufacturing as protectionist policies backfire.

Current Valuation Check: Rivian's price-to-sales ratio of 1.2x is half Tesla's 2.4x but still rich for a company burning $2.3 billion in cash annually. Investors must ask: Can Rivian turn a profit before its tax credit lifeline snaps?

Final Analysis: A High-Reward, High-Risk Bet

Rivian is a speculative play on U.S. EV dominance. Its all-electric trucks/SUVs and $2.5 billion factory in Georgia position it to capitalize on the credit's current terms—but only if lawmakers don't pull the rug out. For aggressive investors, Rivian offers growth potential in a $1.2 trillion global EV market. For the cautious, the political roulette makes it a “wait-and-see” until policy clarity emerges.

The next 100 days will decide whether Rivian's electric dream stays charged—or goes dead silent.

Congress is trying to get the bill to the president's desk by July 4, though there are differences between the House version passed in May and the Senate bill being debated on the floor. It remains to be seen whether House Republicans would accept changes to the bill drafted in the Senate.

The Senate held a prolonged procedural vote late Saturday evening that eventually ended 51-49 to advance the bill. The legislation is projected to add $3.3 trillion to the national debt over ten years.

The driver behind the bill is to prevent the 2017 tax cuts from expiring, but the bill plusses up some tax cuts while also cutting spending for Medicaid and food programs for low-income people.

Beyond the tax cuts, the bill also includes several provisions to improve the farm-safety net from the 2018 farm bill.

Two Republicans, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against the bill. That led to social media posts from President Donald Trump, who vowed to find primary candidates against Tillis in next year's election.

Tillis stated he could not back the bill because of lost funding for hospitals and rural areas, especially with Medicaid cuts.

""It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities,"" Tillis said. ""This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.""

After the vote, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., played one of the few cards he had left by requiring the entire 940-plus page bill to be read before the Senate proceeded to other votes on the bill. The reading of the bill began overnight and continued into Sunday afternoon.

45Z CLEAN FUEL PRODUCTION CREDIT

In a key provision for the biofuels industry, the American Soybean Association (ASA) and National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) praised the Senate for going along with the House language for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Under the bill, only feedstocks from The U.S., Canada and Mexico would qualify for the tax credit. That should curb refiners from importing high volumes of used cooking oil coming from China.

The bill also extends the 45Z credit to the end of 2031. It's one of the few tax credits for clean energy to not only survive unscathed, but be granted an extension.

The Senate also expanded the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer credit from 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon, and allows for transferring 45Z credits, which ASA and NOPA stated would help smaller biofuel producers.

The oilseed backers noted the soy crush industry has invested more than $6 billion to increased crush capacity by more than 25% since 2021. Along with that, current trade disputes demand more focus on increasing domestic use to help make up for some of those trade markets.

""Soybean farmers have long advocated for biofuel tax credits that put American farmers and our rural economies first, and ASA commends the Senate for their continued commitment to U.S. agriculture,"" said American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland, who grows soy in Kentucky. ""As we continue to advocate for new and expanded markets for U.S. soy, the work of the House and Senate will support the farm economy by bolstering a vital domestic market for our farmers.""

PUBLIC LAND SALES OUT

Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, pulled his provision that would have allowed up to 3 million acres of public land sales across as many as 11 western states.

Lee said his plan would have helped build housing in areas with high demand, but it split western-state Republicans. Before voting on the bill Saturday night, Lee posted on X that he was withdrawing the amendment, though he said there had been ""misinformation"" and ""outright lies"" about what the change would have done.

Lee also said some of the language changes meant he could not ensure the land would go to American families instead of foreign interests or corporations.

""I continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land -- land that is mismanaged and in many cases ruining for the next generation,"" Lee stated. ""Under Democratic presidents, massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there, with no meaningful recourse.""

TAX PROVISIONS

The Senate bill makes permanent a 20% deduction for qualified business income for smaller businesses. The Senate language is different from the House, which increases the qualified business income deduction to 23%.

When it comes to buying equipment, the bill reinstates 100% bonus depreciation from 2025-2030 and also increases the Section 179 deduction for smaller businesses to $2.5 million.

The bill would increase the estate tax exemption to $15 million for single tax filers and $30 million for married couples starting in 2026 and the exemption would be indexed for inflation.

AG PROVISIONS IN THE BILL

The bill includes improvements to the farm safety net with as much as $67 billion in program changes over 10 years.

That includes raising reference prices under the Prices Loss Coverage program (PLC) and the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program. For the current crop year, the Senate bill has language that USDA will provide producers with the higher calculated payment rate in 2025 for ARC or PLC. Producers would then go back to choosing which program they prefer in 2026 and beyond.

The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) is plussed up and the bill also reduces crop-insurance premiums for farmers as well.

Payment limits would increase from $125,000 to $155,000 for individuals and then the payment limit would increase based on an inflation index. The bill also removes income caps for farmers or entities that draw 75% or more of their income from agriculture or forestry.

The bill also has provisions that would allow USDA to enroll up to 30 million new base acres for farmers based on production history of that ground.

In conservation, the bill takes back as much as $16 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and rolls those funds into the ten-year budgets for USDA's main conservation programs. Still, the CBO forecasts that move as a nearly $1.8 billion in cuts compared to what the IRA and farm bill funding could have provided for conservation programs.

Other provisions in agriculture would expand on disaster aid for livestock producers and double funding for USDA trade promotion programs.

FOOD AID CUTS

The bill cuts $211 billion from the country's largest food-aid support program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Work restrictions would be tightened for able-bodied adults, people ages 55-64 and parents with children over age 14. The bill also restricts the Agriculture secretary from offering waivers to SNAP work requirements based on areas with higher unemployment rates. Combined, the work requirements would reduce SNAP spending by $92 billion over 10 years.

States also will be required to pay as much as 15% of the SNAP benefits based on USDA's report of their annual error rates. That provision would kick in 2028 and shift more than $4 billion in annual costs to states. Another cost shift to states increases their percentage of the administrative costs as well.

With a joint investment of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars, the initiative will encompass nickel mining and processing, battery materials production, battery manufacturing, and recycling.

Indonesia is currently the world's largest producer of nickel and holds the biggest-known reserves of the metal, an essential component in EV batteries.

The project is a joint operation between Indonesia's state-owned miner PT Aneka Tambang (Antam), the state-owned investment holding company PT and Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), in collaboration with Chinese firm Ningbo Contemporary Brunp Lygend Co., Ltd. (CBL).

""This groundbreaking is proof of our leaders' seriousness in collaborating with our partners and our friends in China. We can work together on a program that I think can be called colossal, an extraordinary breakthrough,"" Prabowo said in his speech.

Indonesia's Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said that the project is expected to create 35,000 jobs and contribute up to 42 billion dollars annually to Indonesia's GDP.

Bahlil noted that the plant will have the capacity to supply batteries for 300,000 vehicles, which would help reduce Indonesia's fuel imports by approximately 300,000 kiloliters per year.

He added that the project aligned with Prabowo's vision for more equitable national development. While it was launching in Java, about three-quarters of the total investment is set to be directed to North Maluku province. ■",,N,,2025-06-29 14:09:00.789111

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.
“These recent efforts by the Trump administration to cancel validly executed contracts are ridiculous,” Webb says.
Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuel energy.
Any consumer who has an energy bill should care about this.”","The United States is not where it should be when it comes to the transition to renewable energy. Ask any climate scientist or reputable energy expert, and they’ll tell you we’re significantly behind schedule if we’re hoping to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Joe Biden’s administration got passed in 2022, was meant to help speed up that transition and get the country on the right track. Now, it’s under attack.

President Donald Trump’s administration has been working to undo any policies that would help the world avoid a climate catastrophe, and it is now trying to use the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” to repeal most of the climate-focused initiatives contained in the IRA. Trump’s signature legislation is caught up in the Senate after the House passed it last month, so it’s not entirely clear what the final draft will contain, but experts agree that these climate provisions are clearly on the chopping block.

The latest version of the bill would be particularly catastrophic for wind and solar. Republicans not only want to significantly cut tax credits for these clean energy projects, they wants impose new taxes on them for the first time. Wind and solar projects completed after 2027, for instance, will be taxed unless they can prove no Chinese components were used.

“They’re proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote in a statement Saturday. “If this becomes law, it will be a shocking act of economic self-sabotage.”

Republicans also stand to cut the $7,500 tax credit for consumers who purchase a new electric vehicle, and the $4,000 credit for consumers who buy a used one.

“It is clear that many of the grant and loan programs that were established by the IRA are at especially high risk,” Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, tells Rolling Stone. “The tax credits are a little more uncertain, but we should expect changes to at least some of the tax credit programs and the elimination of some of them.”

Editor’s picks

It appears some tax credits, like those for nuclear and geothermal energy companies, might remain until at least 2034. Trump recently made it known that he doesn’t like tax credits going to clean energy projects, but he didn’t specify what he was talking about.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM,” Trump posted last week on Truth Social. “I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions.”

The latest version of the bill slashes tax credits for wind and solar projects, while offering them for coal production. “Utterly insane and destructive,” Elon Musk wrote of the bill on Saturday. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

Daniel Kammen, a distinguished professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, says he doesn’t think anything is off the table when it comes to cuts to the IRA, and that Republicans will have to make individual decisions about what might help or hurt them when the midterms come around next year.

“There are Republicans who voted against the IRA who then campaigned for reelection on its merits,” Kammen says. “[The bill is] even targeting measures popular with Republicans.”

Nearly 80 percent of renewable energy project funding in the IRA went to Republican congressional districts. Many hoped Republicans wouldn’t eliminate provisions that benefited their constituents. However, with Donald Trump leading the charge, much of this funding might be cut, regardless of whether it is helping Republicans.

“The fact that many of the incentives were provided to red states means that even Republican governors and legislators will probably be averse to abandoning them,” says Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of Earth and environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania. “So there is some hope there.”

It’s unclear what will become of projects that were started due to the passage of the IRA or were helped along by it. Kammen says these cuts will likely have a “big effect,” and that they may suddenly find it difficult to obtain more capital for “project expansion and grid connection,” for example. “The amount of damage that is going to be done is high,” he says.

There is also concern about Trump administration efforts to claw back funds that were already guaranteed to certain projects, which are being challenged in the courts. If the courts rule against the Trump administration, then that funding would remain intact.

“These recent efforts by the Trump administration to cancel validly executed contracts are ridiculous,” Webb says. “It’s up to Congress to determine what gets funded, and Congress sets the priorities in a statute like the IRA.”

While many industrialized nations, from Europe to China, are preparing for the future and investing in renewable energy, the U.S. appears determined to double down on antiquated and withering energy sources. Some of the efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in America will continue on, such as those at the state or local level, but the Trump administration is doing everything it can to kill green energy at the federal level and even trying to block many of the local initiatives to move away from fossil fuels.

Kammen says we’re “hitting pause” on renewable energy development at exactly the wrong moment, with Webb adding that America is “looking backwards” while other nations are focusing on what’s ahead of us.

“For U.S. competitiveness, it’s really important,” Webb says. “This will have huge economic impacts. Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuel energy.

“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical Bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.
Mr Trump attacked Mr Tillis, who opposed the Bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina.
?“ Mr Trump said on social media.
Mr Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.","WASHINGTON - The Republican-controlled US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump’s, sweeping tax-cut and spending Bill on June 28, during a marathon weekend session marked by political drama, division and lengthy delays as Democrats sought to slow the legislation’s path to passage.

Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page mega-Bill, with two of Mr Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military priorities.

Mr Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful Bill”.

After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice-President J.D. Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the mega-Bill first be read aloud in the chamber - a task that could delay the start of the debate until the afternoon of June 29.

Democrats say the Bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.

“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical Bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.

“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.

Once the Bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama”, before the Senate votes on passage.

Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the Bill on June 30.

Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.

Mr Trump attacked Mr Tillis, who opposed the Bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Mr Tillis is up for re-election in 2026.

“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.

Mr Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the US$36.2 trillion (S$46.17 trillion) US debt by an additional US$5 trillion.

“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???“ Mr Trump said on social media.

In limbo

June 28’s vote was in limbo for hours as Mr Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals if any were struck to win over their support.

Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mr Mike Lee and Ms Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the Bill in the end.

Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.

Mr Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.

The mega-Bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Mr Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.

The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate Bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by US$4.5 trillion over the next decade, increasing the US$36.2-trillion US government debt.

The White House said in June that the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by US$1.4 trillion.

The world’s richest person, Mr Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the Bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.

Calling the Bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Mr Trump that raged earlier in June, before Mr Musk backed down from his rhetoric.

“The latest Senate draft Bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Mr Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.

Medicaid changes

Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for Medicaid providers, including rural hospitals.

The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include US$25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.

The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to US$40,000 with an annual 1 per cent inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current US$10,000.

The Bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than US$500,000 a year.

That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.

Republicans are using a legislative maneuver to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.

Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.

The Bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.

If the Senate passes the Bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the Bill in May.

These corporate handouts fuel inflation, undermine energy security, and break the promises Republicans made to voters. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.

At a time when interest payments on the national debt exceed defense spending, terminating wasteful green energy subsidies should be a no-brainer. But Congress has a spending addiction.

As former President Ronald Reagan observed, “Government does not solve problems; it subsidizes them.” This remains true today. These ineffective green energy giveaways are expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, perhaps even more.

These subsidies are fiscal failures that distort our markets and burden taxpayers. We need an affordable energy policy, not high-cost, taxpayer-subsidized incentives that enrich unreliable energy producers and punish states such as Oklahoma, the sixth-largest producer of oil and fifth-largest producer of natural gas.

These subsidies also undermine energy reliability, putting America’s national security at risk. Democrats’ green energy subsidies prioritize unreliable, intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar, while our nation needs tried and true energy that can keep the lights on at all times and provide the constant, reliable power to homes and industries needed to keep our country strong and secure.

But the risks go beyond blackouts.

These subsidies make us more dependent on China, which dominates the global solar supply chain. Just last month, China was caught embedding devices with the potential to disable our power grid in U.S. solar equipment. That’s a national security threat we cannot afford.

Beyond security risks, these subsidies also burden American families trying to make ends meet.

Americans did not vote for endless giveaways to billion-dollar developers. They voted for dependable power, stable prices, and a government that lives within its means.

There’s a better path forward, starting with preserving the framework House Republicans set in their version of the “big, beautiful bill,” which enforces a firm end to these green energy giveaways. It’s time for the federal government to stop funding failure, kill these runaway green-energy handouts, and deliver relief to Americans.

The ball is in the Senate’s court to prove it is serious about fiscal responsibility, energy reliability, and prosperity for average Americans.

The history of renewable energy tax credits in the U.S. is full of of phase-outs and restarts.
Solar projects would have to pay a 50% tax on the value of the overage, and wind projects would pay 30%.
Even so, Rhodium Group has estimated that it would increase project costs overall by 10% to 20% — a whopping total to eat on top of losing key tax credits.
“I just learned about the excise tax and it’s definitely not something I would support,” he posted to X yesterday, adding he’d rather they focus on removing the tax credits instead of creating a new cost.","Senate Republicans are in the final stages of passing their budget reconciliation megabill — which suddenly includes a new tax on solar and wind projects that has sent many in the industry into full-blown crisis mode.

The proposed tax was tucked inside the latest text of the Senate reconciliation bill, released late Friday night, and would levy a first-of-its-kind penalty on all solar and wind projects tied to the quantity of materials they source from companies with ties to China or other countries designated as adversaries by the U.S. government. Industry representatives are still processing the legislative language, but some fear it would kick in for certain developers as soon as the date of its enactment. Taken together with other factors both in the bill and not, including permitting timelines and Trump’s tariffs, this tax could indefinitely undermine renewables development in America.

On Saturday, as legislators began to digest the new text, Senator Brian Schatz declared on X not once, not twice, but three times that with the new penalty, this bill would on its own “kill” the U.S. solar energy industry, leading to energy shortages and raising costs across the board. ""I promise you,” he wrote, “this bill is worse than you think.”

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a staunch advocate for climate policy, said in a statement to Heatmap that the tax will help China and hurt American families, “all so Republican oil and gas donors can make even bigger profits. This isn’t policy; it’s pay-off.”

Without this new tax, energy companies might’ve quietly swallowed the bitter pill of losing the incentives established in the Inflation Reduction Act. In the weeks since the first version of this legislation was introduced in the House, I’ve interviewed numerous renewables developers, tax attorneys, and cleantech investors, who have emphasized the resilience of the industry given rising energy demand and explained that there would still be many ways for projects currently under development to qualify for the credits before they’d be phased out. The history of renewable energy tax credits in the U.S. is full of of phase-outs and restarts. The industry’s been at least somewhere like this before.

But the withdrawal of incentives is one thing. A targeted federal tax that could increase development costs by up to 20% that is levied over longstanding supply chain relationships that will take not years but rather decades to rebuild is another.

The American Council on Renewable Energy said in a statement that the latest iteration of the bill “effectively takes both wind and solar electric supply off the table, at a time when there is $300 billion of investments underway, and this generation is among the only source of electricity that will help to reduce costs and keep the lights on through the early 2030s.” The North America’s Building Trades Unions issued a statement after the text’s release calling it the “biggest job-killing bill in the history of this county” and adding that that “simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects.”

“I think it’s impossible to overstate how this new version of the bill makes the House bill look moderate by comparison,” Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy 4 America, told me in an exasperated tone over the phone Saturday afternoon. “The hope as I see it is that as the full impact of how devastating this proposal would be for every state in the country comes into play, as this comes to the floor, Senate Republicans who claim to care about this issue come to [Majority Leader John] Thune and ask to amend this.”

The tax would apply to new solar and wind construction and be calculated based on the degree to which a project exceeds statutory limits for materials sourced from “foreign entities of concern,” i.e. Russia, North Korea, Iran, and most especially China. Solar projects would have to pay a 50% tax on the value of the overage, and wind projects would pay 30%.

Here’s a simplified example to illustrate how it would work: Say you are developing a solar project that will begin operating in 2028, and the total cost of all of your material inputs is $100,000. The new law would require that at least 50% of the value of all of your materials come from entities disconnected from Chinese companies and investment (the statutory limit for 2028), but your project is only able to achieve 40%. The extra $10,000 dollars you paid to companies with ties to China would be subject to the 50% solar tax, adding $5,000 to the total cost of your project. And this doesn’t even touch the new expense of capturing and reporting all of this supply chain data for the federal government.

The rules for how developers would actually calculate the value of their various material inputs will be subject to the Treasury’s interpretation and guidance, so it is impossible to determine how harshly this tax would fall on any individual solar or wind energy facility. Even so, Rhodium Group has estimated that it would increase project costs overall by 10% to 20% — a whopping total to eat on top of losing key tax credits.

This penalty for sourcing linked to China dates back to the IRA’s consumer electric vehicle tax credit. As I was first to report years ago for E&E News, Senator Joe Manchin successfully limited the credit’s scope by requiring qualifying cars to be made with an increasing percentage of materials from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement and mandating that materials could not come from a foreign entity of concern. This tactic mostly failed to reshore mineral supply chains as quickly Manchin had hoped it would, but it did ensure that relatively few vehicles qualified.

This anti-foreigner approach to energy policy has now been taken up by Republicans in Congress to erode the IRA overall. As my colleagues Emily Pontecorvo and Matthew Zeitlin have explained, the Senate legislation would deny tax credits to companies that have supply chains with any ties to China, which many say would effectively stop them from qualifying for the credits.

This specific policy approach is something I’ve previously dubbed the GOP’s “anti-China trap” for renewable energy. Now, on top of cutting off companies from tax credits, this trap will catch them for failing to reinvent their supply chains overnight with little if any warning. Of course, reshoring these supply chains will also be more difficult because of other provisions in the bill that would erode and eliminate advanced manufacturing tax incentives originally designed to encourage companies to make more of these components at home.

The only silver lining here is that the fight isn’t over. It wouldn’t surprise me to see a senator try to get rid of this tax as the bill moves through the amendment process on the Senate floor.

I expect some sort of intervention here because there appears to be momentum from powerful entities outside of Congress to get rid of this tax. Reviews of this piece of the bill are so bad, it has put the American Clean Power and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the same side as pro-fossil “philosopher” Alex Epstein, who is also calling on senators to oppose the tax.

“I just learned about the excise tax and it’s definitely not something I would support,” he posted to X yesterday, adding he’d rather they focus on removing the tax credits instead of creating a new cost. “I stand for energy freedom, always, in every situation,” he added in a separate post defending his opposition.

Elsewhere on X yesterday, Elon Musk spent hours (on his birthday, no less) going after the Senate bill, reposting energy wonks’ rants about the bill and its tax on renewables, including from Jesse Jenkins, the host of Heatmap’s very own Shift Key podcast.

So, okay, but will Musk, Epstein or any of these other critics convince at least one senator to force a successful vote on getting rid of the tax? That’s really the only way it can go away, because it’s very likely the Senate will force the House to pass whatever it passes.

I talked to Jenkins hours after Musk reposted him and filled up his replies. Like the iconoclastic billionaire, he told me he thinks this legislation is worse than anything congressional Republicans had released before it. A big reason for that is indeed the excise tax, a completely new idea that hadn’t been in any other previous draft of the bill or debated in committee, which he sees as a “obviously, deliberatively punitive attack on the wind and solar industry for what appears to be purely ideological reasons.”

“It’s going to kill hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and hundreds of gigawatts of new supply that would otherwise help us meet rapidly growing electricity demand. So, yeah, higher energy prices, less jobs, less investment in American energy production, and less confidence in the American business environment,” Jenkins said. “No one is asking for this.”

Debate on the bill is expected to begin later today, and the amendment process will stretch into Monday morning at least.

California and ten other states immediately filed suit in federal court, citing a number of statutory and constitutional claims in arguing that the resolutions were unlawful and asking a federal court to declare them to have no effect. As this litigation begins to play out in court, it is a timely moment to take stock of the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the law which made the federal government’s attack on state emissions laws purportedly feasible. This essay explains the history of CRA actions and the asymmetrical threat it has posed and continues to pose to regulatory safeguards, and concludes by suggesting that this latest unprecedented use of the CRA may well lay the foundation for Congress to revisit or repeal the CRA.

Three Decades of the Congressional Review Act

The CRA is a 1996 statute that creates an expedited process for Congress to nullify an executive branch agency rule. The CRA requires federal agencies to notify Congress upon finalizing a CRA-covered rule. Congress can then pass a resolution of disapproval during a statutorily-prescribed window of time after the agency action was taken. Importantly, this resolution enjoys a privileged status that avoids the filibuster and allows it to be passed by a simple majority. If the President signs the resolution, the agency rule is nullified, and the agency is prohibited from taking a future action that is “substantially the same.”

The Congressional Review Act was passed by a Republican Congress in 1996 but has a bipartisan pedigree. Throughout his career, now-deceased Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) was a champion of the concept of congressional review of agency rules. In 1979, shortly after joining the Senate, Sen. Levin introduced legislation to establish a legislative review of agency rules. In 1985, after the Supreme Court found legislative vetoes unconstitutional, Sen. Levin introduced revised legislation that proposed the resolution of disapproval approach ultimately enacted by the CRA. Sen. Levin’s proposals had enjoyed a measure of bipartisan support, and his 1985 bill was cosponsored by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS).

While Sen. Levin’s bill was not enacted, Congress ultimately passed the CRA more than a decade later as part of a larger legislative package. Due to a popular provision that effectively increased Social Security benefits, the legislation had overwhelming bipartisan support in the House and passed unanimously in the Senate. When Democratic President Bill Clinton signed the CRA into law, he said he had long supported the concept.

Still, there were concerns on the Democratic side about the CRA. Noting estimates that 4,000 rules are issued each year, Sen. Levin was concerned that, as drafted, the CRA applied to too many rules. Levin said that the text was “not exactly what I would have chosen to support, but it’s close enough.” President Clinton was concerned that the review process could drag on too long.

Perhaps because of this history of bipartisanship, Democratic politicians have been slow to articulate concerns that the CRA is a significant problem for Democratic – as opposed to Republican – governance. In fact, the CRA has had much more effect on curbing the actions of Democratic administrations over the years than those of Republican administrations.

The CRA was first used by Congress and President George W. Bush in 2001 to negate a Clinton regulation related to ergonomic injuries. It wasn’t successfully used again until 2017 when President Trump and a Republican Congress used it to undo sixteen rules finalized by the Obama Administration. These included measures to protect streams from coal mining, to keep firearms from the mentally ill, to protect consumers’ privacy, to promote women’s health, and to discourage U.S. companies from bribing foreign officials.

In President Trump’s second term, in addition to the California emissions waivers discussed above, the CRA has been used to rescind thirteen Biden Administration rules. These rules include a rule that imposes a fee on emitted methane in order to discourage waste and pollution, a rule that limits the use of off-road vehicles in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, rules that set efficiency standards for gas water heaters, walk-in coolers and freezers, and commercial refrigerators and freezers, a rule that reduces toxic emissions from tire manufacturing, a rule that protects marine archeological resources, an IRS rule regarding reporting of digital asset sales, two rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a rule that revises the process of considering bank mergers, and a rule that limits emissions of persistent and bioaccumulative hazardous air pollutants.

There is only one example of a Democratic Congress and Democratic President using the CRA to nullify a rule issued by a Republican administration. In 2021, Congress passed a resolution to nullify an EPA deregulatory rule. In 2020, the Trump Administration had promulgated a rule to deregulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, and Congress used the CRA to nullify that action. President Biden signed that resolution into law. The result was that methane continued to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, and the CRA would appear to bar such a deregulatory action in the future.

The CRA has seen its most use during periods of presidential transition, when a new President has the opportunity to undo some of the last actions of the former President. But the CRA has also served as an important cudgel against Democratic administrations outside of those transition periods. Mere introduction and consideration of a CRA resolution can serve as a tool to build and demonstrate opposition to executive action. President Obama was forced to veto five resolutions of disapproval during his presidency relating to labor protections, protections against financial conflicts of interest, pollution controls for new and existing power plants, and rules limiting water pollution. President Biden vetoed ten resolutions of disapproval relating to the domestic content of electric vehicle chargers, small business lending, endangered species protections for certain bats and birds, consumer protections relating to cryptocurrency, labor rules, student loans, emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles, Labor Department rules that address climate change-related fiduciary duties, and the scope of the Clean Water Act.

By contrast, Congress never sent President George W. Bush a resolution of disapproval for actions of his administration. Congress sent President Trump only a single resolution of disapproval relating to an action of his administration. In 2020, Congress disapproved of a rule relating to student loans, but President Trump vetoed the resolution.

The CRA undoubtedly also has a pernicious, yet unquantifiable, effect on the rulemaking process. Seeing agency rules challenged or even nullified by the CRA, agency regulators craft regulations with the specter of the CRA hanging over their heads. It can’t be known how many changes are made in contemplation of the possibility of having to defend a regulation against a majority vote in the Senate, but there can be little doubt that the CRA has a chilling effect on agency rule writers.

Additionally, the CRA has come to be understood to apply to executive actions well beyond what was contemplated on the Senate floor back in 1996 – beyond notice and comment rulemaking, and even including agency actions that have no binding effect. The CRA provides that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the role of determining whether federal agencies have followed the proper procedure when the agencies report their CRA-eligible rules to Congress. Even though the CRA does not require it, the GAO has also accepted the role of issuing decisions regarding agency compliance with the CRA when Congress requests their view. These legal decisions have endorsed the view that a broad scope of actions are eligible for CRA review.

For example, in 2022, the GAO determined that a Department of Transportation memo which sought to merely encourage states to maintain existing roads prior to building new roads was subject to the CRA. Republicans in Congress threatened to use the CRA to nullify the memo, and in response the Department revised their policy to placate congressional opposition. That episode not only demonstrates the expansiveness of actions potentially eligible for CRA review but illustrates how the CRA has forced a Democratic administration to change its policy even without the passage of a resolution of disapproval.

On top of all of this, the expanding understanding of CRA eligibility means Congress could review countless federal actions previously not submitted to Congress because submittal was not understood to be required. In 2017, the GAO issued a legal decision addressing 2013 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) guidance. The GAO determined that the CFPB guidance was indeed a rule even though the CFPB had argued it was not a rule and had not submitted it to Congress. Despite the rule having been finalized four years previously, the CFPB rule then became eligible for congressional review. Congress subsequently nullified the rule in 2018. Because the breadth of CRA eligibility has only become understood in the last decade, there are doubtless many federal actions taken after enactment of the CRA in 1996 that Congress could now review if it elected to do so.

The three-decade history of implementation of the CRA demonstrates that the law has had a disproportionate effect on efforts undertaken by Democratic administrations as compared to Republican administrations. To date, the CRA has nullified 33 rules issued by Democratic administrations and only one rule by a Republican administration. Additionally, the CRA has been used to effectively demonstrate congressional opposition to the agenda of Democratic administrations far more than Republican administrations. While facially neutral, the CRA is inherently deregulatory in practice and therefore has an asymmetrical effect on proposals to address problems through regulation. Because the policy goals of the Democratic Party can often be achieved through regulation and the policy goals of the Republican Party are often associated with deregulation, the CRA is a tool that serves Republican legislators far more than Democratic ones.

Despite this history of implementation, Democratic legislators have not unified around the need to revisit the CRA. That may change with Congress’ recent extremely aggressive uses of the CRA and the new precedent the Senate set to use the CRA on EPA’s waivers of preemption on California emissions standards.

Using the CRA to Overturn State Regulation

On May 21, 2025, Senate Majority Leader John Thune offered two points of order on the floor of the U.S. Senate to set a new precedent that will guide future utilization of the CRA. This precedent gained attention like few procedural votes in the Senate do. The precedent allowed the CRA to be used to undo a category of agency actions that have never been subject to the CRA before and it could fundamentally change the scope of what the CRA applies to going forward, ushering in a new era of implementation for the law.

For the first time, Congress used the CRA to review the EPA’s issuance of a waiver of preemption regarding California’s pollution requirements. Since enactment of the Congressional Review Act in 1996, EPA has taken nearly 150 actions under that authority and until 2025 no one, including the George W. Bush Administration, had ever considered them to be “rules” subject to the CRA. EPA’s California waivers do not fall into the definition of a rule according to the GAO or the pre-2025 EPA (Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump). The GAO has explained that the waiver is an “order,” not a “rule,” because the waiver was particular to California, based on consideration of particular facts, and had immediate effect in California. The GAO concluded that even if the waiver was a rule, it is a rule of particular applicability because it “concerns a specific entity—California—and addresses a statutory waiver specific to California’s Advanced Clean Car Program.” The CRA specifically excepts rules of particular applicability from being subject to CRA review.

When the Trump EPA submitted the waivers to Congress pursuant to the CRA they offered no explanation to counter the GAO’s analysis or EPA’s former position and provided no information that could be used to distinguish California waivers from any other executive action not subject to review under the CRA. The Senate, for its part, articulated no rationale to explain why approvals of the California waivers would be subject to the CRA, but other orders, adjudications, or excepted actions like contracts, leases, and permit approvals would not be. (Several weeks after the Senate vote, the White House has attempted to provide a rationale for why the waivers should be considered rules subject to the CRA.)

In short, the CRA has entered a phase of implementation where Congress is willing to defer completely to the executive branch regarding which actions are eligible for CRA review. This precedent in effect says that the Senate will now just take the executive branch’s word on whether an action is subject to the CRA – even when that action is on its face at odds with the CRA statutory language and no justification or argument for applicability is even offered. An administration that is willing to recategorize orders, adjudications, and excepted actions as “rules” subject to the CRA can now achieve privileged consideration in the Senate, contrary to the original intent of the CRA.

The Senate has therefore engineered a path for a one-party government to bypass the filibuster when seeking to eliminate virtually any previously unreviewed agency action. This opens the door to abuse of the CRA and would allow for enormous and unpredictable policy shifts that disproportionately favor anti-regulatory advocates, polarizing the CRA in a way that hasn’t been seen previously.

A Foundation for Revision or Repeal

During the Senate floor debate establishing the new CRA precedent, Democratic senators made clear that they understood the gravity of what was happening. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the Senate Republicans were “going nuclear” and setting a precedent “that cannot likely be reversed.” “Moving forward,” Senator Schumer said, “Congressional Review Acts will be weaponized like never before.” Senator Durbin said the use of the CRA was “a dramatic break from Senate precedent with profound consequences.”

Democratic senators demonstrated an understanding that notwithstanding the statute’s definition of a rule and the statutorily prescribed time periods for review, the new precedent creates vast new opportunities for abuse. Senator Schumer said that with this precedent the Trump Administration would be able to “choose an Agency action or policy [they don’t] like, stamp it with a label ‘CRA,’ send it over to the Congress, and Republicans will … repeal it at a simple majority threshold.” Senator Whitehouse explained, ”Essentially, any Executive decision since the passage of the Congressional Review Act can now be brought here on a purely political basis and—boom—blown up.” Senator Padilla agreed: “Under this logic, the Trump administration can send an endless stream of nonrule actions to Congress going back to 1996, including vaccine approvals.” Indeed, recent reporting indicates that EPA may now be searching for additional “older rules” that can be sent to Congress for CRA review.

It appears that Democratic legislators understand the threat the CRA now poses to Democratic policy priorities. This precedent could be a catalyst to accelerate the Senate towards majoritarian rule. A key argument for retention of the filibuster is the policy stability the filibuster promotes. Yet with this precedent, the filibuster has diminished value at providing that stability. A filibuster might stop a repeal of a statute, but the CRA would now allow any effort to implement that statute to be overturned by Congress. Additionally, overcoming a filibuster to enact a reform would also be of more limited value if an agency action is required to carry out that reform and those actions are threatened by a majority vote under the CRA. Still, retention of the filibuster would maintain a measure of stability, especially where agency implementation is limited or unnecessary.

Setting aside the larger discussion of filibuster reform, Democratic legislators have at least three alternatives to respond to the new CRA precedent.

First, Democratic legislators could attempt to operate under the current precedent and exploit it to their advantage during the next Democratic administration. Current policies relating to scientific research, reproductive health, fossil fuel permitting, and agency management could all presumably be undone with a Democrat in the White House and a willing Congress. Democratic senators raised that specter during the floor debate. Senator Schumer observed, “What goes around comes around,” and Senator Schiff raised the possibility that a Democratic majority could use the CRA to focus on state rules regarding mifepristone or federal licenses to export liquid natural gas.

But realistically, this new precedent – just like previous use of the CRA – will likely disproportionately impact Democratic administrations. Because of the CRA’s inherently deregulatory nature, there may be fewer targets of interest for Democratic policymakers. Additionally, the CRA’s prohibition on future agency actions that are “substantially the same” as a rescinded rule might impact Democratic policies more than Republican ones. The prohibition is vague and likely weak, but Democratic legislators might consider the uncertainty it creates as a disincentive for action under the CRA.

Second, Democratic legislators could seek legislative amendments to the CRA to reform the law or even to repeal it. To date, amendments to the CRA have not sought to meaningfully affect the scope or function of the Act. A 2023 amendment required additional analysis by the GAO and a 2024 amendment established a reporting and database requirement. Attempts to modify or repeal the CRA when it has become such a useful tool for their opposition may be difficult, but Democratic agreement that the CRA poses asymmetrical risks to Democratic governance is the first step. Identification of a revision that can more fairly serve all parties would be a difficult next step.

Finally, Democratic legislators could adopt chamber-specific reforms to how the CRA is used. In enacting the CRA, Congress recognized the unique space in which it was legislating. A Congress has very little ability to bind the process used in a future Congress. Therefore, Congress included a provision in the CRA to recognize the constitutional right of both chambers of Congress to change their rules “at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.” This means that at the beginning of a Congress that Democrats control, a legislative majority could decide to establish rules governing consideration of CRA resolutions that differ from those dictated by statute. This would be permissible under the CRA and warranted given the recent turn of events in the Senate. Such a rule change might limit or remove the privileged status of a resolution of disapproval. While such a change would not fix the precedent of May 21, 2025, it could limit the ability of a minority to hamper the governance of a Democratic President during that President’s term. Other creative options could certainly be developed.

The Senate’s new precedent allowing the CRA to be used to overturn EPA’s waivers of preemption for California emissions standards is another significant step in the long saga to reduce carbon pollution from the transportation sector. However, it is an even more important moment in the governance of the U.S. Senate. Perhaps it lays the foundation for a significant reconsideration of the Congressional Review Act.

This move aims to strengthen the Lucid graphite supply chain and reduce reliance on foreign materials, the company said.

Future Lucid electric vehicles will use natural and synthetic graphite produced in the United States through partnerships with battery cell suppliers.

U.S.-Based Supply Chain Strategy Gains Momentum

“A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation’s economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles,” said Marc Winterhoff, Interim CEO at Lucid. “These partnerships are another example of our commitment to manufacturing with localized supply chains.”

The supply deal with Graphite One marks another step in Lucid’s strategy to localize its battery material sourcing, it said.

Natural and Synthetic Graphite Sourced Domestically for Lucid Supply

Under the agreement, Graphite One will begin supplying Lucid and its battery partners with natural graphite in 2028. The material will be mined from the Graphite Creek deposit near Nome, Alaska.

This builds on a previous 2024 agreement with Lucid for synthetic graphite. It would be sourced from Graphite One’s proposed facility in Warren, Ohio.

“This agreement complements the deal we struck with Lucid in 2024. It marked the first synthetic graphite agreement between a U.S. graphite developer and a U.S. EV company,” said Anthony Huston, CEO at Graphite One. “We made history then. We’re continuing to make history now as we build momentum for our efforts to develop a fully domestic graphite supply chain. We can meet market demands and strengthen U.S. industry and national defense.”

Additional Supplier Partnership with Syrah Resources

In a separate supply agreement, Syrah Resources will begin supplying natural graphite active anode material (AAM) to Lucid starting in 2026. Over the three-year term, Syrah will collaborate with Lucid or its battery suppliers to fulfill purchasing needs. The graphite AAM will come from Syrah’s Vidalia, Louisiana, facility.

Graphite is a core component of lithium-ion battery anodes and plays a role in supporting fast-charging capabilities and long-range EV performance, according to Lucid.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lucid_Gravity_Lucid_Air.-1400.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 13:10:24.739229

The Indonesian government officially launched construction on a $5.9 billion integrated electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing project in Karawang, West Java, on Sunday, marking a major step toward its ambition to become Southeast Asia’s EV hub.

The project is a joint venture between Indonesia’s state-owned mining company Aneka Tambang (Antam), the Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), and a consortium led by China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), along with Brunp Recycling and Lygend Resources.

This flagship industrial initiative was first championed under former President Joko Widodo and is now being carried forward by President Prabowo Subianto, who presided over the groundbreaking ceremony.

“With great pride, I officially launch the construction of this integrated EV battery industry ecosystem, a collaboration between Antam, IBC, and the CBL consortium,” President Prabowo said during the ceremony.

Prabowo was joined by several senior officials, including Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia, State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, and Housing Minister Maruar Sirait, alongside Cabinet Secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya and regional government leaders. Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Wang Lutong also attended as a guest of honor.

The Karawang facility is being developed on a 3,000-hectare site and is expected to create up to 8,000 jobs once operational. The project will also drive the development of 18 key infrastructure projects, including a multipurpose port.

The plant is designed with sustainability in mind, combining coal, waste heat recovery, and solar power to reduce its environmental footprint.

The factory’s initial production capacity is targeted at 6.9 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the first phase, scaling up to 15 GWh in the second phase. Commercial operations are expected to begin by late 2026.

Nickel Mining and Recycling in Halmahera

In parallel, upstream operations are underway in East Halmahera, where Antam and Hong Kong CBL Limited (HK CBL) have established a joint venture called Feni Haltim. This venture will develop a new energy industrial park, featuring a nickel mine and pyrometallurgical smelter with an annual production capacity of 88,000 tons of refined nickel alloy starting in 2027.

Additionally, the Halmahera site will include facilities for producing nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode materials and a battery recycling plant, further enhancing Indonesia’s push toward a circular economy in the EV sector.

Bill Adds Surprise Tax That Could Cripple Wind and Solar Power - The New York Times,"Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/29/climate/gop-bill-adds-surprise-tax-that-could-cripple-wind-and-solar-power.html,"“And at a time when electricity prices and demand are soaring.” The bill would rapidly phase out existing federal tax subsidies for wind and solar power by 2027.

For utilities and tech companies, adding solar, wind and batteries has often been one of the easiest ways to help meet soaring electricity demand.
And the bill would impose new restrictions on tax breaks for factories that manufacture wind turbines, solar panels and batteries.
Projects would only qualify for a federal tax credit worth at least 30 percent of project costs if they finish construction by the end of 2027.","Senate Republicans have quietly inserted provisions in President Trump’s domestic policy bill that would not only end federal support for wind and solar energy but would impose an entirely new tax on future projects, a move that industry groups say could devastate the renewable power industry.

The tax provision, tucked inside the 940-page bill that the Senate made public just after midnight on Friday, stunned observers.

“This is how you kill an industry,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a nonpartisan group of business leaders and investors. “And at a time when electricity prices and demand are soaring.”

The bill would rapidly phase out existing federal tax subsidies for wind and solar power by 2027. Doing so, many companies say, could derail hundreds of projects under development and could jeopardize billions of dollars in manufacturing facilities that had been planned around the country with the subsidies in mind.

Those tax credits were at the heart of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022 in an attempt to nudge the country away from fossil fuels, the burning of which is driving climate change. President Trump, who has mocked climate science, has instead promoted fossil fuels and demanded that Republicans in Congress unwind the law.

But the latest version of the Senate bill would go much further. It would impose a steep penalty on all new wind and solar farms that come online after 2027 — even if they didn’t receive federal subsidies — unless they follow complicated and potentially unworkable requirements to disentangle their supply chains from China. Since China dominates global supply chains, that measure could affect a large number of companies.

“It came as a complete shock,” said Jason Grumet, the chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, which represents renewable energy producers. Soon after the Senate bill was made public, Mr. Grumet said that phones started ringing at 2:30 a.m. on Saturday with “everyone saying, ‘Can you believe this?’”

The new tax “is so carelessly written and haphazardly drafted that the concern is it will create uncertainty and freeze the markets,” Mr. Grumet said.

Even some of those who lobbied to end federal support for clean energy said the Senate bill went too far.

“I strongly recommend fully desubsidizing solar and wind vs. placing a kind of new tax on them,” wrote Alex Epstein, an influential activist who has been urging Republican senators to eliminate renewable energy subsidies. “I just learned about the excise tax and it’s definitely not something I would support.”

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also criticized the tax. “Overall, the Senate has produced a strong, pro-growth bill,” Neil Bradley, the group’s chief policy officer, posted on social media. “That said, taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.” He added: “It should be removed.”

Wind and solar projects are the fastest growing new source of electricity in the United States and account for nearly two-thirds of new electric capacity expected to come online this year. For utilities and tech companies, adding solar, wind and batteries has often been one of the easiest ways to help meet soaring electricity demand. Other technologies like new nuclear reactors can take much longer to build, and there is currently a multiyear backlog for new natural gas turbines.

The Senate bill, which is being debated on Sunday, would also eliminate federal tax credits this year for consumers to buy electric vehicles and to install solar panels and heat pumps in their homes. And the bill would impose new restrictions on tax breaks for factories that manufacture wind turbines, solar panels and batteries.

The White House in a statement praised the Senate legislation for “eliminating wasteful environmental policies” and said that “failure to pass the bill would be the ultimate betrayal.” Last week, Mr. Trump wrote that green tax credits are “a giant SCAM” and should be eliminated, referring to wind turbines “and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Some conservatives voiced support for the bill. If “repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative research group that supports fossil fuels. “Extending green giveaways on the backs of American taxpayers is shortsighted and neglectful.”

In another unexpected move, Senate Republicans added a provision that would provide tax credits for the U.S. production of metallurgical coal, a form of coal that has been used for decades in steel-making and is mainly exported to countries like India and Brazil.

While metallurgical coal accounts for around 10 percent of U.S. coal production and is not used in coal-burning power plants, the contrast struck many observers. Mr. Trump has promised to revive coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels and an industry that has been swiftly declining in the United States.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla, wrote on Saturday, underscoring his recent split with Mr. Trump. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

The version of the bill passed by the House in May sharply scaled back many of the law’s tax credits. Companies building wind, solar, geothermal or battery-storage plants could get a tax break only if they start construction within 60 days after the bill becomes law and finish the project by the end of 2028. New nuclear plants could receive the credit if they start construction before the end of 2028.

Electric utilities and other companies have warned that abruptly cutting off those tax breaks could cause electricity prices to surge. Many had asked the Senate to phase out the credits more slowly. At the same time, Mr. Trump and other House Republicans urged even deeper cuts.

The latest draft of the Senate bill would preserve tax credits for sources of emissions-free electricity that can run at all hours — such as nuclear reactors, geothermal plants, hydroelectric dams and industrial-scale batteries — through 2036. The bill would also expand tax breaks for biofuels and would enlarge subsidies for companies that capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks and use it to extract oil from underground.

But wind and solar power do not fare well. Projects would only qualify for a federal tax credit worth at least 30 percent of project costs if they finish construction by the end of 2027. Developers say that deadline could be difficult to meet, even for projects that are already underway, since companies often face delays in obtaining government permits or other obstacles beyond their control.

The bill also creates a complex set of rules requiring developers to prove that they are not using components that can trace back to China or other “prohibited foreign entities.” And, starting in 2027, the bill would impose new excise taxes on companies that fail to meet those requirements, even if they are no longer receiving federal subsidies.

Renewable energy companies say that they have been shifting away from Chinese components and toward using domestically made parts, but that the new restrictions are so opaque it could be tough for many businesses to prove they are in compliance.

Meanwhile, the US president, Donald Trump, has withdrawn from the Paris agreement and is intent on expanding fossil fuels and dismantling carbon-cutting efforts.
“Spending more on defence means spending less on climate,” said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis).
The world’s second biggest economy and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases is also the global renewable energy powerhouse.
Canada’s effort and Japan’s have both been found “insufficient”, however, by the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors the levels of countries’ emissions reduction.","“Climate is our biggest war. Climate is here for the next 100 years. We need to focus and … not allow those [other] wars to take our attention away from the bigger fight that we need to have.”

Ana Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, the UN climate summit to be held in Brazil this November, is worried. With only four months before the crucial global summit, the world’s response to the climate crisis is in limbo.

Fewer than 30 of the 200 countries that will gather in the Amazonian city of Belém have drafted plans, required by the 2015 Paris agreement, to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown.

And that crisis is escalating. In the last two years, for the first time, global land temperatures soared to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – breaching the limit that governments have promised at multiple climate meetings to keep.

Meanwhile, the US president, Donald Trump, has withdrawn from the Paris agreement and is intent on expanding fossil fuels and dismantling carbon-cutting efforts. The EU is mired in tense arguments over its plans. China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, is rumoured to be considering weak targets that would condemn the world to much greater heating.

And the attention of world leaders is elsewhere, as the conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral further. Poor countries are labouring under a mountain of debt, and the continuing cost of living crisis in many countries is fuelling populism and a backlash against green policy.

Toni, a respected Brazilian economist, told the Guardian: “There’s no doubt that the wars that we’ve seen – military wars and trade wars … are very damaging – physically, economically, socially – and they divert the direction and the attention from climate.”

Vulnerable countries fear their concerns will be lost amid the push for militarisation. “Spending more on defence means spending less on climate,” said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis).

But the questions for Belém cannot be ignored. Can the world cut greenhouse gas emissions far enough and fast enough to stabilise global temperatures? Is the lack of progress inevitable when hundreds of countries are trying to agree a way forward, or are more sinister forces at play, trying to throw up roadblocks? Has a recent meeting in Bonn done anything to bring more resolution and collaboration?

Beyond 1.5C of heating, the impacts of climate chaos – heatwaves, sea level rises, species die-offs, droughts, floods and storms – will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible. And we now know that the world could already be traversing vital “tipping points”, beyond which runaway climate change will be impossible to recover from within human timeframes.

Anna Rasmussen, the chief negotiator for Aosis, said: “Around the world, the ‘unprecedented’ has become our new norm. The economics of small island states are stymied by disasters we did not cause. Not even a year ago, the Caribbean was ravaged by Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic ever recorded.”

Nationally determined contributions

Since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Temperatures are affected by the cumulative quantity of carbon in the atmosphere, so every additional tonne counts: scientists have now calculated that we can only carry on producing current levels of carbon dioxide for two more years, ensuring the breach of the 1.5C limit becomes permanent.

But while temperatures have soared, and weather records have tumbled, any sense of urgency inside the negotiating halls seems to have cooled. Two weeks of preliminary talks, intended to lay the groundwork for Cop30, have just finished in Bonn. They started two days late because countries could not agree an agenda, and ended without clear negotiating texts for the key points.

Some of the frustrating lack of progress is inevitable, as countries grapple with geopolitics and the complexity of getting nearly 200 governments in line. But several negotiators told the Guardian they saw more sinister motives in play – deliberate attempts by some recalcitrant countries or their allies, usually fossil fuel producers, to throw up roadblocks.

“These are not accidents we are seeing, they are attempts to slow things down, no question,” said one. At one point, according to an observer, a key discussion degenerated into speculation about the buttons on a putative website presenting data, rather than addressing the substantive points.

At the core of the Cop30 summit will be the national plans on emissions. Known as “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs), these are the bedrock of the Paris agreement, setting out not just overall targets on how far governments intend to cut emissions over the next decade, but also indicating what measures might be taken in different sectors to meet those goals, such as boosting renewable energy or improving efficiency.

The Brazilian hosts of the Cop30 summit are urging governments to finish their NDCs by September, so the UN can assess them ahead of the scheduled start of Cop30 in November.

“We are really far from where we need to go, even in quantity of NDCs, let alone how ambitious [they are] and the quality of them,” Toni told the Guardian. “I don’t think there is any excuse [for countries not to come up with new NDCs]. We are expecting NDCs that are improved, both in terms of ambitions and on their quality.”

Most closely watched will be China. The world’s second biggest economy and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases is also the global renewable energy powerhouse. China’s green economy has outstripped all expectations, with about a third of electricity now coming from clean sources, and renewable generation capacity on track to double by 2030, compared with 2022 levels.

China is also the biggest exporter of renewable energy components and electric vehicles, so stands to benefit from other countries setting stiffer targets on emissions. Experts believe that China could halve its emissions by 2035 without difficulty – yet the government is thought to be considering tabling reductions of only about 10%.

Coal is the reason. While coal fell to its lowest share of electricity generation on record in May 2024, this year a surge of approvals of new coal-fired power plants, and investment in mining, has alarmed analysts.

Gao Yuhe, of Greenpeace East Asia, said China could cause its emissions to peak this year if renewable energy growth continues. “The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment in the country’s energy transition,” she said. “There is already enough existing capacity to meet today’s peak demand. Approving a new wave of large-scale coal projects risks creating overcapacity, stranded assets, and higher transition costs. That will ultimately undermine progress toward a cleaner, more flexible power system.”

The EU is locked in tense negotiations over its carbon target for 2040, which will be thrashed out next week. That target, which is expected to involve a cut in carbon of at least 90% compared with 1990 levels, would be the steepest yet presented, but arguments are raging over whether, and how much of, this could be met by trading carbon credits with other countries. When the 2040 figure is agreed, it must then also be translated into a commensurate 2035 goal – the end date for the current commitment period under the Paris agreement – and published along with further policy details as a fully fledged NDC in September.

Other countries, including major emerging economies such as India, are still to submit their plans. “There is a lot of watching and waiting going on,” says Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a prominent thinktank in India and one of the Cop30 envoys chosen by Brazil to support the aims of the talks. “We should be judging countries on implementation – climate leaders are those who get things done, rather than those who say things.”

A few countries have already presented their NDCs. The UK’s is judged to be fairly ambitious, with an 81% cut in emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2035. Canada’s effort and Japan’s have both been found “insufficient”, however, by the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors the levels of countries’ emissions reduction.

A further problem is that none of the NDCs so far, which are pegged to 2035 or 2040, have contained revisions of countries’ existing near-term targets. Current NDCs, set at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, are inadequate to stay within 1.5C. At Glasgow, countries agreed that the “ratchet” – the system for updating NDCs – should allow for the upward revision of targets more frequently than the five-yearly system laid out in the Paris agreement.

Disappointingly, no countries have availed themselves of the opportunity, said Niklas Höhne, of the NewClimate Institute. “[To stay within the 1.5C limit] needs drastic reductions. None of the NDCs on the table have updated 2030 numbers. But if we do not do more by 2030, it will be very difficult to catch up later.”

Last year’s conference of the parties (Cop) focused on finance, and that will also play a major role this year. Developing countries need assistance from the rich world, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. At Cop29, they were assured of $1.3tn a year by 2035, with $300bn of this coming in the form of public finance from developed countries.

Those numbers will be harder to reach now that the US has pulled out of climate finance and other forms of overseas aid. Poor countries want to see concrete plans for how the financial flows will be reached, and Brazil is working with last year’s host, Azerbaijan, on a “Baku to Belém roadmap” due in October.

Yalchin Rafiyev, the chief negotiator for Azerbaijan at Cop29 last year in Baku, warned that not enough was being done to meet the financial commitments made last year, particularly from the taxpayer-funded development banks. “We have seen very low-profile engagement of MDBs [multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank] in climate-related issues,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “We have opened the Baku to Belém roadmap to $1.3tn for wider stakeholders for their written submissions. So far, we have received 102 submissions, and only two of them are from MDBs. That’s quite surprising, because they have always expressed their interest to be part of the process.”

Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, the chief negotiator for Panama, said being able to show substantial progress on finance was crucial. “We need to define what is the roadmap to close the finance gap towards developing nations, because if we don’t address that, if we don’t fill that gap, if we don’t provide these resources, then we cannot expect developing nations to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement,” he said. “It’s all about the money.”

Brazil’s agenda for Cop30 also gives little room for what many activists still see as the key question: fossil fuels. At Cop28, in Dubai, countries made a landmark commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels”. At Cop29, attempts to flesh that out with a timeframe and details of what it would mean were stymied by opposition from petrostates, including Saudi Arabia.

Activists had hoped to bring the commitment back to Cop30, to be elaborated and formalised into a coherent plan that countries would sign up to. But Brazil appears wary of reopening the debate, and would prefer to regard such past resolutions as settled. The presidency has been resistant even to the idea of a “cover text”, the catch-all outcome document that in most Cops captures the key resolutions.

At Bonn, it was not clear where in the Cop30 agenda it would be possible to discuss the transition away from fossil fuels. “We tried to get to discuss it [in various forums] but we keep getting it moved away,” said Stela Herschmann, of the Observatório do Clima network of civil society groups in Brazil. “It’s like nobody wants us.”

Despite the frustrations of the last two weeks of pre-talks in Bonn, the goodwill that Brazil enjoys as host nation was much in evidence. The presidency has drawn on expertise from around the world, creating a “circle” of the former Cop presidents since the Paris agreement was forged in 2015, a “circle” of finance ministers from around the world, and a group of economists. Indigenous people will play a key role, with a “global ethical stocktake” intended to reflect their concerns, involving Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, and well-known climate activists including Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. Brazil has also set out an “action agenda” to track progress on initiatives from previous Cops and to foreground key issues related to the climate crisis, such as food and agriculture, forestry and nature, water, oceans, social justice and equity.

The irony is that the most substantive issue of Cop30 – the NDCs – will be out of Brazil’s hands, decided in national capitals long before any leaders hop on planes for Belém. “We don’t negotiate NDCs at Cops – this is nationally determined, so what we will have at Cop30 is the report of those nationally determined decisions that have been taken,” said Toni. “And yes, that can be frustrating. There can be a good picture or very bad picture, we will see, but it will be a reflection of national politics more than anything. We are obviously the designated president of Cop30, but it is a collective responsibility.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd866c5492c84b79b1c5f802ff22d63bb85a50ca/0_50_3632_2906/master/3632.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=128da0dc103dda30ae956cb42596e7da,N,,2025-06-29 13:11:16.779969

On their first day as the front-month, gas futures for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 10.5 cents, or 3.0%, from where the August contract closed on Thursday to $3.631 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at 9:06 a.m. EDT (1306 GMT).

That put the front-month up about 12% from where the July contract closed on Thursday when it was still the front-month. On Thursday, the front-month closed at its lowest since May 28 for a second day in a row.

Even though meteorologists forecast the weather will remain hotter than normal for at least the next two weeks, those temperatures were not expected to return to the highs seen earlier this week.

In fact, some analysts have started to say the market may have already seen its highest price for the summer when it hit $4.15 per MMBtu on June 20 in anticipation of this week's heat.

Futures for September 2025 started trading at a premium over August 2025 for the first time ever three days ago as the market bets supplies will be lower, demand will be higher and/or the surplus of gas in storage above normal levels will be lower (or even in a deficit) in September.

After adding more gas into storage than usual for 10 weeks in a row, analysts projected energy firms likely injected less gas than usual into inventories this week as power generators burned lots of the fuel to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming during a brutal heat wave.

Supply and Demand

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to 105.6 billion cubic feet per day so far in June, up from 105.2 Bcf/d in May, but still below the monthly record high of 106.3 Bcf/d in March due primarily to normal spring pipeline maintenance earlier in the month.

Meteorologists forecast weather across the Lower 48 states will remain mostly warmer than normal through at least July 12.

With more summer heat still to come, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would rise from 103.9 Bcf/d this week to 106.0 Bcf/d next week and the week after. The forecasts for this week and next week were similar to LSEG's outlook on Thursday.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 14.2 Bcf/d so far in June, down from 15.0 Bcf/d in May and a monthly record high of 16.0 Bcf/d in April. The feedgas average for June, however, was up a bit from where it was earlier in the month as units at some LNG plants returned from maintenance reductions.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, surpassing Australia and Qatar, as surging global prices fed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Gas was trading at a four-week low of around $11 per MMBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and a two-week low of around $13 at the Japan Korea Marker (JMM) benchmark in Asia.

A quiet success story in energy and climate Energy Star does not grab headlines.","Since the early 1990s, the small blue Energy Star label has appeared on millions of household appliances, electronics and even buildings across the United States. But as the Trump administration considers terminating some or all of the program, it is worth a look at what exactly this government-backed label means, and why it has become one of the most recognizable environmental certifications in the country.

Energy Star was launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 and later expanded in partnership with the Department of Energy with a simple goal: making it easier for consumers and businesses to choose energy-efficient products, helping them reduce energy use and save money, without sacrificing quality or performance.

As a scholar of energy conservation, I have studied the Energy Star program’s development and public impact, including how it has shaped consumer behavior and environmental outcomes.

According to the EPA, it has saved consumers an average of $15 billion a year on energy costs since its inception, a massive return on a program that costs taxpayers an estimated $32 million a year.

How Energy Star works

When you see an Energy Star label on a product, it means that product has met strict energy efficiency standards set by the EPA in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, which tests how much energy appliances use. The federal agencies also consult with product manufacturers, utilities and others to figure out how best to improve products and determine how cost-effective changes might be.

Products that earn the Energy Star certification typically use significantly less energy than standard models, often between 10% and 50% less. The energy – and financial – savings can add up quickly, especially when homes or buildings have multiple Energy Star appliances and systems.

Energy Star itself does not manufacture or sell products. Instead, it acts as a trusted third-party certifier, providing consumers and businesses with reliable information and clear labeling. It also offers information to help people estimate energy savings and compare long-term costs, making it easier to identify high-performing, cost-effective options. Manufacturers participating in Energy Star seek to improve their environmental reputation and increase their market share, giving them a strong incentive to meet the program’s efficiency criteria.

Today, the label appears on refrigerators, dishwashers, laptops, commercial buildings and even newly built homes. The government says people in more than 90% of American households recognize the label.

People don’t always choose efficient products

Energy Star seeks to tackle a wide range of problems that can result in people deciding not to buy energy-efficient products.

One problem is that efficient models often come with higher up-front costs. While efficient models save money over time, that higher purchase price can discourage buyers. Energy Star helps counter this problem by clearly showing how much money can be saved on energy costs over the lifetime of the product – as compared with noncertified products – and by offering rebates that reduce the initial expense.

Another problem involves what economists call “split incentives.” A landlord might not want to pay a higher price up front for energy-efficient appliances if the tenants are the ones who will save money on the utility bills. And renters may not want to spend a lot of money on appliances or equipment in a place they do not own. Energy Star tries to bridge this divide by promoting whole-building certifications, which encourage landlords to invest in their buildings’ energy efficiency with the goal of making their properties more attractive to tenants.

The countless varieties of refrigerators, dishwashers, air conditioners and other items on the market can also create confusion. Consumers who just look at manufacturers’ promotional material may find it very hard to determine which appliances truly deliver better energy efficiency. The Energy Star label makes this comparison easier: If the label is there, it is among the most efficient choices available.

And consumers are often skeptical of manufacturers’ claims – especially when it comes to new technologies or environmental promises. Energy Star’s status as a program backed by the government, rather than a private company, gives it a level of independence and credibility that many other labels lack. People know the certification is based on science, not sales tactics.

Lastly, Energy Star helps overcome the problem that many people are not aware of how much energy their appliances consume, or how those choices contribute to climate change. By connecting everyday products to larger environmental outcomes, Energy Star helps consumers understand the effects of their decisions, without needing to become energy experts.

The program delivers real results

Since its inception, more than 800,000 appliance models have earned Energy Star certification based on the criteria for their type of product.

The same principles that make the label valuable for consumer appliances – independent certification, clear metrics and a focus on results – have proved equally effective in real estate. Nearly 45,000 commercial buildings and industrial plants have earned certification. And there have been more than 2.5 million Energy Star-certified homes and apartments built in the U.S.

In 2023 alone, over 190,000 new homes and apartments were certified, representing more than 12% of all new residential construction nationwide.

Energy Star-certified homes are designed to be at least 10% more energy efficient than those built to standard building codes, with more insulation and windows and lights that are energy-efficient, as well as appliances. These enhancements can translate to better quality, comfort and long-term cost savings for homeowners.

Commercial buildings, which account for about 18% of total U.S. energy use, have also benefited substantially. Research I was involved in found that certified commercial buildings use an average of 19% less energy than their noncertified counterparts.

Why government leadership matters

Energy Star’s status as a government-led label contributes to its credibility as a more neutral and science-based source of information than commercial labels.

Energy Star’s government connections also bring scale: By requiring federal purchases to have Energy Star certifications, the federal government can influence manufacturers. For example, a federal executive order in 1993 required government agencies to purchase only computers that had been Energy Star-certified, which required them to have energy-saving sleep functions.

In response, manufacturers began including the feature so they could sell their products to the government. Consumers soon came to expect the sleep feature on all computers.

A quiet success story in energy and climate

Energy Star does not grab headlines. It does not rely on regulation or mandates. Yet it has quietly become one of the most effective tools the U.S. has for improving energy efficiency across homes, offices and public buildings.

That said, the program is not without its limitations. Some critics have pointed out that not all certified products consistently perform at the highest efficiency levels. Other critics note that the benefits of Energy Star are more accessible to wealthier consumers who can afford up-front investments, even with available rebates. And the EPA itself has, at times, struggled to manage the certification process and update standards in line with the latest technological advances.

At a time when energy costs and climate concerns are rising, Energy Star stands out as a rare example of a practical, nonpartisan program that delivers real benefits. It helps individuals, businesses and communities save money, lower emissions and take part in a more sustainable future – one smart decision at a time.

Yes, electricity is not free, but it’s very close to being free compared to the price of a gallon of gas.

Unfortunately, most electric vehicles were not practical purchases for me. Many were more expensive than what I was willing to spend on a car, and some simply did not fit our needs for a vehicle.

We have a very small, two-car garage and a very narrow driveway. We purchased a new Kia Soul, essentially because it was the only car that was reasonably affordable that also fit in our garage.

Our son needed a car, so we gave him my Toyota Prius, and I bought my first electric car, a 2017 BMW i3. It was a modest purchase by BMW standards at about $11,000.

It’s also not entirely electric. It has a 2-gallon gas tank that can be used to create electricity. Under most circumstances, on a full charge, using the middle efficiency settings, I get about 125 miles from the electric battery.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter 💰💵

It’s a little more for local driving and a little less for highway driving. The extra tank, which BMW calls the Range Extender, gives me another 80 or so miles.

The gas tank also offers an option when charging is not possible.

EV charging does not work the way I thought it did

We installed a level two charging station in our garage. That means I can charge at home, but with three cars to juggle, it’s often a hassle to get into position to charge my car.

A level two charger is not a quick process. It takes maybe five or six hours to fully charge the car. That would be adequate if we had a bigger garage, but on many occasions, I have found myself looking for a charging station.

The good news is that for level three charging stations, I do have a couple of options. In theory, there are two charging stations at the Wawa about two miles from our house.

I say in theory, because while I’ve seen other people charge there, I’ve never been able to make it work. I downloaded the app, backed into the space, plugged in, and I never got it to work.

More on travel:

Florida Light and Power, our electric company, also has four charging stations not too far, maybe a little over two miles from our house. Those actually work, but I did not realize how slowly even a level three charger works.

In about half an hour, I can charge my battery maybe 70% of the way. Once I hit 80%, the charger slowed down, so that’s clearly how much it wants me to charge.

America does not have enough charging stations

While there are only a couple of options to charge near where we live, there don’t seem to be that many other people needing to charge their cars.

When we're in a bigger city, there are more chargers, but way too many people using them.

The electric company app shows me how many chargers each station has and how many are being used. It is not, however, very good at showing you which ones aren’t working at that moment.

Having many broken chargers can lead to going into a place to charge your car and not actually being able to do it. Since it takes a half hour or more, many people go grab a coffee, do some shopping or otherwise leave their cars while they power up.

That means that many of the charging stations may be occupied by cars that have already been charged. It's frustrating, and charging takes a lot longer than filling up with gas did.

Buying an electric car has meant always considering where I am going to charge it. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s much more frustrating than I thought it would be.

If I did not have the range extender, I would be constantly worried about it.

Elon Musk warns that ending EV tax credits early could harm U.S. jobs, innovation, and long-term competitiveness.

He points to the bipartisan roots of the $7,500 credit, originally created under the Bush administration to boost energy independence.

Musk argues that cutting incentives now gives an advantage to global rivals like China, which are expanding EV support.

The rollback represents a sharp shift from decades of U.S. policy aimed at building domestic clean energy leadership.

Elon Musk has issued a pointed warning against a newly proposed Senate tax bill that accelerates the termination of electric vehicle tax credits, arguing that the rollback threatens not only America’s energy future but also its political stability.

The Tesla CEO voiced concern that the planned cuts to the $7,500 credit for new EV purchases would undermine decades of bipartisan effort and dampen innovation in a sector crucial to U.S. competitiveness.

The proposed legislation, reportedly backed by former President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans, would move up the sunset date for key clean energy credits to September 30. The cuts would affect not only new EV buyers, but also eliminate credits for used and commercial electric vehicles.

Musk warned that the abrupt shift could deliver a blow to American employment, particularly as automakers scale up domestic EV manufacturing. He also noted the political risk to Republicans, citing polling that shows most Americans support EV incentives as part of a broader transition to sustainable transport.

A Legacy of Bipartisan Support for EV Adoption

While some Republican lawmakers have framed the tax credits as partisan giveaways, Musk was quick to point out their bipartisan origins. The EV tax incentive, he explained, first emerged during the Bush administration as part of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, and was expanded by both parties over subsequent years.

Rather than serving as simple consumer perks, the credits were intended to foster energy independence and reduce the nation’s reliance on imported oil, an aim that had wide support across the political spectrum during a time of global energy insecurity.

The structure of the tax credit was designed to encourage early market development without creating long-term dependency, with built-in caps and phase-out thresholds. This policy model, Musk suggested, offered a responsible way for government to accelerate innovation while allowing the private sector to eventually stand on its own. By withdrawing support prematurely, the bill threatens to unravel the careful balance that has helped push EVs toward mass adoption.

Global Rivals Double Down as U.S. Pulls Back

Musk’s criticism also highlighted how the U.S. risks falling behind global competitors who continue to back their EV sectors aggressively. Countries like China and Norway have offered wide-ranging support for electric transportation, fueling rapid growth in market share and manufacturing dominance.

As American automakers like Tesla and General Motors commit billions toward electrification, a sudden change in policy could create uncertainty and open the door for foreign firms to outpace the U.S. in clean mobility.

This comes at a time when EV adoption is accelerating globally. Industry analysts expect sales to top 20 million vehicles in 2025. In this context, Musk emphasized that slashing federal incentives could signal to investors and manufacturers that the U.S. is stepping back from a future it once helped shape.

Rollback Seen as Reversal of Energy Strategy

Musk’s broader concern centers on what the rollback signals for America’s long-term strategy. For years, EV tax credits were seen as part of a larger goal to strengthen domestic energy resilience and reduce pollution-related health costs. With relatively modest government investment compared to the potential environmental and economic benefits, Musk argued that the credits represent smart industrial policy—not just environmentalism.

As the U.S. inches toward clean energy leadership, the decision to curtail EV support could stall that momentum. Musk’s warning is not just about Tesla’s bottom line, but about protecting an American-led energy transition that had, until now, enjoyed broad political consensus.",https://coincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2318800323-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 12:12:34.851670

The legislation, set to slash wind and solar incentives while imposing punitive taxes on projects reliant on Chinese supply chains, has ignited fears of a “regulatory trainwreck” for clean energy firms. For investors, the stakes are clear: this is a defining moment to reassess risk in renewables and identify sectors that can thrive—or falter—in a policy-driven storm.

The Senate Bill's Triple Threat to Renewables

The bill's core provisions—repealing tax credits, introducing excise taxes tied to supply chains, and accelerating subsidy phase-outs—form a trifecta of headwinds for the sector. The immediate removal of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for wind and solar projects by 2027 could freeze over $200 billion in planned investments, according to industry analysts. Meanwhile, a 30%-50% excise tax on projects using components from “Foreign Entities of Concern” (read: China) adds a compliance nightmare, as 80% of solar panels and 60% of wind turbines currently rely on Chinese materials.

The impact is already visible in equity markets. Take Tesla's stock, which has underperformed the S&P 500 by 20% since the bill's draft circulated in April. The electric vehicle giant, which relies on federal credits for sales and battery production, faces a September 2025 deadline for EV subsidies—a timeline that could force price hikes or production cuts.

Sector-Specific Risks: Where Capital Will Flee

The bill's most immediate victims are companies tied to traditional renewables. Solar manufacturers like Qcells and wind turbine makers such as Vestas face a dual crisis: shrinking demand due to subsidy losses and soaring costs from supply chain penalties. Even firms with U.S. manufacturing footprints, such as First Solar, are scrambling to source materials outside China—a near-impossible task given global supply chains.

Job losses, projected at 830,000 by 2030, amplify the risk. States like Texas, California, and North Carolina, which host 60% of U.S. renewable jobs, could see capital flight to countries like Vietnam or India, where green policies remain stable.

Opportunities in the Policy Crossfire

The Senate bill's wrath, however, creates asymmetric opportunities for investors willing to look beyond the headlines:

Advanced Battery Tech: The Last Renewable Holdout

While wind and solar face existential threats, battery storage companies like QuantumScape and Solid Power are shielded by demand from utilities needing grid stability and EV makers seeking to retain competitiveness. The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Production Credit (45X) for battery production, though phased out faster, still applies to projects completed by 2026—giving a narrow window to lock in incentives.

Space Infrastructure: Musk's Side Bet Pays Off

With SpaceX's Starlink and satellite broadband projects, Musk has quietly positioned himself in a sector the Senate bill ignores. As terrestrial energy costs rise, space-based communication and energy solutions (e.g., solar power satellites) could emerge as critical infrastructure. Investors might look to companies like Maxar Technologies or Astrobotic, which are already securing NASA contracts for lunar exploration—another Musk-led frontier.

Policy Proof: Firms with Diversified Revenue

Companies like NextEra Energy, which derives 40% of revenue from regulated utilities and grid services, offer a buffer against subsidy cuts. Similarly, Siemens Energy's pivot into hydrogen and nuclear fusion R&D insulates it from reliance on wind tax credits.

Political Uncertainty = A Buy Signal for the Bold?

The Senate bill's political fragility could be its own undoing. Senators from states like Utah (a solar hub) and Alaska (a wind hotspot) are already threatening amendments to soften the tax credit phaseout. If the bill is diluted, renewables stocks could rebound sharply. For contrarians, buying beaten-down solar ETFs (e.g., TAN) at 2020-era valuations may prove prescient.

Final Take: Navigating the Regulatory Whiplash

Investors must treat the Senate bill as a pivot point. Short-term, prioritize battery tech and space infrastructure—sectors where Musk's advocacy and market demand align. For the long term, bet on policy resilience: firms with diversified revenue streams, geographic flexibility, or exposure to stable markets like the EU (where renewables subsidies are expanding).

As Musk warns, the U.S. risks ceding its green tech crown to China—a shift that could accelerate capital flight. But in every crisis, opportunity lurks. For those willing to navigate the storm, the post-subsidy renewable era may favor the nimble and the visionary.

Just downstream, the 520 MW Parbati Project Phase III (PHEP-III) was similarly incapacitated—its trash racks buried beneath metres of debris, halting some 30 million units’ generation of electricity per day.
Full generation might take some more time, provided there are no further rain-triggered surges.” Though this timeline is aggressive, the region’s power planners are under immense pressure.","The cloudburst on June 25 unleashed floods across remote Sainj valley, crippling nearly the entire hydropower corridor. Within hours, raging waters—laden with boulders, silt and uprooted trees—overran intakes, penstocks and turbine halls, forcing a complete shutdown of four major plants with a combined capacity of 1,420 MW.

The fallout is stark, operators are now grappling with daily revenue losses running into several crores of rupees. A multi-month restoration race against time is already under way.

Two National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) projects bore the brunt. The 800 MW Parbati Hydroelectric Project Phase II (PHEP-II) saw its entire powerhouse floor inundated with sludge, clogging draft tubes and disabling all four turbines.

Just downstream, the 520 MW Parbati Project Phase III (PHEP-III) was similarly incapacitated—its trash racks buried beneath metres of debris, halting some 30 million units’ generation of electricity per day. The 100 MW Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (HPPCL) Sainj hydel project and a private 1 MW mini-hydel plant in the same valley also collapsed under the deluge, with the latter’s dam and powerhouse structures suffering damage.

Rehabilitation teams have mobilised heavy earth-moving equipment from NHPC’s adjoining sites. As river levels subside, contractors are carving temporary bypass channels around the jammed intakes and shoring up damaged sections of the headrace tunnels.

“Once the flow eases,” explains PHEP-II head Ranjeet Singh, “we’ll divert the Jivah nullah spill into a new alignment. Only then can we accurately assess the structural damage inside the powerhouse.” He cautions, however, that clearing compacted debris, much of it lodged beneath the turbines and draft tubes, could take time.

Meanwhile, at PHEP-III, General Manager Prakash Chand Azad remains cautiously optimistic. He said, “With specialised equipment, we expect to restore at least two units within a short time. Full generation might take some more time, provided there are no further rain-triggered surges.”

Though this timeline is aggressive, the region’s power planners are under immense pressure. These hills contribute key peaking power for northern India’s summer grid. Any prolonged outage risks grid instability and forces reliance on costly thermal plants.

Beyond repairs, the disaster underscores a growing vulnerability. Experts warn that Himalayan cloudbursts, once rare, are spiking in frequency and intensity, driven by shifting monsoon patterns and glacial melt. As restoration teams race to bring units back online, state authorities are also conducting post-mortems on slope stabilisation, upstream catchment management and early-warning systems to safeguard the valley’s lifeblood — its rivers.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9tZWRpYTQzZTJmZjQwLTU0NjctMTFmMC05YTI3LWZiZmNhMjFkMmNiMC5qcGc=,N,,2025-06-29 13:09:47.997936

“Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!” Mr. Trump said.
It was not, so Mr. Paul voted against the motion to proceed on Saturday, despite golfing with Mr. Trump that morning.
Mr. Johnson separately met with Mr. Trump on Saturday morning but throughout the day maintained his opposition to rushing the Senate bill to a vote.
Despite all the challenges, Senate Republicans’ latest tweaks to the bill did win over some notable holdouts.","Senate Republicans late Saturday voted to begin debate on President Trump’s sweeping tax and spending package, kickstarting an effort to get the measure to his desk by July 4.

The 51-49 test vote was a victory for Republicans after struggling Saturday to secure enough support to take that first step, holding the procedural vote open for almost four hours as GOP leaders negotiated with various holdouts.

Vice President J.D. Vance waited in the Capitol prepared to break a tie, but ultimately he was not needed.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican, cast her “yes” vote nearly two hours in, while GOP Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida followed two more hours later.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the legislation is poised to deliver on Republicans’ promises and “make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous.”

“Fifty-three members will never agree on every detail of legislation, let’s face it,” the South Dakota Republican said in a floor speech before the vote. “But Republicans are united in our commitment to what we’re doing in this bill – securing our border; strengthening our national defense; growing our economy; unleashing American energy; cutting waste, fraud, and abuse; and preventing tax hikes on hardworking Americans.”

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, is forcing Senate clerks to read the bill aloud on the floor before the chamber proceeds to up to 20 hours of debate, after which unlimited amendment votes can begin. That puts the bill on track for passage sometime Monday.

“Republicans won’t tell America what’s in the bill. So Democrats are forcing it to be read start to finish on the floor,” Mr. Schumer said.

Senate Republicans’ latest changes, unveiled late Friday night, moved some GOP holdouts to “yes,” while others who voted to proceed to the bill are withholding judgment on final passage.

“That does not mean in any way that I’m satisfied with the provisions in this bill,” said Sen. Susan Collins, Maine Republican. “I intend to file several amendments to it.”

For example, she said she plans to push a proposal to let the top tax rate for the highest income earners revert to 39.6%. The Senate proposal extends the current 37% top individual rate and lower rates for taxpayers of all income levels enacted during Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cut bill.

Two Senate Republicans – Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky – voted against the motion to proceed.

Mr. Trump remained publicly silent Saturday ahead of the vote, but the White House put out a statement saying he supports the Senate measure and warning Republicans that failing to pass it “would be the ultimate betrayal.”

The president quickly proved that true, attacking Mr. Tillis on social media after he cast his “no” vote.

“North Carolina will not allow one of their Senators to GRANDSTAND in order to get some publicity for himself, for a possible, but very difficult Re-Election,” Mr. Trump said.

He slammed the senator, who is up for reelection in 2026 and a top Democratic target, for effectively voting for a 68% tax increase, as that is that is what would happen if his first-term cuts expire at the end of the year, and against no tax on tips, overtime and some Social Security benefits, among other GOP priorities in the bill.

“Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!” Mr. Trump said.

In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump said “numerous people” have offered to run in a GOP primary against Mr. Tillis and that he would be meeting with them over the coming weeks.

Mr. Tillis only cited one issue in his statement on opposing the bill: a Medicaid overhaul that would result in “tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities.”

“This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population,” he said.

Mr. Paul, concerned about the deficit impact, has broadcast his opposition to the bill for weeks, saying he would not support the measure unless a provision to raise the debt limit by $5 trillion was dropped.

It was not, so Mr. Paul voted against the motion to proceed on Saturday, despite golfing with Mr. Trump that morning. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Eric Schmitt of Missouri, supporters of the bill, also joined the president’s golf outing.

Mr. Johnson separately met with Mr. Trump on Saturday morning but throughout the day maintained his opposition to rushing the Senate bill to a vote.

He initially cast a “no” vote, but after joining in late-night negotiations with GOP leaders and fellow deficit hawks Mr. Lee, Ms. Lummis and Mr. Scott to secure more spending cuts, he flipped.

Mr. Lee, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, had to withdraw a priority of his from the bill at the last minute due to challenges raised under the Senate rules and opposition from some of his GOP colleagues.

The dropped proposal would have required the Bureau of Land Management to sell 0.25-0.5% of the over 245 million acres the federal government owns to bidders interested in developing the land for housing and associated community needs.

Montana Republican Sens. Tim Sheehy and Steve Daines and Idaho GOP Sens. Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch opposed the proposal and had planned to offer an amendment to strike it.

Mr. Lee had called their opposition “unfortunate,” citing changes he made “to accommodate most if not all of the concerns people had expressed.”

But in a statement on his decision to withdraw the proposal, Mr. Lee only cited the roadblock under Senate rules.

“Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock, and not to any foreign interests,” he said.

Despite all the challenges, Senate Republicans’ latest tweaks to the bill did win over some notable holdouts.

Sen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, the most vocal critic of the Senate’s Medicaid changes, said Saturday he would vote for the bill on final passage. He cited updates that delayed implementation of a crackdown on state provider taxes and added a $25 billion rural health fund to provide relief for hospitals that would lose funding as a result.

The Senate measure would force most states to lower provider tax rates to no more than 3.5% if they want to use the revenue to pay for increased Medicaid payments to the same providers, which would inflate the cost of their Medicaid programs and the share the federal government must contribute.

The phase down of what is known as the “safe-harbor” limit, currently 6%, would not begin until fiscal 2028, with 0.5% annual reductions until it reaches 3.5% in fiscal 2032.

Mr. Hawley said Missouri’s provider taxes are low enough that the phase down wouldn’t hit them until 2030, but the state would begin receiving a portion of the rural health funding in 2028.

“In Missouri, we’re going to get an increase in overall Medicaid funds in this decade, which is good for us,” he said.

However, Missouri would still face hospital funding cuts after 2030.

“I don’t want those future cuts to take effect, and I’ll do everything I can in the next three years to see that they don’t,” Mr. Hawley said.

The Medicaid tweaks may be enough for Mr. Hawley, but are not for several House Republicans, who announced their opposition Saturday to the Senate’s stricter changes to the low-income health program.

“I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams our hospitals rely on, including provider taxes and state-directed payments, or any provisions that punish [Medicaid] expansion states,” Rep. David Valadao said.

Mr. Valadao led a letter earlier this week to GOP leaders that 15 other House Republicans signed. It said they oppose the Senate’s Medicaid overhaul and want to keep the House’s “more pragmatic and compassionate” approach.

Mr. Hawley, who also prefers the House version, did not rule out offering amendments on the floor to change the bill, but said he would vote for final passage either way.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/06/26/Trump_31081_c0-0-6869-4006_s1200x700.jpg?c4badb8c7dc63af9afd9d736b7ff5c69f9bf0a7e,N,,2025-06-29 12:14:15.121700

Quickly Cutting EV Incentives Will Hurt Dealers Part of the tax code you're unlikely to know about benefits dealers for investing in selling EVs, including in adding charging infrastructure.
For car dealerships, these time-of-sale rebates have enabled us to better serve our customers and expand our businesses.
""​​​​​​​ Jobs, Jobs, Jobs The letter doesn't mince words.","You may not be aware of this, but car dealers are a very powerful lobbying group. In fact, many car dealers have been in Congress. So when a group of them, including across Republican-led states such as Utah, Texas, and North Carolina, co-sign a letter to the Senate to back off cuts to EV incentives, you can bet the Senate might just pay a bit of attention. It doesn't hurt that CarMax and Carvana also signed the letter. CarMax runs the nation's largest dealer network, with a vast footprint in almost every state, and casts a bigger shadow across states like Florida and Texas.

In an open letter to Senate leadership, these dealers stressed the following:

Stability and predictability will protect dealerships—axing the EV incentive is a gut punch, and the opposite of predictability.

This is about jobs at dealerships, and buyers struggling to afford used cars.

This is about dealerships investing in their own communities, and yet more jobs.

Here's the down-and-dirty of what they're saying and how EVs and tax credits have become a lifeline for car sales more broadly.

Quickly Cutting EV Incentives Will Hurt Dealers

Part of the tax code you're unlikely to know about benefits dealers for investing in selling EVs, including in adding charging infrastructure. Much as carmakers have been hurt by Trump's sudden tariff imposition, and how hard it is for them to change their business plans in an instant, car dealers have also made long-term strategic decisions based on the existing laws and regulations.

The letter stressed that notion: ""We need a stable and consistent market for our dealerships to plan, invest, and grow. Recent attempts to abruptly roll back key EV-related Inflation Reduction Act tax credits pose a serious threat to our business continuity and the industry’s long-term investments.... Collectively, changes on such a rapid timeline would introduce significant uncertainty and deter investment.""

Used EVs Are Crucial — And Congress Is Wrong To Ignore These Customers

It's often lost in the sauce that there's a $4,000 incentive on used EVs that sell for less than $25,000. But dealers are well aware of it, because it's a boon to moving used EVs to customers who can't afford to buy new.

The letter noted that ""A sudden elimination [of the credit] will disrupt the used car market, a backbone of the American economy."" They went on to skewer the idea that only wealthy people are buying EVs: ""Used EV rebates in particular have provided a valuable bridge for working- and middle-class Americans. For car dealerships, these time-of-sale rebates have enabled us to better serve our customers and expand our businesses. For many of our working-class customers, the used EV rebate becomes the down payment that enables a vehicle purchase at all.""​​​​​​​

Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

The letter doesn't mince words. While carmaker pushback has seemed subtle, not wanting to risk the ire of the President, this letter directly targets Congress members for potentially harming the livelihoods of ""...many independent and family-owned dealerships."" The letter cites a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation suggesting that killing the tax incentives would harm 130,000 auto sector jobs, and another 310,000 jobs affiliated with the auto sector would be lost by 2030.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-volkswagen-id-4-profile.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 12:12:38.860698

Key cuts include: - Immediate repeal of solar/wind tax credits, forcing projects to be completed by late 2027 to qualify for reduced support.
- Termination of EV tax credits by September 2025, eliminating a key incentive for Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM).
These changes threaten over $500 billion in renewable energy investments, according to Rhodium Group analysis.
If the bill fails or is watered down: - Tesla could rally 15–20%, as tax credits remain intact.","The Senate's proposed Trump Megabill, a sweeping tax and energy policy package, has thrown the renewable sector into turmoil. Central to the debate is Elon Musk's vocal opposition, which has framed the bill as a “death sentence” for clean energy. For investors, the legislation—set for a critical Senate vote this month—represents both a risk and an opportunity. Here's how to navigate the shifting landscape.

The Megabill's Threat to Renewables

The bill's core provisions target tax incentives that have fueled the U.S. renewable energy boom since the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Key cuts include:

- Immediate repeal of solar/wind tax credits, forcing projects to be completed by late 2027 to qualify for reduced support.

- New excise taxes on solar and wind facilities using foreign-made components (e.g., Chinese steel or polysilicon).

- Termination of EV tax credits by September 2025, eliminating a key incentive for Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM).

These changes threaten over $500 billion in renewable energy investments, according to Rhodium Group analysis. For Tesla, the blow is twofold: its energy division (solar panels and Powerwall batteries) relies on tax credits to compete with fossil fuels, while its automotive business faces a sudden loss of consumer subsidies.

Musk's Influence on Market Sentiment

Musk's criticism has amplified investor anxiety. His recent “insane” characterization of the bill—paired with warnings about job losses and Chinese competitors—has already roiled markets. Tesla's stock, which often reacts to Musk's tweets, dropped 5% the day the bill's details leaked.

Investment Play: Shorting Coal, Betting on Diversified Renewables

The Megabill's coal-friendly provisions—such as expanded carbon capture credits and supply chain protections for metallurgical coal—create short opportunities in fossil fuel stocks.

Short Candidates:

- Peabody Energy (BTU): A coal producer benefiting from the bill's North American supply mandates.

- Nucor (NUE): A steelmaker that could gain from relaxed emissions rules.

Meanwhile, long positions should target renewable firms with global supply chains or diversified revenue streams.

Long Candidates:

- Vestas Wind Systems (VWS.CO): A Danish turbine maker with a strong EU market presence, insulated from U.S. policy shifts.

- NextEra Energy (NEE): The U.S. leader in wind and solar generation, which can leverage existing projects before tax credit deadlines.

- Invesco Solar ETF (TAN): Tracks an index of global solar companies, though investors should monitor China's dominance in supply chains.

Timing the Vote and Musk's Next Move

The Senate's vote, expected by early July, is a pivotal catalyst. If the bill passes:

- Short coal/steel stocks until August, capitalizing on post-vote euphoria.

- Buy dips in Tesla and U.S. renewables post-credit expiration (September 2025).

If the bill fails or is watered down:

- Tesla could rally 15–20%, as tax credits remain intact.

- Renewables ETFs (e.g., TAN) may rebound, though China's supply chain dominance remains a long-term risk.

The Bottom Line

The Megabill's passage would mark a seismic shift toward fossil fuels and away from Musk's vision of a sustainable energy future. For investors, the strategy is clear: short coal, hedge with global renewables, and time trades around Musk's rhetoric and the Senate's vote. The window to position is narrow—but the rewards for outmaneuvering policy uncertainty could be vast.",,N,,2025-06-29 16:03:45.674693

Education: Gone from the new bill language are provisions to expand Pell Grants to short-term workforce training programs outside of the accreditation system.","Here’s a roundup of some of what’s new:

Rural hospitals: Senate Republicans are planning to provide a $25 billion stabilization fund for rural hospitals over five years. That’s a significant increase from the $15 billion offer Senate GOP leadership had made to a group of Medicaid moderates earlier. The new package also delays cuts to provider taxes that fund state obligations to Medicaid, with the drawdown beginning in 2028.

Orphan drugs: Senate Republicans are aiming to expand a Medicare drug price negotiation exemption for orphan drugs to include medicines that treat multiple rare diseases. The provision was in the House-passed megabill, but was left out of the Senate Finance Committee’s earlier text. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the policy in the House bill would cost nearly $5 billion over 10 years.

Physician fees: An effort to ban Medicaid spread pricing and a requirement that retail pharmacies complete a survey to help HHS understand national drug acquisition costs was knocked out of the bill. But lawmakers added in a temporary one-year, 2.5 percent bump to the Medicaid physician fee schedule for 2026 “to account for exceptional circumstances.”

SALT: The new Senate text keeps House Republicans’ plan to increase the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000. But it would snap back to current levels after 2029. The change is expected to shave at least $100 billion from the approximately $350 billion price tag of the House plan.

SNAP: Alaska and Hawaii could be temporarily exempted from the requirement for cost-sharing for the nation’s largest anti-hunger program under the new language. The bill grants the Agriculture secretary authority to waive the two states’ cost-share requirement for up to two years if they are “actively implementing” a plan to lower their payment error rates for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Both states would also be eligible for waivers to bypass the new SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, if the Agriculture secretary deems they are making a “good faith effort” to comply with the requirements.

Alaskan whaling: Whaling boat captains in Alaska will be able to deduct more for whale-hunting-related expenses, up to $50,000 from the current $10,000. In order to claim the benefit, they have to be recognized as a whaling captain by the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission and must be engaged in the sanctioned, subsistence hunting of bowhead whales.

Energy: The new text would require solar and wind generation projects seeking to qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean electricity production and investment tax credits to be placed in service — or plugged into the grid — by the end of 2027. That’s much more restrictive than an earlier version that tied eligibility to when a project begins construction. It would also deny wind and solar leasing arrangements to residential customers from accessing the climate law’s clean electricity investment and production tax credits.

The bill has more energy changes, including:

Moving up the termination date for electric vehicle tax credits to Sept. 30, compared to six months after enactment in the earlier Finance text.

A bonus incentive for advanced nuclear facilities built in communities with high levels of employment in the nuclear industry.

Expand to $1 billion a new energy dominance loan program.

Mandate oil and gas lease sales onshore and offshore, including in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with the state reaping an increased proportion of revenues from development there.

Land sales: The bill would order the sale of up to 0.5 percent of Bureau of Land Management land across 11 states. Eligible lands would have to fall within five miles of a population center, and protected lands excluded. The new text would set aside money from each sale for hunting, fishing and recreational amenities. The parliamentarian has yet to rule on the new framework, after flagging a previous version.

Federal pensions: The new text eliminates a proposal to hike federal employees’ required retirement contributions and charge unions for time spent engaging in organizing activities, after the parliamentarian ruled that several of the GOP’s civil service provisions violated the chamber’s reconciliation rules.

Education: Gone from the new bill language are provisions to expand Pell Grants to short-term workforce training programs outside of the accreditation system. The change came after the Senate parliamentarian warned that it ran afoul of the chamber’s reconciliation rules.

Also stripped out was language that blocked doctors and dentists from having their student loan payments during residency count toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The new language would delay — rather than repeal — Biden era regulations that made it easier for student borrowers to have federal loans forgiven if schools either defrauded them or closed for 10 years.

Judiciary: At the recommendation of the parliamentarian, the latest version of the bill does not include language that would have limited the ability of federal courts to issue preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders against the U.S. if a bond had not been posted.

Shrinking remittances: A proposed tax on remittances would shrink to 1 percentunder the latest draft, down from the 3.5 percent previously considered, and well off the 5 percent charge House Republicans approved last month.",https://static.politico.com/4c/21/603e17bb455eace56d2aec9b9c4f/senate-parliamentarians-office-02413.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 13:10:47.424619

Separate from EPCA, the Energy Star labeling program was established by the EPA in 1992 as a public-private partnership.
Last month, in response to plans to shutter Energy Star, the organization issued a statement urging the EPA to preserve the program.
AHAM favors revising EPCA standards, she said, based on technological advances rather than the every-six-year requirement.
For instance, the libertarian Cato Institute has called Energy Star ""a very coarse piece of energy information that may crowd out efforts"" to develop more accurate ways to measure energy-operating costs.","Donald Trump, as both a citizen and president, has railed against modern dishwashers, washing machines, light bulbs, showerheads and toilets, claiming that onerous government regulations render them less effective and more expensive.

Since returning to the White House in January, he's turned his ire into an edict.

On April 9, Trump issued an executive order directing certain federal agencies ""to incorporate a sunset provision"" into a laundry list of energy production regulations, including those covering appliances. A month later, he issued a memorandum, entitled ""Rescission of Useless Water Pressure Standards.""

Following that, on May 12, the Department of Energy announced that it was preparing to eliminate or modify 47 federal regulations ""that are driving up costs and lowering quality of life for the American people.""

Many of the rules are covered in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), a decades-old law that mandates energy-efficiency and water-conservation standards for home appliances and plumbing fixtures.

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency said it is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, a popular voluntary initiative that manufacturers employ to rank their appliances based on energy conservation and cost savings, displayed on familiar blue labeling at retail as comparison-shopping guides.

Trump's actions have been met with a mix of resistance from consumer protection groups and appliance manufacturers, as well as support from deregulation hawks and decriers of the nanny state. And while the administration continues to review the current standards and solicit comments before considering any official changes, legal challenges to the efforts are being weighed.

A new era of 'buyer beware' in electric bills

Originally passed in 1975, EPCA ensures that the entire array of products covered by the law all meet a basic level of energy- and water-efficiency performance, reflected in different price points. A prime example are the ubiquitous yellow Energy Guide stickers affixed to appliances that indicate their annual energy usage and cost.

""Consumers who are shopping primarily, if not exclusively, on price also get reasonable efficiency performance [information],"" said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a coalition of environmental and consumer groups, utilities and state governments, based at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization.

Without that level of regulated consumer protection, deLaski said, ""It's buyer beware.""

Consumers would face the risk of less-efficient appliances entering an unregulated marketplace, he said, ""and you're not going to know it until you get the [higher] electric bill.""

Separate from EPCA, the Energy Star labeling program was established by the EPA in 1992 as a public-private partnership. Managed and jointly funded by the DOE, it sets energy-efficiency standards that manufacturers can choose to display on appliances, building products, electronics, lighting fixtures, HVAC equipment and other products as a way for consumers and businesses to make informed purchase decisions.

The EPA estimates that 90% of households recognize the Energy Star label and that over its 33 years, the program has saved five trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions by four billion metric tons and saved $500 billion in utility costs. The program's 2024 operating budget was $35.7 million. To date, every dollar spent has resulted in nearly $350 in energy cost savings.

Americans support energy-efficient appliance efforts

Consumer Reports conducted a national survey in March which found that 87% of respondents support energy-efficient home appliance standards. Nearly a third said that saving money on energy bills would motivate them to buy a more efficient large home appliance.

Last month, in response to plans to shutter Energy Star, the organization issued a statement urging the EPA to preserve the program. ""The loss would hit especially hard at a time when people are dealing with unpredictable energy bills and trying to cut expenses,"" said Shanika Whitehurst, associate director for Consumer Reports' product sustainability, research and testing team.

The nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy, a bipartisan coalition of consumer, environment, business and government groups, suggests that EPCA and Energy Star actually promote the White House's goals of lowering families' energy bills and making the nation energy dominant. ""If you start to dismantle the energy-efficiency programs, American households are going to pay for that,"" said Jason Reott, ASE's senior manager of policy. ""Energy dominance begins at home, by eliminating energy waste.""

The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which represents more than 150 manufacturers, has historically supported efficiency regulations, but pushed back against the Biden administration's updates of EPCA standards for gas stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers and other appliances. The law requires the DOE to review standards at least once every six years, a process that has often led to rule changes.

""We have always been able to produce products at higher efficiency levels,"" said Jill Notini, vice president of communications and marketing for AHAM, ""but there's a tipping point where you have to stop and say, you have to have the technology that allows those standard levels.""

""We very much appreciate the intent behind [President Trump's] goals of deregulatory actions,"" Notini said. ""Our industry needs it after looking at our products and how far they have come in terms of energy efficiency and water use,"" alluding to the eight rounds of EPCA reviews, updates and revisions over the years.

Already at or near peak efficiency, industry says

Today's appliances are at or near their peak efficiency, a result of federal standards and manufacturers' investment in technology and innovation, Notini said. ""So there needs to be a recognition that we can't stay on this path and continue to ratchet up standards and expect high-performing products,"" she added.

AHAM favors revising EPCA standards, she said, based on technological advances rather than the every-six-year requirement. What the association does not endorse, however, is Trump's request for the DOE to waive federal preemption of states' regulations regarding the water efficiency of showerheads, faucets and toilets.

""It's concerning to us that we may not have federal preemption, which creates that certainty that the industry is looking for,"" Notini said, noting that several states have established their own efficiency standards on some EPCA-covered products. Federal preemption ""truly is what has made energy efficiency such a success.""

AHAM member LG Electronics USA has mixed views on efforts to roll back EPCA, according to senior vice president John I. Taylor. ""Generally, deregulation is good for business, but there are some specific things in EPCA that are beneficial to American consumers and the American economy,"" he said. ""Our company has been a leader in driving energy efficiency, so regardless of how the regulations end up, we'll continue to keep our foot on that accelerator.""

In March, nearly three dozen industry groups and appliance companies, including the Chamber of Commerce, Bosch, Carrier and the Air-Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute (AHRI) sent a letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, urging him not to end Energy Star. In April, the U.S. Green Building Council, along with more than 1,000 signatories — among them LG, Miele and Samsung Electronics America — wrote to Zeldin to express concerns about proposed cuts at the EPA, including Energy Star.

Energy Star very popular with consumers, according to retail sector

While major appliance retailers, such as Lowe's , Home Depot and Best Buy , have not publicly commented on any of these pending regulatory changes, the National Retail Federation, one of several consumer products, manufacturing, real estate and retail organizations that sent a letter on June 6 to a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders, asking them to ""strongly support continuation of the non-regulatory and non-partisan Energy Star program within the federal government.""

""Consumers have said overwhelmingly that they support voluntary environmental standard-setting programs like Energy Star,"" said Scot Case, vice president of corporate social responsibility and sustainability and executive director for the NRF's Center for Retail Sustainability. And that's why retailers the trade group represents ""want to make sure they're able to share the benefits of those programs with the consumer,"" he said.

Trump's tribulations with energy-efficiency and water-conservation standards echo those of libertarians and free-marketers who maintain that regulations often represent government overreach and restrict personal choice. For instance, the libertarian Cato Institute has called Energy Star ""a very coarse piece of energy information that may crowd out efforts"" to develop more accurate ways to measure energy-operating costs.

""I'm a big proponent of energy efficiency, but I don't think we need the federal government overriding the choices and preferences that consumers may have when purchasing an appliance,"" said Nick Loris, vice president of public policy for C3 Solutions, a conservative energy think tank. He said rolling back EPCA standards is ""a step forward in reducing government intervention into decisions that should be best left for producers and consumers.""

Where legal challenges are headed

As with a mounting number of actions taken by the Trump administration this year — from tariffs to immigration — tinkering with EPCA is expected to be challenged in federal courts. The law includes a so-called anti-backsliding provision, which prevents rolling back standards that have already been finalized. A 2004 case deLaski referred to, NRDC v. Abraham, upheld the provision. ""Once a DOE standard has been updated and published in the Federal Register, you can't go backward,"" he said of the precedent.

The administration may seek legal authority to enact these deregulation orders by citing the ""good cause"" exception in the Administrative Procedures Act as a way to avoid the APA's public notice-and-comment processes. Yet legal experts, environmental groups and state attorneys general have warned that skipping APA procedures — especially for weakening energy- and water-use standards covered by EPCA — would likely be deemed ""arbitrary and capricious"" and illegal.

Ultimately, considering the success and popularity of EPCA and Energy Star — with consumers, manufacturers and retailers — as well as the legal underpinnings, it's entirely possible that both will remain intact, if perhaps with a few tweaks. ""In one form or another,"" Taylor said, ""we expect both will.""

""We know consumers want the information, and the interesting thing about consumers is, they are also voters,"" Case said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108142527-1746651137420-gettyimages-2213954863-l1053438_tgobbubr.jpeg?v=1746651179&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-29 12:13:24.812757

−Bart Jansen What does Trump say about the Senate version of the bill?","WASHINGTON – The Senate voted to begin a marathon debate about President Donald Trump's package of legislative priorities − stuffed with tax cuts, Medicaid reforms and border security funding – despite lingering Republican concerns about the legislation.

Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, has said he is uncertain whether enough Republicans will support their version to send it back to the House.

""We'll find out,"" Thune said.

But the 51-49 vote to proceed signals that there is enough GOP support to at least begin the hours-long debate and expected voting on dozens of amendments.

GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina each voted against debating the bill as written.

The vote that began at 7:30 p.m. EDT was held open for more than three hours as Thune scrambled to find a majority of votes to kickstart the debate.

If the Senate is ultimately successful, the House would have to vote on the upper chamber's changes in order to reach Trump's desk by his self-imposed deadline of July 4. The Senate has trimmed the House version from about 1,100 pages to 940 − and still faces votes on what are expected to be dozens of amendments.

The success of Trump's domestic agenda for tax cuts and border security hangs in the balance. Republican approval of the spending blueprint would allow a majority of the 100-member Senate to approve all of Trump's priorities included in it through legislation later in the year, rather than needing 60 votes to overcome a filibuster for each measure.

Here's what we know about the legislative package:

Senate voting on whether to debate Trump’s bill

A long wait, then a vote to begin debate

With little fanfare, the Senate began voting at about 7:30 p.m. EDT on whether to begin the debate on Trump’s legislative package.

Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, simply asked the Senate to vote on a motion to begin debating the bill.

The move came after hours of inaction – interrupted by the occasional speech – since the Senate gaveled into action at 2 p.m.

Nevada senator votes despite COVID-19

The vote was close enough and important enough that a Nevada senator voted despite testing positive for COVID-19.

“After experiencing mild symptoms, I have tested positive for COVID,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, said in a social media post. “I’ll continue to follow my doctor’s guidelines and wear a mask while voting this weekend.”- Bart Jansen

Lee drops provision for public land sales from bill

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, agreed to drop a contentious provision for public land sales from the legislative package.

Environmental groups had criticized the provision for opening lands to logging and oil, gas and coal production. A fellow Republican, Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana, threatened to vote against the bill unless the provision was removed, which could have scuttled the entire bill.

Lee announced on social media that he wasn’t able to secure safeguards that the land must be sold to Americans rather than the Chinese or investors.

“I continue to believe the federal government owns far too much land – land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation,” Lee said.

Trump blasts Tillis over opposition to legislation

Trump criticized Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, one of three Republicans to vote against debating the legislation, as “making a BIG MISTAKE.”

Tillis had voiced concern about steeper Medicaid cuts in the Senate version of the bill than in the House version, and said he would have to oppose it.

But Trump noted he won the state in three presidential elections in the Tarheel State, where Tillis faces reelection next year. Trump highlighted provisions in the legislation to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security. He argued taxes will rise if 2017 tax cuts aren’t extended, and that the country needs to increase the limit on borrowing.

“Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!” Trump said in a post June 28 on social media.

In another post, Trump said he would be meeting with “numerous people” who have asked to run in the GOP primary against Tillis. Trump said he is “looking for someone who will properly represent the Great people of North Carolina.”

Democrats force Senate to read entire Trump bill

Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, forced Senate clerks to read the entire bill out loud, further delaying the start of debate on the bill.

While typically a formality, Schumer objected to waiving the reading of the bill. His objection forced clerks to read the 940-page document.

Then senators will begin hours of debate followed by hours of voting. A vote on final passage could come June 30.

'No cause for alarm' on vote delay: Sen. Mike Rounds

South Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds told CNN that he thinks Republicans will ultimately have the votes to begin the floor debate but were working on ensuring commitments for concerned GOP lawmakers that they'll get the chance to offer amendments to address their issues.

""No cause for alarm,"" Rounds said, adding that the lengthy delay from the plan to have a 4 p.m. EDT opening procedural vote stemmed from the wait for the Congressional Budget Office to analyze late changes to the Senate bill. Looking ahead, Rounds outlined a floor plan that would start with Democrats forcing a full reading of the 990-page bill, something the Republican said he hoped they would not do so that congressional staff can go home for the night and get rest before resuming debate on June 29.

Once the floor debate begins, Rounds said Democrats and Republicans would get 20 hours equally divided - with the GOP likely surrendering a considerable amount of that time. Only then would the Senate begin to hold what's known as a ""vote-a-rama"" where they consider scores of amendments.""We've got a long couple of days ahead of us yet,"" Rounds said. - Darren Samuelsohn

Business Roundtable endorses Trump bill

Business groups endorsed Trump’s legislative package for its anticipated economic benefits as the Senate prepared to debate it.

“This critical legislation would protect and enhance the transformative economic benefits that President Trump’s historic 2017 tax reform delivered for American businesses, workers and families,” Business Roundtable President Kristen Silverberg said. “We urge the Senate to swiftly pass this measure.” - Bart Jansen

Democrats to force reading aloud of the entire Senate bill

Senate Democrats unified in opposition to the legislation plan to force the chamber's clerk to read the entire 990-page GOP tax, policy and spending bill aloud if Republicans vote to open the floor debate.

""Future generations will be saddled with trillions in debt,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York. ""Under this draft Republicans will take food away from hungry kids to pay for tax breaks to the rich.""

Schumer's plans mean that the Senate is sure to be in session late into the night, if not past dawn - presuming Republicans vote to begin the debate. - Darren Samuelsohn, Reuters

Elon Musk opens fire, calls Trump bill ‘utterly insane and destructive’

Billionaire Elon Musk, Trump’s former adviser on cutting government spending, fired off another set of attacks against the president’s legislative package for potentially killing millions of jobs.

Musk had quieted his harsh criticism of Trump and the legislation the week after his departure from government May 30. But he blasted the bill again as the Senate prepared to debate it.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk said June 28 on social media. “Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

As the Senate vote remained in limbo, Musk added another post warning the GOP of the electoral risks if they vote for the Trump-backed legislation that is not polling well with Republicans.

Paging Vice President JD Vance: The Senate might need a tie-breaker

Coming out of a GOP lunch June 28, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, said he’s “under the impression” Senate leadership has the buy-in to advance Trump’s bill. But, “I’m thinking we need the VP,” he said.

Republicans need a simple 51-vote majority to pass the bill. But with a tight 53-member majority and ongoing disputes, every swing vote counts. If they hit 50, Vice President JD Vance, in his capacity as Senate president, can break the tie in Trump’s favor. -Savannah Kuchar

Environmental groups criticize bill’s support for fossil fuels

Environmental advocates criticized the Senate version of Trump’s legislative priorities for not just ending incentives for renewable energy but setting taxes on wind and solar power generation.

The advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council estimated taxes on some projects could grow 50%. The bill could also trigger the largest sale of public lands in history for logging and oil, gas and coal production, according to the group.

Trump campaigned on boosting domestic energy production with the phrase “drill, baby, drill.”

""The new budget reconciliation bill text is a shocking fossil fuels industry fever dream come to life,” said Christy Goldfuss, the council’s executive director. “The bill has gone from fossil fuels boosterism to an active effort from Congress to kill wind and solar energy in the United States.” - Bart Jansen

GOP senators join Trump for golf

President Donald Trump had no public events on his calendar, but he had a couple of key allies join him for golf at his Northern Virginia course: CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Republican Sens. Eric Schmitt of Missouri, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

After posting a picture with Trump on the golf course, Graham added that he partnered with Trump and Paul to beat Schmitt and Ratcliffe.

""Proud to announce no casualties,"" Graham wrote. ""A lot of fun! Big Beautiful Bill on the way."". - Bart Jansen

Saying ‘no’ and voting ‘no’ two different things: Sen. Markwayne Mullin

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma, a supporter of Trump’s legislative package, told reporters at the Capitol that lawmakers warning about voting against it and actually voting “no” are two different things.

Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin; Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina; and Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, have each said they were opposed to the bill that is still changing. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have voiced concerns about it.

“Everybody’s got concerns, but saying you’re voting 'no' and when you get to the floor and voting 'no' is two totally different things,” Mullin said. “I don’t believe in losing and we’re going to get the votes.” - Bart Jansen

Budget blueprint debate could be 30 hours of ‘nonsense’: Sen. Brian Moreno

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, a supporter of Trump’s legislative package, said a final vote would likely come after 30 hours of “nonsense” from Democrats voting on proposals to change the contentious bill.

“It’s an absolutely historic and transformative piece of legislation that reverses four years of an assault on American workers,” Moreno said. “I want everybody watching this to remember this as you listen to probably what’s going to be 30-plus hours of complete nonsense from the other side.” - Bart Jansen

Senate meets before debating Trump legislative package

The Senate gaveled in at 2 p.m., in anticipation of beginning debate on President Trump’s legislative priorities, but lawmakers haven’t yet voted to begin talking about the measure.

A majority of senators must agree to begin debate, which can sometimes kill legislation before it begins. With 53 Republicans and 47 Democratic caucus members, just a few GOP lawmakers could prevent a debate.

But the hurdle appears a mere technicality because wavering GOP members such as Sen. Susan Collins of Maine have said she would support the debate even if not necessarily the final bill. -Bart Jansen

Sen. Josh Hawley says Republicans have “soul searching” to do

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, had been one of the leading voices among Senate Republicans raising concerns about proposed cuts to Medicaid and how that would impact his largely rural state.

But after studying the latest, finalized bill text — which delays pushing costs onto states and establishes a $25 billion rural hospital fund — Hawley said he’s a yes on passing the bill.

Beyond this weekend’s vote, though, Hawley said he intends to keep pushing back in effort to prevent the delayed federal spending cuts from ever going into effect.

“This has been an unhappy episode, here in Congress, this effort to cut to Medicaid,” he said. “And I think, frankly, my party needs to do some soul searching.” — Savannah Kuchar

Sen. Susan Collins remains a wildcard

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’ll support Senate leadership bringing the mega bill to the floor and kicking off presumably hours of debate. But she cautioned reporters that she remains uncertain how she'll side when a final vote gets called.

“That does not, in any way, predict how I'm going to vote on the final passage,” Collins told reporters while walking into the Capitol for the start of the day’s events.

Collins said her final vote ultimately will depend on what the bill looks like after lawmakers — including herself — introduce and potentially tack on further amendments.

“There's some very good changes that have been made in the latest version, but I want to see further changes,” Collins said. - Savannah Kuchar

What is in the Senate bill?

The largest provisions in the legislation would extend expiring tax cuts and create a few new ones, and a dramatic increasing in spending on border security.

The heart of the legislation would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts which are set to expire at end of the year. Republicans have said defeat of the measure would lead to a $4 trillion tax hike over the next decade.

New tax deductions Trump campaigned on would apply to tips for employees such as waiters through 2028 and for overtime pay. The Senate capped the deduction at $25,000 and weakened the break for individuals with income above $150,000.

For border security, the bill would increase funding about $150 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. The bill authorizes $45 billion for new detention centers as Trump ramps up arrests and $27 billion for a mass deportation campaign.

A crucial provision would increase the amount the country can borrow by $5 trillion. The country's debt is already approaching $37 trillion and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned the current limit on borrowing will be reached in August.

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican holdout on the bill, said he wouldn't vote for the bill unless the debt limit gets a separate vote. But Republican leaders want to keep the unpopular vote within the overall package. −Bart Jansen

What's not in the Senate version of the bill?

Republican support in the Senate waned after Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled several significant provisions would have to be removed to avoid a filibuster.

Republicans removed provisions to curb environmental regulations; restrict federal judges' powers; bulk up immigration enforcement; and cut funding from a consumer protection agency.

MacDonough also ruled against provisions that aimed to reduce Medicaid spending on health care programs for undocumented immigrants. −Bart Jansen

What does Trump say about the Senate version of the bill?

The Trump administration “strongly supports” the Senate version of the bill, in a White House Office of Management and Budget statement June 28.

The statement isn’t intended to favor the Senate version over the House version on any particular provision, but to signal Trump would sign it if approved by Congress. The two-page statement highlighted provisions for tax cuts, border security, energy and defense.

“President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal,"" the statement said. −Bart Jansen

Is there really a July 4 deadline?

Trump has told congressional Republicans he's want this thing wrapped up by Independence Day.

But the due date is less procedural than it is political. The sooner the president can tout legislation that makes good on several of his 2024 campaign promises, including a tax limit on tips and overtime wages, plus extends his 2017 tax cuts for high-income earners, the better.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/27/USAT/84392605007-2222327981.jpg?crop=6238,3509,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-29 12:14:18.148644

- Solar Incentives: The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar, currently at 30%, phases out entirely by year-end, deterring home installations.
- Manufacturing Credits: The 45X tax credit for battery and wind turbine production, which underpinned Tesla's Gigafactories and partnerships, faces accelerated phaseout.
The Megabill's provisions could: - Crater Demand: Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate Tesla's U.S. sales could drop 20-30% post-2025 without tax credits, squeezing margins.
- Undermine Global Competitiveness: With China maintaining subsidies for EVs and renewables, U.S. firms risk losing market share to Asian rivals.","The Tesla CEO's sharp criticism of the Trump administration's 2025 Megabill underscores a pivotal moment for renewable energy investors. While the legislation's proponents frame it as a “pro-growth” tax cut, Musk's warning that it amounts to a “death sentence” for green tech reveals stark risks—and opportunities—for sectors tied to climate innovation.

The Megabill's Assault on Renewables

At its core, the Megabill accelerates the expiration of federal tax credits critical to Tesla's core business and the broader clean energy ecosystem. By eliminating credits for electric vehicles (EVs), rooftop solar installations, and wind/solar manufacturing by late 2025, the bill threatens to unravel momentum built over the past decade. For instance:

- EV Tax Credits: The $7,500 federal incentive for new EVs and $4,000 for used models expires by September 2025, risking a collapse in affordability for Tesla buyers.

- Solar Incentives: The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar, currently at 30%, phases out entirely by year-end, deterring home installations.

- Manufacturing Credits: The 45X tax credit for battery and wind turbine production, which underpinned Tesla's Gigafactories and partnerships, faces accelerated phaseout.

The bill also imposes a 30-50% excise tax on solar and wind projects using materials from “foreign entities of concern” (e.g., China), further complicating supply chains for U.S. manufacturers.

Why Musk's Opposition Matters

Musk's stance is not merely ideological—it's existential. Tesla's valuation hinges on its role as a leader in EVs and energy storage, both of which rely on federal incentives to offset costs. The Megabill's provisions could:

- Crater Demand: Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate Tesla's U.S. sales could drop 20-30% post-2025 without tax credits, squeezing margins.

- Undermine Global Competitiveness: With China maintaining subsidies for EVs and renewables, U.S. firms risk losing market share to Asian rivals.

Sector-Specific Risks and Opportunities

Risks:

1. Job Losses and Supply Chain Strains: The Rhodium Group projects 800,000 U.S. clean energy jobs at risk by 2040, with companies like Qcells (solar panels) and Talon PV (batteries) already scaling back investments.

2. Higher Energy Costs: Households could face a 10% rise in energy bills by 2040 as grid investments stall, hurting demand for Tesla's Powerwall home batteries.

Opportunities:

1. Short-Term Volatility, Long-Term Resilience: Companies with diversified revenue streams (e.g., Enphase Energy in solar inverters or NextEra Energy in utility-scale renewables) may outperform peers reliant on U.S. subsidies.

2. Global Markets: Firms with strong overseas operations, such as BYD (China's EV giant) or Vestas Wind Systems (Denmark), could gain share as U.S. competitors falter.

Investment Strategy: Short the Fossil Fuel Winners, Buy the Future-Proof

While the Megabill's passage remains uncertain—Senate Democrats are delaying it with procedural tactics—the legislative gridlock creates openings for savvy investors:

Short Positions:

- Coal and Oil Firms: While the bill lacks direct coal subsidies, its focus on dismantling renewables indirectly supports fossil fuels. Shorting coal miners like Peabody Energy or oil giants like Chevron could profit if clean energy's decline boosts demand for traditional energy.

Long Positions:

- Renewable Innovators with Diversified Revenue:

- Enphase Energy (ENPH): Leader in solar inverters with strong global growth.

- First Solar (FSLR): High-efficiency solar panels with a foothold in emerging markets.

- Plug Power (PLUG): Hydrogen fuel cell solutions, less dependent on U.S. subsidies.

- AI-Driven Energy Efficiency: Firms like Aclima (air quality sensors for grid optimization) or Gridscape (AI for solar deployment) could thrive as utilities prioritize efficiency amid rising costs.

The Political Wild Card

The Megabill's fate hinges on Senate Republicans' willingness to compromise. A last-minute tweak to extend EV credits or soften supply chain rules could ease pressure on Tesla. Investors should monitor:

- Medicaid Cuts: Senate GOP divisions over Medicaid work requirements (a key part of the bill) could force amendments delaying its passage.

- Debt Ceiling Tensions: A government shutdown by September 2025 could sideline the bill entirely.

Conclusion

Musk's critique crystallizes the Megabill's threat to U.S. clean energy leadership. While short-term volatility looms, investors should position for a post-subsidy era by backing firms with global scale and technology that transcends policy cycles. For now, the script favors those betting on resilience—and shorting the industries of the past.",,N,,2025-06-29 14:09:29.115697

Floating by are tangled roots and water lilies. Undulating floodwaters reflect the sky. Treetops drop giant peapods into the water. A few thatched huts, without walls and on stilts, are set just above the muddy water’s edge. It is a day trip for twenty Indigenous people in a traditional river canoe, but there’s one adaptation. The travel on the Kapawari River in the Ecuadorean Amazon is in a solar-powered boat. A source of much local pride, it is one of many solar projects around the world that are harvesting the sun for clean power.

Solar Projects in the Ecuadorian Amazon

Kara Solar began in 2012 as a dream to build a solar-powered boat. They now support a thriving network of solar projects — transport and energy hubs in Achuar territory in the Ecuadorian Amazon. They’re also beginning to replicate the model with more communities across the Amazon region. The Achuar community now has nine other solar boats operating in Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, and the Solomon Islands. The vessels have ferried children to schools, transported the sick to clinics, and carried mourners to funerals.

The traditional river canoe has the modification of 24 solar panels that harness sunlight to power an engine. And it’s not the only one: the first solar-powered boat was launched in 2017, with a goal of launching 250 more in the next five years.

The Achuar Indigenous group helped develop and expand the network of solar-powered canoes, which open up possibilities for trips that might not otherwise happen for years. Today, such boats play critical roles in this remote corner of the Amazon. Rivers are an essential link between villages, with travel propelled by the rivers’ shifting currents. The Achuar say creating a sustainable transportation network is a way to take control of their own future, blending ancient traditions with modern solutions.

By optimizing designs, providing technical training, building local supply chains, and facilitating financing, Kara Solar enables Indigenous communities to access, implement, and manage solar transportation and energy systems in their own territories, on their own terms.

This remote region of Ecuador has few roads to connect towns and cities — they’re reachable only by boat. The solar boats are essential to maintain the Indigenous lifestyle and connection to nature. “We don’t want roads here,” Nantu Canelos, the president of Kara Solar, told the New York Times. “Highways destroy communities.” Eventually, Kara Solar would like to elevate the Kapawi River, which is one of the Achuar region’s most important transit links, to be fully powered by solar.

And the solar-powered boats are much cheaper and greener than the diesel-powered boats that have typically been the method of transport on these waterways. In fact, the diesel boats are called “peque peque,” eponymous with the sound of the motor. A 2022 study by an Ecuadorean researcher found that diesel fuel spills had depleted fish stocks, making it harder to fish, which is a major source of livelihood for the Achuar.

Florida Solar Projects for Schools

In Palmetto, Florida, the solar projects at the Manatee School for the Arts are anticipated to be one of the largest rooftop solar installations in state history. It is also the most extensive, using Enphase microinverters produced at its US contract manufacturing facilities. The 2 MW system will use 3,200 IQ8P-3P microinverters, which are estimated to produce over 3,800,000 kWh annually and offset much of the school’s electricity needs for more than 25 years.

Manatee School for the Arts expects to decrease current utility costs by 90% annually, and that will result in an estimated $900,000 in annual savings. The installer company, Tampa Bay Solar, has begun construction and commissioning planned for late June 2025.

Estimates for the project claim it will pay for itself within seven years. The savings will go toward school operational expenses, including plans to expand offerings with new art and dance facilities, and a public dance auditorium that can be used for public events.

“Our goal is a 90% reduction in utility costs, freeing up critical operational budget to enhance educational programs and facilities for the community,” Steve Rutherford, president and founder at Tampa Bay Solar, an installer of Enphase products in Florida, told the Bradenton Times. “Thanks to Enphase microinverters made with domestic content at US factories, the school will access critical federal tax incentives while enjoying reliable and safer operations.”

The microinverters used in this project are part of a new generation of solar technology that offers increased efficiency and safety. Key features include:

a 25-year warranty for long-term performance;

a design that eliminates high-voltage DC wiring, enhancing safety;

compatibility with federal tax incentives tied to domestic manufacturing; and,

seamless integration with modern roofing and energy storage systems.

Tampa Bay Solar notes on a blog post that US solar power is experiencing rapid growth. “With the introduction of new federal incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act’s Domestic Content Bonus, projects that utilize equipment manufactured in the United States can now qualify for additional tax credits,” they say. Let’s hope that the federal incentives continue for this and other solar projects.

Indonesia is the world’s largest nickel producer and it is trying to capitalise on its vast reserves, with a 2020 export ban spurring a domestic industrial boom of the key metal used in EV batteries and stainless steel.

The EV battery project will include a $4.7 billion investment on the eastern island of Halmahera and a $1.2 billion investment in West Java, energy minister Bahlil Lahadalia said in a speech alongside President Prabowo Subianto.

“According to my calculation, it won’t take long, in probably between five to six years we will be able to reach energy self-sufficiency,” Prabowo said at a groundbreaking ceremony in Karawang, West Java.

Bahlil said the Halmahera complex will focus on mining, smelting and production of cathodes which are a key component in rechargeable batteries.

The West Java complex will focus on battery cell production, the minister said.

The two politicians did not say when the megaproject was slated to be operational, but Indonesian officials have said a CATL plant in Halmahera would open in March next year.

Alongside CATL, the Halmahera complex is backed by China’s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Indonesia’s state-owned Antam.

Climate Rights International (CRI) and Greenpeace Indonesia this week issued a call for greater assurances from Jakarta that measures were in place to protect the surrounding environment at the bigger complex in eastern Halmahera.

Environmental group Mining Advocacy Network (Jatam) said in a statement Saturday that Jakarta was “chasing vague economic growth while consciously ignoring the people’s scream” to end damage to the environment and residents’ livelihoods.

Halmahera, a once-pristine island in the Maluku archipelago, has seen environmental damage increase as operations have grown at a large industrial park that hosts the world’s largest nickel mine.

A CRI report this month warned the Indonesian government was allowing environmental damage to go unchecked around the Weda Bay mine and the industrial park that hosts it.

An AFP report last month detailed how the home of the nomadic Hongana Manyawa tribe was being eaten away by mining operations there.

Vital Signs is a great source of inspiring stories about the environment, including articles on global warming solutions, news, and actions you can take to help the planet.","Beginning in 2027, new houses built in England will be required to have solar panels — which is a win for the planet and homeowners' wallets.

The U.K. Labour Party is aiming to build 1.5 million homes by the end of the next Parliament, the Environmental Defense Fund shared in its recent Vital Signs newsletter. This goal would be fulfilled by 2029 at the latest, although elections can be called in the U.K. sooner. The solar panels will help the U.K.'s goal of using 95% clean energy by 2030.

The solar panels will add between £3,000 and £4,000 to the cost of construction for each home, according to the Guardian, but the money saved on annual electric bills will make up for the cost in a few short years. The EDF said it could save homeowners the equivalent of $1,300 every year on utilities. The government may also offer loans or grants for existing homes to install solar panels.

""We have always been clear that we want solar panels on as many new homes as possible because they are a vital technology to help cut bills for families, boost our national energy security and help deliver net zero,"" a government spokesperson said, per the Guardian.

Solar panels help reduce our reliance on dirty energy sources while putting money back in our pockets. In the U.S., solar panels can save homeowners around $1,500 annually in utility bills, while tax credits like those in the Inflation Reduction Act also incentivize people to make the switch.

As more people shift toward renewable energy sources like solar, they reduce their amount of carbon output. This helps mitigate the amount of heat-trapping pollution that is put in the atmosphere, which has led to extreme weather events impacting our quality of life.

Senate Republicans narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" after clearing a key procedural hurdle on Saturday. With a 51-49 vote, the GOP took a first step toward passing its 940-page bill, rallying back from earlier roadblocks that prompted Republicans to release a revised version of their legislation just before midnight on Friday.

Senators will have a chance to propose amendments before taking a final vote. After that, the legislation needs to win approval in the House.

This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population,” Tillis wrote.

The new iteration not only strikes tax incentives for solar energy but also adds a new tax on future development.

The Senate draft released on June 16 cuts the 48E Investment Tax Credit for solar and wind energy projects, which covers 30% of installed system costs. The credit was reduced to 60% of its value by the end of 2026, 20% of its value by the end of 2027, and all projects beginning construction by 2028 were ineligible for the credit. The latest version raises the bar by incentivizing only those facilities that begin producing electricity before the end of 2027.

“This reconciliation bill proposal isn’t just misguided — it’s a direct attack on American energy, American workers, and American consumers. It guts the very industries that are lowering electricity bills, revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, and building more new power capacity than every other energy technology combined,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

Elon Musk shared on Linkedin that “This would be incredibly destructive to America,” in response to a post that included Cleanview’s chart (shown above). Michael Thomas, founder and CEO of Cleanview, a clean energy data analysis platform, shared in his post that the United States will need about 450 GW of new electricity by 2030 to meet rising demand. “And the Senate is about to vote on a bill that could wipe out ~500 GW of potential energy generation capacity.”

The bill also heightens uncertainty with a new tax on some wind and solar projects with obscure language (Page 564 at line 8) about facilities built with materials from a foreign entity of concern (FEOC):

APPLICABLE FACILITIES.—The term ‘qualified facility’ shall not include any applicable facility (as defined in subsection (e)(4)(B)) for which construction begins after June 16, 2025, if the construction of such facility includes any material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (as defined in section 7701(a)(52)).’

“These new taxes will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of American Clean Power Association.

The Republicans that voted against moving the bill forward are Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Tillis released a statement saying ““I will always do what is in the best interest of North Carolina, even when that puts me at odds with my own party. When Senate leaders of my party presented this bill, I did what every American should expect from their U.S. Senator: I worked to gather the facts and comprehensively analyze what the impact would be on the people I swore an oath to represent.”

According to analysis by Cleanview, Thomas estimates that the the bill would raise electricity prices in North Carolina by ~20% over the next 5 years.

“Under current law, North Carolina is expected to see 28 GW of new solar and wind capacity by 2035–enough to power more than 8 million homes,” Thomas said. “Under the bill being considered by the Senate this weekend, that number would be slashed in half, to just over 14 GW. That’s because the bill would phase out the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) 7 years early.”

Proponents of the bill are eyeing the President’s request to have the bill on his desk by July 4th; however, opponents believe the draft was moved forward in haste and released after midnight on a Friday night t avoid the watchful eye of the American people.

The bill will cause the loss of 2 million jobs, Schumer said in a press conference, “and maybe more because we hear they might make the clean energy provisions even worse. They want jam it through, they don’t want the American people to know what’s in it.”

As Americans learn more about this bill, the more they are against it, Schumer said. “Republicans are scrambling and rushing, they know their bill is terrible, they don’t want Americans to know what’s in it.” He added, “Republicans should listen to their own words: Show some backbone, ignore fake deadlines, stop the rush job.”

Schumer called for a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page text, which is expected to take approximately 15 hours. After that the Senate is expected to vote, and if approved, must be reconciled with the House version of the bill; which narrowly passed 215 to 214. Due to the narrow win, the language of the bill may continue to change.

“Any Senator who votes for this bill is voting for higher energy prices, a weaker economy, and a less secure America. And they’ll have to answer for it when families open their utility bills, when workers lose their paychecks, and when voters head to the polls,” said Hopper. “We urge lawmakers to think very carefully about the future they’re voting for because this bill doesn’t reform our energy system, it sabotages it.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/1024px-US_Capitol_west_side-600x311-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 11:09:59.342956

Re: UN’s goals outside council’s purview, Letters, June 11.

I do not necessarily agree with all of the activities of the UN but I do support the Sustainable Development Goals.

The goals are aspirational and are intended for all the people of the planet Earth. They include such aspirations as no poverty, no hunger, good health, good education, clean water, affordable and clean energy, good jobs with fair pay, protecting our ecosystems and living in peace.

Such ambitious goals for the people of the planet can only be reached if all communities including Nanaimo embrace the goals and actively work to make them happen. Change needs to start at the community level which will hopefully result in changes being made at all levels of government. Changes of this magnitude can only be achieved if communities lead the way.

If the colour of the last letter ‘O’ were the same colours as those representing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals then this would be just a small but important display that the City of Nanaimo supports those goals. The visible display of such support to all those who see the sign demonstrates that our community wants to make Nanaimo and hopefully the planet a better place.

Let us remember that the primary function of a city council is the welfare of the people in our community through the provision of various services. I hope that city council actively embraces the goals and works with the citizens of our community towards achieving them.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: UN’s goals outside council’s purview

To the editor,

Re: UN’s goals outside council’s purview, Letters, June 11.

The letter writer notes that the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals include good health, zero hunger, and clean water. He calls these goals “laudable,” but then, bizarrely, suggests that in setting these goals, the UN does not have the best interests of Nanaimoites at heart, then questions whether Nanaimo city council should be trying to promote them.

I think most Nanaimo residents support good health, zero hunger and clean water, and realize that it will take effort at all levels – international, national, municipal and individual – to achieve them. Efforts at the municipal and individual level are particularly important when leadership at higher levels goes missing, and we should support Nanaimo council’s efforts to act responsibly.

“The people impacted should be the people making decisions,” said Asenhat Gómez, interim executive director of El Puente.

The long-standing grassroots organization had planned to use the funds to better involve underrepresented residents in local environmental decision-making. The initiative, funded through the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, aimed to create Environmental Advisory Boards that would engage communities typically excluded from policy conversations about climate resilience and land use, the paper said.

The EPA terminated the grant in May, citing a shift in funding priorities under President Donald Trump and newly appointed EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. The agency stated that the project no longer aligned with its core mission, part of a wider rollback of programs tied to environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).

El Puente's funding was one of hundreds of EPA grants recently revoked and effectively ends programs launched under the previous administration’s $3 billion commitment to support disadvantaged communities through climate resilience and public health initiatives.

Locally, the loss means El Puente must pause its efforts to equip residents, particularly those in NYCHA developments and schools with the knowledge and tools to advocate for environmental improvements. The canceled grant would have supported new hires, outreach efforts and training to help residents integrate with Community Boards 1 and 4, which influence local zoning and land-use decisions, the paper reported.

Planning had been underway since January. Staff were interviewed, community events were held and the organization was preparing to launch. But by February, the grant was frozen. Although briefly unfrozen following litigation in April, the uncertainty made it difficult for El Puente to move forward.

With the grant now officially canceled, five job offers have been rescinded and communication from the EPA has ceased. The program officer who worked with El Puente was reportedly dismissed before the funding decision was made.

El Puente has not identified a new source to replace the lost funds. The organization is now appealing to philanthropies and community donors to help bridge the gap, though support remains uncertain amid broader cuts to arts and community programming.

Despite the setback, El Puente says its mission continues. But without restored funding, the vision of a more inclusive environmental future in South Williamsburg remains on hold, the paper said.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/bkreader/images/local-voices/img_3129.JPG;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-06-29 11:09:10.531906

“In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas,” Tesla CEO wrote.
The revised version significantly alters the timing and scope of EV credit termination compared to the previous draft.
In contrast, the updated text sets a firm statutory cutoff date of September 30 for both new and used EV credits, regardless of when the bill is enacted.
At a recent event, Trump said that his plans to cut EV tax credits were “not something new” and that he was surprised that Musk was endorsing him.","U.S. Senate Republicans on Saturday released a revised version of President Donald Trump’s tax cut and spending bill, proposing to eliminate nearly all federal incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy technologies by the end of September.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would terminate the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs on September 30, 2025.

In addition, it would immediately disqualify leased EVs that do not meet final assembly and battery sourcing requirements in North America.

These provisions are detailed in Sections 70501 through 70504 of the bill, which is part of a broader package aimed at reversing policies introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act.

Answering on X to a user who asked, “Who wants this? The country’s automakers don’t want it […]”, Tesla CEO and Trump advisor Elon Musk replied: “Good question. Who?”

“At the same time, this bill raises the debt ceiling by $5 TRILLION, the biggest increase in history, putting America in the fast lane to debt slavery!” he added.

Last November, Musk wrote on X the country should eliminate all government subsidies.

“In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for EVs, oil and gas,” Tesla CEO wrote.

The revised version significantly alters the timing and scope of EV credit termination compared to the previous draft.

The earlier version proposed ending EV tax credits based on a fixed period following the bill’s enactment — with indications of a 180-day phaseout for new vehicles, 90 days for used EVs, and immediate elimination for leases that failed to meet U.S. sourcing rules.

In contrast, the updated text sets a firm statutory cutoff date of September 30 for both new and used EV credits, regardless of when the bill is enacted.

The language also formalises the immediate disqualification of leased vehicles that are not assembled in North America or fail to meet battery component thresholds.

The new bill further expands beyond tax policy.

While the original version of Title VII focused exclusively on personal and business tax code adjustments, the revised act is a wide-ranging omnibus measure that includes entire titles on energy policy, environmental funding, immigration, health care, and military spending.

Specific to EVs and clean transport, the new version adds repeals for related charging infrastructure credits and removes subsidies tied to clean hydrogen, zero-emission power, and low-carbon building materials.

In parallel with repealing green subsidies, the bill introduces provisions to expand oil and gas leasing on federal lands, promote coal development, and boost U.S. fossil fuel production.

A new section on “energy dominance financing” suggests a redirection of federal resources away from climate-oriented spending and toward traditional energy sectors.

The proposal also rescinds dozens of environmental and climate-related grant programmes, including funding for clean school buses, low-emissions electricity, and greenhouse gas reporting.

Although the legislation is unlikely to advance in the Democratic-led Senate, it offers a preview of Republican energy and fiscal priorities heading into the 2026 midterm elections.

At a recent event, Trump said that his plans to cut EV tax credits were “not something new” and that he was surprised that Musk was endorsing him.

The 2026 President’s Budget for EPA proposes a 54 percent decrease from the 2025 EPA budget level.

There is little understanding of the need for strong environmental regulation and enforcement in this budget proposal. Recent agency actions strongly indicate that commitment to environmental protection is negligible.

No one living in the United States will escape the results of EPA’s budget reduction and the poor decisions to waiver enforcement of our nation’s environmental standards.

The EPA is required to deny any proposed permit deemed not in compliance with the Clean Air, Clean Water or Endangered Species Act. EPA has cut its compliance inspections, initiated fewer civil pollution cases and filed fewer criminal complaints.

Suing the EPA to make them do what the law already requires them to do and for which they are already being paid will become the norm.

More time and money will be spent figuring out how to remove companies from regulation than is spent getting companies regulated. Fines that EPA collect are already smaller than the profits polluters earned by breaking the law in the first place; and most importantly: most enforcement cases against influential polluters are started by some combination of environmental organizations, the media and local citizens.

It is irresponsible for our federal agencies to give industries the green light to pollute. Priority should be given to protecting the public’s health and the environment from the toxic effects of air and water pollution.

Please tell EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, Senator Rick Scott and Senator Ashley Moody that you disagree with the current decision to reduce environmental protections.

This undermines claims that climate change is driving more destructive storms and instead points to economic trends that increase the costs of U.S. natural disasters.","As America braces for another storm season, only the media storms are more predictable than upcoming hurricanes and tornadoes. Even before the dust settles after natural disasters, headlines often warn that gusts of wind and funnel clouds are proof the Earth is boiling.

Politicians rush to blame carbon emissions while their supporters flood social media warning of the inevitable doomsday caused by climate change. It all becomes one message: If we do not pass sweeping climate legislation now, more devastation is on the horizon.

But there is one inconvenient truth for these protests: The data do not support the narrative.

As The Heritage Foundation’s chief statistician, Kevin Dayaratna points out in his new book “Cooling the Climate Hysteria” the claim that climate change is causing more and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes in the U.S. “is unsupported by the relevant trend data.”

According to meteorologists Joe D’Aleo and Roy W. Spencer, there is no foundation to the rising rhetoric that climate change is driving an increase in storm frequency and severity. The long-term numbers within their chapters show no significant trend of increasing frequency or violence of U.S. storms over several decades. In fact, both storm types are well within their historical norms. Some have even trended downward since 1970.

Looking at hurricanes, D’Aleo finds that from 1900 to today there is no significant increase in the number of or intensity of hurricanes making landfall in the United States. Data show that some of the deadliest and most powerful hurricanes, such as the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900, or Camille in 1969, happened before the rise of global CO2 emissions.

Tornado data show a similar story. Spencer finds the average number of EF2-EF5 tornadoes, which cause considerable amounts of damage, have trended downward in the past 70 years despite emissions.

There is a rise, however, in the total number of weak (EF0-EF1) tornadoes recorded from 1950 to 1990. This nuance can be explained by the increase in detection technology, such as the Doppler radar.

With this increased ability to detect tornadoes in less populated areas, along with the overall economic growth and the spread of population, it is not that more tornadoes are appearing, but rather the fact that we have detected more of the existing tornadoes compared to previous years. This explains why, since 1990, there has been a relatively flat trend line in the annual weak tornado counts.

So what explains this disconnect between perception and reality?

Headlines often point to mounting disaster damage as proof of worsening storms. This narrative confuses economic effects with meteorological intensity. While the explicit value of damage has increased, this does not consider the amount of economic growth and inflation that has occurred.

Compare an F3 tornado in an open, unoccupied field to an F3 tornado decades later in the same area that has had residences built and infrastructure put in place. Obviously, the latter tornado will cause more mayhem, but that does not change the actual intensity of its wind speed.

Or consider a home on the coast of Florida that cost $25,000 to build in 1960 but $25 million in 2020. The same hurricane would wreak more destruction in 2020 due to higher land values, construction costs, and amenities in the home.

Thus, it’s important to normalize the data for accurate representation when analyzing the costs of natural disasters.

The normalized cost trend line for tornadoes was decreasing, while it remained relatively flat for hurricanes. This undermines claims that climate change is driving more destructive storms and instead points to economic trends that increase the costs of U.S. natural disasters.

Looking at the data, no statistically significant trend displaying an increase in frequency or intensity emerges among tornadoes and hurricanes. Yet, the media still spread this narrative because fear is an effective tool to advance political goals.

With every storm, there is a race to use the disaster as justification to pass radical climate legislation that raises electricity and transportation costs, such as carbon taxes, gas stove bans, and internal combustion engine bans. With every additional demand to shift policy, we stop asking whether those policies are efficient, effective, or necessary.

The true storm in the United States is no longer the weather. It’s political leverage. We need to understand that our climate has always been dynamic—and that now more than ever, it is human resilience, not alarmism, which is our greatest asset.",https://www.dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2215996700.jpgRS_-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 16:03:50.301016

Around the same time as he was federalizing the California National Guard and preparing to deploy hundreds of marines into Los Angeles, at Trump’s behest, Congress was voting to overturn California’s state laws phasing out the sale of new gas-based passenger vehicles by 2035, mandating an increase in the percentage of nonfossil fuel-based trucks sold, and limiting nitrogen oxide emissions for heavy duty and off-road vehicles.

On June 12, Trump signed the resolutions into law, overturning the California mandates. This is despite the fact that the Senate parliamentarian — who is in charge of interpreting Senate rules — and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had concluded that this was an illegitimate use of the Congressional Review Act (CRA) because California’s waiver was an order subject to the Administrative Procedure Act rather than simply an agency rule that the CRA could overturn. It’s technical stuff, but, basically, they were arguing that the CRA can only be applied to a very limited set of rules, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waiver fell outside of. In signing Congress’s resolutions despite the GAO and Senate parliamentarian’s concerns, Trump said he was rescuing the U.S. auto industry from destruction. In reality, by giving his stamp of approval to the political priorities of big oil, Trump was doing yet more damage to the global climate.

Trump, far and away the most anti-environment modern president, has long had California’s state-level environmental standards in his sights. That includes targeting the half-century-old EPA waivers which allow the Golden State to establish pollution and emissions standards for vehicles that go above and beyond the federal minimums. In the last years of the MAGA leader’s first administration, he pushed to roll back the waivers, resulting in a lengthy legal battle that was still unresolved when Joe Biden entered office, and his administration declined to defend the position of its predecessor.

Now, in version 2.0 of Trump’s presidency — with the entire federal government weaponized against climate research, mitigation efforts, and any policies that could move us away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable fuel alternatives — that campaign against California has accelerated. The gutting of the 2035 internal combustion engine phaseout effort is one part of this. The ongoing effort to eliminate the right of the state’s Air Resources Board to set its own tailpipe emissions standards is another. Meanwhile, on the federal level, these efforts include the attacks on universities and on climate science and the gutting of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other federal agencies responsible for generating climate data. And this past week, the Supreme Court also put its thumb on the scales, ruling that a group of fuel producers could sue California over its vehicle emissions standards.

The implications of the move against California are stark: Because about a dozen other Democratic-led states follow California’s lead on emissions standards and electric vehicle (EV) mandates, it has a huge role in shaping U.S. markets. California’s bloc of states represents roughly 40 percent of the U.S. population — and since automakers are reluctant to have to hew to two separate markets within the country, they generally adhere to the highest common denominator when it comes to pollution standards. In other words, if California’s pollution and EV mandates stand, the country’s air gets cleaner and the shift away from fossil fuel reliance picks up steam, regardless of the priorities of the Trump administration. Moreover, this has an international magnifier effect, since many other countries also look to California when working out best practices for the shift away from fossil fuels. California helps make any kind of U.S. de facto adherence to Paris climate accord emissions reduction goals possible, even though Trump has, for the second time, withdrawn the country from the accord and prioritized the acceleration of fossil fuel production.

It’s that realization that is driving Trump’s animus here. He doesn’t just want to end federal climate change efforts; he wants to destroy the ability of states to chart their own course on the issue. After all, this is the man who, during the election campaign, promised to enact Big Oil’s every whim should the industry cough up $1 billion to pad his political war chest. Since that patently corrupt offer of a quid pro quo, he has repeatedly feted oil executives at Mar-a-Lago and in the White House, has ordered shuttered coal-based power plants to reopen, and has dismantled Biden-era tax subsidies for, and investments in, the development of an array of clean energy sources, from wind and solar farms to EV infrastructure.

If California’s EV mandate is shredded, the country will use billions more gallons of gas over the coming years than it would have otherwise. In 2022, the California Air Resources Board estimated that the shift away from oil-based fuels for California’s huge vehicle fleet would, by 2040, reduce CO2 emissions by 395 million tons, would result in 915 million fewer barrels of oil being used, and would result in thousands fewer deaths related to environmental pollution. Now, all that progress is being deliberately rolled back by the federal government, and for no good reason. It will, in consequence, be that much more difficult for the world to avoid passing critical tipping points in global warming. Yet in Trump’s calculus, that calamity is more than outweighed by the short-term financial benefits for the fossil fuel industry that will accrue as the pump is primed to increase demand for their products.

California is well aware of the stakes. Consider it a modern-day version of the automobile and gas industries’ purchase and destruction of public transit tram lines in Los Angeles generations ago — a wanton act of industrial vandalism that turned Los Angeles from a city with a viable and expanding public transport system into the private car capital of the universe. That helped set the U.S. on a century-long trajectory that, with the exception of a few cities, prioritized private vehicle usage over public transit.

In the aftermath of the congressional voiding of the state’s 2035 electric vehicle mandate, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order asking state legislators and the Air Resources Board to come up with alternative ways to stimulate the growth of the EV market and to protect its emissions standards, and to prioritize state contracts with companies meeting EV targets.

At the same time, the state’s attorney general filed suit against Trump for an illegal use of the Congressional Review Act. The suit is being joined by 10 other states: Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

Because the mandate was overturned through the Congressional Review Act, however, it typically wouldn’t be subject to judicial review. This means that California’s lawsuit, which is largely based around the parliamentarian’s conclusions, is still something of a long shot.

Trump’s wrecking ball approach to environmental policy is continuing apace. Over the coming months, California and its blue state allies will need to work out a new strategy — one that moves beyond simply filing lawsuits — to get around the federal vise. If it can, then the blue parts of the United States might be able to maintain their environmental policies in the face of the MAGA onslaught and help reduce emissions for all of us; if it can’t, the climate crisis will pick up evermore steam.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2215956479-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 11:09:05.919899

Michael Lucci, founder and CEO of State Armor, says the report shows how Energy Foundation China funds green energy initiatives that make America more reliant on China, especially on technology with known vulnerabilities.

“Our report exposes how Energy Foundation China functions not as an independent nonprofit, but as a vehicle advancing the strategic interests of the Chinese Communist Party by funding U.S. green energy initiatives to shift American supply chains toward Beijing and undermine our energy security,” Lucci said in a statement before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee’s hearing on Wednesday titled “Enter the Dragon – China and the Left’s Lawfare Against American Energy Dominance.”

Lucci said the group’s operations represent a textbook example of Chinese influence in America.

“This is a very good example of how the Chinese Communist Party operates influence operations within the United States. I would actually describe it as a perfect case study from their perspective,” he told The Center Square in a phone interview. “They’re using American money to leverage American policy changes that make the American energy grid dependent upon China.”

Lucci said one of the most concerning findings is that China-backed technology entering the U.S. power grid includes components with “undisclosed back doors” – posing a direct threat to the power grid.

“These are not actually green tech technologies. They’re red technologies,” he said. “We are finding – and this is open-source news reporting – they have undisclosed back doors in them. They’re described in a Reuters article as rogue communication devices… another way to describe that is kill switches.”

Lucci said China exploits American political divisions on energy policy to insert these technologies under the guise of environmental progress.

“Yes, and it’s very crafty,” he said. “We are not addressing the fact that these green technologies are red. Technologies controlled by the Communist Party of China should be out of the question.”

Although Lucci sees a future for carbon-free energy sources in the United States – particularly nuclear and solar energy – he doesn’t think the country should use technology from a foreign adversary to do it.

“It cannot be Chinese solar inverters that are reported in Reuters six weeks ago as having undisclosed back doors,” he said. “It cannot be Chinese batteries going into the grid … that allow them to sabotage our grid.”

Lucci said energy is a national security issue, and the United States is in a far better position to achieve energy independence than China.

“We are luckily endowed with energy independence if we choose to have it. China is not endowed with that luxury,” he said. “They’re poor in natural resources. We’re very well endowed – one of the best – with natural resources for energy production.”

He said that’s why China continues to build coal plants – and some of that coal comes from Australia – while pushing the United States to use solar energy.

“It’s very foolish of us to just make ourselves dependent on their technologies that we don’t need, and which are coming with embedded back doors that give them actual control over our energy grid,” he said.

Lucci says lawmakers at both the state and federal levels need to respond to this threat quickly.

“The executive branch should look at whether Energy Foundation China is operating as an unregistered foreign agent,” he said. “State attorneys general should be looking at these back doors that are going into our power grid – undisclosed back doors.

While fossil fuel lobbyists and wealthy waterfront landowners in beachfront communities were cheering on the impending death of offshore wind power a funny thing happened: Turbines continued going up, large-scale projects got built and began turning wind into electricity, and the wind projects continued their progress toward construction.

Candidate Donald Trump vowed that, if he were elected, the offshore wind industry would end on “day one” of his second term, and his Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Environmental Protection Agency immediately began the process of pulling approvals and denying permits on projects up and down the East Coast.

Some projects did fold in the face of poor approval prospects and investor departures – but the industry is quietly completing massive projects that will supply power to millions of homes.

Dominion Energy continues to work toward completing the nation’s largest offshore wind project in the waters off Virginia after battling years of fossil-fuel funded opposition and weathering the Trump administration’s repeated – albeit inconsistent — moves to shut down wind. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is more than halfway complete about 30 miles from Virginia Beach. In many ways, between the jobs, the power and the investment, it may simply be too big to fail.

With 176 turbines, the $6 billion project will power 660,000 homes with clean energy when finished in 2026. It has already created 2,000 jobs and stands as proof that offshore wind is alive and well.

So while the naysayers were busy writing obituaries, offshore wind continued to do what it was always meant to do: generate power, create jobs, and help secure a livable future.

Meanwhile, the most audacious attack on offshore wind, a stop work order from the Trump administration against New York’s Empire Wind, was rescinded earlier this month. That project, 20 miles southeast of Long Island, is now back under construction.

Empire has created 1,500 jobs and will power half a million New York homes when completed in 2028. To the extent reports that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to fresh consideration of one or more fracked gas pipelines in exchange for allowing Empire to proceed are accurate, such ill-advised and outdated proposals face major obstacles, including stiff public opposition. Meanwhile, construction of the critical clean energy that New York actually needs proceeds in the form of Empire Wind.

Revolution Wind, 15 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, began work two years ago and is on target to be finished and powering 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island by next year. Revolution has faced an onslaught of legal attacks from wealthy waterfront owners concerned about their ocean views. But at least for now, the project has been safe from Trump’s anti-wind attacks. And again, size and economic clout may have helped keep the project viable. Revolution has spent more than $100 million shoreside redeveloping waterfront in both Connecticut and Rhode Island and, by creating 1,500 jobs, has strong political and union support.

Finally, there is Vineyard Wind.

After a devastating turbine break stopped construction last July, Vineyard Wind has quietly – very quietly – managed to get back to work on its 806-megawatt project 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard. The project will power 400,000 homes in Massachusetts, revitalize the port of New Bedford, and generate 2,000 jobs. The project is now generating electricity from 10 of 62 planned turbines.

Each of these projects has – so far – survived in the face of relentless attacks from the Trump administration, fossil fuel proponents, and greenwashed fronts. Baseless charges that wind power kills whales; lawsuits targeting transmission cables, substations, and transmission cables; phony “grassroots” organizations bankrolled by waterfront homeowners and/or oil and gas companies; attacks by the Trump bureaucracy – all so far have failed.

Silence about success and ongoing work seems to be a part of the strategy for offshore wind developers – and maybe you can’t blame them.

In May, one of the directors of the Dominion project said that continued construction came from “keeping our head down” and keeping the project away from any fanfare. Dominion has also managed to keep working by touting offshore wind not as clean, green, or planet saving – which, of course, it is – but simply as homegrown American power.

Like federal biologists and health experts, offshore wind developers have learned not to bring the benefits of clean air and cuts to pollution into their conversations.

They can’t say it. But we can: When these four projects go on-line in the next three years, they will power two million homes while taking millions of tons of carbon pollution out of the air we breathe – the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road. That means less asthma, better heart health, and a planet moving further from a future marked by increasing heat and drought, flooding and erosion, real damage to marine life, and more houses being swallowed by a rising ocean.

Jobs, measurable economic impact, and the promise of reliable domestic power – these may be keeping offshore wind on track to survive the current headwinds and thrive when the coast is clear. But for now, just don’t say out loud that it could also help protect our health and save the planet.

What's the story

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) has projected that the clean energy sector will generate around seven million jobs over the next five years. The prediction was made by ISA Director General Ashish Khanna during an interview with CNBC-TV18. He also emphasized how island nations heavily reliant on diesel for power are spending nearly 4% of their GDP on imports.

Energy challenges

Many island nations unable to scale up

Khanna highlighted that many island nations are unable to scale up in batteries or solar energy due to their small size. He said all Pacific nations will meet in Sri Lanka next month, while Latin American countries will gather in Chile. The meetings are part of a joint effort by these island countries to create a platform for large-scale bidding for solar energy and lower costs.

Shale wastewater and solids analyses from the pilot test were sent to Montrose Environmental Group, an independent environmental testing services in Calgary.

A draft report confirming that the ACCELi (Accelerated Chemical Cavitation Extraction of Lithium) process performed as intended, yielding lithium phosphate solids with a purity of 94.2%.

The third and final test run achieved a lithium recovery rate of 69.3%. The average concentration of lithium taken from the source tank across the three batch runs was 243mg/l.

Dr. Ian Hutcheon, Director of Rain and Professor Emeritus of Geochemistry at the University of Calgary said, ""The performance of the ACCELi system in this pilot test provides a significant step forward to the development of a commercial lithium extraction facility in Pennsylvania.

“The future potential of ACCELi in Chile and Argentina, where scarce water resources require a process that has very low or no additional freshwater requirements, has been clearly demonstrated in our pilot test which is of particular importance as we move towards developing our presence in South America.""

Benjamin Hill, CEO of Rain commented, ""From executing an earn in agreement to successfully concluding our first in-field pilot plant test within a year Rain and Avonlea join the few DLE companies that have tested their technology on real brines in-situ.

“We believe ACCELi to be the only DLE technology that can deal with the variable brine chemistry characteristics (in this case from the Marcellus Shale) in real time having successfully processed brine sourced from different areas with different compositions during the Pennsylvania field test.

“Having had our technology and results scrutinized and validated by industry experts, we maintain our high levels of comfort in the ACCELi process and patented Cavitek technology.

“We are obviously very pleased to see Montrose corroborate our findings and that even with a lower concentration of lithium in the brine we were ultimately able to achieve both a high recovery rate and purity of lithium phosphate along with immediately saleable by-products from the process.

“Following the completion of the pilot test at Kendra II's Springville WMG 123 Facility, Kendra II have agreed in principle to enter into an arrangement to jointly work to commercially develop ACCELi Cavitek plants at their facilities across Pennsylvania"".

In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.
This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country.
After the passage of the climate law in August 2022, E2 says 27 new projects were announced in North Carolina alone, representing an investment of over $21 billion.
The tax credits that benefit large clean energy projects will last until 2028, but only for those that begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, an impossibility for most.","Now that the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to kill nearly every federal tax credit there is to support the clean energy transition, gobsmacked advocates and industry leaders in solar, wind, and electric vehicles are looking desperately to the Senate to amend it.

In North Carolina, that means all eyes turn to senior U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a second-term Republican up for reelection next year in this steadfast purple state, which is already reaping benefits from the clean energy economy.

“Sen. Tillis is going to be so important, along with other voices,” said Stephen Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, ​“because he has indicated that we don’t want to whipsaw 180 degrees back and forth between approaches to energy policy.”

Tillis is among four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal. The four signatories alone could sink the House measure if they joined Senate Democrats in opposing it.

The senator’s stance, the economic benefits of clean energy, and bipartisan support among voters for solar, wind, and efficiency all give advocates in the state some cause for cautious optimism. So does the reality that solar and batteries are the quickest, cheapest way to solidify the nation’s ​“energy dominance,” a frequently stated goal of President Donald Trump.

“We need energy today and tomorrow,” said Chris Carmody, executive director of Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, a trade group. ​“Not only are renewables and storage the lowest-cost option, they’re also the fastest to build.”

The clean energy economy has an intricate foothold in North Carolina. Largely owing to its acres upon acres of solar fields, the state was home to the fourth most solar capacity in the country last year, supporting over 7,000 jobs, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And the region doesn’t just use solar equipment, it also makes it: Vietnamese panel manufacturer Boviet Solar opened its first U.S. plant in Greenville, North Carolina, in April, with plans for expansion next year that would create over 1,300 local jobs.

The Tar Heel State is also a leader in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain, with lithium mines, Toyota’s massive battery plant in Randolph County, and EV factories all in the works. Its robust manufacturing sector already produces a number of renewable energy components. In all, North Carolina boasts over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country, per the national nonprofit E2.

The federal tax credits that helped spur this economic activity were first enacted decades ago with bipartisan support. Combined with favorable state policies, that means that wind, solar, and battery storage were on the rise during the first Trump administration and before. But the incentives were undoubtedly supercharged by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The landmark climate law extended the tax credits for large wind and solar projects and rooftop solar through 2032, then tapered them down over several years. It enacted new and expanded incentives for rooftop solar, EV purchases, and energy-efficiency improvements, set to end around the same time. It also included an advanced manufacturing incentive, designed to spur domestic production of minerals, battery components, and more.

This 10-year runway of economic certainty sparked a wave of clean energy development across the country. After the passage of the climate law in August 2022, E2 says 27 new projects were announced in North Carolina alone, representing an investment of over $21 billion.

House bill takes sledgehammer, not scalpel, to clean energy incentives

Experts say the House Republicans’ budget measure, which cleared the chamber by just one vote, would imperil all of these economic gains. The tax credits that benefit large clean energy projects will last until 2028, but only for those that begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage, an impossibility for most.

“Unless your project is shovel-ready and has gotten every permit, there’s no project, in any type of energy, that can go from zero to begin in 60 days,” Carmody said.

The rare developer who can begin construction that quickly faces another seemingly insurmountable hurdle: It must document that no component of its project, no matter how small, is linked to a ​“Foreign Entity of Concern” such as China. That requirement also applies to the advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, rendering that incentive all but useless even though it’s extended beyond 2028.

“It’s never been done before for any industry. It’s incredibly onerous,” said John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network. ​“We have a global interconnected economy. We definitely want more manufacturing back in the U.S., and I agree with the president 100% on that. But the way that [provision] is worded, it’s almost impossible to meet.”

The House bill abruptly eliminates at year’s end an array of tax credits for EVs and charging infrastructure. Combined with the poison-pill provision on foreign components in advanced manufacturing, the termination of those incentives could kneecap the state’s burgeoning EV sector.

“The bill passed by the House takes a sledgehammer to North Carolina’s EV industry and undermines efforts to build secure and reliable access to critical minerals,” said Ben Prochazka, the North Carolina-based executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a national nonprofit.",https://zephyrnet.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-2213764780.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 12:14:05.027187

Trump on Friday evening called for the end of the credits and said they no longer need support.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The latest version of the Senate’s massive budget bill that the Senate is racing through for a vote as soon as Saturday deals a fatal blow to the use of tax credits in place since 2005 to spur more wind and solar energy and would set a new tax on those projects for the first time, renewable energy proponents said on Saturday.

Despite hopes earlier in the week that the Senate would rework the budget megabill’s language about the future use of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to extend their use and make them more usable, the new version of the bill introduced by Senate leadership overnight will effectively repeal the incentives for solar and wind immediately.

Instead, it imposes a new tax on wind and solar projects completed after Dec. 31, 2027 if they cannot prove they have not used any Chinese components, while offering a new tax break for coal production.

It also accelerates the phase-out of clean energy manufacturing tax credits that have attracted billions in investments throughout the US, especially in Republican states.

The clean energy industry and environmental groups decried the last-minute changes to the bill, saying that it will raise household energy costs and deprive the US of new, necessary and fast electricity capacity at a time of massive power demand amid a rush of construction of power-hungry data centers to power AI development.

Trump’s former advisor and head of DOGE Elon Musk blasted the bill on his social media platform X on Saturday, warning that the bill will “destroy millions of jobs in America” and cause “strategic harm.”

“It is utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” he said.

Energy security organization SAFE said in a statement that the bill, as written, would give an advantage to China, which dominates the clean energy and electric vehicle industries and is racing to outpace the US in AI development by taking away financing for energy storage, mineral processing and power projects.

“Where the original Senate version was a recipe for energy stagnation, this is outright energy surrender—all but guaranteeing Chinese dominance of critical minerals, industrial supply chains, and AI development,” said Avery Ash, head of government affairs for SAFE.

Green energy opponents praised the bill for ending support for renewable energy. Trump on Friday evening called for the end of the credits and said they no longer need support.

“If, as supporters of the IRA are complaining, repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance.

Protecting the environment is one of many ways that Entergy powers life and creates sustainable value for our stakeholders — customers, employees, communities and owners.

Entergy is recognized as an industry leader for taking bold action to address climate issues. In 2001, we were the first U.S. electric utility to commit to voluntarily stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, we’ve challenged ourselves even further and set stricter reduction targets.

In 2019, we set a new emissions strategy for the next decade by committing to reduce our emission intensity by 50% from our 2000 level by 2030. This means that for every unit of electricity Entergy generates, we will emit half the CO2 that we emitted in 2000. Learn more in our climate report here.

Now, we are accelerating our climate action goals with a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This commitment illustrates our ongoing view of the importance of environmental stewardship. Learn more about our strategic actions and opportunities for technological advances here.

Energy diversity means sustainability and affordability

It is critically important that we maintain a diverse energy portfolio for our customers. Entergy Louisiana primarily uses natural gas and nuclear power generation in addition to purchased power to meet customers’ needs. This level of diversity not only keeps prices as low as possible, but it helps to control emission output.

Natural gas — 51%

Coal — 2%

Nuclear — 22%

Purchases — 22%

Renewables — 3%

We’re also looking to the future by pursuing new sources of emission-free energy for our customers. We have issued a request for proposals to add up to 300 MW of new-build solar resources in Louisiana by the end of 2023.

In October 2020, we started purchasing power from Capital Region Solar, a 50-megawatt solar plant built near Port Allen in West Baton Rouge Parish.

These new sources will add to the approximately 190 megawatts of renewables – including hydro, waste heat recovery and biomass – currently in our generation portfolio.

We are increasing our environmental efficiency with each new project.

Renewable energy

Solar power for a brighter future.

Entergy Louisiana continues adding the power of the sun to its generation portfolio through a variety of new projects. A diverse energy portfolio helps us keep costs as low as possible, and renewable energy will help ensure a brighter future for generations.

In October, 2020, Entergy Louisiana customers began receiving power from the largest solar facility in the state, the Capital Region Solar site. Located in West Baton Rouge Parish, the 50-megawatt facility provides a source of clean, reliable and affordable energy for the region.

Entergy Louisiana recognizes that customers are increasingly interested in renewable energy. In coordination with regulators, Entergy Louisiana is working to expand its portfolio of energy solutions, while achieving the company’s sustainability goals. As part of its plan to continue expanding its clean-energy portfolio for the benefit of customers, Entergy Louisiana has issued a request for proposals to add up to 300 megawatts of utility-scale solar resources that would be in service by 2023.",https://www.entergylouisiana.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FavIcon.png,N,,2025-06-29 14:10:10.349692
,American Energy,2025-06-29 12:06:27+00:00,The Denver Post,Xcel plans Colorado coal ash cleanup as toxins seep into groundwater - The Denver Post,Noelle Phillips,,,,,https://www.denverpost.com/2025/06/29/colorado-coal-ash-cleanup-xcel-valmont-station/,"The report placed three of Colorado’s coal-ash waste sites among the 50 most contaminated sites in the United States.
During that time, Xcel dumped its coal ash — also known as coal combustion residuals — into three ponds and a landfill.
“If you ask if there’s a big problem with coal ash in the U.S., the answer is yes because coal ash was mismanaged for decades,” Evans said.
Hazardous chemicals found in coal ash include arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, radium and selenium.
Meanwhile, there is no other long-term plan for removing the millions of tons of coal ash buried in Colorado.","BOULDER — When Xcel Energy stopped burning coal at its Valmont Power Station in 2017, it left 1.6 million tons of toxic coal ash on the property, and now that waste is leaking hazardous metals into groundwater, threatening nearby drinking-water wells.

Xcel plans to scoop most of the coal ash from a landfill at the site and turn it into an ingredient in concrete to be sold in metro Denver. The project awaits approval from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The utility company expects to spend $24 million over the next 10 to 12 years to remove ash and treat contaminated groundwater, said Michelle Aguayo, an Xcel spokeswoman.

Officials at Boulder County Public Health are on board with the coal-ash cleanup, saying that recycling hazardous waste into a useful product is a proven solution. It would rid the site of a toxic substance and prevent anyone from trucking it to another community.

“That’s one reason we like this project — we’re not just putting this project on someone else. Another reason we like it is it will be a net greenhouse gas reduction,” said Bill Hayes, the county health department’s air quality program director. “We aren’t trucking it nationally. We are creating something that will be used locally and won’t have to be trucked in from thousands of miles.”

“Boulder County Public Health supports the project,” he said. “The beneficial use project will have global impacts. But there will be some risk with it.”

Xcel will be the first utility company in Colorado to initiate such a large-scale coal-ash cleanup after lithium and selenium leaked into groundwater and seeped toward wells used for drinking water on nearby properties.

But there are millions of tons of coal ash in other landfills and ponds around Colorado, and almost all of those sites are leaching pollutants into groundwater.

Over the years, public reporting of coal-ash contamination has been inconsistent because there was no regulation of the waste before 2015. Even after that, utility companies were only required to report monitoring results from landfills that were still in use — and those documents can be hard to find and difficult to understand.

Then, last year, the Biden administration expanded those reporting requirements to all waste disposal sites, although nothing has yet resulted from that rule change.

In 2022, two environmental organizations compiled a list of coal-ash waste sites across the United States, using Environmental Protection Agency reports, and their research identified 12 known coal ash locations in Colorado.

Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project estimated that over the decades 14 Colorado power plants created more than 1.7 million tons of ash per year that went into landfills and retention ponds, according to their 212-page report.

The report placed three of Colorado’s coal-ash waste sites among the 50 most contaminated sites in the United States.

While Xcel has a plan to remove coal ash at the old Valmont station, environmentalists say it is unlikely that most utility companies will clean their sites unless forced by federal or state regulators, or if sued by impacted communities. Utility companies have a track record of doing the minimum amount required under the EPA’s Coal Combustion Residuals rules, said Abel Russ, senior counsel with the Environmental Integrity Project.

“They find ways to formally comply with the rule but not do much with cleanup because it’s expensive and they don’t want to spend the money,” Russ said.

Xcel’s cleanup project at Valmont comes as the Trump administration shows little appetite for enforcing existing coal-ash disposal rules, as the president and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin push their “Powering the Great American Comeback” agenda, which prioritizes coal as a leading source of energy in the country.

On Thursday, a Republican-controlled House environmental subcommittee held a hearing to review coal-ash regulations and to discuss whether or not “government red tape and bureaucracy can stifle innovation surrounding the use of coal ash,” according to an announcement of the hearing.

In Colorado, utility companies are phasing out coal-burning power plants as the state strives to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and pivot toward renewable energy such as wind and solar. Those companies will continue to produce coal ash until that happens. Meanwhile, the retention ponds and landfills that have held the ash for decades are not going away.

For example, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association’s ash disposal facility near its Nucla Station in Montrose County received waste from 1987 until 2019, when the coal plant was retired. The company reported last year that 4.8 million tons of coal ash are in a landfill, and that the electric cooperative continues maintenance at the waste site.

Last year, Tri-State said it had taken steps to prevent erosion, including adding riprap along the perimeter and building a 1.5-foot-tall berm, according to the company’s 2024 inspection report.

The Valmont Power Station on North 63rd Street in Boulder operated as a coal-fired electricity generation station for almost a century, until it was converted to a natural-gas-powered station in September 2017. During that time, Xcel dumped its coal ash — also known as coal combustion residuals — into three ponds and a landfill.

In 2020, Xcel’s groundwater monitoring detected lithium and selenium leaching from a 60-acre landfill that was in operation from 1993 until 2017. That led the company to come up with a plan to remove the ash from the site and stop the leaks.

But it’s been a long process.

Xcel submitted its engineering and design plan earlier this year to explain how the cleanup will work. That plan is still under review by the state health department’s Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division and will be subject to public comment once preliminary approval is given.

The company also must apply for a permit to emit pollutants into the air during the cement-making project, and that must also be approved by the state.

Work cannot start until those approvals have been given. Still, Xcel says it will begin in 2026.

A national problem

Nationally, 5 billion tons of coal ash are estimated to have been created by coal-powered electricity plants since the late 1800s, said Lisa Evans, senior counsel with Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law group.

Coal ash is the second-largest industrial waste stream in the country, accounting for 70 million tons pouring into landfills and retention ponds every year, Earthjustice research found.

“If you ask if there’s a big problem with coal ash in the U.S., the answer is yes because coal ash was mismanaged for decades,” Evans said.

Hazardous chemicals found in coal ash include arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, radium and selenium. Those chemicals are known to cause an increased risk of various cancers, heart and thyroid disease, respiratory illnesses and neurological problems.

Lithium is a naturally occurring metal and has various commercial uses, including as a material used in batteries. The EPA has placed lithium on a list of priority contaminants in drinking water, but has not established regulations on how much is an acceptable minimum level. Lithium has been known to cause renal and neurological problems in people.

Selenium is also a naturally occurring metal and has useful purposes, including as an essential nutrient at low levels. The EPA has established a maximum level for that metal, which can damage the liver, kidneys, nervous system and circulatory system, and cause hair loss.

Coal-ash disposal in the United States was unregulated until after the December 2008 Kingston TVA coal ash spill in eastern Tennessee.

In that disaster, a dike used to contain coal ash broke near the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, dumping 5.4 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash into nearby water, including the Emory and Clinch rivers, and contaminating more than 300 acres of land. It took more than six years to clean the mess from rivers and streams, and private property. Hundreds of workers were sickened — and dozens died — from exposure to arsenic, lead, mercury and radium that was in the coal ash.

“That was just so dramatic that it focused everyone’s attention on it. It reminded everyone that it’s a huge waste stream,” Russ said.

When Americans first started burning coal to provide electricity, no one thought about the ash byproduct left over after the coal burned. The ash was dumped in unlined lagoons and landfills without much thought.

“It’s the sheer volume of it and the concentration of heavy metals in it,” Russ said. “They didn’t wrap their heads around it until it was too late.”

The EPA established the first rules for coal-ash management in 2015 in the wake of the Kingston disaster. The rules addressed the risks associated with coal-ash disposal, including leaks into groundwater, dust blowing into the air and failures of barriers around landfills.

The federal government also began requiring record-keeping and reporting at active coal-ash landfills across the country, and the regulations allowed for the beneficial use of coal ash, which is what Xcel is planning for the Valmont Power Station in Boulder.

Those 2015 rules only applied to active landfills and excluded some of the oldest coal-ash ponds and landfills in the country. In 2024, the EPA, under President Joe Biden, tightened rules governing those older ponds and landfills that required monitoring for pollutants and cleanup.

However, the Trump administration has already signaled that it will not prioritize coal-ash enforcement, Evans said.

In March, Zeldin announced a plan to shift coal-ash regulation to the states with EPA support, and pledged to change the rules on compliance deadlines by the end of this year.

That means there will be uneven enforcement across the country, with coal-friendly states such as Wyoming and North Dakota becoming lax while other states, including Colorado, tackle the challenge, Evans said.

“Coal ash is like running on a treadmill. We gain ground and lose ground,” Evans said. “We made progress with Obama, and Trump tried to rescind it, but ended up just delaying. Then we got a new rule with President Biden to fill the gaps. And now the Trump administration wants to undo it.”

A Colorado problem

There are 12 known locations in Colorado where coal ash has been dumped, and those sites include 38 coal-ash ponds and landfills, according to a database maintained by Earthjustice. There could be other unknown sites where coal ash was stored long before any regulations existed, the environmental group says.

Those 12 sites are on the grounds of former or active coal-burning power plants, or nearby landfills, and are the responsibility of the utility companies that own them. It’s unclear exactly how much coal ash is buried in the ground in Colorado because of incomplete reporting.

Xcel is responsible for seven of the coal-ash waste sites in the state: the former Arapahoe Generation Station in Denver; the former Cameo Generation Station in Mesa County; the Cherokee Generation Station in Denver; the Comanche Generation Station in Pueblo; the Hayden Generation Station in Routt County; the Pawnee Generation Station in Morgan County; and Valmont.

The other sites in Colorado include: Colorado Springs Utilities’ Clear Spring Ranch Landfill, which holds waste from the Ray Nixon Power Plant and the former Martin Drake Power Plant; Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association’s Nucla Ash Disposal Facility, which holds waste from its former Nucla Station in Montrose County and its Craig Station in Moffat County; and the Platte River Power Authority’s Rawhide Energy Station in Larimer County.

Earthjustice also reported there is a coal-ash waste site at the former Martin Drake Power Plant in El Paso County, but there are no available reporting documents online and efforts to reach Colorado Springs Utilities were unsuccessful.

It is also unknown whether there is coal-ash waste associated with the former W.N. Clark Power Plant in Fremont County, which was decommissioned in 2012.

Earthjustice lists three Colorado coal-ash sites among the 50 most contaminated in the country because they have multiple pollutants exceeding EPA standards: Valmont is ranked 31st; Tri-State’s retired Nucla station is 39th; and Xcel’s Hayden Station is 44th.

While it is unclear exactly how much coal ash is buried in landfills and sitting in retention ponds across the state, a Denver Post review of available 2024 coal combustion residual inspection reports found more than 30 million tons at the various sites. No reports are available for landfills that were closed before 2015.

Xcel’s seven sites contain more than 19 million tons of coal ash, according to inspection reports the company posted online. However, not every Xcel disposal site has an updated report on the company’s coal-ash management website, in part because of the change in reporting rules for coal-ash sites. The Post found online reports missing for Arapahoe, Cameo, Cherokee and Pawnee’s north landfill sites.

Xcel declined to make its coal-ash managers available for interviews with The Post. Instead, Aguayo, the company’s Colorado spokeswoman, sent an emailed statement and referred the newspaper to the company’s website for any information on coal-ash management.

“Protecting our customers and the environment is a priority, and we have a strong record of environmental leadership,” Aguayo said in the statement. “We’re committed to responsibly managing impacts from our operations, including from prior coal plants, like Valmont.”

In the past three years, Xcel has been cited twice by the EPA for failures to comply with coal-ash regulations.

Xcel’s Cherokee Generating Station transitioned to a natural-gas-fired power plant in 2017 and closed five dumpsites, including a retention pond, on the property. But closing a coal-ash disposal location does not mean the coal ash is removed. Rather, no more waste is dumped there.

Xcel was fined $134,500 in September after lithium was discovered leaking from its Cherokee plant, identifiable by its red-and-white smokestack visible from north Denver. The EPA cited the company for failing to adequately prepare groundwater monitoring reports, failing to meet groundwater monitoring performance standards, failing to accurately represent readings in groundwater quality, and failing to use the most effective statistical methods to analyze groundwater data, according to the agency’s consent agreement.

Xcel agreed to correct its missteps, according to the consent agreement between the company and the EPA.

The utility is still assessing how to treat the lithium plume, said Lauren Whitney, a state health department spokeswoman. Xcel is evaluating two solutions and will hold a public meeting before selecting a method and starting work.

But that’s not the largest fine Xcel has paid for coal-ash violations.

In 2022, the EPA penalized the company for failing to comply with regulations on the disposal of coal ash and not properly monitoring groundwater at its Comanche station in Pueblo. The company paid $1 million to settle with the federal government.

That site is releasing cobalt into the groundwater.

Xcel has identified the plume, tested the groundwater and is putting together a remediation strategy, Whitney said.

Between August 2024 and February, the remediation strategy included injecting a treatment reagent into six injection wells using an EPA-approved method, Whitney said. Wells near the plume did not have cobalt levels that exceeded the drinking water standards.

Meanwhile, Xcel continues to dump coal ash into a landfill in Pueblo until the coal plant is decommissioned, no later than Dec. 31, 2030. As of 2024, about 4.9 million tons of coal ash are in the ground at Comanche, according to the most recent inspection report.

Cleaning up Valmont

Valmont Station will be the first site in Colorado where Xcel plans to convert coal ash into Portland cement, an ingredient used to make concrete. And it is the only site with such a massive cleanup in the company’s plans, Aguayo said.

The company has contracted with Charah Solutions, a Kentucky-based company that specializes in coal-ash management and cleanup. Charah has hired Geocycle, an industrial waste management company, to help with the project, Aguayo said in the utility’s statement.

Charah is expected to process about 2 million tons of ash over 10 years to remove the hazardous waste.

Charah and Geocycle use a proprietary system to recycle the ash into cement. It involves a mobile kiln that would be set up on the Valmont property, and the companies would use a baghouse — an industrial dust collector — to prevent harmful air emissions, Aguayo said.

Charah will only excavate the amount of ash that its workers intend to process in one day to avoid leaving excess ash on the ground that could blow into the community at night when the work stops, she said. The equipment is enclosed to manage dust, and the noise it makes is similar to Valmont’s normal operations.

The cement created onsite will be sold and used in the Denver market, Aguayo said.

“This project provides large-scale environmental benefits by eliminating the need to mine new raw materials for Portland cement and by eliminating the need for cross-regional transport of Portland cement and/or concrete to Denver’s local market,” her statement said.

Operations will run during daylight hours, seven days a week. Work will stop when wind gusts exceed 55 mph or sustained winds exceed 40 mph, according to the company’s engineering and design plan.

Once the ash is removed, the contractor will grade the area and put down clean soil and grass seed. Any ash that is not suitable for recycling will be placed in a specific area of the landfill, and then the landfill will be closed.

Hayes, the air quality manager at Boulder County Public Health, said he is most concerned about how much dust will flow into the air once the project starts. The engineering and design plan calls for dust control systems but lacks details.

“That’s what I’m really waiting to see are the controls we want to see in that dust control plan,” Hayes said. “The dust concerns from start to finish are when they are excavating the landfill sites.”

Hayes hopes more of those details will be included in the company’s air-pollution permit. He wants the state health department to require continuous air-quality monitoring at the site, but so far, the state has not agreed to consider it once the air permit is filed.

“CDPHE says they’ve never required it in an air permit,” Hayes said. “I said, ‘Yeah, but we’ve never issued an air permit for a coal-ash landfill project.’ This is a unique and novel project, and we just don’t need to go with what we’ve done in the past.”

Hayes said he’s not optimistic that a monitoring requirement will be included in the air permit, so he is searching for outside funding to pay for it.

“In our current climate, getting funding for air monitoring is proving to be a little challenging,” he said. “Federal grants that used to be available for that are dwindling and going away.”

But the air quality problem at a coal-ash landfill only occurs once a company starts excavating the material.

The more critical problem at most coal-ash waste sites is the groundwater contamination.

“It’s a huge problem. We’ve been burning coal since the early 1900s,” said Evans, with Earthjustice. “The ash was not regulated until 2015, so billions of tons of coal ash have been dumped in pits and ponds and used as fill across the United States. Almost every state had a coal-burning power plant.”

For years, companies were allowed to dump the ash without lining the landfills. More than 90% of coal-ash waste sites have contaminated groundwater above federal safety standards, she said.

“It’s not an exaggeration to say that whenever you dump coal ash, you’re going to get water contamination,” Evans said.

At the Valmont Station, Xcel has monitored groundwater with a network of wells that the utility drilled in the area, said Carl Job, a water quality specialist with Boulder County Public Health. Those wells detected elevated levels of lithium and selenium in a plume moving north and east of the property, and the plume was moving toward nearby drinking water wells.

Xcel filed an ash landfill remedy selection report, which proposes a cleanup method, in May with the state health department. The report said two plumes were creeping out of the landfill. The first plume contains elevated concentrations of lithium and selenium, while the second plume exceeds lithium levels mandated by the EPA.

“These plumes are not adversely impacting drinking water in the area, and the groundwater will continue to be monitored to ensure ongoing protection of human health in the area until remedy completion,” the report stated. “There are also no public drinking water supplies in the vicinity of the impacted groundwater.”

The contaminated plumes are not a threat to most Boulder residents, who get their water from the city system, Job said. The real concern surrounds the few wells nearby where people get their drinking water, which are not as regulated as public water systems.

Only one well has shown higher levels of lithium contamination, and Xcel is providing an alternate source of water, said Erin Dodge, Boulder County Public Health’s water quality program coordinator.

The plumes are not impacting Boulder Creek or South Boulder Creek, she said.

Groundwater remediation is proceeding under a compliance order from the state, Whitney said. Xcel has submitted a proposal for treating the groundwater, and it is under review by the state and Boulder County. Once it is approved, Xcel will submit a design plan for the state health department to review.

Xcel is proposing to use reverse osmosis, which is a proven method for cleaning water. That system will extract groundwater through wells and collection trenches and truck it off-site for treatment, the report said.

The remedy selection report estimated it would take 15 to 35 years to treat the groundwater.

Meanwhile, there is no other long-term plan for removing the millions of tons of coal ash buried in Colorado.

Some utilities, such as the Platte River Authority, sell some ash for beneficial reuse. Platte River sells ash to architectural block manufacturers and to liquid-waste disposal facilities, according to its company website.

Officials at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment say they are committed to making sure coal ash does not contaminate groundwater.

The state regularly monitors coal-ash waste sites, said Tracie White, director of the health agency’s hazardous waste division. And Valmont is of particular interest because of the size of its ash reuse project.

“We are committed to making sure coal ash landfills in Colorado are protective of human health and the environment,” White said. “At Valmont Station, our team is closely reviewing the proposed cleanup remedy to ensure it meets all state regulations and prevents further impacts to groundwater. We regularly monitor these sites to track, trace, and treat potential contamination, and we work in partnership with local communities throughout the process.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TDP-L-coal-ash-RJS-20590.jpg?w=1024&h=679,N,,2025-06-29 13:09:56.333319

A key claim by Hochul in her announcement was that nuclear power provides “zero-emission” energy in terms of emitting carbon that causes climate change.
Also, Hochul stressed the new nuclear development would involve “advanced” nuclear plants.
Nuclear power is dirty, dangerous, and wildly expensive—and this project will leave New Yorkers footing the bill while delaying urgently needed progress on renewables.
Nuclear power is an extremely complicated and costly means of boiling water,” said Kluewer, long a professor at Suffolk County Community College.","Governor Kathy Hochul continued her push for nuclear power in New York State by announcing on June 21 that she has “directed the New York Power Authority” to “develop a new nuclear facility” to be built “upstate” and, as the heading of her announcement said, be the “First New Nuclear Power Construction in New York State in a Generation.”

Her move was criticized by safe-energy and climate activists and participants in the decades-long battle against nuclear power on Long Island. For years, the Long Island Lighting Company sought to build seven to eleven nuclear power plants. The Shoreham plant was the first constructed, but was stopped from going into operation, with grassroots action playing a pivotal role in blocking it.

A key claim by Hochul in her announcement was that nuclear power provides “zero-emission” energy in terms of emitting carbon that causes climate change. However, as emphasized in a statement by a coalition of organizations — including Don’t Waste NY and the Green Education and Legal Fund— this ignores the nuclear power life cycle.

“Despite the spin from the governor and industry, nuclear is far from ‘carbon free’ with significant carbon emissions during the construction of plants, the mining, processing and transportation of the fuel, and the storage of long-lived waste,” they said.

Also, Hochul stressed the new nuclear development would involve “advanced” nuclear plants. However, the Union of Concerned Scientists conducted research on the so-called “advanced” plants and in a 140-page report, authored by Edwin Lyman, a physicist and its director of nuclear power safety, found these plants “are no better—and in some respects significantly worse—than the light-water reactors in operation today.”

Hochul also was not considering renewable energy sources—primarily in the form of solar panels and wind turbines — now accounting for more than 80% of the world’s new electric generating capacity and up to 90% cheaper than nuclear power. The push by the nuclear industry and pro-nuclear government officials for a so-called “nuclear renaissance” is a last-ditch effort to stifle the growth of renewable energy, according to Harvey Wasserman, co-author of “Solartopia” and “Killing Our Own: The Disaster of America’s Experience with Atomic Radiation.”

Hochul “is making a major push to not only build new nuclear plants in New York State but to make N.Y. the center of a nuclear revival in the U.S.,” Mark Dunlea, chair of the Green Education and Legal Fund, said in May. The author of “Putting Out the Planetary Fire: An Introduction to Climate Change and Advocacy,” Dunlea said Hochul “buys the argument that nuclear is carbon-free, avoiding looking at the life cycle of nuclear and its carbon footprint.” Her June 21 announcement is “the latest mistake in Governor Hochul’s increasing mishandling of the climate crisis, Dunlea said. “She is paying far more attention to corporate sales pitches and campaign donations than to the facts about the accelerating climate crisis.”

Ellen Weininger, director of educational outreach at Port Washington-based Grassroots Environmental Education, said: “We call on Governor Hochul to immediately halt her reckless decision to build new nuclear facilities. Constructing new nuclear facilities squanders precious time and New Yorkers’ hard-earned money on the dirtiest, most expensive and climate-accelerating type of energy. In addition to its life cycle’s significant greenhouse gas footprint, these facilities produce endless amounts of dangerous, highly radioactive waste, create harmful exposures to known carcinogens, teratogens and mutagens and generate large quantities of Carbon-14 and Krypton-85, and other potent radioactive greenhouse gases. New Yorkers should not be asked to foot the enormous bill for these nuclear blunders. We urgently need to transition to safe, affordable, proven renewable energy solutions that work now and will enable New York to meet its pressing climate goals without jeopardizing our health and safety.”

Alex Beauchamp, Northern Region director at the national group Food & Water Watch, said: “Governor Hochul’s nuclear gamble is a reckless distraction from the clean, affordable energy New Yorkers actually need. Nuclear power is dirty, dangerous, and wildly expensive—and this project will leave New Yorkers footing the bill while delaying urgently needed progress on renewables. Hochul needs to stop chasing false solutions and start delivering real climate action.”

“Even with a price tag too large, a waste problem too radioactive, and a timeline too slow, Governor Hochul has still chosen nuclear power over investing in real climate solutions like wind, solar, and geothermal. A new nuclear plant is simply not in the interests of New Yorkers,” said Bob Cohen, Policy and Research director of Citizen Action of New York.

Jeff Kluewer, who as a member of the Shoreham Opponents Coalition challenged LILCO’s nuclear plans said Hochul’s move “is a serious misdirection of effort and capital to address climate change and the electric supply. This directive calls for creating something that does not now exist, implying a timeline that must be measured in decades at costs measured in the many billions of dollars. Such investment would be much better directed at decentralized residential solar and end-use efficiencies as well as wind and solar farms and their accompanying storage technologies. Such investments can address electric energy supply far more quickly, at lower cost while creating and sustaining far more jobs. Nuclear power is an extremely complicated and costly means of boiling water,” said Kluewer, long a professor at Suffolk County Community College.

Marjorie Harrison who chaired the Long Island Public Power Project said: “It’s disappointing when responsible leaders lead us into repeating the mistakes of the past. Shoreham was a mistake, economically and environmentally. Unproved design and construction costs and uranium mining and radioactive waste disposal, among other problems, remain as troubling and unresolved today as they were decades ago. Thank goodness we closed Shoreham through a massive public movement. Kudos to all who joined in to the stop Shoreham, stop LILCO campaign…

“Instead of problematic nuclear power, let’s make it a priority to develop good union jobs by building out our safe-energy economy. With Governor Hochul’s recent nuclear-plant announcement, we can’t sit back and let high-cost, non-renewable energy mistakes happen all over again. Governor, there is still time to ‘say no’ to nuclear plants in New York State.”",https://riverheadlocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/shoreham_power_plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 09:02:15.969146

Next year, analysts expect the electric vehicle (EV) maker's sales to grow by more than 40%. The biggest catalyst for this growth will be its introduction of three new models, all of which are expected to be priced under $50,000. But one factor could put the company's future at risk.

Washington could detour Rivian from its growth path

Any EV company that hopes to grow significantly must eventually launch affordable mass-market models. Today, more than 90% of Tesla's vehicle sales come from its two mass-market models: the Model 3 and Model Y. Rivian, meanwhile, has no affordable models. Its lowest-priced truck starts at about $70,000. But in 2026 and 2027, production of three new ""mass market"" models is set to begin, making Rivians accessible to millions of potential new buyers.

Most Americans are looking to spend less than $50,000 on their next vehicle purchase. Federal EV tax credits -- which can total up to $7,500 -- effectively lower the prices that consumers pay for those vehicles, boosting demand for EVs across the board.

Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are moving to eliminate those tax credits through a provision of the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" Would Rivian be impacted? Germany, of all places, provides us with clues.

From 2016 to 2023, Germany offered its citizens incentives to buy electric vehicles. More than 2 million vehicles ultimately qualified. Incentives averaged nearly 5,000 euros per car. After that program was ended suddenly in 2023, EV sales in Germany fell by 27.4% over the following 12 months. Meanwhile, EV sales throughout the rest of Europe continued to grow.

Surveys show that EV buyers have become increasingly price conscious. The elimination of federal tax credits, therefore, could significantly slow Rivian's growth. Germany's history is a strong testament to that possibility, so if you're invested in Rivian or any other EV stock, carefully monitor the political risk factors.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/822775/gettyimages-1330888912-1201x655-4b46871-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 08:04:49.632647

Key tax incentives for US wind and solar projects are poised to face a more aggressive phase-out under the Senate's latest version of President Donald Trump's spending package. The Bloomberg report highlights that this adjustment follows Trump's pushback on the Inflation Reduction Act credits, potentially limiting the number of qualifying solar and wind farms.

Under the revised $4.2 trillion tax and spending package, wind and solar projects must be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify for valuable clean energy production incentives. This contrasts with the earlier requirement of merely starting construction by the end of 2025. Industry experts, like James Lucier from Capital Alpha Partners, express concerns about the accelerated timeline, which could impact developers such as NextEra Energy Inc., known for its extensive inventory of projects slated to begin in 2025.

Additional provisions in the legislation introduce an excise tax on renewable projects using Chinese materials and expand tax credits to include coal used in steelmaking. However, rooftop solar leasing companies, such as Sunrun Inc., face the early termination of key incentives, sparking criticism from the Solar Energy Industries Association about potential economic and energy security impacts.

On a related note, the bill extends the phase-out period for a hydrogen production tax credit, benefiting companies like Plug Power Inc., until 2028.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Gamble VinFast's factory-driven strategy has the potential to disrupt EV markets in Asia, where affordability trumps brand prestige.","VinFast, the Vietnamese electric vehicle (EV) upstart, is on a collision course with established automakers like Tesla and BYD, betting that its aggressive factory investments and cost leadership strategy can secure regional dominance in Southeast Asia and beyond. With a network of factories stretching from Vietnam to India and Indonesia, VinFast aims to undercut rivals on price while leveraging local partnerships to build charging infrastructure and capture emerging markets. But can its rapid expansion overcome financial losses, production delays, and fierce competition?

The Cost Leadership Playbook

VinFast's strategy hinges on three pillars: local manufacturing scale, vertical integration, and pricing power. Its $4 billion Vietnam plant—now producing 300,000 EVs annually—fuels exports to Indonesia, the Philippines, and beyond. In Indonesia, it's replicating the Vietnam model: a factory producing 50,000 EVs annually by 2024, paired with 100,000 charging stations controlled by its affiliate, V-Green. This vertical integration allows VinFast to offer vehicles at prices 40% lower than rivals. For example, its VF3 SUV sells for $13,700 in Indonesia, undercutting BYD's Dolphin by $8,300.

In India, VinFast's $500 million Tamil Nadu factory—set to begin production in July 2025—will assemble EVs at a $11,500–$13,000 price point, targeting the growing middle class. By localizing production, VinFast avoids India's punitive import duties and positions itself to export to Africa and the Middle East.

The Regional Dominance Gambit

VinFast's focus on Southeast Asia is paying off. In Vietnam, it controls 90% of the EV market by bundling free charging with sales to its affiliated taxi fleet, Xanh SM. In Indonesia, it's replicated this model, capturing a 15% EV market share in 2024. Its next-gen platforms, like the EC Van (a $11,500 cargo EV) and EB 6 electric bus, aim to diversify into commercial markets, where competition is thinner.

The company's pivot to franchised dealerships in the U.S. and Europe—replacing costly direct sales—has cut operational expenses. By closing underperforming stores and partnering with local dealers like Schachtschneider in Germany, VinFast is redirecting resources to higher-growth regions.

The Risks: Delays, Losses, and Market Saturation

Despite its momentum, VinFast faces existential risks. Its $9.8 billion cumulative losses by 2024—driven by underutilized plants and weak U.S. sales—raise concerns about its ability to sustain investment. While Q1 2025 saw a 150% revenue jump to $656 million, net losses remained at $712 million.

The delayed U.S. plant in North Carolina—now pushed to 2028—highlights execution risks. Overcapacity in the EV sector could also erode margins. BYD's aggressive pricing and Tesla's brand dominance in wealthier markets leave little room for error.

Investment Considerations

VinFast's parent company, Vingroup (VIC), has pledged $1.4 billion in loans to prop up its EV arm, but this lifeline may not be enough if losses persist. Investors should watch three metrics:

1. Profitability milestones: Can VinFast break even by 2026, as promised?

2. Market share in Southeast Asia: Sustained dominance in Vietnam and Indonesia will determine long-term viability.

3. Execution in India and the Middle East: The Tamil Nadu factory's ramp-up and Middle Eastern partnerships will test VinFast's operational scalability.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Risk Gamble

VinFast's factory-driven strategy has the potential to disrupt EV markets in Asia, where affordability trumps brand prestige. Its vertical integration and localized supply chains give it a cost advantage few rivals can match. Yet, its survival hinges on turning factories into profit centers rather than cash drains.",,N,,2025-06-29 13:11:40.647842

Tesla's stock trading was initially halted and shares were volatile for weeks.","Tesla debuted on the Nasdaq 15 years ago, at a time when its only car available for sale was the Roadster.

The IPO price of $17 is equal to a split-adjusted price of $1.13 today. The stock closed on Friday at $323.63, an almost 300-fold increase.

A $10,000 investment in Tesla at the time of its 2010 IPO would now be worth almost $3 million.

At the time of Tesla's IPO 15 years ago, the company had generated roughly $150 million in revenue in its lifetime. That came almost entirely from the Roadster, a two-seat electric sportscar that boasted a range of 236 miles on a single charge.

The Model S sedan was still in the lab, two years away from hitting the market.

""The Model S, which is planned to compete in the premium vehicle market, is intended to have a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster,"" the company said in its IPO filing, ahead of its planned $226 million offering.

A bet on Tesla, which debuted on the Nasdaq on June 29, 2010, was a wager on CEO Elon Musk's ability to develop a roster of mass-market electric cars and scale an automaker far away from the Detroit auto hub, focusing instead on Silicon Valley, home to much of the world's top tech talent.

Musk didn't start Tesla, but he invested early, served as chairman and took over as CEO in October 2008, after leading a board revolt against founding CEO and inventor Martin Eberhard early that year.

An investor who put $10,000 into Tesla's stock at the time of the company's IPO and held onto all those shares would now own a stake worth close to $3 million. A similar investment at the time in the S&P 500 would have resulted in holdings worth about $57,000.

Money Report

Far removed from its days as an experimental clean-tech startup led by a member of the ""PayPal mafia,"" Tesla is now the eighth most-valuable publicly traded U.S. company, with a market cap of over $1 trillion after nearly hitting $100 billion in revenue last year.

The Roadster is largely in the history books, and the Model S is no longer of great importance to the company's bottom line. Rather, it's Tesla's top-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, along with sales of environmental regulatory credits, that helped define the company's financial success over the past decade.

But for the 54-year-old Musk (his birthday was Saturday), now the world's wealthiest person, that's the past. He's told investors that the reason to buy and own Tesla stock from here has almost nothing to do with selling cars to consumers.

""If somebody doesn't believe Tesla's going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company,"" Musk said on an earnings call in April of last year. He added, ""We will, and we are.""

Two months after that, Musk said his company's Optimus humanoid robots that he hopes some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars, could some day lift Tesla's market cap to $25 trillion.

Musk, who last year characterized himself as ""pathologically optimistic,"" has said he expects thousands of Optimus robots to be working in Tesla factories by the end of 2025, and that the company will begin selling the robot next year.

As for autonomy, Tesla currently lags behind Alphabet's Waymo, which is operating public robotaxi services in several U.S. markets, and Baidu's Apollo Go in China. Tesla's Robotaxi just launched a very limited pilot service in Austin, Texas, earlier this month, and said Friday it had completed its first driverless delivery of a new car to a customer.

While Tesla still has its share of fanatics and a largely bullish slate of analysts, Wall Street is skeptical of Musk's futuristic promises or sees them as baked into the stock price. The stock is down about 20% this year, badly underperforming major U.S. indexes and trailing all of its megacap tech peers. Apple, down 19.7% for the year, is the only one close.

Earlier in June, Tesla's vice president of Optimus robotics, Milan Kovac, said he's leaving the company after a nine-year tenure, and Musk more recently fired Omead Afshar, the automaker's vice president of manufacturing and operations.

Meanwhile, Tesla EV sales have been sluggish in 2025, with automotive revenue suffering a second straight year-over-year decline in the first quarter due to an aging lineup and bustling competition, especially from lower-cost Chinese manufacturers.

New Tesla sales in Europe fell for a fifth straight month in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, or ACEA, and Tesla's newest model, the Cybertruck, has failed to gain significant traction in the U.S. after a series of recalls.

Hovering over Tesla's business is the unpredictability of Musk.

Long glorified for his business success — through PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, brain tech startup Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI, among other pursuits — Musk asserted himself in the political realm last year, when he endorsed Donald Trump for president and subsequently injected nearly $300 million into his campaign and related Republican causes.

Musk spent the first few months of 2025 spearheading President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), slashing the size of the federal government and stripping resources from regulatory agencies, including those tasked with oversight of his companies.

But his pivot to politics came at a cost, at least in the short term.

Musk's vocal and financial support of Trump, endorsement of Germany's far-right AfD party and extended string of charged and divisive remarks and gestures, including on his social network X and in press appearances, has been correlated with declines in Tesla's reputation, and a drop in his overall favorability, according to polling data.

""Unless Tesla can come up with a whole range of new products that will really excite consumers, and unless they can mitigate some of the antagonism caused by their leader, they will be seen as past their peak and will begin to go down,"" David Haigh, CEO of research and consulting firm Brand Finance, said in January.

Brand Finance's data showed that the value of Tesla's brand fell by 26% in 2024, a second straight annual decline. That was before Musk's time working in the second Trump administration.

Musk's official tenure in Washington, D.C., ended earlier in June, just as his relationship with the president was souring. Shares of Tesla fell 14% on June 5, as President Trump threatened to pull government contracts for Musk's companies, escalating a war of words over the president's spending bill.

Musk temporarily slowed his posting about politics on social media after that, and appeared to focus more on promoting his businesses. But this weekend he resumed attacking portions of the bill that would hamper solar and renewable energy companies, including Tesla.

Whether Musk is now focused enough to solve Tesla's problems and, even if he is, whether that's a big catalyst for the company, is very much up in the air.

Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.

Tesla investors have learned that volatility is a big part of the story, and has been since the company's stock market debut. On more than 40 occasions in the past 15 years, Tesla's stock has gained or lost at least 20% in a single month.

Here are the three best and worst months for the stock and what happened to cause these hefty moves:

The good months

May 2013

In Tesla's best month on record, the stock jumped 81%. The company for the first time reported a quarterly profit, albeit a very narrow one. It didn't mark a sudden turn to profitability, as Tesla continued to lose money until 2018. But sales of Model S cars topped estimates as did revenue from zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits, which have long been a boon for the company and have sometimes been the difference between a quarter ending in the red or the black.

August 2020

Following a big dip in the early days of the Covid pandemic, Tesla's stock began an historic rally, leading to an eightfold increase in the stock in 2020, by far its best year on record. Its single best month that year was August, when the share price jumped 74%. Model 3 sales were accelerating rapidly, but much of the momentum was tied to buzz that the company could soon enter the S&P 500, and a pandemic market boom, when retail investors poured into meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and FOMO (fear of missing out) assets. Tesla's big announcement in August 2020 was a five-for-one stock split, with the share price having soared well past $1,000. Tesla would split its stock again in 2022.

November 2010

Tesla's 62% rally in its fifth full month as a public company was as much a sign of early volatility as anything else. The next month, the company would lose almost a quarter of its value, wiping out most of those gains. Tesla's cash position at the end of 2010 was precarious enough that the company warned it may need to raise more money in the future, particularly ""if there are delays in the launch of the Model S."" On Nov. 9, 2010, Tesla reported a 31% drop in year-over-year revenue to $31.2 million and a net loss of $35 million. A week earlier, the company said Panasonic had invested $30 million in Tesla through a private placement.

The bad months

December 2022

Tesla's steepest monthly slump on record was a 37% decline to wrap up 2022, which was the worst year for the Nasdaq since the 2008 financial crisis. The company faced a production halt at its Shanghai facility, which was dealing with a fresh onslaught of Covid cases. Musk had been selling Tesla stock in big chunks to fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, which he later renamed X.

Musk said on Twitter Spaces on Dec. 22 that he wouldn't be selling any stock for 18 to 24 months. In a debate with a Tesla shareholder, he pinned Tesla's declining share price on Federal Reserve rate hikes, writing that ""people will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop."" The distraction of the Twitter deal weighed on Tesla shares, and Musk also frustrated some shareholders by borrowing personnel from the Tesla Autopilot team to work on his social media company's technology.

February 2025

What was supposed to be a honeymoon period for Tesla, thanks to Trump's return to the White House, turned into a massive selloff, with the stock plummeting 28% in February. In its earnings report in late January, Tesla said automotive revenue sank 8% from a year earlier and the company reported a 23% drop in operating income. Tesla cited reduced average selling prices across its Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X lines as a major reason for the decline. Investors also worried about impending tariffs on goods and materials coming from Canada and Mexico, where some of its key suppliers are based. With Musk ramping up his political rhetoric, new vehicle registrations dropped in Europe, plummeting in Germany by around 60% in January from a year earlier.

January 2024

The beginning of 2024 was almost as bad for Tesla, with the stock tumbling 25% to open the year. The company reported revenue and profit for the fourth quarter that trailed estimates, partly because of steep price cuts around the world. Tesla warned that volume growth in 2024 ""may be notably lower"" than in 2023, and cautioned investors that it was ""currently between two major growth waves.""

There were countless other monumental moments for Tesla along the way and, had Musk gotten his wish in 2018, the IPO anniversary may have never taken place.

""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,"" Musk infamously tweeted in August of that year. Tesla's stock trading was initially halted and shares were volatile for weeks. A take-private never occurred.

The SEC investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of the tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charges. The agreement forced Musk to temporarily relinquish his role as chairman of the Tesla board, a position that's now held by Robyn Denholm.",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2025/06/108165341-1751051384558-2010-06-29T000000Z_1666896168_GM1E66U028S01_RTRMADP_3_TESLA-IPO.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-06-29 08:05:36.578860

It’s record-breaking hot today (June 23) and PJM, the electric grid operator in our area, is presently getting less than 8% of its power from solar plants and less than 2% from wind farms. That’s not because power generation companies don’t care about the environment; Texas is presently generating about 30% of its electricity from solar and wind. It’s because we live in a low-wind region, and latitude matters for solar power. The message is that we should do what we can, where and when we can; the laws of physics trump ideological purity.

That didn’t stop Maryland from passing in 2022 the Climate Solutions Now Act, which mandates a 60% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2031 and net-zero emissions by 2045. How can they do this? Easy — shut down their generation stations and build new transmission lines to draw power from evil old Pennsylvania, which continues to burn coal, oil and natural gas in great quantities. This creates shortages, which drive up the cost of power, allowing Pennsylvanians to share with Marylanders the virtuous thrill of paying high electric bills. Thanks, greenies.

Congress should invoke war powers

I respectfully urge Congress to invoke the War Powers Resolution of 1973 and fully assume its constitutional responsibilities regarding acts of war.

Even during the lead-up to the Iraq War, President George W. Bush presented a case — albeit flawed — through Secretary of State Colin Powell to both the American people and the United Nations. Today, we are witnessing echoes of that moment. As history has shown, there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the assurances made at the time.

Now, there are similar claims being made about Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Before any further steps are taken, we, the people — and the world — deserve to see clear, independently verified evidence. The consequences of military action are profound, and decisions of such magnitude must be grounded in truth and made with full congressional oversight, as required by the Constitution.

Please stand up for democratic accountability and ensure that any move toward conflict is subject to open debate, scrutiny and public transparency.

Is history repeating itself?

It is said if we don’t learn from our past mistakes, history will repeat itself. I am old enough to remember World War II and I feel that history is repeating itself when I see masked, armed men abducting people off the street because of the way they look, or because they are using their First Amendment right of free speech. This was how the Gestapo operated in Germany. Is this country turning into a dictatorship, run by self-serving politicians and billionaires? Please, no matter what political party you are in favor of, let us exercise our humanity, use common sense and human dignity to treat each other as people with rights as outlined in the Constitution. If you are upset with the way things are going, write, email or call your local elected officials and let your voice and concerns be known. You have heard that for evil to exist requires good men to do nothing. Many prayers for this country.

Keep clean energy tax credits

Andrew Seidman’s article in the June 22 edition of The Morning CalI explained it well. If Congress repeals or quickly phases out clean energy tax credits in the reconciliation bill before the Senate, it would hurt the economy and consumers in Pennsylvania and nationwide. That risks losing $1.3 billion in private investment and thousands of good paying jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

Sen. John Fetterman already said he is opposed to the bill. Sen. Dave McCormick should also reject the Trump agenda and support good business and energy policy by voting not to repeal these valuable credits that are delivering real economic value and are good for the country and good for the environment.

U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie initially signed a letter, along with 20 other house Republicans, to the chair of the Ways and Means Committee calling for the preservation of the clean energy tax credits in the House bill. Yet, when it came to a floor vote, he caved and voted to eliminate them.

Tax credits spur investment in a wide range of projects by allowing businesses to plan for the long term. These credits also help reduce our greenhouse gas pollution, cut energy costs and inspire technological innovation.

I urge Sen. McCormick to do what is right for Pennsylvania

Trump violates inauguration promise

In his inauguration speech Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump stated, “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars we end — and perhaps most importantly by the wars we never get into.” Based on this assessment and the recent bombing of Iran, success is rapidly slipping away from this administration.

Alzheimer’s research needs funding

I write to thank U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie for hearing from Alzheimer’s Association advocates during our recent visit to Washington. We appreciated the opportunity to share our stories and the urgent need for congressional action to address the Alzheimer’s crisis.

More than 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, and there are over 12 million family caregivers. Families across the country are struggling with the emotional, physical and financial toll of the disease. That’s why we’re asking Congressman Mackenzie to co-sponsor the ASAP Act and the AADAPT Act — two bipartisan bills that would help improve care and expand access to diagnosis.

We also urge him to continue supporting strong federal funding for Alzheimer’s and dementia research. Every dollar invested brings us closer to breakthroughs that could change — and save — millions of lives.

Mike DeWine to use his line-item veto authority to strike out parts of a recently passed budget.

Attorney General Dave Yost has already expressed displeasure about plans to funnel $600 million in taxpayer money to the Cleveland Browns for a new stadium. Now, Senate Democrats have sent a letter that asks for 27 items to be vetoed.

“This veto letter includes items that we believe are not in the best interest of all Ohioans,” said Senate Democrat Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood. “We have asked the governor to consider line-item vetoing them. I am hopeful that he will give thoughtful consideration to each and every item.”

At the top of the list is the Republican plan to use individual taxpayers’ money in unclaimed funds and give them to the Browns for a stadium in Brook Park.

J.C. Bradbury, one of the nation’s leading economists who has studied and published reports on taxpayer-funded sports stadiums, called the plan “willful ignorance” and said promised benefits rarely, if ever, turn into reality because it diverts spending from other areas.

Democrats want to follow DeWine’s original plan of increasing taxes on sports gambling in the state and using the new revenue to develop a fund for stadiums and other sports needs.

Republicans, in their budget, also included a provision that would force state school board and local school board candidates to run under a party affiliation. Currently, those elections are nonpartisan.

“Education is not a partisan, political issue, however this provision, by requiring political affiliations for school board candidates, makes education a partisan and political issue,” the letter reads. “We are concerned that making school board races partisan could restrict who can run due to their employment with state, federal or nonprofit entities. If we want our schools to be represented well, we should not add requirements that make it harder to run.”

Democrats are also pushing for line-item vetoes in areas such as Medicaid restrictions, public library restrictions, a public records exemption for legislators, repeal of the sales tax exemption for newspapers, limits on the amount of money schools can save, elimination of allowable tax levies and a 20-mill minimum levy, requiring health care providers to collect and report abortion data, the recognition of only two sexes, and several other areas.",https://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.timesleaderonline.com/images/2016/08/19083536/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 12:13:15.332928

Natural gas is presented as the most reliable and affordable option for baseload power, despite the growth of renewables.

Wisconsin's approval of new natural gas plants aims to address the gap between rising energy demands and retiring power sources.

The article argues that states with ambitious climate goals often experience higher electricity prices, while those relying on natural gas see lower bills and emissions.

Over 80% of Americans use some kind of AI-enabled product weekly. Widespread AI usage is not on the horizon, or somewhere off in the future – it is here, and it is growing.

Data center development here in Wisconsin is also exploding, with investments in Mt. Pleasant, Kenosha, Port Washington, Beaver Dam, and Wisconsin Rapids, as tech companies race to expand their infrastructure and meet surging demand.

But the jobs, economic development, and technological progress associated with this growth could be at risk if new baseload electricity generation is not brought online, and soon.

Regulatory changes are causing baseload power generation sources like coal plants to retire and close. Power needs can often rise much more quickly than new generation can be brought online – data centers can be built in as little as two years, while siting, permitting, and building sufficient capacity to support them often takes a decade or more.

Making intelligent investments in the grid to plan ahead is one of the most urgent issues facing Wisconsin’s economy, to ensure there is enough slack in the system to accommodate new development.

Natural gas plants best bet for reliable power needs

While renewables are continuing to evolve, the future of reliable baseload power in Wisconsin will depend on natural gas. Natural gas is already the largest single fuel source in this country, accounting for roughly 43% of U.S. utility-scale generation last year, and about 27 gigawatts of new natural gas generation is expected to be built by 2030.

Unfortunately, approximately 79 gigawatts of baseload power is also likely to retire by 2034. In other words: we simply do not have enough power generation to meet the combined threat of expected retirements and growing demand. If we don’t act, coal plants will likely be kept online well past their planned closure dates, leading to higher emissions and leaving our grid stuck in the past.

Thankfully, states like Wisconsin are recognizing this looming problem and are taking steps to address it. The Wisconsin Public Service Commission recently gave unanimous approval to two new natural-gas-fired power plants as part of a $1.8 billion project from We Energies.

The project includes a new facility in Oak Creek to help replace the retiring coal-powered Oak Creek Power Plant, as well as a new gas plant in Kenosha County. It also adds liquefied natural gas storage and expanded pipeline infrastructure.

Ambitious climate goals often lead to higher electric bills

Crucially, this new generation capacity will be dispatchable, meaning it can be turned on when needed. That flexibility is essential to support critical industries, data centers, and advanced manufacturing, where consistent, around-the-clock power is not an option.

Consumers, businesses, and families in Wisconsin need reliable and affordable energy now. Natural gas costs have remained low or even fallen, while electricity prices continue to rise. In fact, states with more aggressive climate goals have often seen their electricity prices rise dramatically, while those powered by natural gas have simultaneously seen lower bills and falling emissions.

Wisconsin must not be caught flat-footed, and the future of the state’s economy depends on getting power generation right. That means approving and building new natural gas capacity now, not once power bills skyrocket and the lights start to flicker.

Renewable Energy Senate Republicans moved up a cut-off for tax credits used for wind and solar projects even earlier then they initially proposed, amid pushback on the credits from Trump.","Vice President JD Vance and Senate Republican leaders worked late Saturday to persuade reluctant holdouts to back President Donald Trump’s multi-trillion dollar tax and spending bill.

After a day of arm-twisting, Majority Leader John Thune called a pivotal procedural vote, which quickly drew three Republican “no” votes while several others remained undecided as the vote was held open.

Vance, who would break a tie, met on the floor and in Thune’s office with holdouts, eventually helping to persuade Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski to support advancing the bill. But three others — Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Rick Scott of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah — had not cast their votes.

The lobbying, which included Trump golfing with frequent foe Rand Paul and other senators, came as the party worked to rush the bill to the president’s desk ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Senate Republicans unveiled a new version of their $4.2 trillion tax cut package early Saturday that adjusts key provisions on the SALT deduction, Medicaid and clean energy.

The new draft reflects compromises among warring factions of the Senate GOP, which has been divided over how much to cut safety-net programs such as Medicaid and how rapidly to phase out renewable energy tax credits enacted under the Biden administration.

Thune has said he plans for his chamber to hold a final vote on the bill as soon as early Sunday. Democrats, however, are threatening to force the bill be read on the floor, which would likely push the final vote to Monday.

Party leaders plan to bring House members back to Washington early next week for what they hope will be final approval of the measure in time for Trump’s Independence Day deadline.

It is not yet clear if the 50 Senate Republicans needed to pass the bill are all on board. The bill can be further altered on the Senate floor to secure the votes if needed. The House could also make more changes if Speaker Mike Johnson has trouble corralling votes for the measure.

But Paul, as well as Senators Ron Johnson and Thom Tillis , voted against starting debate on the bill.

“This is an important bill,” Johnson said. “There’s no need to rush it.”

Johnson, however, was later among the senators meeting in Thune’s office. He left open the possibility he could reverse his vote.

Montana’s Tim Sheehy briefly threatened to block the bill before Thune offered him an amendment vote to strip out public land sales from the bill.

SALT Deduction

A tentative deal with House Republicans to increase the state and local tax deduction is included. The bill would raise the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years before snapping back to the $10,000 level. The new cap applies to 2025 and rises 1% in subsequent years.

The ability to claim the full SALT amount would phase out for those making more than $500,000 per year. A House attempt to curb the ability of pass-though businesses to circumvent the SALT cap was removed from the text.

The deal has the support of most members of the House SALT caucus of Republicans from high-tax swing districts. While decried by conservatives for costing hundreds of billions of dollars, it has the blessing of the White House.

Senate Republicans also deleted a Section 899 “revenge tax” on some foreign companies and investors that had spooked Wall Street, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested the change.

The Senate measure makes permanent individual and business tax breaks enacted in 2017, while adding temporary new breaks for tipped and overtime workers, seniors and car buyers.

Medicaid Changes

To win over moderate Republicans, the bill would create a new $25 billion rural hospital fund aimed at helping mitigate the impact of Medicaid cuts, which otherwise could force some rural providers to shut down.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, however, had demanded a $100 billion fund.

Moderate Republicans also won a delay from 2031 to 2032 on the full impact of a new 3.5% cap on state Medicaid provider taxes. States often use these taxes, within some already existing rules, to draw down federal funding and increase payments to facilities like hospitals. Limits on the Medicaid funding mechanism would begin phasing in in 2028.

The cap on provider taxes would only apply to states that expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 40 states and the District of Columbia have done so.

The House-passed version of the bill proposed a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the federal government more than $89 billion over the next decade.

The measure also would impose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients and require Medicaid beneficiaries who gained eligibility through the Affordable Care Act to pay a share of their costs through charges such as co-pays and deductibles.

Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had criticized the cuts to Medicaid as too deep, said the changes were enough to gain his support while Collins said she “would lean against the bill” without more concessions, but would vote to begin debate.

Renewable Energy

Senate Republicans moved up a cut-off for tax credits used for wind and solar projects even earlier then they initially proposed, amid pushback on the credits from Trump. The new measure requires those projects to be “placed in service” by the end of 2027 to receive the incentives, as opposed to simply being under construction by that time.

The change, if it makes into law, could be a blow to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects. But the energy tweaks may help get holdout GOP Senator Mike Lee to vote for the bill.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Americans in a social media post that Republicans’ plan to phase out the clean energy tax breaks would “jack up your electric bills and jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs.”

Senate Republicans also would alter an existing clean energy tax credit so that it would also cover production of metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making.

The new Senate legislation would end a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles by Sept. 30, earlier than in the prior drafts. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.

The bill would slash funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut federal payments to states for food stamps and boost funds for a US-Mexico border wall among other things.

The version drops a provision explicitly terminating the IRS-run free electronic filing Direct File program, a loss for TurboTax maker Intuit Inc. But the legislation keeps in a $15 million pot of funding that creates a task force to study replacing the free electronic filing program.

The bill would alter a proposed new tax on some remittances by non-citizens, lowering it from 3.5% in earlier versions to 1%, in a win for Western Union and Moneygram.

The measure would avert a US payment default as soon as August by raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

In Pennsylvania, that means about $112 million of the $171.5 million allocated to the state for charging stations remains in limbo.
But Friday’s ruling from the Supreme Court limiting the scope of district court rulings and an expected appeal from the Trump administration are likely to lead to more delays.
“We continue to support our active projects, and we are preparing for when we can obligate NEVI funds again,” Appleby said in an email.","A federal judge in Seattle ordered the Trump administration last week to release the remaining federal funds to build a nationwide system of electrical vehicle charging stations, but it isn’t clear how that might affect Pennsylvania.

That’s not only because the state wasn’t among 17 that filed suit for the release of the funds but also because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling later in the week that limits the scope of orders issued in one jurisdiction. In a case challenging the administration’s ability to deport the children of immigrants born in the U.S., the Supreme Court ruled Friday that federal district court judges can only issue injunctions that apply in their district, not across the country.

In February, the U.S. Department of Transportation, under orders from President Donald Trump, stopped distribution of the remaining funds from a $5 billion allocation known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program, which had been included in former President Joe Biden’s economic recovery plan. Biden’s plan called for a national network of charging stations every 50 miles along interstate highways and other high-traffic corridors to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles, reduce pollution and spur manufacturing of materials for electric vehicles and charging stations.

Trump, who doesn’t support the environmental and manufacturing goals of the program, paused distribution of money already awarded to states and ordered the department to review whether the program meets the policies of his administration. That review was supposed to have been completed by spring, but states haven’t received any additional communication about it.

In Pennsylvania, that means about $112 million of the $171.5 million allocated to the state for charging stations remains in limbo. The state has contracts for 90 active projects worth about $59 million, PennDOT spokesman Zachary Appleby said.

Once those 90 are open, he said, the state will have met the requirement of filling gaps in what were dubbed “alternative fuel corridors.”

The state last week announced six more charging stations have opened across the state, bringing the total number of NEVI stations to 17, second most in the country. Four of those sites are in the western part of the state: Penn Place Shopping Plaza in Monroeville; Sheetz on Route 224 near New Castle; Love’s Travel Shop along Interstate 80 in Brookville; and Giant Eagle near the Meadville interchange on Interstate 79.

In a news release, PennDOT said the state’s NEVI stations have provided 17,400 charging sessions, powering more than 2 million miles driven and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 950,000 pounds.

“The Shapiro administration is working quickly — getting hardworking tradesmen and women on the job and opening more EV charging stations than almost every other state — making Pennsylvania a national leader on NEVI,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. “The rollout of EV charging stations in the commonwealth is moving along at speed, and we’re excited to make clean transportation more accessible for Pennsylvania travelers.”

The ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle said the Trump administration had “overstepped their Constitutional and statutory authority” and had “attempted to override the express will of Congress” by freezing the grant money. She ordered the program to be reinstated beginning Wednesday.

But Friday’s ruling from the Supreme Court limiting the scope of district court rulings and an expected appeal from the Trump administration are likely to lead to more delays.

Appleby declined comment on the injunction ruling.

“We continue to support our active projects, and we are preparing for when we can obligate NEVI funds again,” Appleby said in an email. “We are currently evaluating the impact and next steps of the preliminary injunction.”",https://www.unionprogress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shrine20230620-209-o25gbk.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 08:05:40.289284

A new lithium-ion battery plant, a joint effort between an Indonesian company and China's CATL, is set to become operational by the end of 2026, boasting an initial capacity of 6.9 gigawatt hours. The development was reported by Reuters here. According to the energy ministry spokeswoman Dwi Anggia, the facility's production is expected to expand to electric vehicle batteries with storage capacity reaching up to 15 GWh, catering to both domestic and international markets.

This venture is part of a $6 billion power battery project signed in 2022, involving Indonesia Battery Corp and the Chinese giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. The partnership, which includes Indonesian state-miner PT Aneka Tambang Tbk, encompasses nickel mining and processing, EV battery manufacturing, and battery recycling. The plant, located in West Java, is a key component of Indonesia's strategy to leverage its abundant nickel reserves, the largest in the world, to bolster its electric vehicle industry.

Indonesian Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia highlighted during the project's groundbreaking ceremony that the plant might also produce batteries designed to store energy from solar panels. He noted that with this addition, the total production capacity could reach up to 40 GWh. Discussions with project owners are ongoing to finalize these plans.

The Indonesian government has set a target to produce approximately 600,000 electric vehicles by 2030, a significant increase from the number sold last year. The country's strategic initiatives in battery manufacturing are expected to play a crucial role in achieving this goal, supported by data from the IndexBox platform indicating a robust growth trajectory in the EV sector.

Hybrid wind-solar battery swapping stations with battery storage systems to store the power generated are technically and economically feasible.
If this market starts using electric vehicles, they’ll need battery swapping stations to stay on the road all day.","Petrol and diesel vehicles are being phased out globally and replaced with electric vehicles so that countries can meet their commitments to zero human-caused carbon emissions by 2050. But electric vehicles’ batteries run down quickly and take a long time to recharge. One solution is battery swapping systems, where depleted batteries can be swapped for fully charged batteries, putting electric vehicle drivers back on the road faster than it would have taken them to fill up with petrol. Lumbumba Taty-Etienne Nyamayoka is a researcher and PhD candidate with the Future Electrical Energy Technology Research Group at the University of the Witwatersrand. His research looked at the best way to set up battery swapping systems powered by solar and wind energy.

What are the limitations of electric vehicle batteries?

Electric vehicle batteries have a limited driving range, depending on the type of vehicle, battery capacity and usage conditions. Their charging time is very slow – several hours to charge at home and longer at a public charging station than it takes to refuel a conventional car. Also, electric vehicle charging stations in South Africa are not as widespread as petrol stations.

The battery performance also decreases with age and use. This means the vehicles can’t travel up to 500 kilometres on a single charge, as they can with a new battery, or reach fast speeds. The older the battery, the longer it takes to charge. The batteries are also affected by extreme heat or cold. Thermal management systems that protect against this are expensive.

Electric vehicle batteries are expensive. In South Africa, they can cost between R100,000 and R400,000 (US$5,630 to US$22,523), whereas petrol car batteries can cost as little as R3,500 (US$197). Prices are falling but the high costs are still off-putting.

Finally, an electric vehicle battery pack weighs an average of 454kg and takes up between 100 litres and 200 litres of space in a car, depending on the model. This is a problem for smaller cars.

How can electric vehicle battery swapping stations help?

Instead of stopping on a long trip to spend hours charging their car’s battery, drivers need only drive up to the swapping station and get a new battery. This is very quick and easy, especially for delivery motorbikes, trucks, buses or taxis that need to be on the road all day. (Battery swapping stations need to keep multiple types and ages of batteries so that motorists can swap batteries for those of the same age and quality.)

Battery swapping stations also help electric vehicle owners because they don’t use fast charging methods which generate high heat and place strain on the battery. Instead, the stations charge electric vehicle batteries slowly, off-site. This extends the battery lifespan.

Some battery swapping stations are already established in Africa – mainly for electric motorbikes – in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria and South Africa, but they exist in larger numbers in China, the US and Taiwan.

In fact, battery swapping stations can help the electric vehicle market grow by giving people confidence that they’ll always be able to charge an electric car if they buy one.

Where do wind and solar power come in?

Battery swapping stations should be powered by wind and solar renewable energy systems so that motorists are not charging environmentally friendly electric vehicles with electricity produced by burning coal. Just over 74% of South Africa’s electricity is currently generated by burning coal.

My research found that a renewable energy system made up of 64 wind turbines and 402 solar photovoltaic panels can power a moderately sized swapping station – one that replaces approximately 50 to 200 electric vehicle batteries daily.

To set one of these up costs just under R2 million (US$112,000). In my case study, this amount covers the total life cycle cost. This includes the initial capital investment, installation, operation and maintenance, and replacement costs over the system’s lifetime of 20–25 years. Battery swapping stations of different sizes would cost a different amount.

These costs could be recouped by investors within five and a half years, based on projected energy savings and operational revenues from 50-200 swaps per day. After the payback period, the system would generate profit through continued cost savings on electricity, revenue from electric vehicle users, and by earning money from feeding electricity into the grid.

Hybrid wind-solar battery swapping stations with battery storage systems to store the power generated are technically and economically feasible.

Few people drive electric vehicles in South Africa. Do we really need battery swapping stations?

Electric vehicle battery swapping stations are necessary from an early planning and infrastructure development perspective. Electric vehicle uptake is still growing, but is gaining momentum in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa.

For example, major South African courier and trucking companies are starting to convert their truck fleets to electric.

The high number of minibus taxis and buses on South African roads contributes significantly to urban air pollution, especially in densely populated areas. If this market starts using electric vehicles, they’ll need battery swapping stations to stay on the road all day.

By starting now, South Africa can build out its electric vehicle ecosystem so that it lines up with the country’s energy goals — without overcommitting resources too early, but by making sure it is ready when demand accelerates.

What needs to happen next?

A demonstration project of 64 wind turbines and 402 solar panels should be built. This should be tested over different periods so that we can see how a wind and solar powered battery storage system would perform in different weather conditions.

The government must also do some future projections of the costs of battery storage system parts, their lifespans, and the tariffs that might make them more expensive. This data will help guide investors.

Advanced forecasting techniques (such as machine learning or time-series models) are needed to predict load demand and renewable generation. This can be used to improve the model.

Policies must be developed to see how tax credits, subsidies and carbon credits could be used to make it cheaper for business to set up battery swapping stations.

Regulations are also needed to encourage electric vehicle charging stations to be based on hybrid wind and solar renewable energy.

Battery swapping systems do not need to be rolled out nationwide immediately. Instead, a phased approach can focus on places where electric vehicle activity is most concentrated.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/673644/original/file-20250611-56-k5l9se.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C1023%2C4128%2C2064&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-29 08:04:57.501652

The partnership agreement, signed by World Bank Group President Ajay Banga and IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, formalizes multiple engagements between the two institutions over the last year, and marks the World Bank Group’s first concrete step to reengage with nuclear power in decades.

The agreement also reflects a new, broader approach by the World Bank Group to electrification—one that prioritizes accessibility, affordability, and reliability, while managing emissions responsibly. With electricity demand in developing countries expected to more than double by 2035, this approach aims to help countries deliver the energy people need by enabling pathways that best fit their national context, including development objectives and Nationally Determined Contributions.

Nuclear energy provides continuous baseload power, enhancing grid stability and resilience. Reliable baseload electricity is essential for job-generating sectors such as infrastructure, agribusiness, healthcare, tourism, and manufacturing. Nuclear power is also a source of high-skilled employment and stimulates investment across the broader economy. In addition, it can adjust to changes in electricity demand and support frequency regulation, enabling greater integration of variable renewable energy sources.

“Jobs need electricity. So do factories, hospitals, schools, and water systems. And as demand surges—with AI and development alike—we must help countries deliver reliable, affordable power. That’s why we’re embracing nuclear energy as part of the solution—and reembracing it as part of the mix the World Bank Group can offer developing countries to achieve their ambitions. Importantly, nuclear delivers baseload power, which is essential to building modern economies,” said World Bank Group President Ajay Banga. “Our partnership with the IAEA marks an important step, and I’m grateful to Rafael for his personal commitment and leadership in making this possible. Together, we’ll deepen our expertise, support countries that choose nuclear, and ensure that safety, security, and sustainability guide every step forward.”

“Today’s agreement is a milestone and the result of a year of joint work since President Ajay Banga kindly invited me to the World Bank Group Executive Board in Washington in June of last year,” IAEA Director General Grossi said.“This landmark partnership, yet another sign of the world’s return to realism on nuclear power, opens the door for other multilateral development banks and private investors to consider nuclear as a viable tool for energy security and sustainable prosperity. Together, we can help more people build a better future.”

Under the memorandum of understanding signed today, the IAEA will work with the World Bank Group in three key areas:

Build knowledge related to the nuclear field: Expand the World Bank Group’s understanding of nuclear safety, security, safeguards, energy planning, new technologies, fuel cycles, reactor lifecycles, and waste management.

Extend the lifespan of existing nuclear power plants: Support developing countries in safely extending the life of existing nuclear reactors-one of the most cost-effective sources of low-carbon power-as many global reactors near the end of their original 40-year design life.

Advance SMRs: Accelerate the development of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer flexible deployment, lower upfront costs, and potential for wide adoption in developing economies.

Thirty-one countries currently operate nuclear power plants, which combined produce about 9% of the world’s electricity, amounting to almost a quarter of all low-carbon power globally. More than 30 other countries, most of them in the developing world, are considering or already embarking on the introduction of nuclear power and are working with the IAEA to develop the necessary infrastructure to do so safely, securely and sustainably.

“SMRs have great potential to cleanly and reliably power progress and fight poverty, but financing remains a roadblock,” Director General Grossi said. “Today’s agreement is a crucial first step to clearing that path.”",https://www.greenbuildingafrica.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IAEA-Worldbank-.jpeg,N,,2025-06-29 13:09:35.026609

RED SPRINGS —Early one evening this April, Kim Overstreet had just turned off the stove when she heard a boom. The panel box in the kitchen swung open and fuses shot out of their holders, bouncing off the fridge.

Less than a block away, Debra Duncan’s robot vacuum bolted off its charging station toward her, trailed by a blue flame.

In a home across the street, a light bulb exploded near a teenage boy, showering him in glass shards. “It frightened him so severely that he believed he had been shot,” one of his parents later wrote to town officials. It was the third power surge at the property in six months, they said.

These homes were among roughly 40 in Red Springs, a Robeson County town of 3,000, that were damaged by power surges on April 7. Residents lost appliances collectively worth tens of thousands of dollars: televisions, stoves and microwaves, washers and dryers, refrigerators, coffeemakers, HVAC systems, dishwashers, generators. Even surge protectors could not handle the voltage coursing through the electrical systems.

Officials with the town of Red Springs, which owns and operates its electric utility, have refused to cover the damages. They attribute the surge to the severe storms passing through that afternoon.

“We are deeming these losses as the result of Acts of God and were beyond the town’s control,” Town Manager Shanelle Harris wrote in an announcement on the Red Springs website April 17. “The power surges were not the result of lack of maintenance to the utility system or negligence. Our system meets modern, acceptable standards and the poles are annually inspected.”

Yet public documents and interviews show the Red Springs electric system is in disrepair. There isn’t enough money to cover major improvements, according to financial documents, in part because the town has used proceeds from its electric fund to float other government operations.

Red Springs is one of roughly 70 municipalities statewide that own and operate their own utilities. The town buys power from Duke Energy, but is responsible for the maintenance, improvements and operation of electrical lines, transformers and poles. It also sets rates and collects payments from customers.

Audits by the town’s accounting firm filed with the Local Government Commission, a division of the state treasurer’s office, reveal Red Springs routinely used customer payments deposited in the electric fund to fill gaps in the general fund, which covers day-to-day town operations, such as payroll.

State law allows municipalities to transfer those funds, but the amounts are capped, based on a percentage of the electric department’s gross annual revenues, or gross capital assets, for the previous year.

The state established those limits to “ensure electric funds are not being used to support municipalities’ general operations,” according to the town’s most recent audit.

In 2022 and 2023, the electric fund covered several months of health insurance premiums for some employees who did not work for the Electrical Department, including the town manager and the town clerk. The fund also covered a vacation payout for then-town manager David Ashburn when he retired in the spring of 2023.

“This practice has been stopped,” the town wrote to the Local Government Commission in response to the 2023 audit.

But a June 2024 audit showed Red Springs had transferred nearly $348,000 from the electric fund to plug holes in the general fund over the previous year. That amount was $101,000 more than the limit.

Since that audit, the town has reduced those transfer amounts well below the legal threshold, Red Springs’ Harris told Inside Climate News.

However, records show that even transfers within legal limits have significantly drained the electric fund.

The fund had an operating loss of more than $239,000 in fiscal year 2022, according to public documents. “This is largely due to the amount of subsidy provided to the General Fund, and inflation related to operating materials,” town officials wrote at the time.

In fiscal year 2021, electric capital reserves contributed $164,000 to the general fund; a second town account, the electric fund, transferred $176,000 to the water and sewer fund.

The storm and the power surges

Harris, who had been town manager for six months at the time of the April surges, wrote on the Red Springs website a storm with high winds caused electric lines to cross or “slap” at an intersection downtown.

A storm did pass through Red Springs that day. The first surge occurred at 2 p.m., and blew parts of Duncan’s meter base 10 feet, where they landed near an azalea bush.

Although the weather was calm, neighborhood residents said, a second surge occurred around 7 p.m., and destroyed their appliances.

Harris said the second surge happened when Duke Energy tripped a breaker at its substation. A Duke Energy spokesman told Inside Climate News that some of its Robeson County customers experienced storm-related outages at 2 p.m. and again at 7 p.m. after a tree fell on a line. He could not confirm whether a breaker had been tripped.

After the second surge, Overstreet said she called the town dispatch and told them she needed to speak to someone as soon as possible. Electric department workers then arrived at her home.

She and her husband noticed the wires leading from a pole to the top of the house had come loose.

“Every time we have an outage, it’s that transformer. They come out and fix it,” but the repairs don’t last, Overstreet said.

The Overstreets have experienced problems with the electrical system, and in one case, the town’s insurance covered it. In 2013, a voltage issue affected the fridge, Overstreet said. A receipt from that time shows the town paid $1,055 for “property damage.”

Harris also attributed the widespread damage to electrical problems within individual homes. When town staff replaced damaged meters, she wrote, “some customers were advised their homes had outdated meter bases that weren’t … properly grounded, old panel boxes or faulty wiring.”

Overstreet’s home was built in the 1940s, but she said her meter had been updated. Workers who came to the house after the surge did not go inside to check the wiring, she said, nor did they comment on the age of her meter.

The former employee’s account matches comments Red Springs has provided to the Office of State Budget and Management. Two years ago, the town received a $1 million grant, half of which was supposed to cover electrical upgrades. To receive the funds, the town had to submit a scope of work document.

According to that document, “a much-needed electric utility upgrade is converting areas of town from 4 kVA power to 24 kVA power.”

A kilovolt-ampere, or kVA, is a unit of measurement that indicates the total energy supplied to an electrical system. When an energy load is unbalanced, equipment can overheat, fail, increase power consumption and degrade the overall performance of the system.

Red Springs would also “assess low-voltage areas and a full upgrade,” the town wrote, “and eliminate an obsolete substation and improve lines and infrastructure.”

The town received the grant in February 2025, according to an Office of State Budget and Management spokesperson, but has not yet reported any expenses.

The town’s electric fund is more solvent now because rate increases “provided significant revenues to the once-struggling fund,” according to a proposed town budget presented to the commissioners in early June. The budget calls for $210,000, within the legal limit, to be transferred to the general fund.

Earlier this month, Overstreet spoke before the town commissioners and told them the April 7 power surge could have been handled differently. “Even if you would have told us to give you a list of the things we lost, and to tell you what happened to us that day,” she said. “A little bit of respect and compassion goes a long way.”

The Overstreets did file a claim with their insurance company and received a small sum to replace the food in their burned-out refrigerator. A dryer also had to be replaced, but insurance did not cover that. Overstreet estimates the family has spent $5,000 out of pocket on new appliances and light fixtures.

“We pay the town, we entrust our safety to the town,” she said. “When I lay down at night, I used to feel reassured that they have my safety as their first interest. Now I don’t feel that at all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Red-Springs-town-hall-Inside-Climate-News.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 11:10:06.460064

Clean energy workforce

The Tribune’s recent article on clean-energy job training rightly highlights the need for stronger career pathways for underserved communities and the importance of preparing Illinois’ workforce for a climate-friendly future. We’re proud that labor is not only part of this critical transition but also helping lead it.

Illinois’ landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) set a national example by tying climate action to economic justice, including the statewide network of workforce development programs that prioritize Black, Latino and other equity-eligible communities historically left out of energy careers.

Crucially, it was Illinois’ labor movement that helped secure landmark labor provisions in CEJA — including requirements for prevailing wages, project labor agreements and high-road labor standards for utility-scale projects — ensuring clean energy jobs are good jobs. These standards raise the bar for equity, quality and safety across the industry.

Climate Jobs Illinois, in partnership with HIRE360 and unions across the state, is investing in clean energy workforce programs that open doors for equity-eligible communities. Backed by CEJA, these programs are more than job training — they’re launching pads for long-term, family-sustaining careers in solar, wind, electric vehicle infrastructure and energy efficiency.

Through the Climate Works Pre-Apprenticeship Program, participants receive:

Industry-recognized credentials and licenses.

Exposure to over 30 union construction trades.

Stipends and financial support during training.

Site visits and mentorship from skilled professionals.

This is how Illinois makes a just transition real — by putting people to work in the communities that need it most, with the skills and protections to build and sustain the state’s clean energy future.

Heat and air pollution

Regarding the June 27 Nation & World article “Heat dome brings ‘double whammy’”: I never understand why politicians continue to ignore the facts when it comes to the health and well-being of American citizens. The evidence is overwhelming that links extreme heat and air pollution to climate change.

As the article states: “Researchers are worried about the twin health hazards of extreme heat and pollution, which can amplify each other. As climate change drives up global temperatures past record levels, the frequency of days when it is both hot and polluted has also been increasing.”

As someone with respiratory issues, I live with this double whammy, and it’s only gotten worse over the years as politicians ignore this fact. They pass energy policy that only worsens this impact.

As the article points out, “the (Donald) Trump administration is moving to weaken limits on emissions from power plants and cars, which could increase carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and other pollutants. It is also encouraging more mining and burning of coal, the dirtiest of the fossil fuels.”

The article also states: “The World Health Organization estimates that outdoor and indoor air pollution combined cause 6.7 million premature deaths a year.” And: “A 2023 analysis of more than 20 million deaths around the world found that hot days and days with bad air quality both resulted in higher-than-normal mortality rates. But periods in which heat and pollution are combined were even deadlier.”

Don’t Republican politicians care about people’s health?

Ironically, I recently sat in on a webinar given by a leading energy professor and scientist on the state of renewable energy, highlighting that we have the technology and know-how to reverse course on this double whammy. Unfortunately, it’s apparent we don’t have the will or desire to take appropriate action.

As a result, I’ll be forced to spend more time indoors this summer and future summers, suffering the consequences of these politicians’ apathy toward human health.

Solutions for CTA, CPS

Two recent Tribune pieces — an article highlighting Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates’ call to prioritize district contracts (“CTU president rebukes Trump administration, urges district to prioritize union contract,” June 24) and an op-ed co-written by CTU Vice President Jackson Potter advocating for increased funding for public education and transit (“Public education and transit benefit Chicagoans but aren’t being fully funded,” June 24) — raise critical issues but miss the mark on solutions.

Both suggest massive new spending, funded by higher taxes on Chicago and Illinois residents. While I agree that our public schools and transit system need significant improvements, I strongly disagree that more taxes are the answer.

Chicago Public Schools already has sufficient funds to support its shrinking student population. With 47 schools operating at less than one-third capacity, consolidation could free up resources to enhance remaining schools, rather than burdening taxpayers further.

Similarly, our transit system — the CTA, Pace and Metra — needs an overhaul, but not through costly projects like the $1 billion-per-mile Red Line expansion. Instead, merging these agencies into a single, efficient unit with unified fares and coordinated schedules could cut administrative costs and improve service.

Chicago and Illinois don’t have a taxing problem; we have a spending problem. Let’s prioritize efficiency and innovation over endless tax hikes.

— Dean Gerber, Chicago

CTA needs real leader

The CTA appears to be on life support and needs a new president who has extensive experience running mass transit systems, someone who actually rides the trains and buses, unlike the recently departed Dorval Carter Jr. and current members of the CTA board. The mayor claimed his administration conducted a national search for a CTA president but apparently didn’t do that, according to the Tribune’s June 20 edition (“Records show mayor didn’t conduct formal national search for CTA head”).

The mayor could install one of his cronies who has no experience in running a large transit agency like the CTA. That would be a big mistake at a time when the CTA needs solid, experienced leadership.

Access to test prep

When I decided to study prelaw at the University of Illinois at Springfield, I knew the LSAT and, later, the bar exam would be serious hurdles.

What I didn’t expect was the cost of preparing for them. Quality LSAT prep courses can cost well over $1,000. That’s not within reach for aspiring professionals.

Thanks to the Prepare for Illinois’ Future initiative, I didn’t have to make that financial trade-off. This state-funded program gave me access to one of the top LSAT prep resources from Kaplan at no cost. The weekly classes, personalized feedback on practice exams and live tutor support helped me stay on track while working a part-time job. I was able to target the areas where I needed the most improvement, boosting both my score and my confidence.

Improving my LSAT score isn’t only about getting into my top-choice law school; it also positions me for scholarships that make that path financially viable.

But this program was never just about one student or one test. It was about access. It was about removing financial barriers that hold back aspiring professionals from advancing in law, health care, education and other critical fields.

By Abhimanyu Sharma

Director General of the International Solar Alliance (ISA), Ashish Khanna has projected creation of 7 million jobs over the next 5 years in the clean energy sector.

In an exclusive conversation with CNBC TV18, he pointed out that while several island nations dependent on diesel for energy end up spending 4% of their GDP on imports, many islands are also unable to scale up in batteries or solar energy due to their small size.

Khanna said that all Pacific nations are meeting in Sri Lanka next month while all Latin American countries are meeting in Chile as part of a joint initiative by island countries to develop a platform for large scale bidding for solar energy to lower costs.

At ISA's Standing committee meeting co-chaired by India and France last week, Khanna said that ISA is opening a new vertical on technology prioritisation in manufacturing on the request of member countries to help intertwine energy security and industrial policy.

While the ISA is looking at 3 to 4 countries in each continent to develop a detailed strategy to harness solar energy, 16 centres of excellence in 16 countries are now connected with India's expertise through a Global Capability Centre (GCC).

ISA is also looking to set up regional platforms to bring together small island states under India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's initiative of One Sun One Earth One Grid.

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavor,” said Chancellor Tedd L. Mitchell, M.D. “Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this campus will not only be the largest energy and data complex of its kind, but also a testament to the unshakable spirit of our system, the Texas Panhandle and this great state.”

TTU officials said Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry, is set to partner in the project to provide infrastructure energy solutions amid the U.S.’s participation in “the energy-intensive AI race.”

Perry phrased the project as a way to bring “all hands on deck” to continue the nation’s development in the energy sector, following President Donald Trump’s executive order in May to “designate [AI] data centers, located at or operated in coordination with Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, as critical defense facilities, and the nuclear reactors powering them as defense critical electric infrastructure.”

Fermi America’s announcement of the project described it as “the only site with the potential to include safe, clean, new nuclear power, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power, and battery energy storage at unprecedented scale.”

The Pantex plant in Amarillo is considered a United States Department of Energy Superfund Site, though it does not generate nuclear energy.

The initial announcement from TTU did not specify whether or not the campus is intended to have its own nuclear power generator, nor a prospective timeline for that energy aspect. There were also no details in TTU’s initial announcement of the project regarding expected resource requirements for water or electricity usage.

Another recent project, APR Energy’s development of an 800-acre data center near Pampa, is expected to start with using 2 gigawatts of natural gas and 1.5 million gallons per day of water.

TTU officials noted the project campus will intend to include academic and research opportunities for faculty and students including internships, employment and workforce training, and placement programs set to benefit its institutions.

“This collaboration will not only position Texas Tech to address the evolving demands of the energy and technology sectors but will also create meaningful educational opportunities for our students and research possibilities across many disciplines for our faculty,” said TTU President Lawrence Schovanec.

Analysis: Senate GOP’s Updated Megabill is Still a Disaster for Affordability, Jobs, and Clean Energy

Our policy summary of the terrible so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”

Share:

It’s official: Republican Senate Leadership has released an updated version of their tax megabill, which will likely be the version that goes to the floor for a final vote. And somehow, it’s even worse than before. Senate Republicans are proposing passing legislation that will lock in higher household energy bills, kill American jobs, sell out the health of working and frontline communities, harm Medicaid, jeopardize food assistance, and torch our future.

If this bill passes, Republicans would be responsible for the loss of over 800,000 jobs, raising the average American’s electricity bills by 10 percent, and in a time of intense heat and grid demand, they’ll be reducing new energy capacity installed on the grid by at least 50 percent. All this—simply to line the pockets of billionaires, fossil fuel executives, and their top corporate backers with massive tax cuts.

We analyzed the latest proposed Senate bill text for the Senate Finance Committee (“Finance”), the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (“ENR”) Committee, and the Senate Environment and Public Works (“EPW”) Committee, to explain how these sweeping cuts will harm pocketbooks, health, and our planet.

In the coming days, the Senate is expected to put this chilling legislation to a vote. If it passes, the GOP’s megabill will return to the House for passage. As this process unfolds, we will continue to provide updates on the disastrous tax package.

What’s the Status of the So-Called One Big Beautiful Bill?

In August 2022, Congress passed historic clean energy investments as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These investments were strategically designed to make energy bills more affordable, revitalize American manufacturing, create millions of good jobs for working Americans, and cut pollution to tackle the escalating climate crisis. But Congressional Republicans are now unleashing a full-scale attack on these transformational investments, even though the lion’s share of the benefits from these investments have been flowing to GOP districts.

The first part of the GOP’s plan culminated in May, when House Republicans passed their so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” This bill lumped together a series of devastating cuts to Medicaid and food assistance with an attempt to functionally repeal or completely eliminate critical programs like clean energy tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, Environmental Justice Block Grants, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).

The GOP’s disastrous tax bill then moved to the Senate, where Republicans proposed further cuts to clean energy provisions, food assistance, and Medicaid during the committee markup process. Next, the Senate Parliamentarian combed through the legislation to determine which provisions of the GOP’s megabill must be taken out of the package, a procedural prerequisite for passage of any reconciliation bill. Among the provisions knocked out of the bill were the previously proposed repeal of the light-duty and medium-duty vehicle emissions standards and a former provision that would have allowed natural gas exporters to pay a fee to have dangerous liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects automatically deemed in the public interest. Now that the Parliamentarian’s review is mostly over, the Senate has released its updated text.

Make no mistake: The updated Senate text is still a staggering affront to American communities who are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, working people who are trying to support their families, those living in sacrifice zones with polluted air and water, and anyone counting on a livable future on our planet.

Senate Finance Committee Analysis

The Senate Committee on Finance (“Finance”) covers the tax-writing and revenue-raising elements of the reconciliation bill. The updated bill text includes major cuts to the federal energy tax credits that are already delivering enormous benefits, particularly in Republican districts. This proposal will be disastrous for households across America, raising the average American’s electricity bills by 10 percent. The proposed cuts to tax credits will kill energy and manufacturing jobs at a time of economic hardship for many families across the nation.

Summary of What the Senate Finance Committee Proposed

The Senate Finance bill guts critical tax credits for clean energy, clean vehicles, home efficiency, and clean manufacturing. The updated text proposal goes beyond the repeal of clean energy tax credits—even imposing new taxes on solar and wind energy projects, which throws up further obstacles to clean energy growth. These changes will kill clean energy and manufacturing jobs, raise energy prices, and increase pollution.

Tax credits for wind and solar will be effectively repealed immediately, and new taxes will be applied to solar and wind projects. These changes will make the grid less reliable by cutting back 50 percent of the new capacity that was expected to be added to it within the next decade.

The bill eliminates tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, commercial clean vehicles, and fueling infrastructure. This would stall the American-made EV industry, resulting in significant job losses across the auto industry.

The Senate Republicans’ text accelerates the phase-out of manufacturing tax credits that support American businesses and supply chains, and which have brought billions of investments to the U.S.

The bill cuts tax credits that make homes and buildings more efficient and more affordable to operate. Eliminating these credits will not only take money out of the pockets of Americans who rely on these credits but also add more pressure to the electric grid.

1. Clean Energy Tax Credits (45Y and 48E)

Let’s start with one of the most powerful tools supporting the rapid deployment of new energy generation and a modern, reliable, and affordable electricity grid for American homes and businesses: the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits.

The Production Tax Credit (PTC) (45Y) is a technology-neutral tax credit that subsidizes the production of zero-emission energy sources like solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal. For every kilowatt hour (kWh) of clean energy generated, the producer gets a base credit of 2.6¢/kWh if they meet certain criteria. Similarly, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) (48E) provides a credit of 30 percent (or more) of the investment into these same zero-emission energy generation technology projects, including energy storage.

The GOP’s latest bill contains the immediate effective repeal of the investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) for wind and solar projects. It requires projects to be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to get the credit, which applies to wind and solar only. Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirements begin immediately. In addition, a new excise tax is imposed on all solar and wind facilities—not only those that would have qualified for 45Y/48E—in the amount equal to 30 percent (solar) or 50 percent (wind) times the percentage by which a facility fails the material assistance cost ratio times the facility's manufactured component cost. This means that after the credit is gone, the supply chain requirements are still imposed as a penalty on both utility-scale wind/solar and rooftop solar projects. ITC/PTC credit remains for other zero-emission energy generation (geothermal, hydropower, nuclear) and energy storage, although FEOC restrictions apply.

The previous version from Senate Finance phased out wind and solar beginning in 2026, at which time wind and solar projects would only get 60 percent of the value of the credit (i.e., an 18 percent credit). In 2027, that percentage would have dropped to 20 percent of the value of the credit (i.e., a 6 percent credit), and by 2028, the credit would be completely phased out. For hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal, the credit remained available at 100 percent of the credit value through 2033, 75 percent of the value in 2034, 50 percent of the value in 2035, and 0 percent in 2036. By contrast, the latest Senate bill is much more punitive to clean energy. It applies a placed-in-service standard on an even shorter timeline than the House, as well as FEOC restrictions. It also levies an extremely punitive new tax on solar and wind.

The latest Senate version will effectively repeal the credits immediately and crush the booming manufacturing and clean energy industries in communities across the United States. Repealing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the affordability crisis, raise energy bills, harm grid reliability, kill jobs, and inflame the climate crisis.

Skyrocketing energy prices: The Senate’s proposed repeal of the clean energy tax credits would raise American household energy bills. It could increase annual energy bills up to $140-$220 per household across the country in 2040, and over $500 per year in some states.

Kill good-paying jobs: Full repeal of the 45Y and 48E clean energy tax credits alone would result in roughly 100,000 fewer full-time jobs across the country by 2040. The updated Senate bill could approach those levels of job loss.

Harm grid reliability: These tax credits are enhancing grid reliability in the face of increased electricity demand and extreme weather. Clean energy is the fastest, cheapest way to add new power to the grid. In fact, clean energy accounted for 93 percent of the new energy capacity added to the U.S. grid last year.

These changes jeopardize billions of dollars of existing investments, including any project underway now that won’t be fully operational by 2027. By stifling the booming solar and wind industries, Republicans are ensuring that our international competitors take the lead on clean energy development, setting back American energy dominance.

Slashing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the climate crisis. Saving the 45Y and 48E tax credits would cut climate pollution by 300 to 400 million tons compared to no tax credits in 2035. That’s 29-46 percent lower than a scenario without clean energy tax credits. After a year marked by devastating, billion-dollar climate disasters, floods, and fires, it’s more important than ever that we address climate head-on.

2. Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E)

The IRA’s electric vehicle (EV) tax credits have been rapidly accelerating America’s clean auto industry and job growth. At the same time, these tax credits have made EVs more financially accessible for some families. Households and commercial companies can receive tax credits for purchasing new electric vehicles (up to $7,500) and used electric vehicles (up to $4,000), as well as for chargers and installation.

This proposal would end EV tax credits for new EVs (30D) and used EVs (25E), commercial clean vehicles (45W), and fueling infrastructure (30C). This bill distinguishes between heavy-duty commercial vehicles (considered under commercial vehicle requirements) and light-duty commercial vehicles (considered under personal vehicle requirements).

The updated Senate bill would eliminate credits faster than the House bill proposal. The bulk of the credits (25E, 30D, and 45) end after September 2025. Vehicle charging infrastructure ends after June 2026.

The used EV (25E) tax credit is eliminated by September 30, 2025. In the House version, it was the end of 2025. In the previous Senate version, it was within 90 days of passage.

The new EV (30D) tax credit is eliminated by September 30, 2025. In the previous Senate version, it was within 90 days of passage. In the House version, it was the end of 2025. In the House bill, drivers can get a tax credit for qualified vehicles from manufacturers who have not yet hit the 200,000 EV cap through December 31, 2026. There is no such provision in the updated Senate bill.

The new clean commercial vehicle (45W) tax credit is eliminated by September 30, 2025. In the House bill, it was the end of 2025.

The vehicle charging infrastructure (30C) tax credit is eliminated by June 30, 2026. This stands in contrast to the House bill, which ended the credit at the end of 2025. In the previous Senate bill, the credit was eliminated a year after the bill’s enactment.

Fully repealing the IRA’s EV tax credits would drive a wrecking ball through the American-made EV industry and would cause major job losses, according to the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, and would benefit China, according to General Motors. For households, new and used electric vehicles would become less financially accessible, meaning consumers would have fewer transportation options.

3. Manufacturing Tax Credits (45X and 48C)

The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Production Credit (45X) provides an incentive to manufacturing facilities that produce clean energy components or systems in the U.S. Facilities that produce solar, wind, advanced batteries, and certain critical minerals are rewarded for re-shoring supply chains in America. The Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit (48C) incentivizes investment in advanced energy projects, such as clean energy manufacturing and recycling, critical mineral processing, and industrial decarbonization projects. The 48C tax credit supports the development of a domestic supply chain for these clean energy projects.

The GOP’s bill accelerates the phaseout of 45X tax credits for manufacturing batteries, wind turbines, and critical minerals. It also adds metallurgical coal to the list of eligible critical minerals. The new text does maintain credit stackability, allowing manufacturers to claim the 45X credit for subcomponents (e.g., a photovoltaic cell) and additional IRA tax credits for the final product (e.g., a finished solar panel). The Senate bill also tightens FEOC restrictions to limit the pool of manufacturers that can receive the credit, arbitrarily excluding facilities with a certain proportion of investment from “prohibited foreign entities.”

It’s a slightly different story for 48C. The Senate text severely limits 48C projects’ viability by instituting a two-year “placed in service” requirement, which will inject uncertainty for developers and investors who counted on receiving the credit before the artificial two-year timeline was put in place. The Senate’s changes will also effectively repeal the credit after two years by not allowing for the recycling of rescinded credits from failed projects to qualified ones.

For 45X, this version adds metallurgical coal as an eligible critical mineral. It adjusts the FEOC provisions covering this credit, including setting an escalating “material assistance cost ratio,” which establishes the proportion of material financial assistance allowed for eligible components. While the previous Senate text eliminated credit eligibility for components that have been integrated into other eligible components, this version restores that eligibility (in keeping with the House text). Phaseout timelines are only slightly tweaked from the previous Senate version. The general thrust of prematurely winding down the credits remains.

Meanwhile, the 48C section remains identical to the previous Senate Finance text, and 48C was untouched in the House version.

The 45X Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit has sparked a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing, especially for electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and solar energy and their supply chains. The credits have helped incentivize over $200 billion in new investment in the U.S. and positioned the U.S. to be competitive in critical 21st-century global industries. This incentive has contributed to job and manufacturing growth—most of which is in districts that Republicans represent. The GOP’s call for repeal would directly harm the jobs and livelihoods of their constituents, while sending American manufacturing jobs overseas.

The 48C’s “placed in service” restriction will inject uncertainty for developers and investors who were counting on receiving this credit before the Senate GOP inserted this artificial two-year timeline. It will threaten the certainty of building these facilities and the jobs that come with them. It also means the credit will be repealed after two years, not allowing for the recycling of rescinded credits from failed projects to qualified ones.

4. Home Energy Efficiency Tax Credits (25C, 45L, 179D)

Thanks to the IRA, households can take tax credits of 30 percent off (up to $2,000) for installing a heat pump or heat pump water heater, plus $1,200 for weatherization and insulation via the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C). The 25C tax credit helped 2.3 million American families improve their homes and reduce their monthly energy bills in 2023. Families are saving an average of $130 a year in energy costs. By 2032, homeowners are expected to use the credit enough to cut peak electric demand by 3,400 MW.

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) provides incentives to builders of homes that meet Energy Star or Zero-Energy Ready Home standards. This credit assisted with the construction of nearly 350,000 efficient new homes in 2024 and cut homeowner energy bills by about $450 per year.

The Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (179D) provides a tax deduction for installing energy-efficient appliances and equipment in commercial buildings, like energy-efficient heating, lighting, and hot water. This deduction applies to building upgrades on existing properties, as well as new construction.

The GOP’s bill would eliminate the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) at the end of 2025. It would eliminate the New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) after June 2026. The Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (179D) is amended so that it does not apply to property whose construction begins after June 2026.

In the updated Senate text, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) is eliminated at the end of 2025. This is the same timeline as the House version. The previous Senate version proposed 180 days after bill enactment. In the updated Senate text, the New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) is eliminated for homes acquired after June 30, 2026. The House bill eliminates the credit at the end of 2025 unless the home construction begins before May 12, 2025. The House bill did not include the elimination of the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (179D).

Cutting building energy efficiency credits takes money out of people’s pockets by making home energy upgrades more expensive and raises everyone’s utility bills by reducing efficiency and putting more pressure on the electric grid. Households can currently save $990 per year on utility bills if they utilize the 25C tax credit, and these credits create 240,000 jobs. By effectively terminating the Energy Efficient Home Credit for new buildings, this is a major gut punch to any builders trying to provide new homes to address the housing crisis.

5. Residential Clean Energy Tax Credits (25D)

Dating back to 2005, the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides households with a 30 percent tax credit for rooftop solar, wind power, geothermal heating systems, and battery systems. In 2023, 1.2 million American families took advantage of the residential clean energy tax credit, and now 5 percent of US households have solar. And all of that small-scale solar adds up, with over 66GW installed, amounting to more than one-third of US solar capacity.

This bill would eliminate the Residential Clean Energy Credit—which incentivizes homeowners to install solar panels, water heating, fuel cells, wind, geothermal heat pumps, and battery storage facilities—after December 31, 2025. The credit will no longer apply “with respect to any expenditures made after December 31, 2025.”

The House version is the same, eliminating the credit at the end of 2025. The previous Senate bill eliminated the credit 180 days after the bill’s enactment.

Households would see higher costs for home energy upgrades and lose access to $1,250 in savings per year on utility bills. At the same time, we would be cutting a huge source of new energy capacity just as demand on the grid is increasing, which will raise energy costs for everyone. Plus, cutting the residential clean energy tax credits would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs in the home energy and rooftop solar sector.

6. Foreign Entity of Concern

The Senate Finance bill contains extreme restrictions on the clean energy tax credits through the “Foreign Entity of Concern” (FEOC) provisions. A FEOC has previously been considered an entity that is owned, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of a particular nation, such as China, Russia, or North Korea. Though FEOC requirements have been imposed in the past (such as through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law), they have not typically interfered with tax incentives.

The Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions applied across clean energy and manufacturing tax credits are unworkable and, in some cases, extraordinarily punitive for industry. The bill establishes a material assistance cost ratio framework—modeled after the existing domestic content bonus—that sets credit-specific eligibility thresholds based on the share of inputs used across different technologies. It applies material assistance requirements to solar and wind projects that commence construction after June 2025. Projects must also pass new Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) tests tied to foreign ownership and influence. For solar and wind energy projects, as mentioned above, the Senate text also includes a new excise tax that functions as a supply chain penalty even after the underlying credits expire. The tax is equal to the percentage by which a facility fails the material assistance cost ratio times the facility's manufactured component cost.

The final Senate bill FEOC restrictions are more cumbersome, take effect more quickly, and are accompanied by new penalties. The text also includes some changes to address industry concerns about FEOC restrictions.

FEOC restrictions will make the credits effectively repealed immediately for solar and wind projects—raising energy costs, killing jobs, and undermining U.S. investment and economic competitiveness. Some adjustments were made to the House bill to address industry concerns, but FEOC restrictions will also raise costs and hardship for energy and manufacturing projects.

7. Other IRA Programs Affected by Senate Finance Text

Direct Pay (aka Elective Pay): These provisions in current law are not themselves amended, but they will be functionally unusable for the technologies for which energy tax credits are no longer applied.

Clean Fuels Credits (45Z): This section of the bill adds a requirement that the fuel must be produced or grown in North America (U.S., Mexico, or Canada), which will be effective after December 31, 2025. It amends the credit such that the emissions rate cannot be less than zero; amends the credit to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes, and allows the Secretary to determine adjustments on regulations and methodologies; and amends the credit with respect to fuel derived from animal manure, by giving a specific emissions rate for each animal manure feedstock. All these changes will take effect in 2026. 45Z is extended through December 31, 2029.

Carbon Capture Credits (45Q): FEOC requirements added. It increases the credit value and boosts the credit for carbon used for more oil production.

Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V): Requires a facility to begin construction by January 1, 2028, instead of January 1, 2033, to be eligible for the credit.

Nuclear Tax Credit (45U): Adds FEOC restrictions beginning at the date of enactment for specified foreign entities, and within two years of enactment for other prohibited foreign entities. Additional prohibition of credits to covered nations/entities, including restrictions on imported nuclear fuel that was produced in a covered nation/by a covered entity, with the exception of fuel acquired before January 1, 2023. Restrictions on foreign entities began in taxable years following enactment; restrictions on imported fuels begin after December 31, 2027.

Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee Analysis

The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW) covers, among other things, any elements of the reconciliation bill related to air and water pollution, environmental policy, and public buildings. This part of the reconciliation bill repeals many federal grant programs created by the IRA.

Summary of What the Senate EPW Committee Proposed

The Senate EPW bill text largely mirrors the final House text, harming flagship climate programs.

The bill repeals the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). And it rescinds unobligated balances from key programs like Environmental Justice Block Grants and the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG).

The bill delays the imposition of a historic methane fee for ten years, rendering the effort to cut this climate super pollutant ineffective.

The Senate bill proposes an “opt-in” fee for project sponsors to pay that expedites their project’s environmental review under NEPA.

8. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is the largest grant program within the IRA. This $27 billion is divided into three programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All. Not only does this program provide a significant investment in pollution-reducing clean energy technology and green banks, but it also benefits communities that have been historically overlooked and underserved, bringing greater equity to the clean energy transition. For months, the Trump administration has waged an unsubstantiated assault on this fund. At every turn, the administration has been unable to justify its attacks to undermine this program, failing to offer evidence to support its bogus claims of fraud, waste, or abuse.

The GOP’s bill repeals Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, in which the GGRF was created. Any unobligated balances are rescinded.

There is no change to the House version.

The GGRF is unlocking a historic wave of public and private investment, delivering local economic development opportunities that would not have materialized without this program, especially in disadvantaged communities. But the Trump administration has already been attacking the GGRF through an illegal funding freeze, and a court battle is currently raging with program awardees, in particular the NCIF and CCIA programs. The GGRF funding has technically been obligated, and only minimal GGRF funds remain unobligated and available for rescission. But this bill would harm program implementation and oversight at EPA. It may also represent an attempt by Congress and the administration to block or claw back funds that have been legally obligated.

9. Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) are an EPA program established as part of a new Clean Air Act Section 137 created in the IRA, which provides grants to state, local, and Tribal governments to create and implement programs that reduce emissions and support jobs and communities. It was funded with $5 billion, including $250 million in planning grants, $4.6 billion for implementation grants, and the remaining balance for technical assistance and program implementation. These grants have been used to support state, local, and Tribal governments in nearly all 50 states.

The bill rescinds any unobligated funding under the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) for plans and implementation grants.

Same as the previous version.

The CPRG program is a primary vehicle for states to fund their pollution reduction programs. Rescinding unobligated funding for the CPRG program would dramatically harm program implementation at the agency. Many awarded states could have to stall or permanently halt their pollution reduction plans that were intended to create jobs, reduce energy and transportation costs, and mitigate pollution in impacted communities.

10. Environmental Justice Block Grants

This first-of-its-kind $3 billion federal program aims to empower disadvantaged communities to determine and design their own visions of pollution reduction and clean energy investment. The Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants, also known as the Community Change Grants, provide highly flexible funding that goes directly to nonprofit organizations serving these communities. This means projects are designed by and for communities to address their unique needs and build resilience to extreme weather events and environmental risks.

The Senate GOP’s bill rescinds all unobligated funding under Section 60201 of the IRA, which provided funding for highly flexible grants to nonprofit organizations serving disadvantaged communities.

The Senate version closely mirrors the House version.

Without EJ Block Grants, there will be less financial support for on-the-ground, community-led organizations that provide life-changing services to households based in disadvantaged communities or living near sacrifice zones. Examples of critical services include community-led pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation; projects that reduce indoor air pollution; projects to counter health risks from urban heat islands, extreme heat, and wildfires; improved community engagement in public processes; and technical assistance. Much of these funds are unobligated.

11. Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Methane is a potent, planet-heating greenhouse gas that oil and gas operators often flare or leak into the atmosphere. That’s why Congress passed the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) through the IRA in 2022, requiring oil and gas operators to pay a penalty fee if they exceed a certain level of methane pollution. Soon after, the Biden-led EPA introduced a rule implementing the WEC. But at the beginning of 2025, the Republican-controlled Congress voted to eliminate that rule. Now, Congress is trying to get rid of the fee outright via the budget reconciliation bill.

The bill rescinds all unobligated funding from Section 60113 of the IRA, which provided funding to the EPA for financial and technical assistance for methane monitoring and mitigation. Senate Republicans retain a fee on excessive methane waste, known as the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC), but the language is altered so that the collection of charges is postponed until 2034, as opposed to 2024 under current legislation. This renders the fee largely ineffective for the next decade.

This is similar to previous versions of the text.

By cutting methane pollution and other harmful pollutants, the WEC would have helped prevent asthma attacks and other health-harming impacts. The program would have reduced an extremely harmful greenhouse gas superpollutant. Altering the WEC will disproportionately impact communities of color and disadvantaged communities. The methane fee is also a revenue raiser, so its alteration increases the budget deficit and would necessitate even deeper cuts to other vital programs to comply with the GOP’s self-imposed spending cut targets.

12. Opt-In Fee Program under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is our nation’s bedrock environmental law. It requires federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of all major proposed government projects.

Senate Republicans have created a new “opt-in fee” mechanism that would allow project sponsors to receive special treatment in the environmental review process. In exchange for a fee of 125 percent of the costs to prepare the environmental document, the project sponsor receives an expedited review.

The previous Senate version had a provision that allowed project sponsors to skirt judicial review for a fee. The parliamentarian found the judicial portion violated the Byrd rule and was therefore struck.

This is a continuation of the “pay-to-play” politics we saw in the GOP’s House version, but this time, the bill is attacking the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which provides for environmental reviews of all major government actions.

13. Other IRA Programs Affected by the Senate EPW Bill

Here’s a selection of programs that saw funding rescissions:

Heavy-Duty Vehicles Program under Sec. 132 of the Clean Air Act

Air quality monitoring in fenceline communities (Sec. 60105 of the IRA).

Air quality monitoring in schools (Sec. 60106 of the IRA).

Lots of embodied carbon programs, including the environmental product declaration assistance, low-embodied carbon labeling, GSA emerging and sustainable technologies program, and more.

What Didn’t Survive the ""Byrd Bath"" in the Senate EPW Text?

The Senate Parliamentarian advised that several provisions in the Senate’s former EPW bill text did not meet the requirements of the Byrd rule. This means that the following provisions have been struck from the bill:

Republicans tried to repeal statutory authorizations for the Inflation Reduction Act and rescind funds. The parliamentarian ruled that the GOP’s megabill can rescind funding, but it cannot repeal their authorization. This means Congress could provide funding for them in the future.

Republicans wanted to repeal the EPA’s tailpipe emissions rule, also known as the multipollutant emissions standards for model years 2027 and later light-duty and medium-duty vehicles. Fortunately, this provision has been struck from the text.

Republicans wanted to enable project sponsors to speed up environmental reviews and skirt judicial review for a fee. The parliamentarian found the judicial portion violated the Byrd rule and was therefore struck.

Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee Analysis

The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) covers policies related to energy resources and development, which include regulations and conservation efforts, nuclear energy, as well as Tribal affairs, public lands and their renewable resources, and federal leasing and related activities. This component of the reconciliation bill repeals critical IRA programs that were putting the nation on track to be energy dominant, while also cutting health-harming air and climate pollution.

Summary of What the Senate ENR Committee Proposed

The GOP’s ENR bill will generate more climate disasters and harm to frontline communities by lowering fees required to lease land for oil and natural gas drilling and establishing a minimum number of required onshore and offshore oil and gas sales annually.

The Senate bill will sell off public lands in eleven western states.

Republicans will eliminate the majority of new funds and programs under the Department of Energy Loan Program Office, which will undermine American businesses and U.S. technology leadership.

The GOP will repeal and rescind the remaining funds for the Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment program, which will be a major blow to US economic competitiveness.

14. Oil, Gas, and Coal Leasing Handouts

America’s public lands and waters are precious—and coal, oil, and gas extraction that currently occurs there must end if we want to align with the latest climate science. But in this bill, the GOP has promised to further plunder lands currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) — while slashing the royalty rates paid by oil and gas corporations to exploit America’s public lands.

Scientists and peer-reviewed academics have repeatedly found that there simply is no room for new coal, oil, and gas fields if we want to limit planetary warming to 1.5C. Flying in the face of climate science, the Republicans’ ENR bill recklessly accelerates oil and gas extraction on America’s public lands and waters. This bill sets a floor for the minimum number of onshore and offshore oil and gas sales annually and lowers the barriers to oil and gas leasing, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska’s Cook Inlet. This bill would reinstate onshore non-competitive leasing processes, lengthen drilling permit terms, and cut royalty rates. Each of these provisions lowers the barrier to access for Big Oil to exploit U.S. public lands and waters. The bill also proposes a massive expansion of coal leasing across federal lands, making at least 4 million acres of public land available for coal leasing. The bill text provides significant handouts to Big Coal by reducing the royalty rates for coal extracted on federal land.

Leasing was made competitive so that government agencies could ensure the best and most efficient use of taxpayer dollars and reduce opportunities for corruption. This bill opens the door to backroom dealing through expanded non-competitive processes and reduced fees. This bill also encourages gas and oil drilling nationwide, which will increase air pollution, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and hold our national economy back by supporting reliance on non-renewable energy resources. Make no mistake: This is a cheap sell-out of our nation’s precious natural resources, an act of climate arson, and a poisoning of communities—all to facilitate a gargantuan handout to fossil fuel corporations.

15. Derailing Transmission Reforms

There are several IRA programs at DOE that support the expansion of electricity transmission infrastructure in the U.S. and are critical to providing affordable and reliable power for Americans. These include the Transmission Facility Financing program; the Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modeling, and Analysis program; and the Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines. These programs are especially important at a time of rising electricity demand, fueled by data centers to power artificial intelligence (AI), increasing electrification of vehicles and buildings, and an American manufacturing renaissance.

This version of the bill does not rescind unobligated funds for transmission facility financing.

The previous version repealed and rescinded unobligated funds for transmission facility financing, grants to facilitate the siting of interstate electricity transmission lines, and interregional and offshore wind electricity planning, as well as modeling and analysis.

It would seem that Republicans have finally come to terms with the fact that transmission reform and funding are necessary to deliver energy to Americans—even as the GOP aggressively eliminates opportunities to build clean energy. By eliminating clean energy programs that make our energy grid a secure and reliable source of affordable power, Republicans are pushing the nation farther away from energy dominance.

16. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office

The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office (LPO) was created with strong bipartisan support during the George W. Bush administration, and for the last two decades, it has provided critical financing for American energy, manufacturing, mining, and other industrial projects that reduce emissions and support American leadership in the fast-growing clean energy economy. To date, LPO has financed approximately $90 billion in innovative energy and manufacturing projects, including a $465 million loan to Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors in 2010. At the end of 2024, LPO had collected over $5 billion in interest payments from its loans, meaning that it has made a profit for American taxpayers.

Rescinds unobligated balances from LPO programs under Sections 1703 and 1706.

In addition to rescinding unobligated balances, the previous Senate text also repealed LPO’s authorities under Sections 1703 and 1706. Only rescinding unobligated balances puts this bill in line with the House Energy and Commerce text, which also rescinded funding but did not repeal it altogether.

Eliminating LPO’s new loan authority would be a devastating blow for the U.S., especially amidst rising energy demand and a competitive global race to build and manufacture the energy technologies that will power the 21st century. It would harm American businesses and U.S. technology leadership. Not only that, over the long term, shrinking LPO will cost American taxpayers money, as the successful program has already returned $5 billion in profit to the American taxpayer, via interest on its loans.

17. Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program

The Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program (AIFDP) was created in the IRA and funded with over $5.8 billion to advance industrial decarbonization and support American manufacturing’s global economic competitiveness. The program has provided funds for innovative low-carbon cement manufacturing projects in Indiana, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia, for next-generation aluminum manufacturing in Colorado, for low-carbon steel production in multiple states, and much more.

Rescinds unobligated balances.

In addition to rescinding unobligated balances, the previous Senate text also repealed AIFDP. Only rescinding unobligated balances puts this bill in line with the House E&C text, which also rescinded funding but did not repeal it altogether.

Rescinding unobligated balances and eliminating the AIFDP program would deal a major blow to U.S. global economic competitiveness as American businesses fight for market share in increasingly decarbonized steel, cement, aluminum, and other heavy industries.",https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/og-image/one-big-beautiful-bill-hero-2-og.jpg?1751125660,N,,2025-06-29 07:07:08.750739

With $3.8 trillion in tax cuts, $350 billion in defense spending, and deep cuts to Medicaid and green energy programs, this bill is a minefield of opportunities and risks. Let's dissect its impacts and plot a course through the chaos.

Healthcare: A Sector on the Brink

The bill's Medicaid provisions—work requirements, co-pays, and rural hospital funding shifts—are a double-edged sword. While the Senate's $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program may stabilize some facilities, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts 10.9 million fewer insured Americans under the House version. This could reduce patient volumes for hospitals and insurers, especially in states like North Carolina and Kentucky.

Investment Implications:

- Short or Avoid: Hospital chains like HCA Healthcare (HCA) and Tenet Healthcare (THC), which rely on Medicaid reimbursements.

- Consider: Telehealth platforms like Teladoc Health (TDOC) or UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which might capture demand from newly uninsured patients seeking affordable care.

Renewable Energy: A Sunset Industry?

The bill's elimination of electric vehicle (EV) tax credits by September 2025 and cuts to renewable energy incentives could be catastrophic for wind and solar firms. Senate Democrats warn this is a “death sentence” for industries already facing supply chain and cost pressures.

Investment Implications:

- Avoid: Pure-play renewables like Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRF) or NextEra Energy (NEE).

- Rotate: Into fossil fuel giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX), which could benefit from reduced competition and higher energy demand.

Defense & Infrastructure: A Boom for Contractors

The bill's $350 billion allocation for national security—border walls, missile defenses, and detention facilities—lights a fuse under defense contractors. Private prison companies like CoreCivic (CXW) and aerospace firms like Lockheed Martin (LMT) could see windfalls.

Investment Implications:

- Buy: Defense contractors with direct ties to the bill's priorities, such as Raytheon Technologies (RTX) (missile defense) or Boeing (BA) (military aircraft).

SALT Provisions: A Regional Tale

The SALT deduction's expansion to $40,000 (for five years) aids high-tax states like New York and California. However, the retained “pass-through” loophole—which lets wealthier taxpayers bypass caps—could skew benefits toward the affluent.

Investment Implications:

- Watch: Real estate in high-tax states, as reduced tax burdens may boost demand.

- Avoid: Overweighting regional banks in states facing Medicaid cuts, as loan defaults could rise.

Political Risks: The Clock is Ticking

The bill faces GOP infighting, Democratic filibusters, and CBO cost estimates that could sway undecided senators. A failure to pass by July 4 would trigger a market sell-off, while passage might spark a rally in defense and fossil fuels.

Hedging Strategies:

- Diversify: Use inverse ETFs like ProShares Short S&P 500 (SH) to offset downside risks.

- Monitor: The S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX) for fear-driven volatility.

Final Take: Play the Winners, Hedge the Risks

The bill's passage hinges on GOP unity and Senate procedural wins. Investors should:

1. Rotate into defense contractors and fossil fuels while avoiding renewables and Medicaid-reliant healthcare.

2. Hedge with inverse ETFs to insulate portfolios from legislative gridlock.

3. Stay nimble: Watch for amendments or CBO reports that could shift momentum.

This isn't just a legislative battle—it's a real-time stress test for sectors and investor resolve. The July 4 deadline isn't just symbolic; it's a countdown to reshaped markets.

Sunny cities like Las Vegas can reach 97 percent of the way to constant solar electricity every hour throughout the year.

The cost for this is $104 per MWh, which is 22 percent lower than just a year ago and cheaper than new coal or nuclear power.

Around-the-clock solar energy now technical and economic reality

Solar electricity production is now very affordable and with recent improvements in battery costs and technology, 24-hour electricity production is within reach. Rapid advances in battery technology, particularly regarding cost, have made nearly continuous solar power available every hour every day of the year. This is now an economic and technical reality in sunny regions worldwide.

On an average day in a sunny city like Las Vegas, 5 kW fixed solar panels together with a 17 kWh battery are required to deliver constant 1 kW stable power supply around the clock. This combination can deliver constant 1 kW solar electricity every hour during a full 24-hour period. This amount of battery is sufficient for most regions in the world.

Sunny cities reach 97 percent constant power supply

In the sunniest cities, it is possible to get more than 90 percent of the way to constant solar electricity production every hour every day of the year. Las Vegas can reach 97 percent of the way to 1 GW constant supply and Muscat in Oman reaches 99 percent with 6 GW solar panels and 17 GWh battery. Even cloudier cities like Birmingham can get 62 percent of the way to constant supply every hour every day of the year.

Cloudy days mean that 24/365 solar electricity production would require so much solar and battery capacity that it is probably uneconomical. In sunny cities, however, it is possible to get more than 90 percent of the way.

Economics are strong in sunny cities

In a sunny city like Las Vegas, the estimated cost of electricity is $104 per MWh at 97 percent constant supply. This is already 22 percent lower than the estimate of $132 per MWh based on global average capital costs for solar and battery a year earlier. It is also more cost-effective than coal in many regions at $118 per MWh and much cheaper than nuclear power at $182 per MWh.

Industries gain access to continuous clean energy

Industries like data centers and factories need uninterrupted power supply to function. At the same time, demand for clean electricity every hour of the day is increasing through corporate purchase agreements for carbon-free energy. With the ability to deliver electricity around the clock, solar energy can now support 24/7 clean energy contracts for industries that require continuous power, not just daytime.

This is extremely valuable for emerging economies, where solar-powered industrial and economic zones can emerge in sunny areas far from existing grid infrastructure. At the same time, it can bring significant potential savings on grid expansion costs by allowing up to five times as much solar capacity to be installed behind the same grid connection.",https://www.warpnews.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/06/Solar-energy-24-7.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 08:05:14.962127

Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she voted to begin debate, but that she couldn’t support the bill as-is without additional measures to mitigate the effects of the Medicaid cuts in the bill. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska agreed to advance the legislation on Saturday after lengthy reassurances from Thune.

The bill advanced in a vote of 51 to 49, with enough Republican holdouts joining party leaders to avoid the need for Vice President JD Vance’s tie-breaking vote and to push the measure forward despite lingering concerns about some of its provisions.

Collins said she was supporting the motion to proceed out of respect for Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), who has pressed for the bill’s swift consideration, but warned that she still has substantial reservations and intends to introduce several amendments in an effort to reshape the legislation.

Hawley, who had previously objected to proposed Medicaid cuts, told reporters Saturday that he would back not only the motion to proceed but also final passage of the bill. He credited his decision to new language in the updated bill that delays implementation of changes to the federal cap on Medicaid provider taxes—a provision he said would ultimately bring more federal funding to Missouri’s Medicaid program over the next four years.

The provider tax, or provider assessment, is a fee states charge hospitals to help fund Medicaid. While the House bill kept the federal cap at 6 percent of providers’ revenue, the Senate version would lower it to 3.5 percent—but the reduction would be phased in gradually. Hawley and several other Republicans warned that cutting the cap too quickly could strain hospitals and reduce Medicaid coverage, and said the Senate’s delay of those changes was key to winning his support.

The controversial language, championed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), would require the Interior Department to identify between 0.25 and 0.50 percent of Bureau of Land Management lands for sale, focusing on parcels near developed areas suitable for housing. Protected lands like national monuments and wilderness areas would be excluded, and sales would be limited to areas within five miles of towns with at least 1,000 residents. Though narrower than earlier proposals rejected by the parliamentarian, the provision remains contentious, drawing warnings from conservation groups and lawmakers such as Sheehy, who said it could set a dangerous precedent for privatizing public lands.

Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) voted no on the procedural motion, underscoring ongoing divisions within the GOP. Paul objected to the bill’s provision raising the debt limit by $5 trillion. Tillis said he cannot support the bill because it contains significant changes to Medicaid that would be “devastating to North Carolina.”

Trump, during an event at the White House on June 26, highlighted the tax cuts and immigration funding efforts included in the bill, describing it as “one of the most important pieces of legislation in the history of our country.”

The legislative package will “secure our borders, turbocharge our economy, and bring back the American dream,” the president said.

One of its major provisions raises the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029, before reverting to the lower limit, though the higher cap phases out for individuals earning above $500,000.

It also fulfills Trump’s campaign pledge to end taxes on tips, excluding up to $25,000 in tip income for individuals earning under $150,000, with the benefit reduced for higher earners.

The bill proposes significant changes to clean energy policy, terminating tax credits for electric vehicles after September 2025 and accelerating the end of clean energy incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, including credits for wind, solar, and hydrogen production.

The measure eliminates fines for automakers who fail to meet certain fuel economy standards for model years not yet subject to penalty notices and introduces a new tax exemption for interest paid on auto loans for U.S.-built vehicles, up to $10,000 annually, phasing out for those earning above $100,000.

The Senate draft increases funding for rural hospitals to $25 billion between 2028 and 2032, and proposes a gradual reduction in the cap on Medicaid provider taxes from 6 percent to 3.5 percent over several years.

Further, the legislation eliminates the $200 tax stamp required for purchasing firearm silencers and short-barrel rifles, and it drops earlier proposals to force the U.S. Postal Service to remove electric vehicles and charging infrastructure from its fleet after those measures were ruled out of order under Senate reconciliation rules.",https://i.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2025/06/id1076266-US-Capitol-GettyImages-2222356725.jpg-900x506.webp,N,,2025-06-29 08:05:55.105380

Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Tax cuts are the priority

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.

Trump savings accounts and so, so much more

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

What's the final cost?

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

In June, Tesla signed an agreement to develop a grid-scale battery power plant in China to help provide the country with a stable supply of clean power for consumers and support its aims for a green transition. However, Tesla will be competing with some of the world’s biggest battery manufacturers for a market share, as it strives to break into new territory, beyond electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.

The U.S.-based EV giant Tesla began as a Silicon Valley startup around two decades ago. Elon Musk joined the company as its chairman and principal funder in 2004, becoming its CEO in 2008. Tesla was viewed as a pioneer in the world of EVs, investing in a new way of driving when most automakers were only just beginning to float the idea. The EV firm dominated the U.S. and European EV market for several years, offering consumers a variety of wholly electric car models ahead of many of its much larger competitors.

The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of over 250 miles, at a time when most competitors were offering far slower EVs with a comparatively low range. By 2020, Tesla held a 60 percent share of the U.S. EV market, a figure that fell to 38 percent in 2024, as hundreds of highly competitive EVs flooded the market.

However, over time, Tesla has become more than just an EV manufacturer. The company has invested in the development of autonomous driving systems, aiming to deliver driverless “robotaxis” to cities worldwide. It also has a burgeoning energy-storage business and is working on developing a humanoid robot, known as Optimus. While its EV business is faltering, as far more fully electric options enter the market, many from reputable automakers and at a lower cost, Tesla remains optimistic about its other projects.

In June, Tesla announced it had signed a deal to develop the largest grid-scale battery power plant of its kind in China. The utility-scale battery storage system will be used to balance the supply and demand of energy to the grid, helping to deliver a stable supply of renewable electricity to consumers. The deal is thought to be worth $556 million.

Tesla’s first battery factory in Shanghai has produced over 100 Megapacks – the batteries used for utility-scale deployment – in the first quarter of the year, according to Tesla. One Megapack can provide up to 1 MW of power for four hours. The company stated, “The grid-side energy storage power station is a ‘smart regulator’ for urban electricity, which can flexibly adjust grid resources.” The use of Megapacks is expected to boost energy security by ensuring that a stable supply of renewable electricity is delivered to consumers.

China has invested heavily in its solar and wind energy sectors for several decades to become the biggest renewable energy power in the world. The Asian giant once again broke records last year when it installed huge quantities of green energy. China’s installed solar and wind power capacity climbed 45.2 percent and 18 percent, respectively, in 2024, according to the National Energy Administration. There is now 886.67 GW of installed solar power, marking an increase from 609.49 GW in 2023, as well as a wind energy capacity of 520 GW. China hit its 2030 renewable energy capacity target in July last year, six years ahead of schedule.

China’s huge renewable energy capacity means that it is vital that the country install utility-scale battery storage at several of its major wind and solar farms to ensure that the clean energy supply is not limited only to the hours of the day in which the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. Battery storage will help China shift its reliance away from fossil fuels in the coming decades as it attempts to decarbonise the economy.

Tesla is competing against China’s CATL and the automaker BYD in developing battery storage. CATL currently holds around 40 percent of the global market share for battery manufacturing, and the firm was previously expected to provide the battery cells and packs used in Tesla’s Megapacks. In addition, Tesla is taking a gamble as the project comes at a time when China is facing a trade war with the U.S., with President Trump having recently imposed high tariffs on Chinese imports.

China now has a grid-scale battery capacity of around 40 GW. However, this will have to grow immensely in the coming years to help meet the country’s green transition aims. In addition, other countries around the world will be looking to expand their utility-scale battery installations, which could lead Tesla to export more batteries from China.

The Baton Rouge lawyer, who just won a $745 million verdict against Chevron for damaging wetlands, is taking on Big Oil in Louisiana and winning. But he’s no tree hugger. Nor, he says, a headline-chasing trial lawyer.

Through three governors’ administrations, he and his firm have navigated political headwinds to keep their lawsuits against oil companies alive. Carmouche has helped quash bills and candidacies that would have threatened his efforts. While his work seeks to make oil companies pay billions for damage they’ve done to the environment, he insists he wants the oil industry to thrive in Louisiana, as long as it doesn’t leave behind a mess.

“I have a Democrat’s heart but I’m a Republican, because I understand business,” Carmouche said, seated at a conference table in his Baton Rouge office, a mosaic of photos of the Louisiana marsh on the wall behind him. “We want the state to thrive. We’re tired of our kids leaving. To bring this state back, we have to take away the oil companies’ liability.”

That means suing them, and getting them to pay for the damage they’ve done to the coast, he says.

Not quite Republican nor Democrat. Neither fully pro-industry nor environmentalist. In Louisiana, taking on oil companies doesn’t just take legal know-how. Carmouche is walking a political tightrope.

He’s about as far from a Birkenstock-wearing environmentalist as anyone could be. He’s built like a small tank with a fitted suit and a Panerai wristwatch. During the recent trial in Plaquemines, he carried a plastic can of Zyn, the trendy nicotine pouches popularized by conservative social media influencers.

“They're very skilled politically. And they're very skilled in the courtroom,” John Barry, the Tulane historian and author who led an unsuccessful effort to sue oil companies over coastal damage, said of Carmouche and his law partners. “They've gone through hell to get where they are.”

Carmouche, 57, and his firm have been suing oil companies for decades. But the April verdict in Plaquemines Parish, a historic win against the oil and gas industry, marks the beginning of a new phase of his fight.

“This is one of the largest verdicts ever won by a local government for environmental damage — not only in the United States, but globally,” Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said after the verdict. “I'm sure the oil companies will vigorously pursue all possible appeals, unless some kind of master settlement is reached first.”

Indeed, Carmouche and his team expected oil companies to come to the table to open settlement negotiations after the trial in Plaquemines. That didn’t happen.

Last week, it became clear why. They were waiting to hear from the Supreme Court, which announced it would hear an argument from the oil companies about whether Carmouche’s lawsuits, and perhaps others like them around the U.S., belong in state or federal court. The companies argue that some of the oil production in question took place under directives from the federal government during World War II, which would justify moving the cases to federal court.

That also means the $745 million verdict — and any payday for Carmouche — is up in the air.

Delays, attorneys argued, are part of Chevron’s strategy.

“They don’t pay until they have to pay,” said Billy Goodell, a private attorney who was previously a Louisiana assistant attorney general for environmental enforcement. “Carmouche is making them pay.”

The oil companies see it differently. They feel that they're being blamed for land loss that should be attributed to the levees along the Mississippi, which have starved coastal wetlands of sediment. Climate change-driven sea level rise has also played a role, they admit.

Beyond that, they say such lawsuits threaten to put a chokehold on the industry in Louisiana, hurting employment and energy production in the process. The companies point out, too, that some of the operations in question occurred before a law they are accused of violating took effect in 1980.

""It’s time to stop incentivizing trial lawyers to pick industry’s pockets and start protecting the future of both our state and the 306,750 people working in and alongside the oil and natural gas industry here every day — because in Louisiana, they’re one and the same,"" Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said in a statement this month.

‘Friends along the coast’

The story of the Carmouche practice starts with his father, Don, who has been practicing since 1966. Does he plan to retire? “No way,” he said.

John argues the cases now — it’s a young man’s game, Don said — but the 84-year-old looks sharp enough to have prosecuted the Plaquemines case himself.

The elder Carmouche served as district attorney in the 23rd Judicial District, which covers Ascension, Assumption and St. James parishes, between 1985 and 1990, when he lost his bid for reelection.

“Thank God he lost,” his law partner, Vic Marcello, recalls. “We had to make money.”

They did just that. Their focus shifted to personal injury work. But Don’s political connections would prove crucial as they turned to environmental litigation.

The firm’s coastal lawsuits, the first of which were filed in 2013, evolved out of what are often called “legacy lawsuits,” cases brought by private landowners against oil companies for pollution done decades ago. But Carmouche’s approach is distinct.

The strategy involves going after major oil companies for failing to abide by state coastal use laws that went into effect in 1980. They went about identifying sites across the coastal zone where major oil companies — Shell, Exxon, Chevron, and the like — once produced oil. Since then, many of the large companies have sold their Louisiana wells to smaller firms.

His coastal litigation focuses on holding the companies that drilled the wells and profited off of them the most accountable. That also allows Carmouche to go after the companies with the deepest pockets.

Rather than representing private landowners, as the Carmouches do in the legacy suits, they represent parishes. To convince coastal parishes to sign on, they leaned on the political connections Don forged as district attorney.

“I had a lot of friends along the coast that I’ve known in my 60 years of being a lawyer,” the elder Carmouche said. “It really wasn’t difficult for any elected official along the coast to clearly see that something should be done, and the state and the parishes just don’t have the funds to do it.”

“And why shouldn’t those companies that destroyed it pay for it? It really wasn’t a difficult sell. They embraced it,” he said.

John stepped in to correct the record: “Not all of them,” he said.

Indeed, Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, two of the largest coastal parishes that historically produced a huge amount of oil, have not joined the lawsuits, even though they would be entitled to funds that result from litigation in the other coastal parishes. The Lafourche Parish Council even passed a resolution this month opposing the litigation. In Plaquemines, which did join the litigation, there was local pushback, fueled by a campaign funded by oil companies.

“The pressure placed on parish officials to sue the largest industries in their parishes is unrelenting and daily,” said Marc Ehrhardt, the executive director for GROW Louisiana, an oil and gas industry advocacy group.

Carmouche does make a strong case to politicians. He has self-funded polls, he said, which indicate that 88% of Louisiana voters think the industry should pay to repair damage to the coast — up from 70% a decade ago.

The pitch to elected officials isn’t subtle: Carmouche believes that if they support his cause, they’ll get reelected.

Different governors, same game

In 2013, when the lawsuits were first filed, Gov. Bobby Jindal was running Louisiana. Carmouche dodged his ire.

“We were getting ready to file these coastal lawsuits when the levee district filed their lawsuit,” Carmouche said, referring to the lawsuit that the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East filed in 2013.

Carmouche would file 42 separate lawsuits related to locations that he alleged were damaged by oil and gas production by specific companies. The flood protection authority would file a single suit, against about 100 companies, alleging broad damage to the Louisiana coast.

That caught Jindal’s attention — and drew it away from Carmouche. “It took his eyes off of the true coastal claim and allowed our lawsuits to move forward,” Carmouche said. “They took the bullet.”

The flood protection authority’s litigation would be struck down by a federal appeals court. Carmouche’s cases continued on.

In 2015, at the end of Jindal’s term, they didn’t wait for the next governor to be elected before moving to ensure that his successor would support their lawsuits. They spent $2 million to fight David Vitter, a Republican U.S. senator at the time.

“When Vitter announced he was going to run, the first thing he said was — ‘I’m going to get rid of legacy lawsuits,'” Marcello said.

“They gave us no choice,” Carmouche said. “They kind of put a gun to our head.”

John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, won the election. The lawsuits continued.

During Edwards’ term, Republican Attorney General — and current governor — Jeff Landry threatened to take over the lawsuits. He would have boxed out Carmouche, installing state lawyers in the cases. Had that happened, Carmouche would not have earned legal fees.

It didn’t happen, and the state ultimately intervened on Carmouche's side.

Carmouche also worked to win over the future governor. He cut Landry’s campaign large checks in 2023; last year, Landry appointed Carmouche to the LSU board of supervisors, a plum gig that comes with free season tickets to sit in the board suite at all LSU football games.

Landry has spoken of wanting to reduce the number of such lawsuits through negotiated settlements, ""where everyone works together to protect our coastal communities.""

In many ways, the oil and gas industry has pursued similar political strategies.

It has had to work with vastly different presidents over the last decade, said Faucheux of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. And the industry has also made substantial political donations in Louisiana over the same time period. Landry tapped Faucheux’s predecessor, Tyler Gray, to run the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

“By going to small communities in Louisiana and promising them billions, they’ve been able to keep communities motivated,” Faucheux said of Carmouche's lawsuits. “That, in turn, keeps policymakers, even at the statewide level, motivated.”

But what, ultimately, motivates Carmouche? He’ll say he’s not in it just for the money, though the money doesn’t hurt. He says he’s a sportsman and loves the outdoors, but that doesn't seem like the main thing.

Perhaps the most convincing theory of what makes Carmouche tick is that he is legitimately fired up by a fight, and the oil industry is giving him one.

Nancy Mace has asked the Trump administration to release roughly $285 million in climate funding approved under President Joe Biden to help finance a Mercedes-Benz plant in her state in its efforts to convert to manufacturing electric vehicles, according to a letter she wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

In the letter, sent privately to Wright on Tuesday and obtained by The Washington Post, the South Carolina Republican asked that the funds be released for the Mercedes-Benz Vans plant, located north of Charleston, because the project will add 800 jobs in her area, the newspaper reported Saturday.

The funding is part of a $1.8 billion program approved during the Biden administration in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act to help at-risk auto plants make electric vehicles and convert supply chains.

However, the Trump administration has been pushing to withhold funding for the Biden-era climate programs, as well as to repeal hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy incentives in its ""big, beautiful bill"" under discussion in the Senate.

The South Carolina Mercedes plant plans to produce a light-duty electric van prototype, which Mace said in her letter will add jobs and capital to the Charleston region — much of which she represents — and would ""ensure America-made options remain available in the commercial vehicle sector.”

She added that while she continues to support President Donald Trump's initiative to cut waste and fraud in government, ""we believe that federal investments should continue to prioritize projects with sustained economic growth.""

Mace spokeswoman Sydney Long said in a statement that securing the grant means a ""major opportunity"" for South Carolina.

She added that the congresswoman has been ""incredibly successful"" in securing grant money, while she's ""always raised concerns about reckless federal spending.""

""But once the money is out the door, she's always fought to bring jobs and investment home to South Carolina,"" said Long. ""Congresswoman Mace has repeatedly stated South Carolina's tax dollars matter just as much as anyone else's. The $285 million grant tied to up to 800 jobs at the Mercedes-Benz Vans plant in North Charleston is a major opportunity for South Carolina.""

Meanwhile, the Energy Department said it's undergoing a department-wide review to determine that all its activities ""follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration's priorities"" and that the administration has a ""mandate"" to restore ""American Energy Dominance.""

Trump, shortly after taking office, signed an executive order to pause the disbursement of funding approved through the Inflation Reduction Act, along with other climate-related money from the bipartisan infrastructure law that was approved earlier in the Biden administration.

Republicans in Congress have supported efforts to rescind the clean energy funds, but Democrats say Trump's fight against clean energy funding is leading GOP lawmakers to hurt their own constituents.

According to an analysis last year by the bipartisan E2 group, roughly 85% of the money unlocked by the 2022 law was invested in Republican districts.

Bayview Kenworth rolled out new, more powerful, natural gas model

You may see a transport truck on the highway with no smoke billowing out of its tall chrome pipes.

That's because the fuel the truck runs on is natural gas, not traditional diesel fuel that the trucking industry is accustomed to.

Bayview Kenworth, which has locations throughout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, just put the final polish on its new T880 model, claiming its Cummins X15N engine rivals its diesel counterpart.

The single truck was sold in Fredericton and will be the first one east of Montreal to hit the road.

""This is a great alternative to get you as close to zero emissions as possible, but still have all the same characteristics as diesel — similar range, same power, same capabilities,"" said Chris Nagle, vice-president of sales for Bayview Kenworth.

The truck's emissions are 90 per cent below thresholds currently set by the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and Environmental Protection Agency, according to Nagle.

The CEPA and EPA governs emissions in Canada and the U.S. respectively. With trucks moving between borders couriers need to be compliant with both sets of regulations.

The new model has a single exhaust pipe below the truck that is more comparable in size to a pickup truck.

Lower emissions don't mean a sacrifice in power, Nagle says, noting the truck still produces 500 horsepower.

In comparison, one of Bayview Kenworth's diesel T880s makes 565 horsepower and the same amount of torque.

""Currently one of the most feasible options out there, for especially our long haul members for alternative fuels, would be compressed natural gas,"" said Chris McKee, the executive director of the Atlantic Provinces Trucking Association.

The diesel and natural gas models also have the same engine block, which is helpful for repair. The only hardware difference is the engine head and fueling system.

Its fuel comes from five compressed natural gas cylinders that are stacked horizontally behind the cab of the truck. The fuelling system costs $70,000, bringing the truck's total price tag to around $400,000, which is about $100,000 more than the diesel equivalent.

Truckers can refuel those tanks in other parts of Canada and the U.S., but there aren't any refuelling stations in Atlantic Canada.

The truck, which is being purchased by Irving Oil, can only be refuelled at the Lincoln natural gas station, which sits between Fredericton and Oromocto.

McKee said that couriers would have to either set up their own refuelling station or have a mobile refuelling service travel to them, which would be an additional cost.

The cost of just the fuel would be cheaper than diesel, and the range is also similar, he said.

Nagle hopes refuelling becomes easier and more of these state-of-the-art trucks can roll off his lots.

""It's almost like the chicken or the egg. If we go back to the automobile industry 100 years ago, you know what came first, the car or the gas station. So as we go down this footpath with, you know, the initiative to go green, you're going to see more and more.""

Past and future of natural gas power

The new truck isn't the first to run off natural gas. Cummins made a previous model on the X12 engine block, but its power wasn't sufficient to rival diesel trucks.

""X12 is a great engine, but you couldn't get the power that this one delivered, which would limit you to the application of what you can haul,"" said Nagle.

Irving Oil has four X12s in its fleet and is looking to buy more new natural gas trucks that offer more power.

McKee said that natural gas power has grown in ""considerable popularity"" as an alternative to diesel over electric and hydrogen.

Both McKee and Nagle said that the range of fuel sources work for different applications, such as electric for short-haul deliveries.

""There's no real one-size-fits-all from what we can determine in terms of what alternative fuels could be. So you know, I don't think we're going to ever have a clear winner,"" said McKee.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-29 09:02:29.872758

Consider energy storage ETFs like the SOLR (Solar Energy ETF) for diversified exposure.","The U.S. renewable energy landscape is undergoing a seismic shift as the Senate's proposed tax incentive phase-out accelerates deadlines for wind and solar projects. This regulatory pivot creates both urgency and opportunity for investors, demanding a reevaluation of portfolios to capitalize on near-term development booms and structural shifts. Below, we dissect the implications for project timelines, capital allocation, and actionable investment strategies.

Regulatory Timeline and Key Exceptions: A Clock is Ticking

The Senate's amendments to the One Big Beautiful Bill introduce a stark phased reduction for solar and wind tax credits:

- 2026: Credits drop to 60% of their full value.

- 2027: Further reduced to 20%.

- 2028: Credits eliminated entirely for projects starting construction after 2027.

Projects must begin construction by December 31, 2025, to qualify for the full 100% credit. Two exceptions offer reprieve:

1. Energy Storage Collocation: Projects pairing solar/wind with energy storage systems retain full credit eligibility.

2. Large-Scale Federal Land Projects: Facilities exceeding 1 GW with at least 25% of capacity on federal land (leased before June 16, 2025) are exempt.

Impact on Project Timelines: A Race Against Time

The phase-out creates a gold rush dynamic for developers, with two critical deadlines:

1. 2025: Start construction to lock in maximum credits.

2. 2028: Place projects in service before the credit sunsets entirely.

This urgency could strain supply chains, particularly for components like turbines, inverters, and critical minerals. Developers reliant on foreign suppliers face added pressure due to rising domestic content requirements:

- 2026: 50% U.S.-made components (35% for offshore wind).

- 2028+: 55% domestic content.

Capital Allocation Opportunities: Where to Deploy Now

Domestic Manufacturing Plays:

Companies with strong U.S. production capacity for solar panels, wind turbines, or energy storage components will thrive. Examples include:

First Solar (FSLR): Leading in U.S. solar manufacturing.

Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY): A global turbine maker with U.S. production facilities.

Tesla (TSLA): Dominant in energy storage (Powerpack systems).

Energy Storage Specialists:

Companies enabling colocation of storage with renewables stand to gain. Consider:

Fluor Corporation (FLR): Provides engineering for large-scale storage projects.

NextEra Energy (NEE): Already integrates storage into its wind/solar portfolio.

Federal Land Developers:

Firms with existing federal land leases or permits for large projects (e.g., >1 GW) can secure exemptions. Look to:

Pattern Energy (PEGI): Focuses on utility-scale solar/wind.

AES Corporation (AES): Active in large-scale renewable projects.

Risks and Considerations

Supply Chain Bottlenecks: A rush to meet deadlines could inflate costs for components. Monitor companies with vertically integrated supply chains.

Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFEs): Developers using PFE-linked materials (e.g., Chinese-manufactured parts) risk losing credits post-2025. Avoid firms overly reliant on foreign suppliers.

Regulatory Uncertainty: The Senate and House must reconcile differences; track progress toward a final bill by July 4, 2025.

Actionable Investment Strategies

Short-Term Plays:

Invest in domestic manufacturing stocks (FSLR, FLR) ahead of the 2025 construction rush.

Consider energy storage ETFs like the SOLR (Solar Energy ETF) for diversified exposure.

Long-Term Themes:

Energy Storage: Companies like Tesla and Fluor will benefit from colocation incentives.

Federal Land Projects: Invest in developers with existing leases (Pattern Energy, AES).

Avoid:

Firms with heavy reliance on foreign supply chains (e.g., offshore wind projects without domestic content compliance).

Conclusion: Time to Pivot

The Senate's phase-out timeline is a clarion call for investors to reallocate capital toward U.S.-centric renewable energy plays. The window to secure maximum tax benefits is narrowing, but the opportunities for those positioned correctly—whether through domestic manufacturing, storage integration, or federal land projects—are vast. Monitor deadlines closely and prioritize agility in shifting portfolios to align with this regulatory reality.",,N,,2025-06-29 12:13:21.213152

And so it was, last week, in the case of two highly polluting Maine paper mills, one in Rumford and one in Skowhegan, named among the dirtiest in America.

By continuing to burn coal and tires — yes, tires — among other dirty fuels, these plants are filling the air we breathe with hazardous pollutants and warming the climate in the process.

According to the study, “A Paper Trail of Pollution,” conducted over six months by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project, paper industry pollution, driven by dirty fuels and “badly outdated industrial equipment” (the average age of these mills’ boilers was a bewildering 41 years), is grossly underreported — to the tune of 350%. The study included five plants in Maine, all but one originally built more than 100 years ago.

Paper mills’ generation of “biogenic” emissions (from wood and wood byproducts, ethanol, biodiesel and biomass waste) aren’t tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Since July of 2022, thankfully, Maine has been tracking those emissions. Now we just need our leaders to act on the data.

As reporting on the study by the Maine Monitor pointed out, Maine is home to two of the last remaining paper plants in America burning tires as fuel.

The opening words of the watchdog study, which is to be commended for its clarity and accessibility, strike a peacebuilding note. “Paper mills are woven into the fabric of the modern world,” the authors note, “manufacturing a wide range of products essential for daily life.”

These mills are woven very tightly, too, into the cultural and economic fabric of Maine. According to a 2021 report from the Maine Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability on the so-so uptake of a tax credit designed to revive the paper industry, average employment in pulp and paper mills dropped by 72% in Maine and 51% in the U.S. between 2000 and 2020. Even then, Maine had the highest concentration of private-sector employment in these mills of any U.S. state, 10 times the national average.

The digital age has been unkind to an industry that once handsomely supported tens of thousands of Mainers. Twenty-five years ago, there were 52 private Maine firms involved in papermaking. Fifteen years ago, there were 37. Five years ago, that number had fallen to just 19.

The commitment of successive administrations to the survival of this endangered species has been plain to see. In 2021, when the Sappi mill in Skowhegan was threatened by a proposed dam removal, Gov. Janet Mills issued a spirited letter to employees. “The Sappi mill is critical to Skowhegan, the surrounding region, and the state of Maine, providing good-paying jobs to Maine people and an important tax base for local residents,” the letter read.

“As one of the last remaining pulp mills in the state, it is also an integral component of our forest economy supply chain, supporting landowners, loggers and truckers, among others. Closure of this mill, and the resulting ripple effect across the industry, including job losses, would not be acceptable to me — and I will not allow it to happen. My administration’s commitment to the mill is clear and unwavering.”

Maine can and should make every effort to support and future-proof industries with a strong and especially valuable foothold in the state. When it comes to our remaining paper mills, however, relying on the existing EPA emissions framework does us a grave disservice.

With a freshly codified goal of 100% clean energy by 2040 and with a view to both protecting the health of local residents and slashing greenhouse gas emissions, it’s time to be clear and unwavering about modernizing and cleaning up these operations.",https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/42452054_SJ.RUMndpapertires.0627258-1750969026.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-06-29 09:02:34.747452

What do you do with a tangle of pipes, furnaces and crackers like the Grangemouth refinery?","Every morning in Grangemouth, chemists at Celtic Renewables’s small factory feed a vial of microbes with a precisely tailored cocktail of food – liquid residues from the scotch whisky industry.

In vessels surrounded by a web of metal pipes and gleaming stainless steel valves, the microbes multiply into something other than drink: a starter solution for batches of acetone, butanol and ethanol – chemicals essential for countless everyday products.

Celtic Renewables wants more: a plant 10 times its current size. That could form part of plans to sustain Scotland’s chemicals industry after Grangemouth sustained a crushing blow: the closure of the 100-year-old refinery in April, with the loss of 400 jobs. The huge complex will be reduced to a fuel import terminal, staffed by only 75 people. As many as 4,600 jobs in the refinery’s supply chain could also be affected.

That closure has made Grangemouth one of the earliest tests of a “just transition”: the idea that the economy can move relatively painlessly from fossil fuels to net zero, helped along by judicious government interventions to spur new jobs in place of the old.

The Labour government fears that failure could mean voters turn their backs on it – and on the pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – throughout what remains of Scotland’s largely fossil fuel-dependent industry. Climate action by government remains popular in Britain, but parties on the right, and particularly Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, believe opposition to net zero can win them power.

As the government this week unveiled a new industrial strategy, this article – the second in a series on the battle for Britain’s deindustrialised areas – looks at the future for one of Scotland’s industrial icons.

After the second world war, deindustrialisation wiped out much of the coal mining, shipbuilding and steelmaking that dominated employment in Scotland’s central belt from Glasgow to Edinburgh. While those industries all but disappeared, Grangemouth held out, refining crude oil to feed Scotland’s cars and planes taking off from Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Grangemouth’s refinery traces its history back to 1924, making it the second oldest in Europe, but since 2005 it has been part of Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos chemicals empire. Ratcliffe’s investments bolted together assets that others did not want, and generated huge profits. Ineos agreed a deal in 2011 for Chinese state-owned PetroChina to partner in a joint venture, Petroineos.

Expensive energy

Petroineos executives argued in Scottish parliamentary hearings that Grangemouth was not able to compete with newer, more efficient plants in the Middle East and Africa. UK chemicals output has slumped 42% since peaking in March 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Ratcliffe has faced significant criticism for cutting jobs in chemicals and at Manchester United Football Club – which he took control of last year. But he has claimed that it was UK energy policy, not his decisions, that made Grangemouth unviable. Chemicals companies report UK energy costs are five times higher than in the US and well over double those in the EU, according to the Chemical Industries Association, a lobby group. Ratcliffe is also a staunch opponent of carbon taxes on businesses.

“We are witnessing the extinction of one of our major industries as chemical manufacture has the life squeezed out of it,” Ratcliffe told the Financial Times in January. Deindustrialising Britain achieves “nothing for the environment,” he said. “It merely shifts production and emissions elsewhere.”

Cutting energy costs was the flagship measure of the government’s industrial strategy, with exemptions for chemicals businesses for the costs of renewable energy programmes and discounts for levies to fund the grid. The measures did not include short-term help on driving down wholesale prices, the key complaint of big energy users.

What do you do with a tangle of pipes, furnaces and crackers like the Grangemouth refinery? A Scottish government-funded study, known as Project Willow, described nine options for chemical industries that could happen on the site, including plastics recycling, making chemicals from wood, or – perhaps most ardently desired – making so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Westminster has set aside £200m to support private sector investments at Grangemouth, plus £25m from the Scottish government, to support projects. Senior government sources said more money could be available if the right projects come up.

Yet each of those options comes with a price tag, ranging from the relatively manageable (£15m for turning organic waste into methane, with up to 70 jobs) to the truly enormous (up to £2.1bn for a SAF plant, and 270 jobs).

The transition does not feel pain-free in Grangemouth town centre, with the refinery chimneys visible from the end of the road. A pleasant park, rows of sandstone homes and later semi-detached houses evidence the prosperity of the early 1900s and the boom times of the 60s and 70s, but the town also has several areas counted among the 10% most deprived in Scotland. Manufacturing in 2023 accounted for 11.1% of jobs in the broader Falkirk council area. That compared with 6.9% across Scotland that year – down from 35% in 1951.

‘You don’t see anybody’

Mohammad Saleem, the shopkeeper at Sweet Talk, is already feeling the effects of the refinery closure, and has cut back opening hours, with fewer workers passing through to grab chocolate or a paper on the way to work.

“Quiet,” is his description of business in recent months. “It used to be good before corona. After corona, that’s it. This time, lunchtime, you would see crowds. Now you don’t see anybody.”

“It’s a disgrace,” said another shopkeeper in the centre. “But what can you do?”

Marilyn McIlvaney, the secretary of the Kersiebank Community Project, a volunteer-run charity shop that runs a food bank, said they had seen more people under pressure in the weeks since the closure of the refinery. Redundant workers got a relatively generous 18 months of pay, but they are still tightening belts.

“They’re cutting back,” she said. “It’s having a knock-on to the other businesses. It’s getting worse. Food banks are queueing out the doors – some of them [users] are working.”

The question now for workers is whether Project Willow jobs come through before they have to look elsewhere. Those hopes are looking increasingly forlorn, according to Cliff Bowen, who has worked at Grangemouth for 33 years, and is now a convener for Unite, a union. He argues that the political implications will be huge.

“All we asked for is another couple of years until these technologies come online,” Bowen said. “It breaks my heart. Labour are done for a generation in this area.”

Bowen, a lifelong Labour supporter whose anger is palpable, believes that Reform UK will benefit from the loss of jobs at Grangemouth, and throughout Scotland’s oil and gas economy, because it appears to offer a chance for those businesses to continue to operate.

“They’re talking sense when it comes to energy supply,” said Bowen. “People are going to vote for that, regardless of the colour on their rosette.”

Reform’s support is notably strong in areas around other refineries: near Stanlow refinery it won the Runcorn Westminster byelection, while Reform is leading Westminster polls in each of the constituencies that host the UK’s other refineries at Fawley in Hampshire, Pembroke in west Wales, and the plants at Humber and Lindsey in Lincolnshire. Richard Tice, the Reform deputy leader, said: “Reform will scrap net zero which will enable lower energy costs and investment in the chemicals and refining industries, thus creating jobs and leading to the reopening of Grangemouth.”

That prescription is not seen as realistic by industry experts, even if big subsidies were offered. It would also lead to continued UK carbon emissions: the refinery was responsible for more than a quarter of all Scotland’s carbon. Yet the pledge may resonate with people struggling to find work.

Labour managed a surprise victory in a Scottish parliamentary byelection earlier this month in Hamilton – leaving the Scottish National party (SNP) in second and Reform a close third. Yet Brian Leishman, who won Grangemouth back for Labour only last year in the Westminster general election, said the closure was a “failure from the political class” – including Labour, after it failed to live up to a pre-election pledge by the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, to “step in to save the jobs at the refinery”. The SNP is keen to win back an area it held for nearly a decade at Westminster, but also has limited room for manoeuvre because of its nearly two decades leading the Scottish government.

Leishman argued that the government should take ownership stakes in return for Project Willow funding, to prevent the area being vulnerable to the whims of distant bosses in the future. He said that Labour needed to invest in Scotland if it wanted to hold on to its previous gains.

“If you give people good jobs, good life chances, that’s now you get a second term,” he said. “If you do the basics of government well and you improve people’s living standards, you’ll beat Reform.”

Looking for answers

Scottish Enterprise, the lead agency on Project Willow, is hopeful that some of the interest will translate into action soon.

Jane Martin, the managing director for innovation and investment, said she was “aware of the need for short-term wins to turn the narrative around”. The agency is working to triage projects, and work out which will be most likely to succeed. They are a mix of “inside the fence” at the refinery, and others outside.

“Project Willow is a really important lever but we are not only focused on those technologies,” Martin said. “We’re not shutting anything down at this stage.”

It does appear increasingly unlikely that a single employer will emerge to replace the refinery’s jobs. One much vaunted possibility was an investment to produce SAF to meet the UK’s mandate of 10% of all aviation fuel by 2030.

However, Michael Liebreich, a clean energy expert, said SAF was still seen as too risky for investors. SAF production (either from biological sources or using green hydrogen) is still several times more expensive than refining oil into kerosene, and nobody has dared to make the huge investment needed without a cast-iron guarantee that the product will be bought.

There does not appear to be much hope for a neat solution. The question now appears to be whether smaller projects can let the town retain a chemical industry. That could allow it to salvage something from the devastation of the refinery’s closure – and prove whether a messy transition can also be just.

The Senate is currently finalizing its version of the GOP’s budget and tax bill, better known as Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, that passed the House last month.

As expected, the entire thing looks like it’s coming straight out of a fossil fuel industry wet dream, which should not be surprising considering Trump told the oil industry he would do this if they gave him over $1 billion, which they did.

The only person who appears surprised is Elon Musk, even though Trump and the GOP campaigned on doing this with his own money.

While it has been clear for a while that they are going to eliminate all incentives for electric vehicles and renewable energy, we have been reporting on the evolving details about how it will happen over the last few months.

As of earlier this month, the plan was to end the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles 180 days after the bill was signed, which they aim to achieve by July 4th, with a provision for automakers who have delivered fewer than 200,000 EVs in the US.

The Senate has now released an updated version of the bill that now kills the electric vehicle tax credit altogether by September 30th:

IN GENERAL.—Section 30D(h) is amended by striking ‘‘placed in service after December 31, 2032’’ and inserting ‘‘acquired after September 30, 2025’’

The new bill also accelerates the phase-out of incentives for solar, wind, and energy storage projects, while adding additional taxes if they use any materials from China.

Electrek’s Take

The US is already significantly behind the rest of the world in terms of EV adoption, and this will only increase this gap.

It will only further isolate the US from the world’s transition to electric vehicles and make the domestic auto industry uncompetitive on the world stage.

Ironically, Tesla, whose CEO helped make this happen by giving Trump and the GOP $300 million, is going to be the most affected.

“The other issue is that there are 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the Senate.
That means every single Republican vote will count,” Hanna added.
In the end, Wisconsin Senator Johnson flipped his no vote to yes, leaving only Paul and Tillis opposed among Republicans.
“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,” he wrote on X.","The Republican-controlled Senate of the United States has voted to take President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” into the next phase of discussion, making it more likely to pass in the coming days.

The measure, which is Trump’s top legislative goal, passed its first procedural hurdle in a 51 to 49 vote on Saturday, with two Republican senators joining all Democrats in voting against it.

The result came after several hours of negotiation as Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance sought to persuade last-minute holdouts in a series of closed-door negotiations.

Trump has pushed his party to get the bill passed and on his desk for him to sign into law by July 4, the US’s Independence Day.

He was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, according to a senior White House official.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, said the 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was released shortly before midnight on Friday, and senators are still attempting to understand exactly what it means.

“One of the clear things in the bill is that it provides a $150bn boost to military spending. It also adds funding for mass deportations and building that border wall. Now, in order to get this money, there are cuts to Medicare, the federal health insurance programme for people aged 65 and older, as well as to the Clean Energy funding programme,” Hanna said.

The latter programme provides the tax incentives for renewable energy and was put in place under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.

“The other issue is that there are 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the Senate. Now all the Democrats are opposed to the bill. That means every single Republican vote will count,” Hanna added.

The procedural vote on Saturday, which would start a debate on the megabill, began after hours of delay.

It then remained open for more than three hours of standstill as three Republican senators – Thom Tillis, Ron Johnson and Rand Paul – joined Democrats to oppose the legislation.

Three others – Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis – negotiated with Republican leaders into the night in hopes of securing bigger spending cuts.

In the end, Wisconsin Senator Johnson flipped his no vote to yes, leaving only Paul and Tillis opposed among Republicans.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans unveiled the bill “in the dead of night” and are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what is in it.

He immediately forced a full reading of the text in the Senate, which would take an estimated 15 hours.

“Future generations will be saddled with trillions in debt. Debt is abstract, but what does it mean for the average American? Raising your costs, raising your costs to buy a home, raising your costs to buy a car, raising your costs on credit card bills. And why are they doing all this?” he asked.

“Why are they doing the biggest Medicaid cuts in history? Now, it’s getting close to a trillion dollars, just in Medicaid alone. All to cut taxes for the ultra-rich and special interests.”

Elon Musk renews criticism

If passed in the Senate, the bill would go back to the House of Representatives for approval, where Republicans can only afford to lose a handful of votes – and are facing stiff opposition from within their own ranks.

Republicans are split on the Medicaid cuts, which will threaten dozens of rural hospitals and lead to an estimated 8.6 million Americans being deprived of healthcare.

Nonpartisan analysts estimate that a version of Trump’s tax cut and spending bill would add trillions to the $36.2 trillion US government debt. They also say that the bill would pave the way for a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest 10 percent of Americans to the richest.

The bill is unpopular across multiple demographic, age and income groups, according to extensive recent polling.

On Saturday, billionaire Elon Musk, with whom Trump had a public falling out this month over his censure of the bill, again doubled down that criticism.

The Tesla and Space X CEO called the package “utterly insane and destructive”.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,” he wrote on X. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

He later posted that the bill would be “political suicide for the Republican Party”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-29T032424Z_1342896955_RC23CFAF2FCI_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-TAX-1751172485_40c594-1751172656.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80,N,,2025-06-29 06:04:26.097290

A residential energy credit that has benefitted solar-leasing companies such as Sunrun Inc., would expire at the end of 2025 in the current legislation.
“Any senator who votes for this bill is voting for higher energy prices, a weaker economy, and a less secure America,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement.
Other tweaks made in the new version of the bill includes a quicker end to a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles.
House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Thursday the House will need to reverse the Senate’s move to extend a slew of clean energy tax credits.","Key tax incentives for US wind and solar projects would face a more aggressive phase-out in the Senate’s latest version of President Donald Trump’s spending package.

The tweak, which follows pushback by Trump on the Inflation Reduction Act credits, would sharply limit the number of solar and wind farms that qualify for incentives, appeasing opponents while risking the ire of moderate members who argued for a slower phase-out.

Under the new version of the $4.2 trillion tax and spending package released late Friday, wind and solar projects would need to be up and running by the end of 2027 to receive a pair of lucrative incentives for clean energy production.

The initial version released by the Senate’s tax-writing committee simply required projects to start construction by the end of 2025 to get the incentives’ full value.

“This is a huge problem for wind and solar developers, who thought they would have at least four years to finish projects that started in 2025,” said James Lucier, managing director at research group Capital Alpha Partners.

If it becomes law, the change could be a blow to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, which has an inventory of projects that qualified as starting construction in 2025, Lucier said.

The legislation also adds a new tax on wind and solar projects that don’t meet strict restrictions against the use of Chinese materials, as well as adds the production of coal used in steel making to an existing tax credit for clean energy technology such as wind turbines and solar panels.

A residential energy credit that has benefitted solar-leasing companies such as Sunrun Inc., would expire at the end of 2025 in the current legislation. But it restores access to a separate investment tax credit until the end of 2027 that an earlier version of the bill removed, Charlotte Jenkins, a vice president at research firm Capstone LLC, said in an email. Still, the tweak wasn’t enough to stop the solar industry from slamming the bill.

“Any senator who votes for this bill is voting for higher energy prices, a weaker economy, and a less secure America,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement. “And they’ll have to answer for it when families open their utility bills, when workers lose their paychecks, and when voters head to the polls.“

The bill does include a longer phase-out of a tax credit for hydrogen production used by companies such as Plug Power Inc. While the initial version of the legislation ended the credit after this year, the new version allows it to remain until 2028.

Other tweaks made in the new version of the bill includes a quicker end to a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles.

While the earlier proposal would have ended the incentive at the end of this year for most EV sales, the new version terminates the credit after September 30, 2025. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.

The tweaks reflect House Republican resistance to the more generous timetables. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Thursday the House will need to reverse the Senate’s move to extend a slew of clean energy tax credits.

“We had a lot of back and forth over getting that language right to keep it tight,” Scalise said. Trump “is where we are, if not more aggressive, in getting rid of it,” he said.

The changes, however, do not seem to be solving all of the GOP’s problems, with House Republicans still voicing opposition to the language.
“Instead of improving the Medicaid and energy portions of [the] House bill it appears the Senate went backwards,” he told The Hill.","The Senate’s version of the “big, beautiful bill” is facing serious headwinds in the House with The Hill learning that at least six House Republicans are currently a “no” on the framework, a daunting sign for GOP leadership as the Senate races towards a vote.

Those six House Republicans, some of whom requested anonymity, are enough opposition to tank the package, as GOP leaders grapple with a razor-thin majority. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who was one of two GOP lawmakers to oppose the House version of the bill last month, is also likely to oppose the Senate’s edition, deepening the pocket of resistance in the lower chamber.

Republicans can only afford to lose three votes and still clear the legislation, assuming full attendance and united Democratic opposition.

“I support the reasonable provisions in H.R. 1 that protect Medicaid’s long-term viability and ensure the program continues to serve our most vulnerable, but I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams our hospitals rely on, including provider taxes and state directed payments, or any provisions that punish expansion states,” Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) wrote in a statement on Saturday.

“President Trump was clear when he said to root out our waste, fraud, and abuse without cutting Medicaid and I wholeheartedly agree,” he continued. “I urge my Senate colleagues to stick to the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1 — otherwise I will vote no.”

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) told The Hill that he is also opposed to the bill because of the Medicaid provider tax provision. Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) is currently a “no” on the measure because of the Medicaid language, rollback of solar energy credits and public lands provisions, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.

Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), meanwhile, told The Hill that he is against the current version of the package because of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap proposal. The legislation would increase the currently $10,000 SALT cap to $40,000 for individuals making $500,000 or less for five years, then snap back to the original number.

“While I support the President’s broader agenda, how could I support the same unfair $10k SALT cap I’ve spent years criticizing?” LaLota said. “A permanent $40k deduction cap with income thresholds of $225k for single filers and $450k for joint filers would earn my vote.”

It is not, however, just moderates who are signaling issues with the Senate bill: Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, posted an ominous message on X that suggested he was not pleased with the package.

“I will not negotiate via X. But it’s important to know that jamming us with a bill before we’ve had any chance to review the implications of major changes & re-writes, fluid scores, a high likelihood of violating the house framework (deficits) , & tons of swamp buy-offs is bad,” he wrote.

The opposition is rising to the surface as Senate Republicans inch closer to holding an initial vote on the “big, beautiful bill,” which would officially kick off the consideration process and eventually tee up a final vote in the House. It remains unclear, however, if Senate GOP leaders have the votes to move forward.

If the motion to proceed passes by a simple majority, the chamber would hold a series of unlimited amendment votes called a vote-a-rama, which could result in changes to the measure. Senate GOP leaders are also still talking to holdouts and could make changes to the bill as written.

In the meantime, House Republicans — beginning to review the revised Senate text unveiled overnight — are expressing resistance to the measure, prompting serious questions about whether top GOP lawmakers will be able to enact the legislation by their self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) convened a call with the House Republican Conference Saturday afternoon and urged lawmakers to keep their concerns with the Senate bill private, and instead speak directly with their senators and the White House, two sources told The Hill.

Senate Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told members that it is unlikely they will have to return to Washington on Monday, the sources said. Tuesday or Wednesday is more realistic, he told lawmakers.

One source told The Hill that the call was brief and leadership did not take questions.

The main qualm among House Republicans appears to be the Medicaid language in the bill. The Senate’s legislation includes a proposal that would effectively cap provider taxes at 3.5 percent by 2031, down from the current 6 percent, but only for the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

The decrease was initially supposed to begin in 2027, with a 0.5 percent phase down annually, but Senate Republicans overnight changed the text to delay the implementation to 2028. The upper chamber also inserted a provision to create a $25 billion rural hospital relief fund that would be distributed over five years to assuage those concerns.

The changes, however, do not seem to be solving all of the GOP’s problems, with House Republicans still voicing opposition to the language.

Aside from Medicaid, the Senate bill’s rollback of green-energy tax credits is an issue for some House Republicans. The revised legislation for the upper chamber slashes tax incentives for wind and solar energy and adds a new tax on future wind and solar projects.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) would not say how he plans to vote on the bill, but signaled that he is not happy with the Medicaid provisions and green-energy tax credit language.

That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party's narrow House majority.","The Republican-controlled US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's, sweeping tax-cut and spending bill on Saturday, during a marathon weekend session marked by political drama, division and lengthy delays as Democrats sought to slow the legislation's path to passage.

Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump's fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president's top immigration, border, tax-cut and military priorities.

Trump on social media hailed the ""great victory"" for his ""great, big, beautiful bill.""

After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber - a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.

Democrats say the bill's tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.

Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a ""vote-a-rama,"" before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.

Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.

Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill's cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.

""Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against 'Senator Thom' Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,"" the president posted.

Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5 trillion.

""Did Rand Paul Vote 'NO' again tonight? What's wrong with this guy???"" Trump said on social media.

IN LIMBO

Saturday's vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals if any were struck to win over their support.

Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.

Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.

The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump's main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.

The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill's tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5 trillion over the next decade, increasing the $36.2-trillion US government debt.

The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4 trillion.

The world's richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.

Calling the bill ""utterly insane and destructive,"" he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.

""The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!"" Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.

MEDICAID CHANGES

Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for Medicaid providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.

The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1% inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.

That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party's narrow House majority.

Republicans are using a legislative maneuver to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.

Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.

The bill also would raise the Treasury Department's debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation's debt in the coming months.

If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.",https://mmo.aiircdn.com/265/5fa3dbdcad14f.png,N,,2025-06-29 08:06:06.072667

India's top paint makers are navigating a turbulent phase marked by margin pressures, weak urban demand, and intense price-based competition, even as they pin hopes on a modest recovery in FY26. According to news agency PTI, companies such as Asian Paints, Berger Paints, and Kansai Nerolac reported muted growth in FY25 amid increased discounting and a shift in consumer preferences towards affordable options. Asian Paints, which commands over 50% of the domestic decorative paints market, acknowledged the growing strain from aggressive pricing adopted by both established rivals and new entrants. “These dynamics affected the value realisations as well as the profitability for Asian Paints throughout the year,” vice-chairman Manish Choksi said during the company’s AGM, as cited by PTI. He noted that subdued discretionary spending extended repainting and maintenance cycles, while “consumers were also moving towards more affordable options, even within the premium segments.” In FY25, Asian Paints recorded a 5.7% decline in revenue from decorative paints despite a 2.5% growth in volumes—signalling increased downtrading and pricing pressures. Choksi highlighted that challenges were compounded by ""a flat market"" and the emergence of aggressive competition. According to PTI, Kansai Nerolac Paints flagged similar concerns. In its annual report, it observed, “The Indian paints industry demonstrated resilience in the face of subdued demand and intensifying competitive pressures.” While rural demand remained muted, a slight pickup was seen from the third quarter. Berger Paints also pointed to the “full-year effect of FY24 price reductions” and ""softer consumer demand"" affecting its standalone value growth. The Indian decorative paints market, traditionally dominated by a handful of players such as Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac, Akzo Nobel India, and Indigo Paints, has seen significant churn in recent years. Major conglomerates such as Grasim (Birla Opus), JSW Paints, Pidilite (Haisha Paints), and Astral (which acquired Gem Paints) have entered the fray. Last week, JSW Paints added to the consolidation trend by acquiring a controlling stake in Akzo Nobel India Ltd, the maker of Dulux Paints, for Rs 12,915 crore. Despite a difficult FY25, paint companies see a more optimistic outlook for FY26. “The decorative segment is poised for an improved performance, underpinned by a rebound in urban demand, driven by higher disposable incomes from recent tax incentives and easing inflation,” said Berger Paints in its latest earnings update. Kansai Nerolac echoed the sentiment, predicting modest growth ahead. “In the decorative segment, growth will be supported by higher disposable incomes, premiumisation trends, a rising consumer preference for eco-friendly products, and government initiatives such as the 'Housing for All' programme and the 'Smart Cities Mission’,” the company said. According to an ICICI Direct report cited by PTI, the Indian paints and coatings market is valued at $9.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.38% to reach $15.04 billion by 2029.

Electrek reports that SolarEdge, which makes solar batteries for home use, is now an approved partner for the Wattsmart Battery program. That program provides incentives to Washington and Oregon homeowners who install solar batteries.

Under the program, homeowners can get paid up to $3,000 per SolarEdge battery if they allow Pacific Power to use their stored energy to help support the grid. Homeowners can earn $600 per kilowatt, up to that $3,000 limit, for up to two batteries.

Commercial customers can also earn money at the same rate, but with a higher cap of 30 kilowatts.

In exchange for the payments, Pacific Power gets additional clean energy that lets it regulate and balance the grid in real time.

SolarEdge North America general manager Mary Rogers told Electrek: ""It's a smarter, cleaner, and more cost-effective way to maximize backup power and savings.""

The program isn't only for newly installed solar panels, either. Pacific Power says existing solar customers who add a battery can take part in the program and that it won't impact their current rates.

Pacific Power also runs similar programs in other states. Other power companies, such as Rocky Mountain Power, also run similar ""virtual power plant"" programs that pay homeowners.

Battery storage can be important when combined with renewable-energy sources, such as solar and wind. The sun doesn't shine all day, and every minute isn't windy, so solar and wind provide energy intermittently. Battery storage allows that energy to be available at all times, even during blackouts.

Virtual power plants are becoming more common among energy companies. By using software to connect multiple small-scale power sources, such as storage batteries or wind turbines, companies create these virtual plants, which combine into a large network of clean energy that can provide power to all customers around the clock.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SolarEdge-Battery-Programimage-recj2Z7y4IIuX0s6v-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 08:05:19.159483

That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.

He currently serves as chair of the South Carolina Solar Council, championing an all-hands-on-deck approach to the clean energy transition, with a strong focus on the power and potential of solar.","South Carolina has quietly become a solar success story.

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.

But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.

At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.

For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.

But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.

This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.

That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.

And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.

South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.

The broader economic impact is no less troubling.

A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.

By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.

And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.

In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.

Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.

Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.

This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.

Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.

Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.

Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).

The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.

Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.

This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.

Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.

Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.

Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.

They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.

As global demand for low-carbon fuels surges, Linde's Louisiana bet is one that's likely to pay off.","Linde's $400 million air separation unit (ASU) project in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, marks a pivotal moment in the global energy transition. By anchoring its latest infrastructure investment within the RiverPlex MegaPark—a 17,000-acre industrial hub—the company is positioning itself at the intersection of decarbonization, economic growth, and technological innovation. This project, which will supply critical oxygen and nitrogen for low-carbon ammonia production, exemplifies how strategic infrastructure can drive both environmental progress and job creation.

Economic Impact: A Catalyst for High-Wage Jobs and Regional Growth

The ASU is more than a factory; it's an economic multiplier. Linde's investment will directly create 15 high-skilled jobs with salaries exceeding 45% of the local average, while retaining over 100 existing positions across Louisiana. Combined with 50 indirect jobs, this project is expected to add 65 new jobs in the Capital Region. These roles—technical, engineering, and operational—align with the state's focus on cultivating a workforce equipped for the clean energy economy.

The broader economic ripple effects are equally significant. The RiverPlex MegaPark, where the ASU will reside alongside Hyundai's $6 billion hydrogen-integrated steel mill, is becoming a magnet for industrial giants. Louisiana's incentives, including tax breaks and LED FastStart workforce training, have already lured major projects to the region. This clustering effect could transform Ascension Parish from an overlooked rural area into a global hub for low-carbon manufacturing.

Investors tracking LIN (Linde's stock ticker) will note its resilience amid macroeconomic volatility, reflecting confidence in the company's long-term strategy. The ASU project, with its multiyear timeline and alignment with decarbonization trends, reinforces Linde's growth trajectory.

Environmental Strategy: Decarbonizing Industrial Processes at Scale

The ASU's primary purpose is to support the Blue Point Number One ammonia plant, a $4 billion joint venture between CF Industries, JERA, and Mitsui & Co. This facility will produce 1.4 million metric tons of low-carbon ammonia annually, a critical fuel for maritime transport and fertilizer production. By using Linde's oxygen and nitrogen in autothermal reforming processes, the plant will reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 1.7 million metric tons per year—comparable to removing 375,000 cars from roads.

Ammonia's role in decarbonization cannot be overstated. As shipping giants like Maersk commit to green fuels, low-carbon ammonia is emerging as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Linde's infrastructure is not just supporting this shift—it's enabling it. The company's expertise in air separation and hydrogen networks positions it to capitalize on the global ammonia market, projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% through 2030.

Strategic Infrastructure: Building the Gulf Coast's Clean Energy Corridor

Linde's ASU is the largest of its kind on the Mississippi River, but it's part of a larger vision. The company's Gulf Coast infrastructure—spanning Geismar, Lake Charles, and now Ascension Parish—is designed to create a network effect. Pipelines, storage hubs, and processing facilities interlock to reduce costs and increase reliability for customers. This vertical integration lowers barriers for industries transitioning to low-carbon processes, from steel mills to chemical manufacturers.

The RiverPlex MegaPark further amplifies this strategy. By co-locating the ASU with Hyundai's steel mill and Blue Point's ammonia plant, Linde ensures synergies in logistics, energy efficiency, and resource sharing. Such clusters are the blueprint for 21st-century industrial parks, where decarbonization and productivity are inseparable.

Investment Implications: A Play on Clean Energy Infrastructure

For investors, Linde's Louisiana project underscores two themes: infrastructure resilience and decarbonization demand. The ASU's 2029 startup date aligns with global ammonia demand timelines, while its 40-year lifespan ensures long-term revenue streams.

Risks remain, of course. Delays in permitting or construction could strain cash flows, and regulatory shifts (e.g., carbon pricing) could impact project economics. However, Linde's partnership with Louisiana—secured through tax incentives and workforce programs—mitigates political risk, while its technical prowess reduces execution risk.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Future

Linde's ASU project is a masterclass in strategic infrastructure investment. By addressing both environmental imperatives and economic needs, it creates a template for how companies can profitably contribute to the energy transition. For investors, this is more than a stock pick—it's a stake in the future of industries that will define the next decade. As global demand for low-carbon fuels surges, Linde's Louisiana bet is one that's likely to pay off.

Investment Thesis: Buy Linde (LIN) for its leadership in industrial decarbonization, strong Gulf Coast infrastructure, and exposure to ammonia's rising global demand. Monitor stock performance against peers like Air Products & Chemicals (APD) and the S&P 500 Energy Sector ETF (XLE).

In a world racing to reduce emissions, Linde's vision is clear: build the backbone of a cleaner economy, one project at a time.",,N,,2025-06-29 02:59:56.728192

Then again, the Trump administration is prioritizing energy output over career viability—because to become the “AI capital of the world,” the United States will need to produce a lot more energy.
Even Energy Secretary Chris Wright agrees with that sentiment.","The Trump administration is wreaking havoc in seemingly random ways, but if you put their actions together like a carefully curated, MAGAfied puzzle, it appears to spell out something more nefarious.

On May 15, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said during a hearing that he planned to make the United States the “AI capital of the world,” giving a glimpse into the Trump administration’s broader plans for dirty energy.

President Donald Trump is giving artificial intelligence the red carpet treatment, but he needs dirty energy to do it. To make this happen, “Daddy Trump” can’t just sign an executive order and go on his merry way—even if that seems to be the status quo these days.

Instead, each Cabinet member is chipping away at pieces of green legislation, regulations, closed coal mines, and more to make sure that energy-guzzling corporations have the resources they need.

For Zeldin, he’s making sure that coal factories don’t have pesky regulations on pollution. In fact, corporations can now submit their complaints to an email server if they feel that any green regulation is particularly bothersome, which is great news for Big Coal, considering it will soon have a lot more raw material coming down the assembly line.

Thanks to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, coal mines that were once shut down have been reopening. Even new uranium mines—a vital energy source for AI—are bypassing environmental checks.

But moves like cracking open once-protected lands in Alaska to harvest dirty energy have raised eyebrows among environmentalists. Earlier this month, Burgum flaunted a hardhat as he toured the icy terrain of Alaska to brag about a new venture: tapping into protected lands.

But the goal for Alaska’s oil isn’t just to fuel AI but to become a supplier for other countries. As for the coal mines, however, convincing young people to dive into the mines has become increasingly difficult. And with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Then again, the Trump administration is prioritizing energy output over career viability—because to become the “AI capital of the world,” the United States will need to produce a lot more energy.

Even Energy Secretary Chris Wright agrees with that sentiment.

""We have to lead and win the AI race, just like we did Manhattan Project,” he said last month. “This is Manhattan Project 2.”

That’s certainly good news for the Trump administration’s goal of becoming the “AI capital of the world”—and bad news for everyone else.",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1450168/story_image/AP25153750028557.jpg?1751063455,N,,2025-06-29 09:02:39.087655

The clean energy industry and environmental groups decried the last-minute changes to the bill, saying that it will raise household energy costs and deprive the US of new, necessary and fast electricity capacity at a time of massive power demand amid a rush of construction of power-hungry data centers to power AI development.

Trump's former advisor and head of DOGE Elon Musk blasted the bill on his social media platform X on Saturday, warning that the bill will ""destroy millions of jobs in America"" and cause ""strategic harm.""

""It is utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" he said.

LG Energy Solution’s new lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery plant in Holland, Michigan, marks a significant step for clean energy in the US. Opened in early May 2025, this facility shifts focus from electric vehicles (EVs) to energy storage systems (ESS) as EV demand cools. This article explores the plant’s impact on jobs, the economy, clean energy, and how policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the One Big Beautiful Bill, tariffs, and competitors shape its future. We at CleanTechnica have been covering LG Energy and its partnerships (mostly with GM) for years. Click here to read some of our articles on them.

My Visit To Holland, Michigan

CleanTechnica got invited to beautiful Holland, Michigan, I was the one who ended up agreeing to go that far for a 3-hour tour. Because the location is remote, it takes 10 to 12 hours to get there, unless you live in the area. I’ll have to say it was worth the trip both because the LG Energy story is significant and also because it is a beautiful city proud of its Dutch heritage.

My Visit To The LG Plant

During my visit to the Holland plant, I was struck by its scale — spanning 42 football fields — and the buzz of innovation. I spoke with Bob Lee, President of North America for LG Energy Solution, who said, “We have a solution where we can provide energy storage in any location where the energy is being produced and where it can be used in an efficient way to optimize the grid.” Artealia Gilliard, Chief Communications Officer for American Clean Power, highlighted the economic impact: “The $1.4 billion investment is making Michigan a top state for grid-scale battery manufacturing, driving growth here and nationwide.” Jaehong Park and Tristan Doherty forecasted billions in annual economic benefits, emphasizing the plant’s transformative potential.

LG Energy Solution has been in Michigan since 2012, initially focusing on EV batteries, but as I’ve observed, the market has shifted. With EV demand growth waning, the pivot to ESS aligns with growing needs for grid stability and renewable energy integration, a move I believe is timely and strategic.

I observed the manufacturing process — starting with a mixing room creating slurry, coating foil, stacking 40 mono-cells with safety-reinforced separators, sealing in aluminum pouches, and injecting electrolyte. This process, now operational on two lines, with a third expected by year-end, underscores the plant’s scale and innovation.

I wasn’t allowed to take pictures, but they provided the following pictures of what I saw.

I spoke with industry leaders, including Bob Lee, who emphasized: “We have a solution where we can provide energy storage in any location where the energy is being produced and where it can be used in an efficient way to optimize the grid,” as reported in Fox 17 Online. Artealia Gilliard noted, “The $1.4 billion investment is making Michigan one of the top three states for grid-scale battery manufacturing, driving growth here and nationwide.” Jaehong Park forecasted $2.5 billion annual revenue, and Tristan Doherty predicted further economic growth, highlighting the plant’s transformative potential.

Plant Details and Economic Impact

The plant, a $1.4 billion investment announced in 2022, began LFP battery production in May 2025, with a capacity of 16.5 GWh for ESS, boosting total capacity to 21.5 GWh (5 GWh for EVs, 16.5 GWh for ESS). It could employ up to 1,700 people, attracting skilled workers and capital to West Michigan. Jaehong Park noted it could generate $2.5 billion annually, with Tristan Doherty forecasting further growth, making Michigan a clean energy hub and supporting local communities.

In addition to ESS production, the Holland facility will also produce NMC cells and modules for the Ford Mustang Mach-E, having recently onshored this production from LG Energy Solution’s facility on Wroclaw, Poland.

Advancing Clean Energy in the US

LFP batteries are cost-effective for ESS, with high-loading/high-density designs offering the 6000 or more discharge cycles that are needed for a battery that charges by solar daily and discharges when the sun goes down. This allows the battery to be used for up to 20 years, which lets you amortize the cost over that long period instead of replacing the battery every 5 or 10 years with some other technologies. They support the US grid by storing renewable or fossil generated energy, crucial as demand rises, especially for AI data centers. The plant’s role in integrating renewables and enhancing grid resilience is vital, with LG Energy Solution’s safety standards ensuring long-term reliability, aligning with the US ESS market’s expected growth.

Policy Influences and Competitive Dynamics

No article would be complete without a bit of discussion of how Biden’s IRA and Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill might impact things. The IRA’s domestic content adders offer a 10% bonus credit for sections 45 and 45Y, and up to 10 percentage points for section 48, likely influencing the investment. However, the Big Beautiful Bill (although constantly changing until passed and signed by the president) likely scales back IRA credits, potentially affecting future projects. Tariffs on Chinese ESS batteries, rising to 38.4% by 2026, also drive domestic production.

LG executives seemed confident that their team was well positioned to react quickly to any changes passed by Congress. For example, if it places more restrictions on getting components from China, that might require LG Energy Solution to source them from other global sources, and tariffs would likely encourage them to move production to the US. They seemed confident that they were prepared to do that in two steps as quickly as anyone else since they already have global supply chains and significant highly trained people and plants in the US.

Conclusion

I enjoyed my short trip and came away very impressed with LG Energy’s ability to execute and change directions quickly as demand, tariffs, and tax policy change with the political winds.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LG-Energy-Solution-battery-factory.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 05:02:44.029851

Article content

Senate Majority Leader John Thune and his lieutenants may still need to tweak portions of Trump’s signature economic legislation in order to win the 50 votes it needs to pass the Senate.

Article content

But the Senate voted Saturday to begin debate on the legislation just hours after party leaders unveiled the latest version of the massive tax and spending package.

Article content

Two Republicans — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky — voted against the motion. A third, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, switched his vote after meeting with Vance and Thune.

Article content

Johnson told reporters that Trump and Senate leaders agreed to support an amendment to phase out the 90% Medicaid match for the expansion population under the Affordable Care Act.

Article content

Johnson said it would hopefully lead to hundreds of billions in additional savings. But that plan could result in a revolt from moderates in both the House and the Senate, given many states now rely on the funding.

Trump had golfed earlier in the day with Paul, a frequent foe. And the president, who had been monitoring the Senate action from the Oval Office, swiftly threatened to find a GOP challenger for Tillis’ seat.

Democrats have now demanded a full reading of the bill text, which could push a final vote into Monday.

The bill includes nearly $4.5 trillion worth of tax cuts, according to the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation. But Republicans are aiming for only $693 billion of those tax reductions to count in the official bill cost — assuming they are able to successfully use a budget gimmick that wouldn’t count the extension of Trump’s first-term cuts in the price tag.

Article content

Despite broad Republican support for the tax cuts and spending increases for immigration enforcement and defense at the core of the package, party leaders have struggled to balance competing demands from the GOP’s discordant ideological factions.

Article content

Conservatives are demanding larger spending cuts to offset the tax cuts. Moderates are worried about the scale of proposed cuts to safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.

In conclusion, Lake Charles LNG is more than a project—it's a strategic linchpin for Energy Transfer's dominance in U.S. energy infrastructure.","Energy Transfer's (ET) Lake Charles LNG project is nearing a pivotal milestone: its final investment decision (FID), which now appears increasingly likely in 2025. The project's recent progress—driven by expanded offtake agreements, strategic partnerships, and operational efficiencies—has significantly reduced execution risk, positioning it as a cornerstone of U.S. LNG export growth. With Chevron's commitment now at 3.0 MTPA, MidOcean Energy's 5.0 MTPA heads of agreement (HOA), and Kyushu Electric's 1.0 MTPA agreement, the project has secured 10.4 MTPA offtake, representing 80% of its 13.0 MTPA FID threshold. This momentum, combined with Lake Charles' unique infrastructure advantages, suggests the project is primed to deliver long-term cash flow growth for investors.

Chevron's Expanded Commitment: A Vote of Confidence

Chevron's incremental 1.0 MTPA agreement, bringing its total to 3.0 MTPA, underscores the project's strategic value. The 20-year SPA mirrors the terms of its December 2024 deal, with pricing tied to the Henry Hub benchmark—a critical advantage in a global LNG market increasingly reliant on U.S. shale gas. Chevron's expanded stake reflects its confidence in Lake Charles' ability to deliver low-cost, reliable LNG supply amid tightening global markets. This partnership not only boosts offtake credibility but also aligns with Chevron's broader strategy to secure long-term LNG contracts for its global operations and trading activities.

Progress Toward FID: 80% Booked, 20% to Go

The Lake Charles project has already secured 10.4 MTPA offtake, with just 2.6 MTPA remaining to meet its FID target. Recent agreements with Kyushu Electric and MidOcean Energy—particularly the latter's 30% equity stake—highlight the project's appeal to both traditional buyers and equity-backed investors. MidOcean's financial commitment reduces the burden on Energy Transfer while demonstrating the market's confidence in the project's economics. With regulatory approvals (FERC, DOE) already secured and an EPC contract in place with KBR-Tecnip, Lake Charles is now largely a matter of finalizing remaining offtake deals. Analysts now expect FID by late 2025, a full year ahead of initial timelines.

Operational Advantages: Cost Efficiency and Scalability

Lake Charles' existing infrastructure is its crown jewel. Built on a brownfield site, the terminal leverages four LNG storage tanks, two deep-water berths, and direct access to the Trunkline pipeline—a lifeline to the Haynesville, Permian, and Marcellus shale basins. This integration slashes capital costs by 20–30% compared to greenfield projects, enabling Energy Transfer to price LNG competitively. The modular design of three 5.5 MTPA trains further mitigates risk, allowing phased development if market conditions shift.

The project's Henry Hub-linked pricing is another key advantage. Unlike European or Asian-indexed contracts, U.S. gas prices remain anchored to domestic shale production, offering stability amid global price volatility. This structure ensures Lake Charles can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities when U.S. gas is cheaper than international benchmarks—a frequent occurrence in recent years.

Global LNG Demand Drivers: A Tailwind for Lake Charles

The LNG market is entering a golden age of demand growth, fueled by three key trends:

1. EU Diversification: Post-Russian gas dependence, the EU aims to replace 35 billion cubic meters of Russian supply with LNG by 2030.

2. Asian Decarbonization: Countries like Japan, South Korea, and China are expanding LNG use to bridge coal-to-renewables transitions.

3. U.S. Gas Cost Competitiveness: With Henry Hub prices averaging $2.80/MMBtu in 2025 versus $7.50/MMBtu for European TTF gas, U.S. LNG is a low-cost alternative to Middle Eastern or Australian exports.

These tailwinds align perfectly with Lake Charles' strengths. The project's low-cost structure and geographic flexibility (deep-water access for large carriers) position it to capture global market share, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Risks and Considerations

While Lake Charles' progress is compelling, risks remain:

- Remaining Offtake: The final 2.6 MTPA must be secured, though Energy Transfer's active pipeline suggests this is achievable.

- Debt Management: ET's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.7x could strain liquidity if FID is delayed. However, the project's modular design allows scaling capital spending in phases.

- Regulatory Hurdles: While major approvals are secured, permitting for infrastructure expansions could introduce delays.

Investment Thesis: A Buy for Energy Infrastructure Investors

Energy Transfer's stock trades at a 25% discount to its 2022 peak, despite its dominant midstream position and dividend yield of 7.8%. The Lake Charles project's progress justifies a re-rating, as it:

- Reduces execution risk: 80% offtake booked, with remaining commitments likely by year-end.

- Ensures long-term cash flow: A 16.45 MTPA facility at 90% utilization could generate $1–1.5 billion/year in EBITDA.

- Strengthens ET's moat: The project cements ET's role as a U.S. LNG leader, complementing its existing gas gathering, processing, and pipeline networks.

For investors, the 2025 FID decision is a binary catalyst. If approved, Lake Charles becomes a multi-year cash flow generator, rewarding holders of ET's equity and debt. Even if FID is delayed, the dividend yield and midstream resilience provide downside protection.

Recommendation: Buy Energy Transfer (ET) for a long-term portfolio, targeting a 12–18 month horizon. The stock offers a compelling blend of income, growth, and exposure to the LNG boom. Monitor progress on remaining offtake agreements and FID timing for near-term catalysts.

In conclusion, Lake Charles LNG is more than a project—it's a strategic linchpin for Energy Transfer's dominance in U.S. energy infrastructure. With demand drivers aligned and execution risks falling, this could be the year ET's LNG ambitions finally crystallize into shareholder value.",,N,,2025-06-29 05:04:17.515492

One form of electric power generation that is coming back into vogue is nuclear power. Large companies are making commitments to buy electricity from nuclear power plants, while utilities are extending the contracts for existing facilities and planning to bring new power sources to life in the next few years.

One stock that has benefited from this changing nuclear energy sentiment is NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR). The start-up is working on small modular reactor technology to license to third parties, hopefully to democratize the technology. Shares of the stock are up 250% in the last year, beating the broad market averages. But is it a buy right now?

Betting on new nuclear energy developments

Small modular reactors are almost self-explanatory. Unlike the traditional large nuclear power plants, these are smaller systems that can (theoretically) be made more efficiently by combining a bunch together or using one system for a small energy need. Using similar technology to traditional power plants, NuScale Power wants to help utilities improve on the capital intensity a nuclear power plant takes to build, which can be a daunting proposition.

So far, it has not built any actual reactors, but it is the first and only company to get approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a small modular design. This occurred in 2023, with a recent approval happening for the same design but just at a different electricity output. The company does not have any customer orders yet, but management believes one will arrive by the end of 2025, given that it is fully approved with its designs. It is also studying an old coal power plant in Romania to see about the feasibility of turning it into a nuclear power facility.

Canceled projects, delayed timelines

There's a lot of excitement about NuScale Power right now. Spending on energy is well over $1 trillion every year just in the United States. If NuScale Power can commercialize a breakthrough technology in electricity generation with its small modular reactors, there could be enormous revenue potential.

The problem is, no major customers have committed to a project yet. It used to have a project planned with a Utah utility that started in 2015. However, due to major cost overruns and delayed timelines, the utility canceled the project in 2023. This is not a good sign for the viability of small modular reactors. Companies that design legacy nuclear power systems with proven viability still struggle to find utilities willing to invest in nuclear energy projects. A totally unproven technology is going to be a hard ask for utilities and their shareholders to risk.

Is NuScale Power stock a buy?

Today, after going up so much in the past year, NuScale Power stock trades at a market cap of $11 billion. Even though it generates a bit of revenue from the study in Romania, the company can generally be considered a pre-revenue start-up with no product ever sold to customers. It has revenue of $49 million and $98 million in negative free cash flow over the last 12 months.

The company is consistently raising money from capital markets, too. Its shares outstanding keep climbing as it has to raise money to stem its major cash burn. Rising shares outstanding dilutes shareholders, which will be a headwind to long-term returns. It is unclear whether the company will have a viable project contract signed anytime soon, and even if a project is signed, it takes many years for a nuclear power plant to get built, modular or not.

Even if a project gets planned, the stock is already pricing in this growth. At a market cap of $11 billion, the company needs to eventually be generating billions of dollars in revenue in order to make an adequate return for shareholders. Add it all up, and NuScale Power stock looks like a highly risky stock that investors should keep out of their portfolios right now.

The initial draft released by Senate Republicans earlier this month cut the credit for any wind and solar projects that did not “begin construction” by certain dates, while the latest version bases incentives on when projects actually begin producing electricity — a much higher bar to clear.

The first draft gave any project that began construction this year full credit, any project that began construction next year 60 percent credit and any project that began construction in 2027 20 percent of the credit, before they were phased out thereafter.

The new legislation instead says that the credits will only apply to facilities that begin producing electricity before the end of 2027.

In addition, it imposes a new tax on some wind and solar projects that are placed in service after 2027.

The projects that will be taxed if a certain percentage of the value of their components come from China.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including renewable energy. These subsidies were expected to massively reduce the U.S.’ planet warming emissions.

The GOP’s cuts to the credits are expected to severely curtail those gains.

If they pass, the cuts represent a win for the party’s right flank, which has pushed for major cuts to the credits, and a loss for it’s more moderate wing which has called for a slower phaseout.

The renewables lobby slammed the changes as hampering the sector.

“In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry. It is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a written statement.

In France, this applies above all to the many nuclear power plants.
In fact, nuclear power plants emit little or no greenhouse gases during operation and are therefore considered climate-friendly by their proponents.
Building new gas-fired power plants is likely to make this plan even more difficult.","It was only a relatively petty dispute over the organization of an EU event in Brussels. And yet, revealed how differently Economy Minister Katherina Reiche — of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) — and Environment Minister Carsten Schneider — of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) — think about renewable energy, climate protection and nuclear power.

In mid-June, Reiche was looking for a way to spend the evening in Brussels after a long meeting with her EU counterparts. There were two options: a meeting with representatives from countries that want to continue to expand renewable energies, and a meeting with pro-nuclear states.

Twelve of the 27 EU states operate nuclear power plants, with France having the highest proportion — 55 reactors. Reiche ultimately attended the meeting of these countries, even though the government of former Chancellor Angela Merkel moved to phase out nuclear energy after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan. Germany's last power plant went off the grid in spring 2023.

Renewables or nuclear power?

The fact that Reiche nevertheless chose to attend the meeting with the nuclear countries angered her SPD colleague. Schneider is officially responsible for nuclear safety in Germany as the environment minister, including issues relating to the interim and final storage of nuclear waste.

""We have decided to phase out nuclear power. This has also been accepted by society,"" Schneider said.

Officially, Germany is focusing on transitioning to renewable energies, and a large proportion of its energy is now generated from wind or solar power. ""There are no further commitments [to the nuclear industry], nor will there be any,"" said Schneider.

France, Germany backing all forms of energy

The disagreement between the Economy Ministry and the Environment Ministry on nuclear energy issues was already apparent. At the end of May, Reiche said in Brussels that she was ""open to all technologies"" when it came to energy production.

The specific trigger was a joint paper by the governments in Paris and Berlin, which stated that the energy policy in both countries would be implemented ""based on climate neutrality, competitiveness and sovereignty."" In other words, according to the wishes of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, all forms of energy are to be promoted in the EU as long as they are low-emission.

In France, this applies above all to the many nuclear power plants. In fact, nuclear power plants emit little or no greenhouse gases during operation and are therefore considered climate-friendly by their proponents.

The dangers of the technology lie in controlling the nuclear chain reaction and the nuclear waste it produces, which remains radioactive for many thousands of years. According to the EU treaties, each member state has the right to choose its own energy mix.

Major plans for new gas-fired power plants

There is also likely to be more disagreement between Reiche and Schneider on the issue of new gas-fired power plants.

Shortly after taking office, the CDU minister announced plans to build 20 new gas-fired power plants. The previous government had also announced new construction to compensate for the often-fluctuating supplies from solar and wind power — but not in such large numbers.

This is also a cause for concern for Schneider, who is responsible for meeting Germany's climate targets. In mid-May, the German government's expert council on climate issues warned that the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2045 must be backed up by a truly concrete plan from the government.

A warning from climate experts

The economy and environment ministries have often clashed on issues of climate protection and energy policy. At the moment, the government's climate goals are being helped by the rather weak economy and the resulting lower production, especially in industry, according to the council.

A member of the panel, Marc Oliver Bettzüge, director of the Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne, told the newsmagazine Der Spiegel: ""At this point in time, it is not clear how the federal government intends to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2045.""

Building new gas-fired power plants is likely to make this plan even more difficult. Although gas-fired power plants emit less greenhouse gases than coal-fired ones, 20 new plants would jeopardize the climate targets.

The initial draft released by Senate Republicans earlier this month cut the credit for any wind and solar projects that did not “begin construction” by certain dates, while the latest version bases incentives on when projects actually begin producing electricity — a much higher bar to clear.

The first draft gave any project that began construction this year full credit, any project that began construction next year 60 percent credit and any project that began construction in 2027 20 percent of the credit, before they were phased out thereafter.

The new legislation instead says that the credits will only apply to facilities that begin producing electricity before the end of 2027.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including renewable energy. These subsidies were expected to massively reduce the U.S.’ planet warming emissions.

The GOP’s cuts to the credits are expected to severely curtail those gains.

If they pass, the cuts represent a win for the party’s right flank, which has pushed for major cuts to the credits, and a loss for it’s more moderate wing which has called for a slower phaseout.

The renewables lobby slammed the changes as hampering the sector.

“In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted mostly along party lines late Saturday night to move forward with Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump wants on his desk in less than a week, after a dramatic three-hour pause when several GOP senators withheld their votes.

Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against moving forward with the sweeping tax break and spending cuts package that contains many of the GOP’s campaign promises. All Democrats were opposed. Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol in case a tie-breaking vote was required, but in the end was not needed.

Tillis, who is up for reelection in 2026, had told reporters earlier that he would vote “no” on what is called a motion to proceed and on final passage.

He said in a statement the legislation would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina and force the state to make “painful decisions” about Medicaid. Trump in a post on social media later threatened to find primary candidates to challenge Tillis.

The 51-49 vote doesn’t guarantee the bill will make it through a final passage vote but does make it significantly more likely, even with Republicans’ narrow 53-47 majority.

The procedural vote kicked off a maximum of 20 hours of floor debate on the bill, with half of that time controlled by Democrats and the other half by Republicans — though Democrats after the motion to proceed vote forced a reading of the giant bill expected to take as long as 15 hours. That would mean floor debate would not begin until sometime Sunday.

Unlike regular bills, budget reconciliation packages are not subject to the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so as long as at least 50 Republicans support the package, and Vance casts the tie-breaking vote if needed, the measure will go back to the House.

The vote on the motion to proceed that began at about 7:30 p.m. Eastern was held open for more than three hours, with the votes of four senators in suspense — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rick Scott of Florida. All four eventually voted aye and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to aye after earlier voting against the measure.

Lee, however, just before the vote was over, announced he had pulled from the bill an extremely controversial proposal to sell some public lands that was opposed by other lawmakers from the West. He said because of the process being used for the bill, he was unable to obtain enforceable safeguards to ensure the land would be sold to American families and not China or foreign interests.

The latest version of the measure had set up the Interior Department to sell at least 600,000 acres of public land and up to 1.2 million acres of public land within 10 years, advocates said.

Critics, including hunters, anglers and other Western state constituents, have ripped the measure as a “land grab,” as put by Jennifer Rokala, executive director for the Center for Western Priorities.

A summary of the provisions by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said the Bureau of Land Management “must sell a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 0.50% of their estate for housing and associated community needs. This will increase the supply of housing and decrease housing costs for millions of American families.”

Golfing with Trump

Senate GOP leaders released new bill text just before midnight Friday that satisfied rural state lawmakers’ worries about financial threats to rural hospitals posed by cuts in Medicaid. The bill also addresses concerns by Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska about access to food assistance for their constituents despite new restrictions on a USDA program for low-income people.

As talks continued on Capitol Hill Saturday afternoon, a handful of Senate Republicans, including Missouri’s Eric Schmitt and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, were on the golf course with Trump, according to the White House. Graham said on social media that Kentucky’s Paul also played.

Senate Democrats said a fresh financial analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the preliminary Senate text would result in $930 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state low-income health insurance and disability assistance program.

The CBO score was not yet publicly available but Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, pointed to it and slammed the Medicaid provisions as “cruel” in a statement Saturday afternoon.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, also cited the preliminary analysis, pointing to the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.

Collins promises amendments

Senate Republicans planned to take their negotiations to the floor and push for amendments after the procedural vote that triggered official debate on the bill, which in its current public version runs 940 pages.

GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who voiced concerns throughout negotiations about rural hospitals and health cuts that would harm low-income individuals, said her vote on the motion to proceed “does not predict my vote on final passage.”

“I will be filing a number of amendments,” she told reporters as she headed into a closed-door working lunch before the Senate convened at 2 p.m. Eastern.

While Sen. Tim Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday afternoon that he was a “no” on the motion to proceed because of a provision to sell off federal public lands, the Montana Republican changed his mind nearly an hour later and declared he would propose an amendment to strip the provision — which was later removed by its sponsor.

GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma painted somewhat of a rosier picture of the mood in the Senate, telling reporters “we’re good.”

“We won't bring it to the floor if we don't have the votes,” said Mullin, who was the lead negotiator with House Republicans on state and local tax deductions, or SALT — a sticking point for Republicans who represent high-tax blue states like New York and California.

The lawmakers settled on a $40,000 deduction through 2029 for taxpayers who earn up to $500,000 annually. The level then reverts to $10,000, the current limit under the 2017 tax law.

Medicaid turmoil

Proposed changes to Medicaid have been strongly resisted by rural medical providers who say they are already financially strapped.

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters Saturday he would be a “yes” on both the motion to proceed vote and the final bill based on the new rural hospital “transformation program” Senate leadership included in the bill overnight. The measure has yet to be finalized.

The bill’s new version includes $25 billion in a stabilization fund for rural hospitals from 2028 through 2032. The amount is frontloaded to give more of the funds in the first two years.

Critics warn that amount will not fill the financial gaps that rural medical providers will face from losing a sizable portion of federal funding via Medicaid cuts.

While Hawley called the fund a “win” for Missouri over the next several years, he said his party needs to do some “soul searching” over the “unhappy episode” of wrangling over Medicaid cuts.

“If you want to be a working-class party, you've got to deliver for working-class people. You cannot take away health care for working people,” he said.

Senators had not yet agreed on other Medicaid provisions as of Saturday afternoon, including a phase-down of the provider tax rate from 6% to a possible 3.5% that’s become hugely controversial.

States use a combination of general revenues, provider tax revenues and in some cases local contributions to fund their Medicaid programs.

Advocates warn that it’s not a guarantee states would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and if they can’t, provider rate cuts and losses of benefits for patients could be on the horizon.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House version’s provider tax changes — not as deep as the current Senate proposal — could lead to 400,000 people losing Medicaid benefits.

A full and final financial score for the Senate bill is not yet out as the several provisions remain up in the air.

Hawley also praised the inclusion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act fund, or RECA, that revives payments for survivors and victims who suffered cancer as a result of U.S. atomic bomb testing and radioactive waste dumps.

Clean energy tax credits

In what clean power advocates dubbed a “midnight dumping,” Senate GOP leadership added language to accelerate the phase out of clean energy tax credits that were enacted under Democrats’ own massive mega-bill in 2022 titled the “Inflation Reduction Act.”

The language, which wasn’t yet finalized by Senate GOP tax writers as of 6 p.m. Eastern Saturday, tightened restrictions on foreign components in wind and solar projects — and added a new tax on those that don’t comply.

Senators largely targeted wind and solar credits, ending them for projects not plugged into the electricity grid by 2028. Additionally credits for wind turbine manufacturers would terminate in 2028.

Other tax credits would be phased out at a faster pace, including those for the production of critical minerals, though a credit for metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking, was added in.

Clean energy industry manufacturers and small businesses had hoped Senate Republicans would ease up rollbacks in the House version.

Kurt Neutgens, president and chief technology officer of Orange EV, told States Newsroom in an interview Friday that any further rollbacks would amount to “cutting our legs out from underneath us.”

Neutgens, whose Kansas City, Kansas-based company manufactures heavy duty electric trucks and chargers, was watching for changes to credits to the commercial clean vehicles credit. New Senate GOP text would terminate the credit in September of this year.

Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”

Alaska carve-outs

Proposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.

If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.

GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.

States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.

States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.

The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.

Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.

The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%.

Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.

The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.

The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.

Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.

SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.

But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.

Education revisions

Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.

Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.

Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.

The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

‘Even worse than any draft’

Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we've seen this far.”

The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it's worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”

Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”

“We'll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We'll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”

“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.

“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.

House action

Senate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.

The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.

The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.

The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.

The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.

Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.

Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.

“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.

“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock.

What's happening?

A collaborative study by World Weather Attribution, the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, and Climate Central reveals just how much the changing climate has intensified deadly heat waves over the past year, and the results are deeply concerning.

Roughly 4 billion people, nearly half the global population, were exposed to at least 30 days of extreme heat during the study period. Researchers define extreme heat as ""hotter than 90% of temperatures observed in their local area over the 1991-2020 period.""

Just a few weeks after those startling statistics were released, the United States was enduring its first major heat wave of the summer. Several major cities experienced historic heat during the last full week of June. On June 24, during the peak of the heat, several cities set new record highs, including Raleigh, North Carolina, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and Newark, New Jersey, when temperatures soared to 100 degrees or hotter. More than 160 million people were impacted by extreme levels of heat and humidity.

Why is an increasing number of extreme-heat days important?

Heat is now the most lethal weather threat in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service, killing more people over the past 30 years than any other hazard, more than twice as many as flooding. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2024 also noted a worldwide increase in heat-related deaths, with U.S. deaths more than doubling from 1993 to 2023. Researchers last year revealed that heat waves increase the risk of preterm birth and health complications in infants.

""Exposure to extreme heat makes it difficult for our bodies to cool off, resulting in heat-related illnesses including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and even fatal medical emergencies such as heat stroke,"" stated the authors of a Climate Central study on the increasing number of hotter-than-normal summer days.

What's being done about the threat of more days of extreme heat in our future?

Last year continued a disturbing trend: The past 11 years now make up the 11 hottest in recorded history. In the U.S., the eight warmest years have all come since 2012. The joint study noted that 2025 started with the hottest January on record and the lowest amount of Arctic sea ice ever seen in the Northern Hemisphere.

""This is not a surprise or an accident — the causes are well known and the impacts are devastating,"" say the authors of the study. ""The continued burning of coal, oil, and gas has released and accumulated enough greenhouse gases to warm the planet by 1.3°C (over a 5-year average) — and by more than 1.5°C in 2024 alone — compared to pre-industrial times.""

Our warming world is supercharging extreme weather events, including heat waves. Reducing the amount of heat-trapping gases being released into our atmosphere is crucial for the future of our planet.

""We need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,"" Roop Singh, a climate risk adviser at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said in a World Weather Attribution statement, per Fast Company.

Moving away from dirty energy to renewable options, like solar, can help cool our planet. Installing solar panels can curb harmful pollution and help save money in the long run. Researchers recently announced a breakthrough that could pave the way for a new era of high-efficiency solar panels.

Jason Grumet, president of the Clean Power Association, said in a statement Saturday that imposing new taxes on the industry “will strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, and undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.”

Alaska carve-outs

Proposed cuts to federal food assistance remained largely unchanged in the new text released Friday night except for a few carve-outs for Alaska.

If the bill were enacted as written, Alaska’s state government could request a waiver for its citizens from stricter work reporting requirements that critics say will result in some SNAP recipients losing their food benefits.

GOP lawmakers also slightly shifted the timeline for when states will have to begin shouldering SNAP costs — the first time states will be on the hook for the federal food assistance outside of administrative costs.

States would be required to pick up a portion of the costs depending on their “payment error rate” — meaning how accurate states are at determining who needs SNAP, including both overpayments and underpayments.

States that have error rates at 6% or above would responsible for up to 15% of the food program’s cost. According to SNAP error rate data for 2023, the latest available, only seven states had an error rate below 6%.

The new text delays the cost-sharing for states until 2028 and allows states to choose the lesser of their two error rates in either 2025 or 2026.

Starting in 2029, states will be required to use their error rate from three years prior to the current year.

The new text includes the option for Alaska and Hawaii to waive their cost share burden for up to two years if their governments implement an improvement plan. In 2023, Alaska had the highest payment error rate of all states, reaching just above 60%.

Advocates for low-income families worry the cost, which will amount to billions for most state governments, will incentivize states to tighten eligibility requirements for the program, or even drop SNAP altogether.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates the cuts will affect up to 40 million people who receive basic SNAP assistance, including 16 million children and 8 million seniors.

The Senate bill would also increase a state’s share of administrative costs for the program to 75%, up from the previous 50% cost-sharing responsibility with the federal government.

Despite inaccurate public statements from Republicans as recently as in a bill summary released overnight, the bill does nothing to limit food assistance to immigrants without documentation because SNAP was never available to them.

SNAP benefits will remain available to legal permanent residents, and Republicans loosened some language to allow certain immigrants from Cuba or Haiti to access the program.

But if the bill passes, federal food assistance will not be available to refugees and asylees who are already in the U.S. — for example, people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and other war-torn places.

Education revisions

Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions revised or scrapped several measures that the parliamentarian deemed to not comply with the “Byrd Bath,” a Senate process named for the late Sen. Robert Byrd, according to a summary and new bill text out Friday.

Under the revised text, for any loans made starting July 1, 2026, borrowers will have only two repayment plan options: a standard repayment plan and an income-driven repayment plan. The original proposal would have applied these restrictions to existing borrowers, but the parliamentarian struck that down.

Republicans also nixed a proposal that opened up the Pell Grant — a government subsidy that helps low-income students pay for college — to institutions that are not accredited.

The new plan also scraps a restriction that barred payments made by students enrolled in a medical or dental internship or residency program from counting toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

‘Even worse than any draft’

Senate Democrats remain united in opposition to the bill and are expected to slow down final passage by introducing numerous amendments on the floor during what is called the vote-a-rama.

The lawmakers also planned to force a reading of the entire 940-page legislation on the floor ahead of the vote.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continued to rally against the package during remarks on the Senate floor Saturday afternoon, saying it’s “hard to believe this bill is worse — even worse — than any draft we’ve seen this far.”

The New York Democrat said “it’s worse on health care, it’s worse on SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), it’s worse on the deficit.”

Schumer added that “if Republicans proceed, Senate Democrats will hold them to account.”

“We’ll gear up for another night of vote-a-rama very soon. We’ll expose this bill piece by piece. We will show how it cuts health care, raises costs, rewards the ultra rich.”

The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities condemned the cuts to safety net programs as “all in service to tax cuts that are heavily skewed toward the wealthy and corporations.”

“None of this harm has anything to do with fiscal responsibility: our deficits and debts would soar under this bill,” said Sharon Parrott, the think tank’s president, in a statement Saturday.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog, released a new analysis Saturday finding the Senate version will add roughly $4 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years.

“If you thought the House bill borrowed too much — and it did — the Senate manages to make things even worse,” CRFB’s president Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.

House action

Senate Republicans have spent more than a month rewriting the bills that make up the measure in order to meet the strict rules for moving a budget reconciliation package and to earn support from enough Republicans to actually pass the legislation.

The lawmakers have been struggling to maintain spending cuts passed by House Republicans that will pay for the nearly $4 trillion price tag for extending and expanding the 2017 tax cuts.

The House voted 215-214 to approve its 11-bill version of the package in May. Many of that chamber’s GOP lawmakers hoped the Senate wouldn’t change much, though that hasn’t been the case.

The Senate has modified numerous proposals, including those addressing tax law; Medicaid; and SNAP. The Senate bill also raises the country’s debt limit by $5 trillion, a full $1 trillion more than the House version.

The revisions have led to concerns among both centrist House GOP lawmakers and far-right members of the party, muddying the waters around whether Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can cobble together the votes needed to clear the package for Trump’s signature.

Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the House, so leaders there can only lose four members if all of the chamber’s lawmakers are present and voting.

Trump has encouraged Congress to approve the legislation before the Fourth of July, but with time running short and some tempers rising over how the legislation will impact the country’s deficits, that might not be possible.

“The Great Republicans in the U.S. Senate are working all weekend to finish our ‘ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’,” Trump posted on social media Friday.

“The House of Representatives must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th — We can get it done,” he added. “It will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country, which is right now, ‘The Hottest Country anywhere in the World’ — And to think, just last year, we were a laughingstock. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Still, while lobbying for a coal plant tax break this spring, power company executives, including Rainbow's, told North Dakota lawmakers that coal plants still face challenges.
Schreiner said that any project Rainbow builds at the site will require a specific permit from the county.
Still, the law's presence spells another form of uncertainty for coal plants that send their power to grid infrastructure in the state.
Rainbow would have collected revenues from the wind power going on its electric line which the company said would have been reinvested into Coal Creek.","The 2020 announcement followed a trend in U.S. power markets where a large number of coal plants across the country had shut down as they struggled to compete with cheaper and more flexible forms of energy such as natural gas and some sources of renewable energy. More stringent environmental regulations have also made operating coal plants more expensive.

State officials scrambled to find a buyer for the plant after Great River's announcement.

In 2022, Rainbow Energy bought the station, along with the 436-mile-long Nexus Line, a valuable piece of infrastructure that sends electricity to the Twin Cities from McLean County.

Surging power demands -- driven by the data center boom -- along with efforts by the Trump administration to undo a broad swath of environmental regulations, could spell a somewhat rosier picture for coal-fired power on U.S. grid markets. Still, while lobbying for a coal plant tax break this spring, power company executives, including Rainbow's, told North Dakota lawmakers that coal plants still face challenges.

If the effort to build an industrial park is fully seen through, area data centers would use just under half of the energy that the coal plant can produce, providing a steady, local customer for the fuel. That could insulate the plant from losing as much money as it has at times when it needs to cycle the amount of power it produces, which is more costly than running the plant at full capacity because of how it is designed.

Rainbow has also signed up to receive natural gas from Intensity Infrastructure Partners, which is one of the two companies seeking a financial guarantee from the North Dakota state government to build a gas pipeline stretching across the state.

Jessica Bell, Rainbow's vice president of external affairs, said that gas generation is part of Rainbow's plans for the data center park, but an overarching goal for the company remains to run Coal Creek at full capacity.

Other planned developments await the area

No project has been officially announced for the industrial park yet, said McLean County Land Use Administrator Todd Schreiner, but discussions around the data center projects are ongoing.

Schreiner said that any project Rainbow builds at the site will require a specific permit from the county. The zoning change agreement also includes stipulations that the county can deny projects without adequate fire protections or that require certain forms of waste disposal.

When Rainbow purchased the plant in 2022, officials spoke of multiple avenues beyond just data centers that could drive revenue back into the plant.

Rainbow does not operate like a traditional utility with ratepayers. Instead, it is an independent power producer that sells electricity to commercial businesses or public utilities. This setup makes the company subject to less regulations on what it can invest in. Some regulations may be harder to avoid, however.

Coal Creek has historically sent its electricity directly to a converter station in Minnesota where it then goes on the broader power grid. It still does this through sales to some Minnesota utilities, but these companies are under a legal time clock to zero out their climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions by 2040.

North Dakota officials have argued that the law violates the Interstate Commerce Clause and indicated that they may sue over it, depending on how it is interpreted by Minnesota regulators. Still, the law's presence spells another form of uncertainty for coal plants that send their power to grid infrastructure in the state.

To meet some of these challenges and drive money back into Coal Creek, Rainbow proposed capturing and storing the plant's climate-warming carbon dioxide emissions underground in exchange for federal tax credits, as well as selling power from a new wind farm on Rainbow's electric line that feeds into Minnesota.

Neither have gone into development as quickly as what had been originally imagined.

Carbon capture, though technologically possible, has super high costs at power plants and a project at a separate North Dakota coal plant has still not been constructed after at least a decade of study. Bell said Rainbow is still exploring the business case for carbon capture.

Plans to build what would have been North Dakota's largest standalone wind project in the area floundered last year after local opposition brewed up and the McLean County State's Attorney accused Apex Clean Energy, the project wind developer, of ""creating divide-and-conquer dumpster fires"" in its relations with the community.

Under Great River's contract with Rainbow, it had planned to decrease its purchase of the coal-fired power to 350 megawatts this year as the wind farm was expected to come online and be off of coal by 2031. Rainbow would have collected revenues from the wind power going on its electric line which the company said would have been reinvested into Coal Creek.

Bell said there are still discussions regarding a new wind farm in the area, though there is nothing to announce at this time.

One effort that is moving forward is a project that converts coal waste from into cement and other materials. That project was announced in 2023 and is expected to go online soon, Bell said.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bismarcktribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/84/08431a96-895c-55c1-9a49-587e9c1c355d/608b318ad10d4.image.jpg?crop=1803%2C947%2C0%2C101&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-28 23:01:06.251416

The answers might be sitting in an abandoned mall parking lot somewhere in America.","An abandoned shopping mall in Missouri has become an unexpected storage facility for Tesla, as hundreds of unsold electric vehicles continue to accumulate in its parking lot. This unusual situation raises questions about the company’s sales performance and future strategy in the American market.

The sight is striking – row after row of brand new Tesla vehicles packed tightly together, filling the former Chesterfield Mall parking area. This isn’t just a few dozen cars; we’re talking about hundreds of Teslas sitting idle under the Midwestern sun.

A growing storage problem

While a Tesla dealership exists approximately 3 miles away, it clearly lacks the capacity to house this growing inventory. The electric automaker has been renting this makeshift storage space since last year and continues to expand its footprint, with rent being paid regularly as the number of vehicles increases.

This practice of storing unsold inventory away from manufacturing facilities isn’t new for Tesla. Similar situations have been spotted in Florida (where some vehicles were unfortunately vandalized) and more recently in Detroit. The scale of this operation, however, seems noteworthy.

Google Maps Street View images dated June 2023 show the parking lot already filled with Tesla models, suggesting this practice has been ongoing for over a year. One image even captures a car carrier unloading six new vehicles – a snapshot of inventory that keeps growing rather than selling.

Sales challenges behind the stockpiling

The inventory buildup coincides with Tesla’s recent sales challenges. First-quarter revenue for 2025 dropped by a substantial 71%, and April’s performance didn’t bring much relief. U.S. sales for the month fell by 16%, significantly worse than the overall market decline of 4.4% during the same period.

This raises legitimate questions about Tesla’s strategy. What happens if consumer demand doesn’t increase? If these vehicles remain unsold for an extended period, what’s the contingency plan after the lease on this makeshift storage facility expires?

Industry implications

No car manufacturer wants to see their vehicles sitting in parking lots instead of driveways. For Tesla, a company that has historically enjoyed strong demand and even waiting lists for its products, this visual evidence of unsold inventory represents a meaningful shift in market dynamics.

The electric vehicle market in the United States is evolving rapidly, with increased competition from traditional automakers and newer EV startups. Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y, once groundbreaking products with few alternatives, now face rivals from nearly every major manufacturer.

This stockpiling situation offers a rare glimpse into the real-world challenges facing even the most prominent EV maker as the market matures.

Three other states led by Republicans– Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee– have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.

President Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state’s petrochemical industry, says the new law “sets the tone for the future” and will help the state “pursue energy independence and dominance.”

Environmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It’s “pure Orwellian greenwashing,” said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.

Globally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute — solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana’s law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.

Natural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.

Switching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

Besides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.

Redefining natural gas

Louisiana’s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to “prioritize” natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state’s electricity.

The law’s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.

“I don’t think it’s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don’t blow all the time and the sun don’t shine every day,” Landry said. The legislation “is saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,” he added.

Landry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry’s billionaire Koch family.

ALEC helped shape Ohio’s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post.

ALEC spokesperson Lars Dalseide said that just because an Ohio lawmaker left the 2022 ALEC convention with what he described as a model for legislation to define natural gas as clean energy does not mean the group shaped Ohio law. Dalseide said the convention is “a place where legislators from across the country gather to exchange ideas.”

Ohio’s legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.

According to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.

“The goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities’ ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,” Anderson said, adding that ALEC’s legislation makes natural gas “eligible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.”

Gov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s grid is already powered by natural gas.

Landry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state’s electric grid. He highlighted Meta’s plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.

Louisiana’s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the U.S. does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.

Consumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.

Legally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is “blind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,” Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana’s law.

It’s unclear to what extent Louisiana’s utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law “unenforceable” and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas “aligns well” with the state’s economic growth.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.timesleaderonline.com/images/2025/06/28004625/AP25175762940942-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 00:00:52.570005

While Musk's public feud with the administration highlights the immediate risks of policy shifts, it also obscures a deeper truth: the clean energy infrastructure boom is now unstoppable. From battery breakthroughs to grid modernization, investors stand to profit from structural shifts that will define the next decade of energy markets.

The Tax Bill's Disruption: A Catalyst, Not a Catastrophe

The proposed elimination of EV tax credits by 2026—paired with a $250 annual EV fee—threatens to reduce U.S. EV sales by 40% by 2030, according to a Princeton study. Yet this disruption is accelerating private-sector investments in the very infrastructure needed to sustain the EV revolution. Automakers, utilities, and tech firms are pouring capital into charging networks, battery recycling, and grid resilience, even as federal subsidies wane.

While Tesla's (TSLA) stock has fluctuated in response to policy uncertainty, the broader EV ecosystem is diversifying beyond Musk's orbit. Companies like BYD (002594.SZ), which recently unveiled a 1 MW battery capable of charging 400 km in 5 minutes, are pushing the technological envelope. The lesson? Invest in innovation, not ideology.

The Infrastructure Gold Rush: Three Plays for Long-Term Gains

Battery Tech & Recycling

The race to reduce costs and improve safety has created opportunities in advanced materials and recycling. Companies like CATL (300750.SZ) and Redwood Materials (private) are building second-life battery systems for grid storage, slashing lithium dependency by 30% or more.

Investment Thesis: Look for firms with patents in anode/cathode design or partnerships with utilities. A portfolio of battery ETFs (e.g., ARKQ) offers diversified exposure.

Charging Networks

Despite federal delays, private investment in fast chargers is surging. By 2025, automakers plan to install 30,000 fast chargers along U.S. highways—a $12 billion market by 2030. Operators like EVgo (EVGO) and ChargePoint (CHPT) are positioning themselves as critical infrastructure players.

Investment Thesis: Focus on firms with proprietary software (e.g., AI-driven load balancing) or strategic partnerships with automakers.

Grid Modernization

The Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program has allocated $10.5 billion to harden grids against climate risks. Utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Dominion Energy (D) are upgrading transmission lines and deploying smart meters, while microgrid developers (e.g., Enphase Energy ENPH) are capitalizing on distributed energy demand.

Investment Thesis: Regulated utilities with rate-base growth in grid projects offer stable returns, while microgrid specialists offer high-growth potential.

Risks & Reality Checks

Policy Volatility: The EV credit cuts may be delayed or diluted in Congress, but infrastructure investments are less politically contentious.

Supply Chain Bottlenecks: Transformer shortages and rare-earth mineral constraints could delay projects. Monitor companies with vertically integrated supply chains (e.g., Tesla's Gigafactories).

Conclusion: Build Where the Future Is Wrought

Musk's clash with Trump distracts from a simple truth: clean energy infrastructure is now a $99 billion industry with 11.6% annual growth potential. Investors who focus on the physical and digital layers enabling EV adoption—batteries, chargers, and grids—will profit regardless of tax credit timelines. As Musk himself might say, “The road to sustainability is paved with infrastructure, not subsidies.”",,N,,2025-06-28 22:02:57.200002

This article dissects the bill's implications for solar and wind companies and highlights strategies to navigate the post-credit landscape.

The Bill's Double-Edged Sword: Valuation Pressures and Sector Realignment

The Senate's draft legislation targets three pillars of the renewable energy ecosystem: tax incentives for consumers, manufacturing credits for U.S. factories, and penalties for projects using materials from “foreign entities of concern” (FEOCs), primarily China. The most immediate impact is on companies reliant on the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC), which have been instrumental in driving wind and solar deployment since 2022's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The market's reaction has been mixed. Solar manufacturers like First Solar (FSLR) and wind turbine producers such as Vestas (VWDRY) have seen sharp declines, while diversified players like NextEra Energy (NEE) have held up better due to their integrated utility and storage assets. The disconnect highlights a critical divide: companies with exposure to expiring credits face valuation resets, while those pivoting to FEOC-compliant supply chains or alternative revenue streams may thrive.

Key Provisions and Their Impact:

Tax Credit Phase-Out Timeline:

Solar/Wind Projects: Tax credits drop to 60% in 2026, 20% in 2027, and zero by 2028. Projects starting construction by December 31, 2025, qualify for full credits.

Battery Storage: Maintains credits until 2033 but faces gradual phase-outs.

Geothermal/Nuclear: Retains full credits until 2033, offering a relative safe haven for investors.

FEOC Penalties:

Projects using materials from China or other FEOCs face new taxes unless they can prove compliance with supply chain audits. This creates a “race to qualify” for companies, favoring those with vertically integrated supply chains or partnerships with non-FEOC manufacturers.

The Valuation Crossroads: Winners and Losers in the New Landscape

The bill's impact on company valuations hinges on three factors:

1. Exposure to Expiring Credits: Companies with projects tied to 2025 deadlines may see short-term volatility but could benefit from rushed construction booms.

2. Supply Chain Resilience: Firms with diversified suppliers or FEOC-free sourcing (e.g., U.S.-based polysilicon producers) gain a competitive edge.

3. Diversification into Favored Sectors: Geothermal, nuclear, and energy storage firms may see increased interest as alternatives to wind/solar.

Notable Risks:

Job Losses and Layoffs: Analysts predict up to 830,000 job losses by 2030, driven by canceled projects like NorSun's Tulsa solar factory and Qcells' Georgia expansion.

Investment Pullbacks: Over $500 billion in announced clean energy projects face cancellation or delay, per the Rhodium Group.

Hidden Opportunities:

Supply Chain Plays: Companies like Talon PV (specializing in U.S.-made solar panels) or NextEra's battery partnerships could capture market share if they avoid FEOC penalties.

Geothermal/Nuclear Plays: Ormat Technologies (ORA) and NuScale Power (a subsidiary of Fluor Corporation) are positioned to benefit from extended tax credits in these sectors.

International Diversification: Firms with global operations, such as ENGIE or TotalEnergies, may pivot to markets where incentives remain intact (e.g., the EU's REPower Plan).

Investment Strategy: Navigating the Post-Credit Era

Investors should adopt a multi-pronged approach:

1. Short-Term Volatility Plays:

Short solar ETFs: Consider inverse ETFs like SOLR (Solar Industry ETF) to capitalize on near-term uncertainty.

Long FEOC-compliant stocks: Buy companies with clear supply chain compliance, such as 1366 Technologies (WFR) or Hemlock Semiconductor Group, a U.S. polysilicon producer.

2. Long-Term Structural Plays:

Geothermal/Nuclear ETFs: The Global X Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) offers exposure to extended-credit sectors.

Energy Storage Leaders: Tesla's Megapack division and Fluor's partnerships with NuScale could dominate post-2028 storage markets.

3. Geopolitical Hedge:

China Exposure? Despite FEOC penalties, companies with dual supply chains (e.g., Canadian Solar (CSIQ)) may offer asymmetric upside if U.S.-China trade tensions ease.

Final Analysis: A Policy-Driven Reset for Renewable Energy

The Senate bill's passage would mark a paradigm shift: renewable energy transitions from a subsidized growth sector to one where companies must compete on cost and innovation. While valuations for solar and wind firms face near-term headwinds, the bill also accelerates the industry's maturation. Investors who focus on supply chain resilience, FEOC-compliant assets, and under-the-radar geothermal/nuclear plays can position themselves to capitalize on the post-credit era's winners.

As Elon Musk warned, the bill risks “destroying millions of jobs,” but markets rarely stand still. For investors, the challenge is to separate the sector's growing pains from its enduring potential.

Then it would licence the battery manufacturing technology from CATL, which would train the original staff, then decamp back to China.
So Ford and CATL did a quick huddle and decided Michigan was the place for them to build their new battery factory.","The US auto industry has factories in California, Nevada, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio, but its spiritual home has always been in Michigan where Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler have had their headquarters for a century or more. There’s a reason why Detroit is known as Motor City. As the EV revolution lurches forward, the battery factories that will supply the electric cars of the future — and employ thousands of American workers — are being built in Michigan because that’s where there customers are located.

However, the virulent opposition to electric vehicles by the current administration is putting political pressure on those battery factories in a way that was simply unimaginable a few short years ago. The Biden administration tore a page from the conservative playbook when it created the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Conservatives loathe mandates, so the Biden team loaded the law with manufacturing incentives — financial rewards designed to encourage companies to build the battery factories America would need to make more affordable electric cars and trucks.

There were no sticks in the IRA. Despite all the rending of garments and gnashing of teeth about mandates and government overreach, it simply said if companies wanted to build battery factories, they would be eligible for certain financial incentives. This has been standard procedure for both the federal, state, and local governments for decades. If you want something done, make it financially attractive to do so and it will get done.

But instead of saying thank you for adopting ideas from the conservative playbook, Republicans reacted with uncontrolled fury. How dare the mean Democrats steal our ideas and use them against us! Politics is a strange sort of Alice in Wonderland world where up is down and black is white. And when the Republicans returned to power in the last election, they looked at what the Democrats had done and shouted “Off With Their Heads!”

Ford Battery Factory In Marshall, Michigan, In Jeopardy

Ford is working diligently to construct a new battery factory in Marshall, Michigan. That facility will manufacture LFP cells, a first for Ford and arguably a key step forward for the Blue Oval brand, one that will make it possible to lower the cost of its future electric cars. The nearly one-mile-long factory is about 60 percent complete and is already manufacturing prototype battery cells that will be used to validate their performance.

But whether that factory ever gets completed is up in the air at the moment. Those incentives and production credits are in danger of being revoked by the Big Beautiful Bill working its way through the US Congress like a mongoose inside a python. Ford is facing a double whammy. Not only is the wrecking crew in charge of Congress determined to repeal every jot and tittle of the IRA, there is strong anti-China sentiment throughout the Republican Party.

That’s a problem because CATL, the Chinese company that is the largest battery manufacturer in the world, is Ford’s partner in the Marshall battery factory. CATL is the acknowledged leader in LFP battery technology (BYD is close behind), but having its name on the factory building would raise too many concerns for people both locally and nationally. So Ford came up with an ingenious plan.

Rather than a traditional partnership with CATL, it created a unique business arrangement whereby it would own the land, the building, and the production machinery. Then it would licence the battery manufacturing technology from CATL, which would train the original staff, then decamp back to China. In exchange, Ford would pay a royalty to CATL for each battery cell produced. Ford hoped it would be a model for bringing Chinese battery technology to America, and, in fact, according to Bloomberg, Tesla later struck a similar deal with CATL to manufacture LFP cells for energy storage.

Ford originally proposed to build the factory in Virginia, but its governor, Glenn Youngkin — who had some thoughts about maybe running for president one day — decided to beat his breast in front of the cameras and declare that Virginia didn’t need the jobs the factory would bring and that Virginia didn’t want no stinking Chinese corporations doing business within its borders. So Ford and CATL did a quick huddle and decided Michigan was the place for them to build their new battery factory.

A Charm Offensive

Now Ford is in the middle of a charm offensive designed to keep Congress from changing the rules of the game to the point that the battery factory in Marshall, Michigan, might no longer be financial viable. This past week, it invited key legislators to Marshall to view the factory and satisfy themselves there were no scary yellow-skinned people lurking about. Lisa Drake, Ford’s VP of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, led the lawmakers through the factory and summarized online what she told them during the tour:

This facility represents a historic step. An American automotive company is manufacturing — without relying on a foreign joint venture — LFP battery cells and battery packs domestically with American workers for American-assembled next-generation electric vehicles. We remain on track to start production of these prismatic LFP batteries next year.

Our ambition for vertical integration in the right places within our battery supply chain remains a key priority and is critical for future success. The scale of the facility is also key to unlock the cost benefits. We are bringing home to the U.S. the innovation that escaped our industry decades ago, and the result is we will not have to rely on imports in a continually changing global trade environment.

To really deliver truly affordable electric vehicles to our customers, we made a decision years ago to fully invest in a new facility with world-class LFP production technology installed in the U.S. for the first time — wholly owned and operated by Ford. This allows us to integrate cutting-edge innovation while building expertise and retaining control that will lay the foundation for future battery manufacturing in the U.S. — allowing the U.S. to finally build LFP batteries at scale and pave the way to compete globally on energy storage production.

Ford has invested $3 billion in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan. We’re excited that we will welcome around 1,700 people to this team — American jobs in the heart of Michigan.

A Disappearing US Auto Industry

Wow! That is powerful stuff, and it should have a significant effect on any legislator actually concerned about making America great again instead of sucking up to the putrid potentate in the Offal Office. Will the tour change any minds? Based on the virulence of the current mood in Washington, that’s doubtful, which could leave Ford scrambling to replace the $2.3 billion in federal incentives it expected to receive between 2026 and 2029. “I really feel bad for the automakers. I never thought I’d say that,” Sam Adham, the head of battery materials at consultancy CRU Group, told Bloomberg. “Everywhere they turn, there’s a sort of a roadblock.”

Bob Lee, president of LG Energy Solution in North America, told Gabrielle Coppola of Bloomberg, “This whole momentum behind creating an important industry will suffer” if Congress pulls the rug out from under the industries that made important business decisions in good faith based on the benefits promised by the IRA. He worries that if another swing of the pendulum on industrial policy forces Detroit to put off the hard work of making affordable EVs profitably, it won’t get another shot to compete with China’s state-backed juggernauts. “If we can’t sell cars anywhere else, that’s a dangerous place to be. We’re fast getting to that point,” he said.

Will Congress tear up the IRA just to score political points? If it does, few will be surprised. The whole MAGA nonsense is about scoring political points. Why would anyone expect them to suddenly start being rational?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ford-Marshall-battery-factory.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 21:00:32.810617

Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/political/2025/06/27/22067219/685ecc2147bbd-media_4848db0607744a889293d7af549eb407-DMID1-67g6ifmca-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 08:06:21.531954

Trump on Friday evening called for the end of the credits and said they no longer need support.","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The latest version of the Senate’s massive budget bill that the Senate is racing through for a vote as soon as Saturday deals a fatal blow to the use of tax credits in place since 2005 to spur more wind and solar energy and would set a new tax on those projects for the first time, renewable energy proponents said on Saturday.

Despite hopes earlier in the week that the Senate would rework the budget megabill’s language about the future use of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to extend their use and make them more usable, the new version of the bill introduced by Senate leadership overnight will effectively repeal the incentives for solar and wind immediately.

Instead, it imposes a new tax on wind and solar projects completed after Dec. 31, 2027 if they cannot prove they have not used any Chinese components, while offering a new tax break for coal production.

It also accelerates the phase-out of clean energy manufacturing tax credits that have attracted billions in investments throughout the US, especially in Republican states.

The clean energy industry and environmental groups decried the last-minute changes to the bill, saying that it will raise household energy costs and deprive the US of new, necessary and fast electricity capacity at a time of massive power demand amid a rush of construction of power-hungry data centers to power AI development.

Trump’s former advisor and head of DOGE Elon Musk blasted the bill on his social media platform X on Saturday, warning that the bill will “destroy millions of jobs in America” and cause “strategic harm.”

“It is utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” he said.

Energy security organization SAFE said in a statement that the bill, as written, would give an advantage to China, which dominates the clean energy and electric vehicle industries and is racing to outpace the US in AI development by taking away financing for energy storage, mineral processing and power projects.

“Where the original Senate version was a recipe for energy stagnation, this is outright energy surrender—all but guaranteeing Chinese dominance of critical minerals, industrial supply chains, and AI development,” said Avery Ash, head of government affairs for SAFE.

Green energy opponents praised the bill for ending support for renewable energy. Trump on Friday evening called for the end of the credits and said they no longer need support.

“If, as supporters of the IRA are complaining, repealing these subsidies will ‘kill’ their industry, then maybe it shouldn’t exist in the first place,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance.

The H-2A rocket lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, carrying the GOSAT-GW satellite as part of Tokyo’s effort to mitigate climate change. The satellite was released into a planned orbit about 16 minutes later.

The launch follows several days of delays because of malfunctioning of the rocket’s electrical systems.

Sunday’s launch marked the 50th and final flight for the H-2A, which has served as Japan’s mainstay rocket to carry satellites and probes into space with a near-perfect record since its 2001 debut. After its retirement, it will be fully replaced by the H3, which is already in operation, as Japan’s new main flagship.

“Even though our launches seemed stable, we have run into difficulties and overcome them one by one to come this far,” said Iwao Igarashi, senior general manager of the space systems division at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which operated launch services. “As we now move on to the H3 launch service, we will firmly keep up the trust we gained from H-2A.”

The GOSAT-GW, or Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse gases and Water cycle, is a third series in the mission to monitor carbon, methane and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Within one year, it will start distributing data such as sea surface temperature and precipitation with much higher resolution to users around the world, including the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, officials said.

The liquid-fuel H-2A rocket with two solid-fuel sub-rockets developed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has so far had 49 flights with a 98% success record, with only one failure in 2003. Mitsubishi Heavy has provided its launch operation since 2007.

H-2A successfully carried into space many satellites and probes, including Japan’s moon lander SLIM last year, and a popular Hayabusa2 spacecraft in 2014 to reach a distant asteroid, contributing to the country’s space programs.

Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security, and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors of the H-2A series — the larger H3 with Mitsubishi, and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.

The H3, is designed to carry larger payloads than the H-2A at about half its launch cost to be globally competitive, though officials say more cost reduction efforts are needed to achieve better price competitiveness in the global market.

The H3 has made four consecutive successful flights after a failed debut attempt in 2023, when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",https://www.fox44news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2025/06/68608972b554f7.92999068.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-28 21:00:22.630644

As California Braces for a $900 Million Tourism Hit, Fresno County Emerges as the Golden State’s Secret Weapon, Defying Decline with Airports, Food, and Local Allure

As California braces for a $900 million tourism hit, Fresno County emerges as the Golden State’s secret weapon, defying decline with airports, food, and local allure.

Now, California faces a storm. A looming $900 million tourism hit shakes confidence and rattles the Golden State’s glittering reputation. However, Fresno County refuses to flinch. It emerges as California’s secret weapon, determined to defy decline. Moreover, Fresno County fuels its rise with powerful airports, unforgettable food, and irresistible local allure. Meanwhile, California braces for fallout, fearing the loss of precious visitor dollars. But Fresno County stands tall, ready to write its own story.

As the Golden State’s secret weapon, it transforms crisis into opportunity, holding tight to airports, culinary pride, and its magnetic local allure. So stay alert. Because as California braces for a $900 million tourism hit, Fresno County emerges to defy decline—and this is only the beginning.

California’s Tourism Dream Meets a Harsh Reality

California stands at a crossroads.

Tourism has long fueled the Golden State, filling hotels, highways, and restaurants from San Francisco’s steep hills to Los Angeles’ glittering streets.

However, 2025 delivers an unwelcome surprise: the state faces a projected $900 million drop in tourism spending.

It’s the first real contraction since the chaos of COVID-19. And it sends shockwaves through an industry accustomed to growth.

Political Waves Ripple Through Travel Plans

Meanwhile, California’s tourism dip is more than numbers on a spreadsheet.

International visitors, particularly from Canada, are pulling back. Political tensions and fiery rhetoric have soured sentiment, with talks of tariffs and dramatic declarations stoking uncertainty.

Moreover, emotional decisions ripple through families and travelers, who suddenly view California not just as beaches and wine country but as a political battleground.

As a result, major tourism hubs like San Francisco and Los Angeles feel the sting. Their heavy reliance on high-dollar international travelers leaves them exposed as global sentiments shift.

Fresno County Stands Apart

However, in the heart of the Central Valley, Fresno County charts a different course.

While California braces for losses, Fresno County emerges as a shining example of resilience.

It refuses to rely solely on international dollars. Instead, it cultivates a tourism economy as diverse as its farmland and people.

Moreover, Fresno’s secret weapon lies in its connection to the local and regional traveler. The county has mastered the art of attracting visitors from the Bay Area, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Sacramento. These drive markets keep tourism steady—even when international flights waver.

Location, Location, Location

Fresno County’s geography is its gift.

Nestled in California’s center, it offers travelers a perfect launchpad. National parks like Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia lie within easy reach.

Meanwhile, the region’s rolling green hills in spring and golden fields in summer paint postcard-perfect scenes for road trippers and photographers.

Moreover, Fresno County stands as a lower-cost alternative for families seeking adventure without coastal price tags. Hotel rates, meals, and activities stretch dollars further here than in California’s glitzier cities.

Air Travel Becomes a Game Changer

Meanwhile, Fresno Yosemite International Airport is transforming into a force of its own.

A new international terminal, set to open later this year, promises smoother journeys and better connections. The airport has already expanded its security checkpoints, easing congestion for travelers.

Moreover, the county’s tourism vision includes direct flights from cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Phoenix, Dallas, Seattle, and Portland. Even distant markets like New York and Washington D.C. show growing interest in Fresno.

This airline connectivity positions Fresno as not merely a local hub—but a national player in California tourism.

Sporting Events Keep Visitors Coming

However, Fresno County’s strategy extends beyond parks and flights.

The region has become a powerhouse for sporting events. From high school championships to collegiate competitions, sports tourism injects consistent energy and revenue into local businesses.

Five California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) tournaments alone pull thousands of athletes, families, and fans into the valley each year.

Moreover, Fresno’s partnerships reach beyond state lines. Creative collaborations, like the city’s cross-promotion with Atlanta’s university mascots, bring playful yet effective exposure to new markets.

Culinary Pride Fuels Local Loyalty

Moreover, Fresno County wears its culinary scene like a badge of honor.

Farm-to-fork isn’t just a buzzword here—it’s daily life. The region boasts some of California’s richest agriculture, delivering fresh ingredients straight from field to plate.

Restaurants like Saizon, recognized by the Los Angeles Times among California’s top 101 eateries, showcase the valley’s culinary prowess.

Meanwhile, locals fiercely defend Fresno’s food scene, claiming it can rival any major city. For travelers, the valley offers a taste of authentic California without sky-high prices.

California Faces a Perfect Storm as Wildfires, Politics, and Cruise Bans Push State Tourism into Rare Decline

California faces a perfect storm as wildfires, politics, and cruise bans push state tourism into rare decline.

Now, California stands at a crossroads. Flames roar through forests, leaving scars. Meanwhile, politics brews tension, and cruise bans reshape coastlines. California faces this perfect storm head-on, struggling to protect the state’s glittering tourism dream.

However, the threat grows larger. Wildfires blaze, forcing evacuations. Politics stirs uncertainty, and cruise bans sever vital connections. As a result, California watches state tourism slip into rare decline, rattling businesses, workers, and visitors alike.

Moreover, whispers turn into urgent conversations. Will California survive this perfect storm? Or will wildfires, politics, and cruise bans push the state deeper into crisis?

California faces a perfect storm, and its future hangs in the balance. Wildfires rage, politics intensify, and cruise bans loom. State tourism teeters on the edge of rare decline, and the next chapter could change everything.

A Golden State No Longer Untouchable

For decades, California has seemed invincible.

From the beaches of Malibu to the vineyards of Napa and the cityscapes of Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Golden State has been America’s tourism crown jewel.

However, 2025 has proven that even California isn’t immune to forces beyond its control.

A convergence of crises is pushing the state into its first significant tourism downturn since the pandemic. The projected toll? A stunning $900 million drop in tourism revenue.

Wildfires Leave Scars on Tourism Hotspots

In January 2025, the year opened with a blaze.

From January 7 to 31, Southern California battled fierce wildfires, including the Palisades and Eaton Fires.

Flames tore across Los Angeles, Ventura, San Diego, and surrounding regions. Over 57,000 acres burned. More than 18,000 structures were destroyed.

Highways closed. Schools shuttered. Flights were grounded, and entire communities were forced to evacuate.

Moreover, the fires crushed the travel spirit. Visitors abandoned plans. Hotels saw mass cancellations. Events were called off, and attractions lay silent under a smoky sky.

Even as the flames subsided, the scars on California’s tourism reputation remained vivid. For many potential travelers, images of wildfires have replaced thoughts of sunshine and surf.

Political Tensions Dampen International Arrivals

Meanwhile, politics dealt California another blow.

Between February and March 2025, international arrivals tumbled.

Canadian tourism plunged nearly 15.5%. Mexican travel fell by 24%. Visitors from the UK dropped about 22%.

This was no accident. Rhetoric surrounding trade, tariffs, and even jokes about Canada becoming America’s “51st state” soured international sentiment.

Moreover, travelers who once flocked to California’s iconic sights hesitated. Political tensions left a chill, and many opted to explore destinations perceived as more welcoming or stable.

California forecasts a staggering 9.2% drop in international visits for 2025, slashing hundreds of millions in revenue from the state’s tourism economy.

The First Revenue Decline Since the Pandemic

The ripple effects are now surfacing in cold, hard numbers.

State experts predict total visitation could fall between 0.7% and 1%.

More strikingly, international visitor spending is expected to shrink by about 4.3%.

Altogether, this signals a looming $900 million hit to California’s tourism revenue—a sobering reversal for a state that had been riding a wave of growth since pandemic restrictions eased.

For hotels, restaurants, and attractions already wrestling with labor shortages and rising costs, this projected decline threatens to squeeze margins further.

Los Angeles Bears the Brunt of the Crisis

If California is hurting, Los Angeles is bleeding.

Wildfires ravaged L.A. communities like Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Altadena, leaving thousands displaced. Once-bustling streets fell eerily quiet.

International arrivals at LAX dipped 3.5% in early 2025. For a city so dependent on global tourism, even small percentage drops translate to massive financial losses.

Hotels felt the pain acutely. The iconic Georgian Hotel in Santa Monica alone reported nearly $700,000 in canceled bookings during the wildfire crisis.

Moreover, as L.A. tried to recover, it faced another challenge. A heated labor dispute erupted over a proposed $30 minimum wage for hospitality workers, further complicating the recovery narrative.

Monterey Turns Away the Cruise Industry

Farther up the coast, Monterey delivered an unexpected blow to California’s tourism equation.

Led by local teenagers passionate about environmental preservation, the city banned cruise ships from docking.

While the environmental victory was celebrated by activists, it came with steep economic consequences.

Monterey lost about a dozen annual cruise liners. Local businesses, especially those dependent on waterfront tourism, saw customer counts dwindle. Shops, restaurants, and tour operators suddenly faced gaps where once there were streams of eager visitors disembarking from ships.

For California, this added yet another dimension to a year already fraught with tourism setbacks.

Industry Fights Back with Recovery Campaigns

However, California refuses to go quietly into decline.

Visit California has launched a $4.3 million wildfire recovery and marketing campaign. The goal? To combat negative imagery and remind travelers that much of the state remains safe, vibrant, and open for business.

Meanwhile, local tourism boards have pivoted their strategies. A “California Loves Canada” campaign emerged, aiming to repair strained relations and lure back Canadian travelers who once formed a vital piece of the state’s tourism puzzle.

Additionally, cities like Fresno County are leaning heavily on domestic markets, promoting local strengths like farm-to-fork dining, proximity to national parks, and affordable alternatives to coastal destinations.

A Future Hanging in the Balance

California’s tourism landscape faces more questions than answers.

Will international visitors forgive political tensions? Can wildfire-scarred regions rebuild their reputations? And will cruise bans inspire other cities to make similar environmental choices at tourism’s expense?

Moreover, economic uncertainty looms large. Travelers worldwide are cautious, watching inflation, geopolitical shifts, and the cost of long-haul flights.

Yet California still has much in its favor. It’s a state of immense beauty, diversity, and cultural magnetism.

Tourism insiders remain confident that, despite temporary setbacks, the Golden State will shine again. But the road to recovery could be longer—and bumpier—than many expected.

For now, California’s story is one of resilience, reinvention, and a relentless fight to remain America’s ultimate travel icon.

Tourism Slump Hits US States Hard in 2025 as Politics, Heat Waves, and Economic Worries Shake American Travel Dreams

Tourism slump hits U.S. states hard in 2025 as politics, heat waves, and economic worries shake American travel dreams.

Now, the tourism slump sweeps across the nation, leaving U.S. states struggling under its weight. Meanwhile, politics ignites fierce debates, heat waves scorch cities, and economic worries tighten purse strings.

However, this isn’t just numbers on charts. It’s American travel dreams slipping through sunburned fingers. Families cancel trips. Hotels stare at empty rooms. Airlines brace for thinner skies.

Moreover, the tourism slump hits U.S. states hard, sparking fears of lost jobs and shattered local economies. Politics fans the flames, while heat waves blaze mercilessly, threatening safety and comfort.

Hawaii’s Paradise Struggles Under New Pressures

Hawaii, long the poster child of American paradise, is struggling under the weight of sobering numbers.

By mid-2025, the islands have seen visitor arrivals slide 4% below last year. It’s more than just a minor blip—it’s a potential $1.6 billion hit to the state’s economy.

The scars of the devastating Lahaina fire in 2023 still linger, casting a shadow over Maui’s tourism. Meanwhile, rising travel costs and diminished arrivals from Japan and Canada are squeezing the islands further.

Hotels, restaurants, and local attractions feel the pinch. For many businesses, the vibrant hum of tourist dollars has quieted.

Moreover, Hawaii’s tourism authority is scrambling to counter negative perceptions and restore confidence among international visitors hesitant to return.

Florida Sees Canadian Arrivals Collapse

Meanwhile, Florida’s tourism picture is more complicated than palm trees and theme parks.

The Sunshine State faces a staggering drop in Canadian arrivals—historically one of its largest tourism sources.

Reports show Canadian travel reservations plunging as much as 60% in some regions, particularly Fort Myers, Palm Beach, and Orlando.

Behind the numbers lies a political story. A Canadian boycott movement gained momentum in early 2025, driven by tensions over U.S. policy rhetoric and new tariffs.

Airlines are cutting seats on routes connecting Canada to Florida cities. Meanwhile, hotels and attractions reliant on Canadian snowbirds are recalculating revenue forecasts.

Moreover, tourism boards are shifting gears, pivoting marketing efforts toward domestic U.S. travelers to soften the blow.

New York City Faces a Chilling Decline

New York City, the city that never sleeps, is confronting an unwelcome slowdown.

As of June 2025, tourism officials slashed projections by roughly three million visitors for the year.

The city’s lifeblood—its international arrivals—has faltered. Air travel from Canada has dropped by 20%, and land crossings from Canadian provinces are down even more sharply, around 35%.

Moreover, European bookings have declined approximately 12% compared to the same time last year.

Political tensions, visa delays, and global perceptions of a more closed-off U.S. are weighing heavily on decisions to visit America’s biggest urban playground.

Hotels, Broadway theaters, and restaurants all feel the squeeze, recalibrating expectations for the rest of the year.

California Feels the Heat of Political Fallout

California, often seen as America’s travel golden child, is also facing turbulent times.

While the state drew 270 million visitors in 2024 and generated over $150 billion in tourism revenue, the outlook for 2025 is starkly different.

Statewide tourism spending is projected to drop by $900 million—a significant reversal after years of steady gains post-pandemic.

One of the primary culprits? Political tensions spilling across borders.

Canadian visitors are shying away after heated political rhetoric and policy threats, including talk of tariffs and even jokes about Canada becoming the “51st state.”

Meanwhile, California’s reliance on high-spending international travelers leaves regions like San Francisco and Los Angeles exposed to these shifting winds.

However, regions like Fresno County are bucking the trend by focusing on domestic visitors and leveraging local strengths like national parks and regional cuisine.

Las Vegas Faces Slowing Visitor Numbers

Nevada, too, feels the sting of shrinking tourism.

Las Vegas reported a 7.8% drop in visitor numbers during early 2025 compared to last year. Strip casino revenues are sliding, and passenger counts at Harry Reid International Airport are down nearly 4% as summer begins.

Tourism analysts point to several factors: economic uncertainty, international travel hesitation, and new domestic travel trends pulling people toward less crowded destinations.

Moreover, hotel occupancy rates are softening. Average daily room rates remain relatively high, but the volume of travelers has slipped below forecasts.

The entertainment capital of America now faces a tough balancing act—luring back tourists while protecting profit margins amid weaker demand.

National Slump Reflects Broader Global Shift

Zooming out, the story is not merely regional—it’s national.

The U.S. as a whole is facing a projected 7–7.8% drop in foreign travel spending this year. That translates to as much as $12.5 billion in lost revenue across airlines, hotels, restaurants, and attractions.

Data from the U.S. Travel Association shows inbound visits fell about 14% in March compared to 2024, with notable dips from Canada and Mexico—two of America’s most crucial travel markets.

Meanwhile, the World Travel & Tourism Council confirms that the U.S. stands alone among major economies expecting a tourism spending decline in 2025.

Climate Woes Add a New Layer of Uncertainty

Adding fuel to the fire, literal heat waves are transforming traveler behavior across major U.S. cities.

Record-breaking heat engulfed New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., and Baltimore in June, pushing temperatures into triple digits.

Outdoor attractions closed, Amtrak slowed trains for safety, and city tourism boards scrambled to implement emergency measures.

Travelers are now questioning summer trips to traditionally bustling cities, worried about health risks and comfort.

Meanwhile, tourism officials are rethinking strategies—investing in indoor attractions, promoting off-season travel, and offering flexible booking policies.

The Path Forward: Reinvention and Resilience

Despite gloomy headlines, the American tourism story isn’t finished. It’s evolving.

States like Hawaii and Florida are doubling down on loyalty campaigns and digital marketing to reconnect with travelers.

Cities like New York and San Francisco are diversifying messaging to attract domestic audiences and pivot away from total reliance on international markets.

Meanwhile, destinations like Fresno County show how resilience can flourish by focusing on local appeal, regional drive markets, and culinary authenticity.

One thing remains clear: tourism in the U.S. will survive—but it may look very different in the years ahead.

Fresno’s Steadfast Messaging

While California’s coastal giants scramble to adapt, Fresno sticks to its steady drumbeat.

Regardless of political winds, economic fears, or global turbulence, Fresno County stays true to its core message:

It’s a place for genuine experiences, real connections, and diverse adventures.

Moreover, the county’s tourism leadership understands that travelers crave authenticity. Fresno offers that in spades, wrapped in natural beauty and local charm.

A Blueprint for Resilience

Fresno’s story is more than local triumph. It serves as a blueprint for how destinations can thrive amid uncertainty.

Diversifying markets. Investing in infrastructure. Embracing local identity. These strategies fortify Fresno County even as California’s broader tourism numbers waver.

Meanwhile, the $900 million shortfall looming over California cannot be ignored. Yet Fresno’s resilience proves that tourism success isn’t dictated by global headlines alone.

The Road Ahead

As 2025 progresses, all eyes remain on the Golden State.

Will California recapture its lost visitors? Can political rhetoric cool down enough to welcome travelers back from key markets like Canada?

The weekend arm-twisting, which included Trump golfing with frequent foe Rand Paul and other senators, came as the party worked to rush the bill to the president’s desk ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Senate leaders had planned a 4 p.m. ET procedural vote but were still trying to secure the simple majority they needed.

Senate Republicans unveiled a new version of their $4.2 trillion tax cut package early Saturday that adjusts key provisions on the SALT deduction, Medicaid and clean energy.

The new draft reflects compromises among warring factions of the Senate GOP which has been divided over how much to cut safety net programs such as Medicaid and how rapidly to phase out renewable energy tax credits enacted under the Biden administration.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said he plans for his chamber to start voting on the tax bill Saturday with final votes coming as soon as early Sunday. Democrats, however, are threatening to force the bill be read on the floor, which would likely push the final vote to Monday.

Party leaders plan to bring House members back to Washington early next week for what they hope will be final approval of the measure in time for Trump’s Independence Day deadline.

It is not yet clear if the 50 Senate Republicans needed to pass the bill are all on board. The bill can be further altered on the Senate floor to secure the votes if needed. The House could also make more changes if Speaker Mike Johnson has trouble corralling votes for the measure.

But senators Ron Johnson and Thom Tillis have said they would vote against starting debate on the bill. Several others remained undecided hours after the latest bill was released.

“This is an important bill,” Johnson said. “There’s no need to rush it.”

Montana’s Tim Sheehy briefly threatened to block the bill before Thune offered him an amendment vote to strip out public land sales from the bill.

SALT deduction

A tentative deal with House Republicans to increase the state and local tax deduction is included. The bill would raise the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for five years before snapping back to the $10,000 level. The new cap applies to 2025 and rises 1% in subsequent years.

The ability to claim the full SALT amount would phase out for those making more than $500,000 per year. A House attempt to curb the ability of pass-though businesses to circumvent the SALT cap was removed from the text.

The deal has the support of most members of the House SALT caucus of Republicans from high-tax swing districts. While decried by conservatives for costing hundreds of billions of dollars, it has the blessing of the White House.

Senate Republicans also deleted a Section 899 “revenge tax” on some foreign companies and investors that had spooked Wall Street, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requested the change.

The Senate measure makes permanent individual and business tax breaks enacted in 2017, while adding temporary new breaks for tipped and overtime workers, seniors and car buyers.

Medicaid changes

To win over moderate Republicans, the bill would create a new $25 billion rural hospital fund aimed at helping mitigate the impact of Medicaid cuts, which otherwise could force some rural providers to shut down.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, however, had demanded a $100 billion fund.

Moderate Republicans also won a delay from 2031 to 2032 on the full impact of a new 3.5% cap on state Medicaid provider taxes. States often use these taxes, within some already existing rules, to draw down federal funding and increase payments to facilities like hospitals. Limits on the Medicaid funding mechanism would begin phasing in in 2028.

The cap on provider taxes would only apply to states that expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 40 states and the District of Columbia have done so.

The House-passed version of the bill proposed a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes, which the Congressional Budget Office said would save the federal government more than $89 billion over the next decade.

The measure also would impose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients and require Medicaid beneficiaries who gained eligibility through the Affordable Care Act to pay a share of their costs through charges such as co-pays and deductibles.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had criticized the cuts to Medicaid as too deep, said the changes were enough to gain his support while Collins said she “would lean against the bill” without more concessions, but would vote to begin debate.

Renewable energy

Senate Republicans moved up a cut-off for tax credits used for wind and solar projects even earlier then they initially proposed, amid pushback on the credits from Trump. The new measure requires those projects to be “placed in service” by the end of 2027 to receive the incentives, as opposed to simply being under construction by that time.

The change, if it makes into law, could be a blow to companies such as NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest U.S. developer of wind and solar projects. But the energy tweaks may help get holdout GOP Sen. Mike Lee to vote for the bill.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Americans in a social media post that Republicans’ plan to phase out the clean energy tax breaks would “jack up your electric bills and jeopardize hundreds of thousands of jobs.”

Senate Republicans also would alter an existing clean energy tax credit so that it would also cover production of metallurgical coal, which is used in steel making.

The new Senate legislation would end a popular $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles by Sept. 30, earlier than in the prior drafts. Tax credits for the purchase of used and commercial electric vehicles would end at the same time.

The bill would slash funding for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cut federal payments to states for food stamps and boost funds for a U.S.-Mexico border wall among other things.

The version drops a provision explicitly terminating the IRS-run free electronic filing Direct File program, a loss for TurboTax maker Intuit Inc. But the legislation keeps in a $15 million pot of funding that creates a task force to study replacing the free electronic filing program.

The bill would alter a proposed new tax on some remittances by noncitizens, lowering it from 3.5% in earlier versions to 1%, in a win for Western Union and Moneygram.

The measure would avert a U.S. payment default as soon as August by raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

FLASHBACK: MUSK ACCUSED TRUMP, GOP LEADERS OF NOT WANTING TO CUT SPENDING — HERE'S WHERE THEY SAID THEY WOULD

The billionaire criticized the first version of the bill June 3, calling it a ""massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill [that] is a disgusting abomination.""

""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong,"" Musk wrote in the June 3 post. ""You know it.""

'HE'S NOT A BIG FACTOR': TRUMP'S SENATE ALLIES DISMISS ELON MUSK'S CALLS TO 'KILL THE BILL'

The new version, which Senate Republicans hope to deliver to the president by July 4, was debuted Friday night by Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.

Among the changes in the bill are adjustments to the Medicaid provider tax rate, cost-sharing for food benefits, caps on state and local tax (SALT) deductions and cuts to wind and solar incentives.

The new spending guidelines limit credits to sites that start production before 2028 and introduce new taxes on certain projects that commence thereafter.

ELON MUSK POSTS ‘KILL BILL’ MEME IN LATEST PUSH TO NIX TRUMP’S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

In his post about the environmental cuts, Musk said the bill would give ""handouts"" to industries of the past, while severely damaging industries of the future.

The American Clean Power Association (ACP) issued a similar statement Saturday, noting the new taxes would freeze energy investments, reduce domestic energy production and drive up household energy bills.

""With no warning, the Senate has proposed new language that would increase taxes on domestic energy production,"" ACP CEO Jason Grumet wrote in a statement. ""In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry.""

DAVID MARCUS: MUSK VS. MAGA ON 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,' BUT GOP NEEDS BOTH

Grumet added the new taxes would ""strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments, threaten energy security, undermine growth in domestic manufacturing and land hardest on rural communities who would have been the greatest beneficiaries of clean energy investment.""

""We understand the Senate’s desire to meet the President’s July 4th deadline, but the stakes here are very high,"" he wrote. ""We urge Senate leadership to strike these last-minute tax increases and to take the time to responsibly analyze the impacts of this new tax regime on American businesses and communities.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Saturday afternoon said she was helping to hold the Senate ""all night"" to ""FORCE"" a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill.

The Wild Card: Global EV Markets The U.S. policy shift occurs as global competitors accelerate their clean energy agendas.","Elon Musk's vocal opposition to the Trump-backed megabill has thrust Tesla and the broader EV sector into the heart of a high-stakes political battle. While Musk's critiques of the legislation—particularly its phase-out of EV tax credits and imposition of new fees on electric vehicle owners—have been widely publicized, the deeper implications for investors remain underappreciated. The bill's provisions, if implemented, could redefine Tesla's market dominance, accelerate sector consolidation, and test the resilience of EV adoption in the U.S. market.

The Megabill's Triple Threat to Tesla

The megabill targets Tesla in three critical ways. First, the phase-out of federal EV tax credits for automakers that have sold more than 200,000 vehicles (like Tesla and GM) will eliminate a key financial incentive for buyers of newer models starting in 2025. This could pressure Tesla to lower prices or risk losing market share to competitors like Ford or Rivian, which are still under the sales threshold.

Second, a $250 annual fee on EV drivers—a move critics call a ""punitive tax""—could deter purchases of luxury EVs, where Tesla dominates. This fee, coupled with rising battery costs and supply chain bottlenecks, may squeeze Tesla's margins unless it can scale production efficiently.

Third, the bill's foreign ownership restrictions could complicate Tesla's reliance on Chinese battery suppliers. While Tesla has invested heavily in domestic Gigafactories, its global supply chain remains intertwined with Asian manufacturers. The rules, which bar components tied to ""prohibited foreign entities,"" could force Tesla to restructure its sourcing—a costly and time-consuming process.

The stock's volatility since 2023 reflects investor anxiety over these risks. Tesla's valuation hinges on its ability to navigate policy uncertainty while maintaining its technological edge.

Sector-Wide Risks and Opportunities

The megabill's impact extends beyond Tesla. The elimination of used EV tax credits by 2025 could slow adoption among lower-income buyers, reducing demand for secondhand Teslas and other EVs. Meanwhile, the termination of clean energy manufacturing credits (45X) threatens projects in battery and critical mineral facilities, which are critical to domestic supply chains. Over $224 billion in EV-related investments since 2009 could stall without these incentives, creating a risk of overcapacity in some markets.

However, the bill also presents opportunities for nimble investors. Companies with geographically diversified supply chains, such as Panasonic (which supplies Tesla's 4680 batteries) or Livent (a U.S. lithium producer), may benefit from reduced competition for scarce resources. Additionally, automakers like Ford or Rivian, which still qualify for tax credits, could outpace Tesla in the near term.

Strategic Investment Plays

Investors should consider two approaches: hedging against policy risk and capitalizing on sector consolidation.

Short Tesla or long competitors: If the megabill passes, shorting Tesla stock (TSLA) could yield gains, while taking long positions in companies like Ford (F) or Nio (NIO)—which benefits from China's EV subsidies—might hedge against Tesla-specific risks.

Focus on supply chain resilience: Invest in firms like Albemarle (ALB) or SQM (SQM), which control lithium reserves, or Uranium Energy Corp (UEC), which supplies critical minerals.

Monitor Senate revisions: The Senate's potential modifications to foreign ownership rules or tax credit phase-outs could create buying opportunities. Investors should track amendments to the bill's language on ""prohibited foreign entities.""

The Wild Card: Global EV Markets

The U.S. policy shift occurs as global competitors accelerate their clean energy agendas. China's subsidies for EVs and battery production, combined with Europe's stricter emissions rules, could push Tesla to prioritize overseas markets. Musk's recent push for Tesla's ""China 2.0"" strategy—expanding local production and software development—reflects this reality. Investors must weigh Tesla's U.S. challenges against its growing dominance in Asia and Europe.

Final Analysis: A Sector in Flux

The megabill's passage would mark a seismic shift in U.S. energy policy, pitting short-term fiscal conservatism against long-term climate goals. For Tesla, survival hinges on its ability to innovate faster than policy constraints. For investors, the path forward requires balancing exposure to EV leaders with bets on supply chain stability. As Musk once said, ""Companies that are stagnant get disrupted."" In this case, the disruptor may now be its own political adversaries.",,N,,2025-06-28 19:07:23.187698

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavor,” said Chancellor Tedd L. Mitchell, M.D. “Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this campus will not only be the largest energy and data complex of its kind, but also a testament to the unshakable spirit of our system, the Texas Panhandle and this great state.”

TTU officials said Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry, is set to partner in the project to provide infrastructure energy solutions amid the U.S.’s participation in “the energy-intensive AI race.”

Perry phrased the project as a way to bring “all hands on deck” to continue the nation’s development in the energy sector, following President Donald Trump’s executive order in May to “designate [AI] data centers, located at or operated in coordination with Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, as critical defense facilities, and the nuclear reactors powering them as defense critical electric infrastructure.”

Fermi America’s announcement of the project described it as “the only site with the potential to include safe, clean, new nuclear power, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power, and battery energy storage at unprecedented scale.”

The Pantex plant in Amarillo is considered a United States Department of Energy Superfund Site, though it does not generate nuclear energy.

The initial announcement from TTU did not specify whether or not the campus is intended to have its own nuclear power generator, nor a prospective timeline for that energy aspect. There were also no details in TTU’s initial announcement of the project regarding expected resource requirements for water or electricity usage.

Another recent project, APR Energy’s development of an 800-acre data center near Pampa, is expected to start with using 2 gigawatts of natural gas and 1.5 million gallons per day of water.

TTU officials noted the project campus will intend to include academic and research opportunities for faculty and students including internships, employment and workforce training, and placement programs set to benefit its institutions.

“This collaboration will not only position Texas Tech to address the evolving demands of the energy and technology sectors but will also create meaningful educational opportunities for our students and research possibilities across many disciplines for our faculty,” said TTU President Lawrence Schovanec.

New York, like many other states, including New Jersey, needs in-state energy plants now (“Hochul: NY is goin’ nuclear,” June 24).

Gov. Hochul should consult with professionals who know how much time and dollars are needed to build nuclear plants.

The last two nuclear plants recently completed in Georgia were completed in 2024. The time to complete was 15 years. The estimated time when authorized was six to eight years. The estimated cost was $14 billion; the actual cost was $35 billion.

All nuclear plants are long-term plans. If New York wants more power plants, the fastest construction is gas-powered plants. New York authorizing fracking would also keep costs down for all residents of the great state.

Read’s social sway

The second trial to find justice for John O’Keefe was mere showmanship (“Mis ‘Read’ guilt at 1st,” June 22).

It was the culmination of years-long efforts by Karen Read and her defense team to try their case outside a court of law, unchallenged in both social and news media forums.

The courtroom is no longer an impenetrable sanctuary. Social media has infiltrated the halls of justice; sequestration from influential bias is no longer possible in a judge, jury or witness.

Blind allegiance set Karen Read on her course to fame on the back of a dead man from whom justice was robbed.

Don’s F-bomb

Why is the media making such a big deal of President Trump saying the F-word (“Mount ‘cuss’ more,” June 25)?

The word has been in use for many, many years and decades. Many past presidents have used it before, depending on what mood they are in.

Cut Trump some slack. I say it is no big deal. He is sincerely trying his best to end all wars and that calls for the Nobel Peace Prize. Please focus on that.

Bootless Barack

Former President Barack Obama should give back his Nobel Peace Prize because there was no merit to it, and his post-presidency depicts a lack of substance as well (“Enablers-in-Chief,” James Rosen, PostScript, June 22).

Like his friends in Hollywood, Obama is an actor, and his third term under former President Joe Biden illustrated the curtain that should have gone up a long time ago.

He had a good game, but history will record the emptiness of it all.

Kudos to Jennifer Sey, founder and CEO of XX-XY Athletics, for battling the nefarious limitations and other stupidity of HR (“Why My Company Ditched the DEI Cops,” June 21).

The latter’s goal is to create massive collections of non-thinking, overly cautious, and overly compliant people who populate corporate America.

Controlled behavior is a step toward totalitarianism. It’s people like Sey who are attempting to save our nation.

“78% of registered voters say schools should teach children about global warming’s causes, consequences, and potential solutions.” FEMA?","Senators might want to read a new Yale-George Mason University survey of registered voters before they vote this weekend on the huge bill passed by the House of Representatives last week cutting a wide swath of government funding and tax incentives.

There are many eye-catching findings in this report, which are also encouraging if you support clean energy and addressing global warming and the climate crisis.

The Senators & Congresspeople looking to reverse the clean energy tax credits and investments in the Inflation Reduction Act might see that those rollbacks are not a good political move after reviewing this research by the Yale Program for Climate Change Communications and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communications.

Huge majorities of registered voters – not just average Americans, but the folks who actually vote – across party lines support government’s role in developing clean energy solutions and addressing global warming in this brand new survey (conducted May 1-12, 2025).

Here are some key findings on clean energy:

“64% of registered voters think developing sources of clean energy should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress”

“80% support funding more research into renewable energy sources.” Even “74% of liberal/moderate Republicans, and 55% of conservative Republicans” support it, according to this survey.

“71% support tax credits or rebates to encourage people to buy electric appliances, such as heat pumps and induction stoves.” – Which means the administration’s decision to end the Energy Star program may not be a great political move.

“67% support transitioning the U.S. economy from fossil fuels to 100% clean energy by 2050.” – Which means the Trump administration’s moves to bring back coal and nurture the oil and gas industry may not be popular with voters.

“76% of registered voters support generating renewable energy on public land in the U.S.” – which belies the current GOP push to open those lands to oil drilling, which only gets 44% support in this survey.

Majorities also “support building clean energy infrastructure in their local area,” which is interesting since NIMBY (or not in my back yard) has been a familiar refrain from those who oppose it. It found that 59% support solar farms in their area, while 56% support wind farms, and 49% support electric vehicle charging stations.

Climate change?

Communities torn apart and lives upended by extreme weather events across the country (and the globe) feel in their bones that climate change/global warming is doing real damage to their lives and livelihoods. There are now almost too many cities and communities to list, across all regions and socio-economic levels.

This research demonstrates in hard numbers that the policies in the bill currently moving through Congress – and in the Trump administration’s overall agenda, including executive orders and DOGE actions – seeking to dismantle funding and policies that address climate change, are wrong-headed.

Registered voters across party lines support the government addressing this urgent and existential challenge. Disinformation on these issues is also opposed by these voters in large numbers.

Here are some key findings around global warming:

The GOP leadership and the Trump administration seem to think that all these cuts to the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and across the federal government are good politics.

This study says those cuts are opposed by the large majority of registered voters across party lines:

“52% of registered voters think global warming should be a high or very high priority for the president and Congress.”

“88% support federal funding to help farmers improve practices to protect and restore the soil so it absorbs and stores more carbon.”

“75% support regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant.”

“79% of registered voters support strengthening enforcement of industrial pollution limits in low-income communities and communities of color that are disproportionately impacted by air and water pollution.”

“79% of registered voters oppose stopping federal agencies from research related to global warming.” These voters want the government research related to climate change to continue.

“78% oppose ordering all federal agencies to stop providing information about global warming to the public.” That means the public wants to be informed about global warming and climate change.

“78% of registered voters say schools should teach children about global warming’s causes, consequences, and potential solutions.”

FEMA? Then there’s the finding that 75% of registered voters say that Trump’s plan to cut the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not a good idea either.

It’s Bipartisan

“While the word ‘climate’ may be politically charged for some, the need for affordable, reliable, and secure energy is something we can all agree on,” Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), who is Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, told me recently in an exclusive interview on Electric Ladies Podcast. She added that this is one of the largest bipartisan caucuses in Congress.

“Americans are calling for action, and as Members of Congress, it’s our responsibility to deliver. If we want long-term solutions that address both our constituents’ concerns and growing climate risks, we must work together to strengthen our energy and climate security with urgency,” she emphasized.

It’s bipartisan, Congresswoman Houlahan stressed in a follow up email: “Climate change is not a partisan issue — it is a reality that affects every community across our country. The challenges we face, from extreme weather to rising energy costs, demand real, lasting solutions.”

Now we’ll have to see if the Senate and House listen to these voters when they vote on this bill.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/686057573421d0d8c164b785/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-28 19:10:36.310176

The demolition of the 500-foot and 800-foot stacks took place early Saturday, as the Tennessee Department of Transportation warned previously that State Route 170 between Melton Lake Drive and Old Emory Road would be closed around 6 a.m. for the implosion. TDOT said a second closure would also take place around noon, with each closure lasting for approximately 30 minutes.

The Senate is expected to start voting on the legislation Saturday. Once the Senate passes a bill, the House will have to vote on it to meet the GOP’s self-imposed deadline of getting a bill on the president’s desk by July 4.

Senate tax writers are still waiting for additional rulings from the chamber’s parliamentarian, and fine tuning their text. The tax section released early Saturday morning does have some changes, but isn’t the final version, according to a source familiar with the process.

Here are some early winners and losers.

Winners

House Republicans from blue states: The House version of the legislation would raise the SALT cap to $40,000 from $10,000, securing the votes of a handful of these Republicans from higher-tax states like New York and California. But an earlier Senate version of the bill kept the original $10,000 created in the 2017 GOP tax law—infuriating some of those House GOP lawmakers.

In the end, the new Senate text included the cap hike to $40,000, though the rate would snap back to $10,000 after five years.

The new Senate version also would do away with restrictions—which were a part of both the earlier Senate version and the House version—on workarounds to the SALT cap for certain owners of passthrough businesses, which file through the individual side of the tax code as S-corporations and partnerships.

Foreign companies and individuals: What became known as the “revenge tax,” a levy on foreign companies and individuals from countries with taxes the US deems unfair, was scrapped amid Wall Street pushback and speculation that the parliamentarian would strike at least parts of it from the bill.

Investors had worried that the tax, formally known as Section 899, would depress asset values and have other unintended consequences. The measure’s removal came after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a deal with G7 nations to exempt US companies from the 15% global minimum tax.

Hydrogen energy credits: The hydrogen production energy credit was granted a two-year reprieve in the new Senate text, as tax writers pushed back the phase out date from the end of 2025 to the end of 2027.

Small universities: The new tiered university endowment tax proposal was revised in the new Senate version to increase the minimum eligibility threshold for the tax from 500 to 3,000 tuition-paying students. The new formula for calculating endowment size on a per-student basis is simplified.

Losers

Debt hawks: The bill will add trillions to the deficit by traditional scoring methods. Republicans have sought to minimize the appearance of that by promoting an alternative scoring method, but most budget watchdogs call that an accounting gimmick. And the revenue losses could continue to rise, after of recent decisions by the Senate referee who ruled that some of the legislation’s offsets may not be allowed under the expedited procedure Republicans are using to unilaterally pass the legislation.

Electric vehicles: The bill would end the credits for the purchase of electric vehicles at the end of September, earlier than the prior version. The credits for purchasing commercial and used electric vehicles also would go away at the same time.

Wind and solar projects: The legislation accelerates the end dates for wind and solar project credits, compared to the initial Senate proposal, after pushback from President Donald Trump. The latest version would require eligible projects to be “placed in service” by the end 2027.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/44555ab/2147483647/crop/4000x1542+0+52/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F77%2F87%2F6af4164b4a5abf4ccb26c13a7c16%2Felectric-vehicle.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 19:07:26.786689

Recently we have read about devastation from wildfires and strong storms. Climate scientists say we will see more as a result of climate change.

To reduce air pollution that causes climate change we must reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Senator Lindsey Graham said, “CO2 emissions generated by man is creating our greenhouse gas effect that traps heat, and the planet is warming.”

Our government needs to do much more to promote clean energy, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. This includes maintaining tax credits for clean energy–not reducing them.

Hours after the Senate Republicans released theirlatest tax plan for the megabill, companies and lawmakers noticed a new tax affecting solar and wind companies. That’s on top of stricter rollbacks than senators had floated earlier.

The proposed tax would affect projects that don’t meet new restrictions on renewable energy produced with parts tied to certain U.S. adversaries like China.

“The new tax could apply to many, if not all, wind and solar projects that start being built from effectively 2028 onward. All new projects would have one of two options: pay the tax or attempt to demonstrate compliance with the material assistance limits,” said Ben King, associate director of climate and energy for the Rhodium Group, a consulting firm.

“The challenge with the latter is that the rules for demonstrating compliance still need to be written, and it’s likely to be a process that’s onerous bordering on impossible — even if you actually have a manufactured product that would meet the material assistance limits,” King said.

It’s unclear whether renewable energy supporters in the Senate will try to strip the language when the amendment vote-a-rama begins ahead of final passage.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright released a statement in support of the tax provisions. Elon Musk said the bill favored industries of the past.

Public lands

Senate Republicans leaders have apparently promised Montana Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy and others an amendment to strip language to sell some public lands for housing.

The parliamentarian had yet to say whether the proposal from Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah) complies with budget reconciliation rules.

“I have just concluded productive discussions with leadership. I will be leading an amendment to strip the sale of public lands from this bill. I will vote yes on the motion to proceed,” Sheehy wrote on social media Saturday. “We must quickly pass the Big Beautiful Bill to advance President Trump’s agenda.”

Fort Worth Report is certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative for adhering to standards for ethical journalism.","Fort Worth is receiving the last batch of federal dollars aimed at helping the city and the metroplex battle its pollution problem.

In a June 24 meeting, City Council members approved a contract amendment to receive a $380,000 federal grant issued through the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The grant is intended to support Fort Worth’s air monitoring operations from June 1, 2025, to May 31, 2026.

Fort Worth leaders first entered an agreement with the state environmental commission in 2021, when the city first received half a million dollars in federal funding to participate in the Department of Homeland Security’s Whole Air Monitoring grant program. The environmental commission is the entity responsible for administering funds from the federal grant program throughout the state.

The amendments to the agreement, which serve as separate but related contracts, support the city’s effort to provide accurate air pollution data and ensure facilities such as industrial sites are in compliance with air quality regulations, according to a City Council report.

The latest grant marks Fort Worth’s fourth and final contract renewal with the state commission. Through the agreement and annual contract renewals, city leaders received a total of just under $2 million to maintain and operate various air monitoring stations, the report states.

The last of the federal money was granted to the city’s monitoring program to detect air pollutants and toxins that could harm human health in Fort Worth and Tarrant County.

The amendment requires Fort Worth officials to collect and send filters and data for analysis and perform regular audits and maintenance on the city’s air monitors. Fort Worth leaders are not required to provide matching funds.

The $380,000 grant will also open up staff positions for air quality monitoring in the city’s environmental services department, with $290,000 of the grant money to go toward salary. Additional costs for the positions will be recovered by the grant at a rate of 10% and an estimated amount of up to $19,600.

“City leaders will continue to identify all available funding opportunities to support its air monitoring program,” city spokesperson Lola McCartney said when asked how Fort Worth would continue to support the program.

With the federal funding coming through the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, the city expects financial support will continue to be made available, McCartney said.

The city’s environmental services department will be responsible for using the federal grant.

The grant money comes as air quality planners with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the agency responsible for helping North Texas with regional planning, are set to present the final draft of the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan by December. The document outlines measures to improve air quality across 16 counties in North Texas, including Tarrant County, in various sectors such as transportation, energy, waste management and water.

The plan also identifies major sources of air pollutants in order to improve the region’s air quality through 2050.

While North Texas is under the federal limits set for most air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, the area has exceeded limits on ground-level ozone as far back as the 1990s.

The region has until 2027 to bring ozone levels to 70 parts per billion or under. If the region is in violation of air quality standards, polluters or major sources of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides could face annual fines of $45 million under the EPA’s Clean Air Act, according to the state environmental commission.

The fate of those penalties remains unclear with the anticipated changes in federal environmental law, said University of Texas at Arlington public affairs professor Evan Mistur. Just days after Trump was sworn into office, he vowed to roll back federal policies on climate change and air quality. In a June 11 news conference, EPA director Lee Zeldin announced two proposals that would eliminate clean air protections for power plant pollution.

“Lee Zeldin has been very vocal about wanting to change the priorities of the (Environmental Protection Agency),” Mistur said. “I would expect that to definitely translate to cutting back on these restrictions, which is obviously going to make things worse.”

Although federal dollars for Fort Worth’s air quality monitors came from the Department of Homeland Security, Mistur said, environmental regulation and grant cuts can be seen across all levels of the federal government.

“Trump has been very outspoken about: ‘Environmental regulations are not important. They need to be scaled back,’” Mistur said. “It would be very fair to expect reductions in terms of environmental funding from agencies across the board.”

Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Tax cuts are the priority

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.

Trump savings accounts and so, so much more

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing, but senators said that measure could be stripped out during the amendment process.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

What's the final cost?

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/ec77b27f-a573-4c27-be55-1299035d55ff/20250628T211620/ec77b27f-a573-4c27-be55-1299035d55ff_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 18:09:01.628201

“Instead of improving the Medicaid and energy portions of [the] House bill it appears the Senate went backwards,” he told The Hill.","The Senate’s version of the “big, beautiful bill” is facing serious headwinds in the House with The Hill learning that at least six House Republicans are currently a “no” on the framework, a daunting sign for GOP leadership as the Senate races towards a vote.

Those six House Republicans, some of whom requested anonymity, are enough opposition to tank the package, as GOP leaders grapple with a razor-thin majority. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who was one of two GOP lawmakers to oppose the House version of the bill last month, is also likely to oppose the Senate’s edition, deepening the pocket of resistance in the lower chamber.

Republicans can only afford to lose three votes and still clear the legislation, assuming full attendance and united Democratic opposition.

“I support the reasonable provisions in H.R. 1 that protect Medicaid’s long-term viability and ensure the program continues to serve our most vulnerable, but I will not support a final bill that eliminates vital funding streams our hospitals rely on, including provider taxes and state directed payments, or any provisions that punish expansion states,” Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.) wrote in a statement on Saturday.

“President Trump was clear when he said to root out our waste, fraud, and abuse without cutting Medicaid and I wholeheartedly agree,” he continued. “I urge my Senate colleagues to stick to the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1 — otherwise I will vote no.”

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) told The Hill that he is also opposed to the bill because of the Medicaid provider tax provision. Rep. Young Kim (R-Calif.) is currently a “no” on the measure because of the Medicaid language, rollback of solar energy credits and public lands provisions, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill.

Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), meanwhile, told The Hill that he is against the current version of the package because of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap proposal. The legislation would increase the currently $10,000 SALT cap to $40,000 for individuals making $500,000 or less for five years, then snap back to the original number.

“While I support the President’s broader agenda, how could I support the same unfair $10k SALT cap I’ve spent years criticizing?” LaLota said. “A permanent $40k deduction cap with income thresholds of $225k for single filers and $450k for joint filers would earn my vote.”

It is not, however, just moderates who are signaling issues with the Senate bill: Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, posted an ominous message on X that suggested he was not pleased with the package.

“I will not negotiate via X. But it’s important to know that jamming us with a bill before we’ve had any chance to review the implications of major changes & re-writes, fluid scores, a high likelihood of violating the house framework (deficits) , & tons of swamp buy-offs is bad,” he wrote.

The opposition is rising to the surface as Senate Republicans inch closer to holding an initial vote on the “big, beautiful bill,” which would officially kick off the consideration process and eventually tee up a final vote in the House. It remains unclear, however, if Senate GOP leaders have the votes to move forward.

If the motion to proceed passes by a simple majority, the chamber would hold a series of unlimited amendment votes called a vote-a-rama, which could result in changes to the measure. Senate GOP leaders are also still talking to holdouts and could make changes to the bill as written.

In the meantime, House Republicans — beginning to review the revised Senate text unveiled overnight — are expressing resistance to the measure, prompting serious questions about whether top GOP lawmakers will be able to enact the legislation by their self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) convened a call with the House Republican Conference Saturday afternoon and urged lawmakers to keep their concerns with the Senate bill private, and instead speak directly with their senators and the White House, two sources told The Hill.

Senate Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told members that it is unlikely they will have to return to Washington on Monday, the sources said. Tuesday or Wednesday is more realistic, he told lawmakers.

One source told The Hill that the call was brief and leadership did not take questions.

The main qualm among House Republicans appears to be the Medicaid language in the bill. The Senate’s legislation includes a proposal that would effectively cap provider taxes at 3.5 percent by 2031, down from the current 6 percent, but only for the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

The decrease was initially supposed to begin in 2027, with a 0.5 percent phase down annually, but Senate Republicans overnight changed the text to delay the implementation to 2028. The upper chamber also inserted a provision to create a $25 billion rural hospital relief fund that would be distributed over five years to assuage those concerns.

The changes, however, do not seem to be solving all of the GOP’s problems, with House Republicans still voicing opposition to the language.

Aside from Medicaid, the Senate bill’s rollback of green-energy tax credits is an issue for some House Republicans. The revised legislation for the upper chamber slashes tax incentives for wind and solar energy and adds a new tax on future wind and solar projects.

Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) would not say how he plans to vote on the bill, but signaled that he is not happy with the Medicaid provisions and green-energy tax credit language.

The study suggested that green hydrogen production was impractical, at least when using the existing technology.
It shows that after years of pilot projects, we are still nowhere near the commercial phase of green hydrogen deployment; there is little interest in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen fuelling stations; there have been severe delays in the use of green hydrogen in aviation, and other hydrogen sectors have also faced delays.
Several barriers to clean hydrogen production, as well as greater political and economic uncertainty around transition industries, have led to project delays and cancellations.","Just a couple of years ago, everyone seemed to be talking about the great potential for clean hydrogen. As governments worldwide strive to decarbonise, several industry players were looking to hydrogen as the potential miracle fuel that could clean up operations. While there is still hope for a hydrogen revolution in some parts of the world, this is looking increasingly unlikely in the United States.

Under the Biden administration, investors across the U.S. were planning to spend billions on hydrogen projects, encouraged by the financial incentives introduced in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and other policies. The main focus was on green hydrogen, which many hard-to-abate industries were looking to use to help decarbonise operations. Green hydrogen is produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources to power the process. This varies from other forms of hydrogen, such as blue and grey, which use natural gas to power operations.

Investors aimed to develop wind and solar farms in key locations, such as the Gulf and the desert Southwest, and use the clean energy to power electrolysers to produce green hydrogen. The idea was to transform disused gas pipelines to transport green hydrogen across the U.S. to support decarbonisation efforts across a range of industries, from transport to manufacturing, as well as export it to Europe and other regions.

Some industries are notoriously hard to decarbonise, and they still rely on fossil fuels to power operations. While clean electricity has helped drive down emissions in recent years, producing a clean fuel that can be used for a wide variety of applications has been much harder. There was significant optimism around green hydrogen’s use to fill this gap, particularly under former President Biden. The IRA provided a tax credit for the production of clean hydrogen of up to $3 per kilo, while the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) designated $7 billion for a series of ?hydrogen hubs.

However, the big ambitions for green hydrogen that followed the introduction of the IRA and BIL have begun to fade due to a range of barriers to project development. Firstly, the price of producing green hydrogen has not fallen to anywhere near the level investors had previously hoped, as production has remained limited. While many thought that there would be abundant clean electricity from new solar and wind energy projects, progress slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of the clean electricity now available in the U.S. is used directly rather than to produce fuel. In addition, since President Trump has come into power, there is greater uncertainty around the energy transition sector in general, following major funding cuts and pauses on IRA incentives.

In September 2024, Hy Stor Energy backed out of a contract to purchase over 1 GW of alkaline electrolysers from the Norwegian cleantech company Nel. Meanwhile, in June this year, BP announced it was suspending a blue hydrogen project at its Whiting Refinery in Indiana. The blue hydrogen facility was one of eight projects in the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MACH2), a federally funded Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub.

A spokesperson for the company said, “BP is committed to remaining a critical driver of the economic engine that powers northwest Indiana and the Midwest… While we are indefinitely pausing our low-carbon project in the region, our focus is on building a strong, economically competitive future for our Whiting Refinery.”

It is now uncertain whether the expansion of the U.S. hydrogen industry has just stalled or if it will fail to happen. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) published a 2024 green hydrogen analysis that reviewed the $8 billion to be spent on “hydrogen hubs,” and the even larger sums for production and investment tax credits in pursuit of a new hydrogen-driven clean energy economy. It concluded that “hydrogen was essentially a mirage”. The study suggested that green hydrogen production was impractical, at least when using the existing technology.

An updated ITIF assessment suggests that its original prediction appears accurate. It shows that after years of pilot projects, we are still nowhere near the commercial phase of green hydrogen deployment; there is little interest in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or hydrogen fuelling stations; there have been severe delays in the use of green hydrogen in aviation, and other hydrogen sectors have also faced delays. The study ultimately suggests that while green hydrogen may be useful in the U.S. one day, we are still a long way off.

Following several years of enthusiasm around the development of a strong green hydrogen industry in the U.S., this now seems increasingly unlikely. Several barriers to clean hydrogen production, as well as greater political and economic uncertainty around transition industries, have led to project delays and cancellations. As other countries continue to invest in green hydrogen, which could help drive down prices and improve production processes, there is still potential for the development of a U.S. hydrogen industry, but likely not for many years.

The initial draft released by Senate Republicans earlier this month cut the credit for any wind and solar projects that did not “begin construction” by certain dates, while the latest version bases incentives on when projects actually begin producing electricity — a much higher bar to clear.

The first draft gave any project that began construction this year full credit, any project that began construction next year 60 percent credit and any project that began construction in 2027 20 percent of the credit, before they were phased out thereafter.

The new legislation instead says that the credits will only apply to facilities that begin producing electricity before the end of 2027.

In addition, it imposes a new tax on some wind and solar projects that are placed in service after 2027.

The projects that will be taxed if a certain percentage of the value of their components come from China.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits for low-carbon energy sources, including renewable energy. These subsidies were expected to massively reduce the U.S.’ planet warming emissions.

The GOP’s cuts to the credits are expected to severely curtail those gains.

If they pass, the cuts represent a win for the party’s right flank, which has pushed for major cuts to the credits, and a loss for it’s more moderate wing which has called for a slower phaseout.

The renewables lobby slammed the changes as hampering the sector.

“In what can only be described as ‘midnight dumping,’ the Senate has proposed a punitive tax hike targeting the fastest-growing sectors of our energy industry. It is astounding that the Senate would intentionally raise prices on consumers rather than encouraging economic growth and addressing the affordability crisis facing American households,” Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a written statement.

Renewable promise, local pushback Nebraska’s public power model has kept rates low and ensured dependable service.","Nebraska’s energy system faces a critical turning point, according to a new report released by the Nebraska Chamber Foundation. While the state has long benefited from some of the nation’s most affordable and reliable electricity, surging demand driven by data centers, manufacturing and industrial agriculture threatens to outpace supply, raising alarms for economic development leaders and utilities alike.

“Nebraska, compared to peer states, has some of the most affordable and reliable energy in the country,” said Hunter Traynor of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The report, prepared by consulting firm ScottMadden, outlines the state’s current energy landscape and projects a significant increase in electricity demand through 2035. It emphasized both the strengths and structural challenges of Nebraska’s power grid, urging immediate action to maintain economic momentum.

Key takeaways

Nebraska’s electricity demand is increasing at a pace not seen in generations. Industries that require a lot of power, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, ethanol and hydrogen production, are rapidly growing throughout the state. According to the report, industrial users already account for 45% of total energy consumption, with load forecasts rising by hundreds of megawatts as new customers seek to connect.

“We don’t have the power we need to support ongoing economic growth in our state in a lot of cases, and it’s not available to us immediately,” said Josh Moenning of New Power Nebraska. “Uncertainty is the death knell for business investment.”

One of the biggest obstacles: The Southwest Power Pool’s interconnection queue, where new projects can wait more than five years before connecting to the grid. As of late 2024, more than 80,000 MW of generation capacity is pending, with wind and solar projects accounting for a significant share.

Renewable promise, local pushback

Nebraska’s public power model has kept rates low and ensured dependable service. In 2022, coal provided 60% of the state’s electricity, while wind accounted for 19%, nuclear power for 17% and natural gas for 3%. Nebraska ranks third nationally for land-based wind capacity additions and has growing solar potential.

Yet developers face mounting local opposition and zoning hurdles that delay or derail renewable energy projects. “The biggest thing holding back … solar and wind, it’s really the local opposition,” said Dustin Marvel, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD). “It’s a vocal minority that is really standing in the way of billions of dollars of economic opportunity.”

Despite these challenges, renewable energy has become a lucrative economic engine. Moenning noted that land leases for wind and solar projects now pay $40 million annually to Nebraska farmers and landowners.

Utility action plans

Nebraska’s major utilities, OPPD, the Nebraska Public Power District (NPPD) and the Lincoln Electric System (LES), are working to increase capacity while transitioning toward net-zero carbon emissions by 2040-2050. OPPD plans to add 2.5 GW of new generation over the next decade, including wind, solar, storage and gas. LES and NPPD are expanding clean energy portfolios and introducing dynamic rate structures to manage demand.

The state’s energy affordability remains a strength. Nebraska ranked among the six lowest-cost states in 2023 for average electricity prices, supported by a mix of public power governance, low-cost generation and efficient infrastructure.

Still, affordability cannot be maintained without substantial investment and coordination. “The ability to build power at scale is going to have downstream positive effects from the economic development standpoint on local communities,” Traynor said.

Policy recommendations

To meet demand and remain competitive, the report recommended three key strategies:

Public education to build support for energy infrastructure

Streamlined permitting and zoning to accelerate renewable development

Flexible rate schedules and innovative partnerships to attract large customers and facilitate interconnection

“We need an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” Traynor said. “We need an all-in mentality from interested parties … and we need all-in support from the public and better education.”

A pivotal moment

The Nebraska Chamber Foundation hopes the report will serve as a foundation for statewide dialogue and coordinated action. As industries with strict sustainability targets eye Nebraska for expansion, utility leaders, policymakers and the public must align quickly to keep the lights on.

Latino neighborhoods have to cope with 23 more days of extreme heat a year compared to non-Latino white neighborhoods in California, the dashboard shows.
In Los Angeles County, for example, only four percent of land in majority-Latino neighborhoods is shaded by tree canopy compared to nine percent in non-Latino white neighborhoods.
It used the same 70 percent threshold to define non-Latino white neighborhoods.
Latino neighborhoods in California are also exposed to twice as much air pollution and have twice as many asthma-related ER visits as non-latino white neighborhoods, according to the dashboard.","Scorching hot days tend to hit certain neighborhoods harder than others, a problem that becomes more dangerous during record-breaking heat like swathes of the US experienced over the past week. A new online dashboard shows how Latino neighborhoods are disproportionately affected in California.

Developed by University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), the tool helps fill in gaps as the Trump administration takes a sledgehammer to federal climate, race, and ethnicity data resources.

“We want to provide facts, reliable data sources. We don’t want this to be something that gets erased from the policy sphere,” says Arturo Vargas Bustamante, faculty research director at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute (LPPI).

“We don’t want this to be something that gets erased”

The Latino Climate & Health Dashboard includes data on extreme heat and air pollution, as well as asthma rates and other health conditions — issues that are linked to each other. High temperatures can speed up the chemical reactions that create smog. Chronic exposure to fine particle pollution, or soot, can increase the risk of a child developing asthma. Having asthma or another respiratory illness can then make someone more vulnerable to poor air quality and heat stress. Burning fossil fuels — whether in nearby factories, power plants, or internal combustion vehicles — makes all of these problems worse.

Latino neighborhoods have to cope with 23 more days of extreme heat a year compared to non-Latino white neighborhoods in California, the dashboard shows. LPPI defined extreme heat as days when temperatures climbed to 90 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

If you’ve ever heard about a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect, big differences in temperature from neighborhood to neighborhood probably wouldn’t come as a surprise. Areas with less greenery and more dark, paved surfaces and waste heat from industrial facilities or vehicles generally tend to trap heat. Around 1 in 10 Americans lives in a place where the built environment makes it feel at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it would without that urban sprawl according to one study of 65 cities from last year. And after years of redlining that bolstered segregation and disinvestment in certain neighborhoods in the US, neighborhoods with more residents of color are often hotter than others.

The dashboard includes fact sheets by county to show what factors might raise temperatures in certain areas. In Los Angeles County, for example, only four percent of land in majority-Latino neighborhoods is shaded by tree canopy compared to nine percent in non-Latino white neighborhoods. Conversely, impervious surfaces like asphalt and concrete that hold heat span 68 percent of land in Latino neighborhoods compared to 47 percent in majority non-Latino white areas in LA County.

For this dashboard, LPPI defines a Latino neighborhood as a census tract where more than 70 percent of residents identify as Latino. It used the same 70 percent threshold to define non-Latino white neighborhoods.

Latino neighborhoods in California are also exposed to twice as much air pollution and have twice as many asthma-related ER visits as non-latino white neighborhoods, according to the dashboard. It brings together data from the Census Bureau, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s environmental health screening tool called CalEnviroScreen, and other publicly-available sources.

The Trump administration has taken down the federal counterpart to CalEnviroScreen, called EJScreen, as part of its purge of diversity and equity research. Researchers have been working to track and archive datasets that might be targeted since before President Donald Trump stepped back into office.

Efforts to keep these kinds of studies going are just as vital, so that people don’t have to rely on outdated information that no longer reflects current conditions on the ground. And other researchers have launched new initiatives to document the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks. The Environmental Defense Fund and other advocacy groups, for instance, launched a mapping tool in April that shows 500 facilities across the US that the Environmental Protection Agency has recently invited to apply for exemptions to air pollution limits.

UCLA’s dashboard adds to the patchwork of more locally-led research campaigns, although it can’t replace the breadth of data that federal agencies have historically collected. “Of course, we don’t have the resources that our federal government has,” Bustamante says. “But with what we are able to do, I think that one of the main aims is to keep this issue [at the top of] the agenda and provide reliable information that will be useful for community change.”

Data like this is a powerful tool for ending the kinds of disparities the dashboard exposes. It can inform efforts to plant trees where they’re needed most. Or it can show public health officials and community advocates where they need to check in with people to make sure they can find a safe place to cool down during the next heatwave.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STK438_global_warming_climate_change_fire.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-06-28 19:08:18.664045

Now it’s up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump’s signature’s domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here’s the latest on what’s in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Tax cuts are the priority

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump’s first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It’s essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It’s a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.

Trump savings accounts and so, so much more

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing, but senators said that measure could be stripped out during the amendment process.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation’s debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

What’s the final cost?

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation’s deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.

It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It’s a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.

There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House’s version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

Money for deportations, a border wall and the Golden Dome

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump’s border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

How to pay for it? Cuts to Medicaid and other programs

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It’s essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program’s work requirements.

There’s also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Fund to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It’s a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.

Trump savings accounts and so, so much more

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children’s savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump’s long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There’s a new excise tax on university endowments, restrictions on the development of artificial intelligence and blocks on transgender surgeries. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing. The sale of public lands would cover at least 600,000 acres and up to 1.2 million acres, according to a projection from the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.

What’s the final cost?

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation’s deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.

Rollins, Felice Friedson, Jesse Edwards, Zoltan Istvan, Josh Hammer",,,,,https://www.newsweek.com/americans-could-see-energy-bills-increase-this-summer-2091549,"Electricity bills are set to climb across the United States, with households bracing for higher costs this summer.
When adjusted for inflation, the rise amounts to approximately 4.3 percent compared to last year's prices, NEADA and CEPC said, who also noted this would represent a 12-year high for electricity prices.
The Rise of Data Centers Power demand is also set to grow alongside the proliferation of data centers—centralized facilities housing equipment used to store, process, and distribute data.
""Last summer, PJM ran its most recent capacity auction, which saw prices increase significantly from the prior auction.
Higher capacity prices help to send a clear signal that generation investment is needed,"" PJM told Newsweek.","Electricity bills are set to climb across the United States, with households bracing for higher costs this summer.

Analysts say three forces are converging: a spike in natural-gas prices, surging load from artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers that is triggering multi-billion-dollar capacity charges, and an aging, congested grid that is passing ever-rising transmission costs on to consumers.

Natural Gas Prices

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a roughly 4 percent rise in average electric bills in June, July, and August compared with last year, which it attributed to a spike in the cost of natural gas—the top source of utility-scale electricity generation in 2023.

Another forecast from the EIA earlier this week, which included September, suggested an increase of just under 3 percent. That month generally sees cooler weather, lighter air conditioning use, and marginally lower fuel-driven rates. However, data from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) and the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate (CEPC) painted a grimmer picture.

According to this report, from June through September, the average U.S. household is expected to pay $784 for electricity over this four-month period, a 6.2 percent increase from $737 last year. When adjusted for inflation, the rise amounts to approximately 4.3 percent compared to last year's prices, NEADA and CEPC said, who also noted this would represent a 12-year high for electricity prices.

""We predict that prices will be this high for two reasons: first, the cost of electricity is rising faster than [the] average rate of inflation, and second, temperatures are continuing to increase, reflecting the continuing impact of climate change and requiring additional energy to cool indoor spaces,"" the NEADA/CEPC report said.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told Newsweek that""while 4.3 percent doesn't seem like a large increase, this comes on top of bills that have been steadily increasing.""

He added: ""Not only that, but families need to use more electricity to cool their homes each year as summer temperatures keep increasing.""

The Rise of Data Centers

Power demand is also set to grow alongside the proliferation of data centers—centralized facilities housing equipment used to store, process, and distribute data.

In the PJM Interconnection—the nation's largest electricity market, serving 13 states and Washington, D.C.—an additional $9.3 billion in costs tied to future capacity needs will begin appearing in customer bills this month, The Wall Street Journal reported.

A report by Monitoring Analytics, PJM's independent market monitor, cited ""unprecedented"" demand, both current and future, from data centers as the primary driver.

""The report of PJM's Independent Market Monitor, Monitoring Analytics, does affirm what PJM has been saying, which is that supply/demand conditions drove higher prices in the 2025/2026 capacity auction,"" PJM told Newsweek.

According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), capacity-market auctions are a reliability backstop: generators compete to promise enough future capacity, and the competition keeps costs down for consumers.

""Last summer, PJM ran its most recent capacity auction, which saw prices increase significantly from the prior auction. The result of the increase was primarily based on a continued trajectory of supply decreasing and demand increasing on the system. Higher capacity prices help to send a clear signal that generation investment is needed,"" PJM told Newsweek.

PJM says that demand is increasing primarily due to the power requirements of AI and data centers, but also from electrification—replacing technologies or processes that use fossil fuels with electrically-powered equivalents—and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing.

""Data centers and AI will certainly drive demand up and that could lead to higher electricity prices as more costly generation needs to be brought online to meet demand,"" Gilbert Metcalf, professor of economics at Tufts University, told Newsweek.

He added: ""Much depends on how state regulators approve new massive demand loads to connect to the grid. They could, for example, mandate that data centers curtail demand during peak periods or pay for improved infrastructure to ease congestion. Big data centers will resist this, but new, large demand loads added to the grid do bring increased costs that, unless regulators intervene, will be spread to all users.""

America's Aging Grid System

Robert Pindyck, a finance and economics professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, told Newsweek there was ""just one reason"" behind rising electricity bills, ""and that's the grid.""

""We have a very antiquated, inefficient grid here in the United States, and the result is that if there's any increase in demand—even if the electricity can be generated cheaply—it's very hard to move it from A to B,"" he said.

The numbers back up Pindyck's warning. The 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers ""Report Card"" gives the nation's power infrastructure a D+ and calculates a $578 billion investment gap in transmission and distribution through 2033—even after factoring in the $73 billion already set aside for grid upgrades under the 2021 infrastructure law.

Modernizing the grid to meet demand would be ""very hard to do,"" according to Pindyck.

This is in part because different states have different rules. Texas, for example, has its own grid that isn't connected to the rest of the country. It operates like a separate country in that sense, and it's very inefficient, Pindyck added.

Even outside of Texas, building new power lines is extremely hard as there are strict rules about what can be built and where, and people generally don't want new lines in their area. As a result, nothing gets built, Pindyck said.

On Thursday, during an appearance on Fox Business' Mornings with Maria, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright warned that the grid was reaching its limit.

""We need to make changes rapidly. We need to see new capacity built, smarter regulation, we need to use our grid wiser. There's so many things we need to do to improve it. We can't do it all overnight,"" Wright said.

Wolfe, meanwhile, told CBS MoneyWatch in May that taking efforts to modernize your home can lead to cost savings for households as they try and keep cool during the warmer months. For instance, installing insulation can help manage and reduce energy expenses.

""Families should start preparing for long-term extreme weather and think about the energy efficiency of their cooling systems,"" Wolfe said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2670181/americans-could-see-huge-amounts-added-energy.png,N,,2025-06-28 17:08:42.681656

Officials at EQT were not immediately available for comment.

Plaintiffs in the case include the Government of Guam Retirement Fund, Eastern Atlantic States Carpenters Annuity Fund, Eastern Atlantic States Carpenters Pension Fund and Cambridge Retirement System.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

When the deal was announced in 2017, it was expected to create the biggest natural gas producer in the U.S. and was the biggest deal ever for EQT as it looked to expand its gas business. EQT is currently the No. 2 gas producer in the country.

“The recovery – $167.5 million in cash – is notable as it is (by far) the largest securities class action recovery ever in the history of this District and the 14th largest in the history of the Third Circuit,” the plaintiffs said in a filing.

The district is the U.S. District Court Western District of Pennsylvania. The Third Circuit is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

The plaintiffs said in the filing that they reached the settlement after almost six years of litigation and three mediation sessions.

“The Settlement provides a favorable result for Class Members because it allows for an immediate recovery and removes the considerable possibility that Class Members could recover significantly less or even nothing,” according to the filing.

The case is In Re EQT Corporation Securities Litigation filed in June 2019, according to the federal court website.

Nearly 130 million people were under extreme heat warnings or heat advisories on Thursday, according to Noaa’s Weather Prediction Center, with 282 locations breaking daily heat records this week, with another 121 equalling with previous highs, Noaa data showed.
Climate Central’s climate shift index estimates that high temperatures over the past few days were at least five times more likely to occur because of human-caused climate change.

“With climate change already reshaping how we live, it’s more important than ever that we educate ourselves,” Lauditi said.","The list of climate-related disasters in the US was long last week as vast swathes of America sweated under a brutal heatwave.

There was a “mass-casualty event” of fainting high-schoolers in New Jersey as a K-pop concert was cut short in Washington. Young hikers had to be rescued in New Hampshire as tarmac roads bucked and melted in South Dakota and Nebraska.

Luckless Amtrak passengers were stuck on a train with no air conditioning in a Baltimore tunnel, while some subway services in New York were suspended. The Trump administration declared a power emergency in the US south-east, and in Georgia the agriculture commissioner advised residents to make sure their animals had water and shade.

“Remember to take care of our friends also,” Tyler Harper said.

These incidents – and many more – were the result of the highest temperatures across the northern and middle swath of the US at this early summer date in some cases since the late 19th century.

Nearly 130 million people were under extreme heat warnings or heat advisories on Thursday, according to Noaa’s Weather Prediction Center, with 282 locations breaking daily heat records this week, with another 121 equalling with previous highs, Noaa data showed.

Daily heat records were set in at least 50 cities in the eastern US on Tuesday alone, according to the National Weather Service, with New York City recording its hottest day since 2012, according to Noaa.

Climate scientists blamed a rapidly warming Arctic for the heat dome – a consequence that they say is the result of the “stuck” weather patterns that come from a wavier polar jet stream, which can cause not just heatwaves but also heavy rainfall and floods.

A new study, published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said found that stalled atmospheric patterns have tripled over the last 70 years.

The authors of the study claim that while climate models predict that these patterns would occur more frequently with climate change, their study is the first to demonstrate that it is already happening – and will likely intensify as the planet continues to warm.

Climate Central’s climate shift index estimates that high temperatures over the past few days were at least five times more likely to occur because of human-caused climate change. Climate Central scientist Zachary Labe told Politico that the early heatwave “is a stark reminder that climate change is making these dangerous and oppressive heat waves far more likely, affecting millions of people”.

“One of easiest ways to see climate change’s impact is in how it’s increasing the chance these types of heatwaves will occur,” Labe told Bloomberg. “By the middle of this century, these types of heat waves will be normal. The extremes will be even higher.”

According to the American Medical Association, elevated temperatures nearly 22,000 people died from heat in 14 years between 1999 and 2023. The National Weather Service statistics show heat claiming more lives than any other weather-related event.

But heat events are only fatal in the extreme. A broader, general sense of oppression and discomfort was palpable in New York last week, when the extreme hear arrived after a cool spring and gave New Yorkers little time to acclimatize.

“We all know that prolonged heat exposure can have serious effects on your overall health, including mental health, but it can also negatively affect your skin,” said Kim Laudati, chief executive of IT Intelligent Treatment, a skin regeneration business in New York.

Prolonged heat exposure due to the skin’s moisture-barrier protective function becomes damaged, Lauditi said, leading to water loss within deeper and surface layers of skin, resulting in a state of dehydration.

Chronic heat can lead to vasodilation and persistent redness. Inflammation ensues, which can also promote heat-induced erythema, or redness, to the point of creating telangiectasia; commonly known as “spider veins” and melasma, a skin discoloration.

There is also reduced concentration, irritability, and mood swings because the body is diverting resources to regulate body temperature; the impairment of melatonin production, leading to poor sleep. Heat-related damage to the blood-brain barrier can cause lack of focus, confusion, fainting and organ failure.

“With climate change already reshaping how we live, it’s more important than ever that we educate ourselves,” Lauditi said.

Climate change was on the minds of voters last week in New York’s mayoral primary that culminated on the hottest day of heat-dome, when a thermometer at Belvedere Castle in Central Park registered 99 degrees for the first time since July 18, 2012.

Democrat mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani has said that the climate crisis is the central issue of out time and that it isn’t separate from the crisis of capitalism, making it a co-traveler with his resonant message about the affordability of life, or lack of it, in the city.

Zohran’s climate platform is grounded in making the lives of working people better through climate action,” said Denae Ávila-Dickson with the Sunrise Movement, a climate group that endorsed Mamdani. “He has an important commitment to transforming New York City into a national leader on climate.”

“It’s clear to us that the climate crisis has been politicized, but it’s not a political issue,” Ávila-Dickson added. “It’s affecting people in every city, in every state, and a lot of times we fee that it affects people in right in rural States, especially because they’re not having those same kinds of resources.”

In a typical year between 1979 and 2000, the average temperature in the northern hemisphere temperature would break the 21C (69.8F) barrier in July and continue for about five weeks, according to University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute.

But last year, the hottest on record, the northern hemisphere’s average temperature held above 21C from 13 June until 5 September, and data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that heatwaves have grown longer, more frequent and more intense over the past seven decades.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/408d0e6f9aae91716c09d3b8a26c9a8b56c8b319/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d0dfb304120f99fb0f8a24970da8f8a,N,,2025-06-28 17:08:25.808455

Senate Republicans released an updated version of the bill late Friday with hopes of holding a procedural test vote to begin bill debate on Saturday.

The 940-page bill contains the changes made by several Senate committees throughout the week to bring it up to speed with the upper chamber’s rules for budget reconciliation. Other changes were to attract votes of holdouts on the bill.

“This bill implements critical aspects of President Trump’s budgetary agenda by delivering bigger paychecks for Americans, driving massive economic growth, unleashing American energy, strengthening border security and national defense, modernizing America’s air traffic control system, preserving key safety net programs for Americans who need them, while ending waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal spending, and much more,” the administration statement said.

Some GOP members in the Senate have raised concerns over the $5 trillion debt limit increase in the bill and the provisions to stamp out waste and fraud in Medicaid.

Republican leaders cannot afford to lose more than three votes from their party members.

In this test RSEV drove the two vehicles 200 miles to test how the cars would handle range and efficiency, and as it turns out they delivered nearly identical numbers, despite one being on slightly less efficient all-season tires.

After two hundred miles of city, highway, and traffic driving, the two cars were within a single percentage point of each other when the trip ended. Both vehicles used 65% of the available battery for the trip, with the low-mileage car returning 4.55 miles per kilowatt-hour, and the high-mileage car turning in a respectable 4.51 mi/kWh. That minuscule difference could be explained away with one driver having a slightly heavier foot, getting stuck behind a car that the other didn't, or the tire discrepancy, it's impossible to say, but I'm willing to chalk the difference up to simple noise in the data.

Knowing that the efficiency between the two is identical alleviates a lot of my concerns about purchasing a high-mileage electric car. Sure, there are still plenty of wear components that need to be replaced at high mileage, like suspension bushings and wheel bearings and whatnot, but knowing that the motors are still churning just as they were when the car was new lends some credibility to the longevity of EVs.

I hear you asking, ""What about the battery pack?"" The answer to that is slightly more complicated, but not much. As it turns out, this 225,000-mile Model 3 still retains 89% of its original battery capacity, which provides plenty of driving range for the average commuter. According to RSEV, both of these cars are 100% original, including their original motors and battery packs. I've definitely had a bunch of gas cars that didn't survive to see 225,000 miles without a major component failure.

The reality is that there are practically no EVs that we can call objectively affordable in the U.S. This is probably the single biggest hurdle facing uptake of EVs in this country: Most people can’t afford them.

Still, the market is growing fast, so there are a handful of cheap electric cars to choose from amid the sea of Audis, Cadillacs, BMWs and the like. They may not be as inexpensive as an $18,000 Nissan Versa or a $23,000 Kia K4, two of the lowest-priced gas cars.

But EVs aren’t only for the 1% anymore, either. Below, we’ve compiled a list of the 12 cheapest electric cars you can buy in America. We’ve also included each vehicle’s range and tax-credit eligibility to help guide your purchase.

How We Test And Rank Cars

InsideEVs editors have dozens of years of combined experience testing cars. We also spend every day reporting on the ever-changing electric car landscape, ensuring you have the latest information to make an informed decision. Throughout the year, we test dozens of EVs, at first-drive events, during week-long reviews and during Breakthrough EV testing. From the streets of Shanghai to our own driveways, we drive everything so we can give you the best possible information.

We’re basing this list on the sticker prices for 2025 models. Keep in mind that a bunch of factors can impact the final price you’ll pay for a car.

Some models qualify for a $7,500 federal EV tax credit at purchase, which can now be claimed as an upfront discount at the dealership. Any electric car qualifies for a federally funded discount when it’s leased, provided the leasing company is willing to pass those savings on. Some states and cities offer policies of their own that can bring down the upfront cost of getting into a plug-in vehicle.

Whether you buy or lease, it helps to shop around. Both dealerships and manufacturers regularly offer great EV lease deals, discounts, preferential loan rates and other incentives to move cars off of their lots.

These are the cheapest electric cars on sale in the U.S., arranged from most to least expensive. All prices include manufacturer destination charges. We've included some pros and cons about each vehicle, too, drawn from both real-world testing conducted by the InsideEVs staff and our analysis of the market.

America's Cheapest Electric SUV: Chevrolet Equinox EV

Chevy Equinox EV LT

Base price: $34,295 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit)

Range for base model (LT): 319 miles

Maximum range: 319 miles

Drive type: FWD or AWD

This compact crossover is the easiest vehicle to recommend on this entire list. It was our Breakthrough EV of the Year in 2024, after all. It's also a double whammy: the cheapest electric SUV in America and the cheapest electric car with a 300-mile range.

Our testing found that the Equinox EV delivers something that’s been missing from the electric market for years: an affordable, appealing car with legitimate amounts of range. Even in its cheapest trim, the Equinox EV returns an EPA estimate of 319 miles, which is great. It also comes with a large touchscreen display and modern looks.

Overall, the Equinox EV is a very compelling package. We have noticed, however, that the FWD model is a bit sluggish. Another con for some: no Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. General Motors has decided to eliminate those features from all its EVs.

Tesla Model 3

Base price: $44,130 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit)

Range for base model (Long Range RWD): 363 miles

Maximum range: 363 miles

Drive type: RWD or AWD

Tesla never really managed to hit the Model 3’s initially advertised base price of $35,000. But the sedan remains one of the best values on the EV market. Plus, after chugging along for years virtually unchanged, it got a much-needed facelift for the 2024 model year. That update brought fresh styling in front and rear, multicolor ambient lighting and more range, cementing its place as the best electric sedan on sale in America.

In our testing, we’ve found the Model 3 to be quick and agile. Since this is a Tesla, you can expect a smooth and feature packed infotainment system, seamless charging at thousands of the company’s Superchargers and Autopilot adaptive cruise control as standard equipment.

Some cons: The Model 3 foregoes conventional turn signal controls and instead has steering wheel-mounted buttons. Some may find the interior too spartan and the controls too concentrated in the touchscreen.

Nissan Ariya

2024 Nissan Ariya

Base price: $41,160 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (Engage): 216 miles

Maximum range: 289 miles

Drive type: FWD or AWD

Nissan was responsible for one of the first mass-market EVs in the U.S.: the Leaf hatchback. The Ariya is its long-awaited second act. Like many of the cars on this list, it’s solid. Not amazing, but not bad either. It’s a stylish EV inside and out, and I especially liked how some buttons are embedded in the wood-grain trim. In higher trims, you can get serious amounts of range, but the base one is a bit lacking in that respect.

Kia Niro EV

2024 Kia Niro EV.

Base price: $40,995 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range: 253 miles

Drive type: FWD

Kia is a leader when it comes to mass-market EV tech. Models like the EV6 crossover and EV9 three-row serve up extremely quick charging speeds and advanced, 800-volt architectures.

The Niro EV, however, uses an older platform and isn’t a ground-up EV. It offers around 250 miles of range. Kia claims a max charging rate of just 85 kilowatts and a 10%-80% charge time of 43 minutes. Still, if you need an around-town EV and not a road-tripper, the Niro EV may be a good choice.

Base price: $39,990 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (Select): 260 miles

Maximum range: 300 miles

Drive type: FWD or RWD

It can be easy to forget about the Mustang Mach-E, as it’s been on the market since 2020. But this crossover has quietly become America’s best-selling non-Tesla EV—and for good reason. It’s a great-looking EV with competitive specs and a big old screen. And after a price cut, the Select trim can be had for under $40,000 before any tax credits or incentives.

Subaru Solterra

Base price: $39,915 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (Premium): 227 miles

Maximum range: 227 miles

Drive type: AWD

I’d put the 2025 Solterra in the category of “EVs you should consider if you can get a great deal.” It’s only available with all-wheel drive and a small battery, giving it so-so range. But it’s also pleasant to drive, is a nice size and has a charming, funky interior. I was a big fan of the Solterra's digital gauge cluster, which is pushed back to the windshield and sits nicely near the bottom of the windshield.

Right now, this is the only electric Subaru you can buy, but an updated Solterra and a new electric wagon, the Trailseeker, are coming soon.

Lexus RZ

2024 Lexus RZ 450e.

Photo by: InsideEVs

Base price: $44,095 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (RZ 300e): 266 miles

Maximum range: 266 miles

Drive type: FWD or AWD

Surprised a Lexus made this list? Yeah, us too. But the RZ is now way down from the nearly $60,000 starting price it had when it debuted.

The RZ is Lexus’s sole EV in the U.S. This crossover shares its guts with the Toyota bZ4X and Subaru Solterra, both also found on this list. It looks cool and serves up excellent efficiency, but it falls short on range, charging speed and other features we typically look for in an EV. As Deputy Editor Mack Hogan put it in his review: ""It’s the most efficient electric SUV on sale, but its EV ownership experience feels like a complete afterthought.""

The front-wheel-drive RZ 300e will get you the most range. Also, keep an eye out for the 2026 RZ, which arrives later this year as a much more compelling package.

Hyundai Ioniq 5

2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5

Photo by: Patrick George

Base price: $44,200 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when purchased or leased)

Range for base model (SE Standard Range RWD): 245 miles

Maximum range: 318 miles

Drive type: RWD or AWD

The Ioniq 5 is what we'd consider the best overall EV in America that isn't a Tesla. For 2025, it's better than ever before with an updated interior, improved tech, more range and a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug. It can natively use Tesla's Supercharger network or achieve the fast-charging times it's famous for on a CCS plug using an adapter.

It's worth noting, however, that this sub-$45,000 price is for the basic SE Standard Range version, which offers a mere 245 miles of range. You may need to upgrade if you need more than that. The good news is that now that it's made in America, the Ioniq 5 qualifies for the $7,500 EV tax credit when purchased across all its trims. And keep an eye out for discounts; Hyundai often has good deals on offer.

Kia EV6

2025 Kia EV6

Base price: $44,375 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when purchased or leased)

Range for base model (Light RWD): 237 miles

Maximum range: 319 miles

Drive type: RWD or AWD

Like its close mechanical relative, the Ioniq 5, the Kia EV6 packs a lot of style, range and technology into a compelling package. Its coupe-like profile and somewhat more polarizing looks mean the EV6 is often outshone by the Hyundai, but it counts many fans among our staff, including EIC Patrick George, who is also an owner. For 2025, it also packs a Tesla-style NACS port and is made in America to get the $7,500 tax credit.

Note that its base price refers to the fairly limited Light RWD model, which is rated for a mere 237 miles of range. However, deals are often found on the upper trims to make it a much more practical daily-driver.

Hyundai Ioniq 6

2024 Hyundai Ioniq 6 Limited AWD

Base price: $39,095 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (SE Standard Range RWD): 240 miles

Maximum range: 342 miles

Drive type: RWD or AWD

Our testing shows that the Hyundai Ioniq 6 may be the best EV that nobody appreciates enough. This sleek sedan offers exceptional range of over 340 miles, great driving dynamics and the excellent charging performance that Hyundai’s latest EVs have become known for. Mack, our Deputy Editor, called the Ioniq 6 his “favorite EV” when he reviewed one last year.

Just remember: Like the Ioniq 5 above, the base model comes with a smaller battery and less driving range than other trims.

Toyota bZ4X

Toyota bZ4X

Base price: $38,465 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model: 252 miles

Maximum range: 252 miles

Drive type: FWD or AWD

The bZ4X is the only electric Toyota available in the U.S. For years, its mid-tier range, slow charging and high price made it tough to recommend. It's not exactly going to replace the extremely popular RAV4 anytime soon.

However, Toyota has given the bZ4X a big price cut for the 2025 model year, making the entry-level model around $6,000 cheaper than before. Now we’re talking. Other things the bZ4X gets right: Its two-tone styling and sharp looks set it apart from other bland crossovers. It’s not bad to drive, either. And it sports an interesting interior with some unusual materials.

The bZ4X still doesn’t provide as much range or as fast charging as more serious efforts from Hyundai and Tesla. So that should give you pause. But that’s set to change with the introduction of the redesigned 2026 bZ, which will deliver more than 300 miles in some trims.

Hyundai Kona Electric

Base price: $34,470 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model: 200 miles

Maximum range: 261 miles

Drive type: FWD

The Kona Electric proves that EVs “don’t need to be complicated,” staff writer Kevin Williams writes in his review. It’s just a straightforward, no-nonsense EV, with swift acceleration, a comfy ride and futuristic looks.

But the Kona does have its caveats, like most of America’s cheapest electric cars. The base model only provides 200 miles of range, which is not competitive in the least. (Especially when you take a look at the even more affordable Equinox EV.) And, like its Kia Niro EV cousin, charging is nothing to write home about. It took Kevin around 41 minutes to recharge his tester from 10% to 80%.

Fiat 500e

2024 Fiat 500e

Base price: $34,095 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range: 149 miles

Drive type: FWD

The 500e is, on paper, one of the very cheapest EVs you can buy new. But that doesn’t necessarily make it a great value. In his review of the 500e, small-car aficionado and InsideEVs staff writer Kevin Williams said he doesn’t know who it’s for.

According to Kevin, well over 30 grand is a lot to ask for a car that only goes 149 miles on a charge. Some pros, per his review: The 500e is cute and drives well. Cons: It’s too basic inside, lacks a heat pump and can’t go as far as similarly priced rivals.

But then again, if you’re in the market for a tiny city car that’s also electric, this is the only one you can buy new right now. The more premium Mini Cooper SE is on a hiatus in the U.S.

America's Cheapest EV: Nissan Leaf

2025 Nissan Leaf

Base price: $29,280 (Eligible for $7,500 tax credit when leased)

Range for base model (S): 149 miles

Maximum range: 212 miles

Drive type: FWD

And, finally, the absolute cheapest electric car in America: The 2025 Nissan Leaf.

This hatchback has been kicking around since 2010, when it launched as America's first mass-produced electric car. While it’s gotten more range and a new design since then, it’s not quite on the same level as most modern EVs. And that helps explain why the Leaf is so cheap compared to the pack.

The Leaf uses an outdated CHAdeMO charging port, which no other EV in America has. The tiny 40-kilowatt-hour battery in the base model is only good for 149 miles of range. And that hatchback shape has quickly gone out of style in favor of crossovers.

The good news is that it doesn’t cost much, and Nissan regularly offers great lease deals. The even better news is that Nissan just unveiled a completely redesigned 2026 Leaf that brings this iconic electric car into 2025.

Our Takeaway: The Best Cheap EV May Be A Used One

If this list of the cheapest EVs in America shows us anything, it's that there are very few of them and most bring major caveats.

Unless you land a screaming lease deal, the absolute best way to find an affordable electric car is to buy a used EV. The abundance of off-lease EVs and aggressive depreciation on plug-in cars means that if you’re willing to drive a car that’s a couple years old, you can save thousands of dollars on up-front cost.

That will change as the market grows and matures. In the next few years, we expect several cheap EVs to hit the market, expanding options for budget-conscious buyers. Those include the Slate truck, the Kia EV3 and EV4, and the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV. We'll be sure to keep this list updated as those cars hit the road.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBqLXk/s1/best-cheapest-evs.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 19:07:39.580635

Investors seeking to capitalize on this policy-driven crunch should focus on developers with shovel-ready projects and equipment suppliers poised to benefit from a 2025-2026 construction surge. The Senate's phased reduction of solar and wind tax credits creates a stark “now or never” dynamic for projects aiming to secure full federal incentives before they vanish.

The Phase-Out Timeline: A Race to 2025

The Senate's draft reconciliation bill imposes a steep slope for clean energy tax credits (ITC/PTC), compressing eligibility timelines for solar and wind projects:

2025: Full 100% tax credit available for projects beginning construction.

2026: Credits drop to 60%.

2027: Reduced to 20%.

2028: Credits eliminated entirely for new projects.

This contrasts sharply with the previous Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) framework, which allowed phased reductions through 2035. The urgency is underscored by a 2028 “placed-in-service” deadline for projects to qualify under the House's stricter rules, though the Senate's “begun construction” test offers some flexibility.

Project Economics: The Cost of Delaying Construction

The compressed timeline creates a stark financial divide between projects starting in 2025 versus later years. Consider a hypothetical $100 million solar project:

2025 Start: Full 30% ITC saves $30 million in upfront costs.

2026 Start: 60% of the credit reduces savings to $18 million, a 40% erosion in value.

2027 Start: Only $6 million saved—90% less than the full credit.

For developers, this math incentivizes a sprint to secure construction starts by year-end y 2025. Projects delayed beyond this window face sharply diminished returns, creating a “winner-takes-most” scenario for those that act quickly.

Strategic Investment Opportunities

1. Renewable Energy Developers with Advanced Pipelines

Focus on firms with permits, land secured, and financing lined up for projects that can break ground within months. Key names include:

NextEra Energy (NEE): The largest U.S. renewable developer with over 20 GW of solar and wind projects in development. Its 2025 target to start construction on 4.5 GW of solar and wind projects positions it to maximize ITC benefits.

Invenergy: A developer with 1 GW of solar projects and 1.5 GW of wind capacity in the PJM Interconnection's Reliability Resource Initiative (RRI), which aims to add 9,300 MW of capacity by 2031.

Pattern Energy (PEGI): Specializes in large-scale wind and solar projects. Its 300 MW Cottonwood Solar project in Arizona is shovel-ready and eligible for full credits if started by year-end.

2. Equipment Suppliers Benefiting from the Construction Surge

Suppliers with domestic manufacturing capacity to meet the rush will see demand spike. Key plays include:

First Solar (FSLR): A leader in utility-scale solar panels, with a U.S. manufacturing hub in Ohio. Its Series 6 panels are designed for rapid deployment, and its stock has surged 40% YTD amid project acceleration.

Vestas (VWS): A Danish wind turbine manufacturer with U.S. factories in Colorado and Colorado. Its 2025 goal to supply turbines for 5 GW of U.S. projects aligns with the Senate's construction deadlines.

Tesla (TSLA): Leverages its Powerpack and Megapack energy storage systems to serve collocated solar/wind projects, which retain full credits even after 2028 under Senate rules.

Risks and Considerations

Foreign Ownership Restrictions (FEOC): Projects must avoid material assistance from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. Developers relying on foreign components (e.g., wind turbine blades) may face compliance hurdles.

State-Level Support: States like Texas, Florida, and Indiana—leading in clean energy installations—are expanding tax incentives and revolving loan funds to offset federal cuts.

Quantifying the Opportunity

The Senate's rules create a $14 billion opportunity (per Q1 2025 cancellations data) for investors to back projects that can secure full credits. Developers with 2025-ready pipelines could see valuations rise 15-25% as they lock in tax benefits, while laggards face stranded assets.

Conclusion: Act Now, or Pay Later

The Senate's tax credit cliff is a once-in-a-decade catalyst for investment in renewable energy. Investors should prioritize developers with advanced-stage projects and suppliers with domestic capacity to meet the 2025 construction window. With credit erosion set to begin in 2026, the clock is ticking—act swiftly to capitalize on this policy-driven boom.

“This sale marks a significant milestone for the company and a win for the economic vitality of southern Colorado, positioning Evraz North America to thrive in our state for decades to come,” Lieberman said.

Atlas Holdings expects to pay $500 million for Evraz Plc’s assets in the U.S. and Canada.

The sale is welcome news to some state leaders. Eve Lieberman, the executive director of Colorado’s Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, said Evraz’s nearly $1 billion investment in building a state-of-the-art long rail mill supports thousands of jobs.

“This sale marks a significant milestone for the company and a win for the economic vitality of southern Colorado, positioning Evraz North America to thrive in our state for decades to come,” Lieberman said.

Gov. Jared Polis said he is optimistic about the future for the mill. “I met with Atlas leadership and was assured that both new jobs and the expansion efforts will continue at the plant,” he said in a statement.

Evraz North America has operated independently from Evraz Plc since 2022, soon after Russia invaded Ukraine.

Evraz Plc’s largest shareholder, at 29%, is Roman Abramovich, who was accused of having close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was sanctioned by the British government in March 2022. Regulators in the UK, citing the company’s importance to the Russian war effort, sanctioned Evraz in May 2022 and suspended its shares from trading in London.

Evraz’s North American assets have been for sale since August 2022.They include the Pueblo facility, which is the world’s largest solar-powered steel mill and the largest rail supplier in North America, and mills in Portland, Oregon, Regina, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, Canada, and employ about 3,400 people.

Atlas Holdings, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, specializes in the acquisition of underperforming or struggling units of larger companies. Its portfolio includes companies such as the food processor Foster Farms, paper mills, power plants and a steel bridge builder.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the transaction, expected to close later this year, has already passed U.S. anti-trust review and that UK regulators issued a license permitting the sale. Canadian regulators still must weigh in. The Journal also reported that proceeds of the sale will be withheld from Evraz Plc until sanctions are lifted.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Evraz_Steel_Mill_Oct_2021-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 15:06:29.530927

Ford Motor Co.’s plan to make electric-vehicle batteries at a new site in Michigan would be put at risk if Congress cuts federal incentives for clean energy, the company’s chair said.

The plant in Marshall, Michigan — and the 1,700 workers that Ford plans to employ there — would be “imperiled” if US lawmakers move to eliminate tax credits that support battery producers as part of a broader tax plan moving through congress, Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said Thursday during remarks at the Mackinac Policy Conference at Michigan’s Mackinac Island.

“It’s not fair to change policy after all the expenditures have been made,” Ford said. “The production tax credit seems to be up for grabs.”

After the event, Ford told reporters that “nothing needs to change” about the production tax credit because “we have built the business case on Marshall around that.”

President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill included several tax credits designed to help establish an EV supply chain and support consumer demand for plug-in cars.

Republican lawmakers are moving to unwind those policies. In addition to phasing out a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, the House-passed bill would end a manufacturing credit for battery makers after 2031. It would also mandate strict restrictions against the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts say could effectively render it useless.

“Politicians can agree or disagree about whether those things are desirable,” Ford said. “But don’t change the rules once you’ve already made the investment because that to me is just a question of fairness. And that’s unfair.”

The legislative risks mark the latest potential hurdle for a plant Ford announced in 2023 that was originally intended to produce enough batteries for 400,000 EVs, part of an earlier ambitious plan to electrify its lineup. The automaker later reduced that target to power about 230,000 EVs as consumer demand for the technology faltered.

Among the rollbacks proposed are a pause on developing the price gouging penalty rule enacted by the legislature in 2023 and increased oil well permitting in Kern County.

The groups pointed to new state data showing oil refiners making a killing off California consumers – with a combined gross refining margin and distribution margin of $1.71 in April, twice the national and historical averages.

""California oil refiners do not need a bailout. New data posted by the California Energy Commission shows oil refiners made a retail gross refining profit margin of $1.02 per gallon in April,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""In addition, the data shows that the distribution margin, which includes the Mystery Gasoline Surcharge, was .69 cents per gallon in April. Combined these extraordinary profit and overhead costs add more to a gallon of gasoline than the cost of crude oil, as CEC created graphic below shows.""

""California's oil refining and distribution sector are charging Californians more than double what they take in elsewhere. It would be perverse to give this industry more subsidies.""

The groups include:

""We urge you, instead, to insist that the Administration finish the job it started and that the legislature directed it to do in special sessions in 2023 and 2024: propound rules for a price gouging penalty, finalize and enforce the ABX2-1 re-supply inventory rule and begin the minimum inventory rule-making. In addition, we call on you to reject rollbacks to refinery process safety management (PSM) rules which protect refinery workers and communities while preventing sudden outages that trigger price shocks.""

The gross margins are what the refiners keep after the cost of crude oil, environmental fees, and taxes are deducted. The only refiner cost included in the gross margin is the operating costs for the refinery, which are reported by the refiners to the SEC at about 20 cents per gallon.

(EPD), a cornerstone of North American energy infrastructure, faces a critical juncture as geopolitical trade dynamics reshape global energy markets. With its sprawling network of pipelines, storage facilities, and export terminals, EPD's growth prospects hinge on navigating both the risks and opportunities arising from U.S. trade policies and shifting global energy demand. This analysis evaluates EPD's valuation, operational resilience, and strategic positioning amid escalating trade tensions, offering insights into its investment potential.

EPD's Financial Forte: Stable Cash Flow Amid Headwinds

EPD's first-quarter 2025 results underscore its financial stability. Net income dipped slightly to $1.4 billion, but distributable cash flow (DCF) rose 5% to $2.0 billion, supporting a 3.9% distribution hike to $0.535 per unit. The payout ratio of 56%—well below the 70% threshold signaling risk—leaves ample room for reinvestment. Capital spending of $1.1 billion in Q1 focused on high-return projects, including Permian Basin pipelines and the Morgan's Point ethane export terminal.

Valuation metrics paint a mixed picture. EPD's EV/EBITDA of 10.17 (as of May 2025) aligns with its historical range but sits near the upper end of its five-year average. Meanwhile, its dividend yield of 6.8% remains compelling, offering a buffer against near-term volatility. The stock's trading range in June 2025 ($30.75–$32.05) reflects investor uncertainty, but its fair price estimate of $29.74 suggests modest undervaluation.

Geopolitical Crosscurrents: Risks and Tailwinds for Energy Infrastructure

The U.S.-China and U.S.-EU trade disputes have created both challenges and opportunities for EPD's projects:

1. NGL Export Terminals: Winners in a Fractured Market

EPD's NGL export terminals, such as Morgan's Point, are positioned to benefit as global energy trade routes fragment. While U.S.-China tariffs have dampened direct exports of finished goods, U.S. NGLs—particularly ethane and propane—are increasingly attractive to Asian markets due to their role in petrochemical manufacturing. China's export controls on rare earth minerals have also intensified demand for U.S. energy-derived feedstocks for advanced manufacturing.

2. Permian Basin Pipelines: A Hedge Against Supply Chain Bottlenecks

EPD's Permian Basin infrastructure, including its liquids-rich pipelines and gas processing plants, gains strategic importance as global supply chain disruptions delay clean energy transitions. With U.S. shale production rebounding (up 3% YoY in Q2 2025), EPD's capacity to move crude and NGLs to Gulf Coast export hubs ensures steady throughput volumes.

3. Geopolitical Risks: Transformer Shortages and Steel Tariffs

The Achilles' heel? EPD's reliance on global supply chains for critical components. U.S. tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum have exacerbated shortages of power transformers, which are essential for grid upgrades and export terminal electrification. Transformer wait times exceeding 24 months and prices doubling since 2020 could delay project timelines, squeezing margins.

Valuation and Growth: Balancing Act Between Resilience and Risk

EPD's valuation appears reasonable given its 13% revenue growth in 2024 and $6 billion in organic projects (e.g., Bahia NGL pipeline, Mont Belvieu fractionator). However, risks loom:

- Trade-Driven Volatility: A full-scale U.S.-China trade war could disrupt global energy demand.

- Regulatory Overhang: U.S. permitting delays for new pipelines and terminals persist, though EPD's regulated business model mitigates this.

The 10.17 EV/EBITDA multiple reflects investor confidence in EPD's cash flow stability, but it also leaves limited room for error. A downturn in energy prices or prolonged supply chain bottlenecks could pressure multiples.

Investment Outlook: Hold for Income, Buy on Dip

EPD remains a hold for income-focused investors, given its 6.8% dividend yield and 10-year track record of distribution growth. However, bullish catalysts include:

- Resolution of U.S.-China trade tensions boosting NGL export demand.

- Acceleration of U.S. Gulf Coast infrastructure projects, which could lift utilization rates.

Risk-Adjusted Recommendation:

- Buy: On a sustained dip below $30/share, capturing the undervalued fair price.

- Avoid: If global energy demand collapses or supply chain costs escalate further.

With recent contract expansions and strategic partnerships, the company is turning its Louisiana facility into a linchpin for U.S. gas exports—a move that could insulate its cash flows amid energy transition dynamics. Here's why investors should pay close attention.

Infrastructure Advantage: A Cost-Effective Edge

The Lake Charles project's value lies in its existing infrastructure, which slashes development costs and timelines. The terminal taps into the Trunkline pipeline, a 1,000-mile system already connected to prolific shale basins like the Haynesville, Permian, and Marcellus. This access to low-cost U.S. gas—priced at the Henry Hub benchmark—gives ET a critical cost advantage over greenfield LNG projects in other regions.

Moreover, the facility's deepwater port eliminates the need for costly dredging, while shared storage and processing capacity across three 5.5-mtpa trains allow for flexible scalability. Analysts estimate these efficiencies could reduce the project's capital expenditures by 20–30% compared to standalone LNG ventures.

Contractual Momentum: Chevron and MidOcean Signal Demand Strength

ET's recent deals underscore the project's commercial viability. The expanded Chevron partnership, now at 3.0 mtpa, reflects the oil major's confidence in U.S. gas as a reliable and competitively priced resource. Chevron's long-term commitment—20 years at fixed liquefaction charges—locks in stable cash flows for ET, reducing price volatility risk.

Meanwhile, the MidOcean HOA, covering 5.0 mtpa, represents more than just a customer relationship. MidOcean's 30% equity stake in the project (funded through its gas supply commitments) effectively transfers development risk to a partner with deep LNG expertise. This structure aligns with global trends: as Asian and European buyers seek to diversify supply, they increasingly seek equity stakes to secure access.

Combined with smaller agreements like the 1.0 mtpa deal with Kyushu Electric, ET has already secured 10.4 mtpa offtake commitments—80% of the 13.0 mtpa needed to justify FID. This progress, ahead of its end-2025 target, suggests the project is on track to meet its financial close milestones.

Why Global LNG Demand Matters

The LNG market is at a pivotal juncture. Post-pandemic recovery, EU diversification away from Russian gas, and Asia's decarbonization efforts (which still rely heavily on LNG as a “bridge fuel”) are driving annual demand growth of 3–5% through 2030. U.S. LNG exporters are uniquely positioned to meet this demand, with Henry Hub prices often 40–50% below European TTF benchmarks.

ET's Lake Charles facility is primed to capitalize on this spread. Its contracts, tied to domestic gas prices, ensure profitability even as global LNG markets fluctuate. The facility's proximity to shale basins also insulates it from supply bottlenecks, a critical factor as producers like Shell and Exxon face permitting hurdles elsewhere.

FID Risks: Navigating the Final Hurdle

While progress is strong, risks remain. Regulatory approvals—particularly from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—could delay FID. Additionally, securing the remaining 2.6 mtpa offtake commitments hinges on global LNG buyers finalizing their own financing and market plans.

Investors should also monitor ET's leverage ratios, as the project's $4–5 billion price tag could strain its balance sheet. As of March 2025, ET's debt-to-equity ratio stood at 4.7x, a level that could deter lenders if FID is delayed.

Investment Thesis: A Core Position in Energy Infrastructure

Despite these risks, ET's LNG ambitions present a compelling opportunity. The Lake Charles project:

1. Reduces project risk: 80% offtake commitments lower the chance of a stranded asset.

2. Validates scalability: The modular train design allows phased development, enabling ET to pause if market conditions sour.

3. Strengthens midstream dominance: LNG exports will deepen ET's ties to shale producers, reinforcing its core pipeline business.

For investors, ET's dividend yield of 7.8% offers near-term stability, while LNG growth positions it as a long-term winner in energy transition. The stock trades at a 25% discount to its 2022 peak, presenting a valuation floor even if FID is delayed.

Final Call: Buy ET with a Long-Term Lens

Energy Transfer's LNG play is a textbook example of how infrastructure scale and strategic partnerships can turn commodity volatility into opportunity. While FID risks warrant caution, the project's progress, coupled with U.S. gas's global competitiveness, makes ET a top-tier energy infrastructure stock. Investors seeking exposure to LNG's growth story should consider a gradual position build ahead of the Q4 2025 FID decision.

Among the rollbacks proposed are a pause on developing the price gouging penalty rule enacted by the legislature in 2023 and increased oil well permitting in Kern County.

The groups pointed to new state data showing oil refiners making a killing off California consumers – with a combined gross refining margin and distribution margin of $1.71 in April, twice the national and historical averages.

""California oil refiners do not need a bailout. New data posted by the California Energy Commission shows oil refiners made a retail gross refining profit margin of $1.02 per gallon in April,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""In addition, the data shows that the distribution margin, which includes the Mystery Gasoline Surcharge, was .69 cents per gallon in April. Combined these extraordinary profit and overhead costs add more to a gallon of gasoline than the cost of crude oil, as CEC created graphic below shows.""

""California's oil refining and distribution sector are charging Californians more than double what they take in elsewhere. It would be perverse to give this industry more subsidies.""

The groups include:

""We urge you, instead, to insist that the Administration finish the job it started and that the legislature directed it to do in special sessions in 2023 and 2024: propound rules for a price gouging penalty, finalize and enforce the ABX2-1 re-supply inventory rule and begin the minimum inventory rule-making. In addition, we call on you to reject rollbacks to refinery process safety management (PSM) rules which protect refinery workers and communities while preventing sudden outages that trigger price shocks.""

The gross margins are what the refiners keep after the cost of crude oil, environmental fees, and taxes are deducted. The only refiner cost included in the gross margin is the operating costs for the refinery, which are reported by the refiners to the SEC at about 20 cents per gallon.

The H-2A rocket lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, carrying the GOSAT-GW satellite as part of Tokyo’s effort to mitigate climate change. The satellite was released into a planned orbit about 16 minutes later.

The launch follows several days of delays because of malfunctioning of the rocket’s electrical systems.

Sunday’s launch marked the 50th and final flight for the H-2A, which has served as Japan’s mainstay rocket to carry satellites and probes into space with a near-perfect record since its 2001 debut. After its retirement, it will be fully replaced by the H3, which is already in operation, as Japan’s new main flagship.

“Even though our launches seemed stable, we have run into difficulties and overcome them one by one to come this far,” said Iwao Igarashi, senior general manager of the space systems division at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which operated launch services. “As we now move on to the H3 launch service, we will firmly keep up the trust we gained from H-2A.”

The GOSAT-GW, or Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse gases and Water cycle, is a third series in the mission to monitor carbon, methane and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Within one year, it will start distributing data such as sea surface temperature and precipitation with much higher resolution to users around the world, including the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, officials said.

The liquid-fuel H-2A rocket with two solid-fuel sub-rockets developed by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency has so far had 49 flights with a 98% success record, with only one failure in 2003. Mitsubishi Heavy has provided its launch operation since 2007.

H-2A successfully carried into space many satellites and probes, including Japan’s moon lander SLIM last year, and a popular Hayabusa2 spacecraft in 2014 to reach a distant asteroid, contributing to the country’s space programs.

Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security, and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors of the H-2A series — the larger H3 with Mitsubishi, and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market.

The H3, is designed to carry larger payloads than the H-2A at about half its launch cost to be globally competitive, though officials say more cost reduction efforts are needed to achieve better price competitiveness in the global market.

The H3 has made four consecutive successful flights after a failed debut attempt in 2023, when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",https://www.ktalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/68608971e2efa0.24780730.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-29 00:00:59.706510

CAC’s Alt: Senate Reconciliation Bill Raises Rates and Reneges on America’s Clean Energy Future

Washington, D.C. – The Senate has begun debate on the reconciliation bill that seeks to establish massive cuts to climate, clean energy and other investments in order to deliver unprecedented tax breaks for billionaires. Margie Alt, Director of the Climate Action Campaign issued the following statement in response to this development:

“The Senate reconciliation bill reneges on the promise of America’s clean energy future, raising rates for consumers and mortgaging our health and environment to deliver massive tax breaks for billionaires. It effectively repeals the clean energy tax credits that have created jobs, encouraged new business, re-invigorated US manufacturing, and driven down energy costs and climate pollution. This is the most anti-environment bill in history. With a heatwave overwhelming much of the country this week, now is not the time to force families to pay more, our kids to breathe dirty air, and all of us to suffer more climate change-driven extreme weather catastrophes just so billionaires can get richer. This bill should be rejected.”

Brown, William J. Ford",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/06/28/energy-rebate-august-september-maryland-psc/,"Maryland households will have to wait just a little bit longer for a promised rebate on their energy bills amid the summer heat.
For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

While legislative leaders had said they expected the first payments in July, the Maryland Public Service Commission said Friday that the first round of rebates to all residential energy customers is expected in August or September. A second round is anticipated in either January or February.

Total payments are expected to average about $80 per household for the year.

PSC Chair Fred Hoover said the commission spoke with utilities — which will actually dole out the rebates to customers — as well as ratepayer advocates and its own staff, to come up with the best plan for handing out the money.

The commission “has selected a plan that will allow for the most equitable, efficient and timely distribution of refunds to provide relief to customers, particularly those most affected by bill increases this past winter,” Hoover wrote.

The refund payments will show up as credits on ratepayers’ bills and will be based on a customer’s usage over a year, with those who use more energy getting a larger rebate. But the PSC also directed utilities to disburse 25% of the money evenly across all ratepayers, to ensure all customers get a baseline amount.

The PSC also advised utilities to advertise ways for customers to donate their rebate to others if they choose, including to the Fuel Fund of Maryland or SMECO’s Members Helping Members program. For the winter rebate, utilities were told to explore ways that customers could refuse the rebate and send it instead to other customers who receive bill assistance from the state.

The rebates were authorized by legislators as part of the Next Generation Energy Act, a wide-ranging bill that also included a regulatory fast-track for new power plants and other energy infrastructure in the state.

Lawmakers tapped $200 million to pay the rebates from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which utilities pay into if they do not purchase a specified amount of renewable energy for their portfolios. The fund has ballooned in recent years.

During a news conference Wednesday, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) referenced this week’s high temperatures, which flirted with 100, and their impact on already soaring bills.

“I have an HVAC repair person coming tomorrow,” Ferguson said. “So we are personally dealing with the challenges of what I know a number of Maryland families are, which is unbelievably hot weather, and then the resultant impact on people’s bills, which feels like a double hit. I am as frustrated as anyone.”

High utility bills were a major topic of conversation for the 2025 legislature, following high costs during a cold winter, thanks in large part to higher natural gas distribution rates. But now, electricity rates are poised to increase as well for the delivery year that began in June.

The increases will hit different customers at different times: June 1 for SMECO customers, August for Pepco and Delmarva Power customers, and October for Potomac Edison. BGE, which will have the highest increases, was ordered by the PSC to spread them over three months this fall and again next spring, in order to dull the impact in the high-use summer and winter periods.

Moore signed the Next Generation bill and one other energy bill, but vetoed the Energy Resource Planning Act, which would have set up an in-house energy planning office for state government. He recently critiqued the Next Generation law, saying it did not go far enough to attract power generators to build in Maryland.

“We introduced legislation this year that would have allowed more nuclear into the state, that would have allowed nuclear to be seen as a clean energy source, which it is,” Moore said. “I’m proud of the work we did in partnership with the legislature, but I want to be crystal clear: It did not go far enough.”

Ferguson pushed back this week.

“I don’t know what the governor was talking about when he said that. I genuinely have no idea what he was referencing,” Ferguson said during his news conference. “I think that we did incredibly important work to make it easier for all sorts of cleaner energy, from natural gas to wind to solar to geothermal to batteries.”

He said Moore’s nuclear bill would have increased costs for ratepayers, which “was not something that we were going to tolerate. So, what we did was incorporate components of the governor’s bill into the Next Generation Act.”

The bill directs state agencies to pursue nuclear cost-sharing agreements with neighboring states and agreements with federal agencies about nuclear siting, including for small modular reactors.

The fiscal note for Moore’s bill said that “in the short term, the bill appears likely to increase electricity rates,” because it increased the amount utilities would have to pay the state to comply with a solar energy goal. It also established a nuclear energy procurement mechanism that would be funded by ratepayers.

But legislative analysts said the governor’s bill had “the potential to provide other benefits to the broader energy market and eventually reduce associated electricity rates paid by customers in the State.”

Ferguson was also quick to note that increasing power generation in the state isn’t a cure-all. Maryland is part of a 13-state region whose electrical grid is controlled by PJM Interconnection, which has been criticized for policies that make it difficult for new power sources — particularly renewable — to come online at a time of surging demand.

Businesses have announced about 400 large-scale factories and projects that benefit from the tax policies the Senate is expected to phase out and repeal. If approved by the House, the Senate bill would put many of those projects – along with $132 billion in business investments and more than 120,000 jobs – at risk, according to the national nonpartisan business group E2.

The Senate legislation also would make it more expensive to develop new solar, wind and battery projects that currently account for more than 90 percent of all new power being added to the grid – resulting in higher electricity costs for consumers and businesses alike.

The following is a statement from Bob Keefe, E2 executive director and author of the 2024 book about federal energy policy, Clean Economy NOW.

“America’s economy and energy security just took a massive step backward—one that may be hard to recover if not fixed immediately.

“This bill will slam the brakes on made-in-America energy projects, push businesses to take their factories and investments overseas, and drive up energy costs for families and businesses. It’s reckless, it’s shortsighted, and it hands our competitors like China an open invitation to lead while we fall behind.

“President Trump wants to dramatically increase US energy production. This bill does the opposite.”

Other factors still unclear are the type of nuclear plant technology to be used and project delivery approach.
Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point, completed in 1989, was the last nuclear plant built in New York.
Nuclear power had provided about 5.4 GW, or about one-third of the supply at its peak, said advocacy group Nuclear New York.
The prospect of nuclear plant construction has gained organized labor support.","The New York Power Authority will oversee development upstate of at least 1 GW of new combined capacity of advanced zero-emission nuclear power, Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) has announced, although she did not specify location, number, schedule or cost of planned generating facilities. Other factors still unclear are the type of nuclear plant technology to be used and project delivery approach.

The state also seeks private sector investment and partners. “We want to help finance the plant and buy the power it generates. So I'm directing the Department of Public Service to work hand in hand with [the authority] to ensure this is done upfront,” she said. Hochul announced the plan on June 23 at the site of the Robert Moses Niagara Hydroelectric plant in Lewiston, N.Y., near Buffalo.

A number of upstate locations with communities willing to host a power plant are being considered, said Hochul, who estimates total development will create about 1,600 construction jobs and about 1,200 in operation.

Hochul pointed to construction in Canada's Ontario province of four small modular nuclear reactors, noting that will be ""underway in 18 months. This is the speed that they're able to accomplish,” after mentioning discussion of a memorandum of understanding with Ontario Premier Tom Ford.

The idea of new nuclear construction in New York had been set in motion last year with introduction of a draft blueprint at a state energy summit in Syracuse that referenced the “attractive possibilities” of small modular reactors—including scalability, smaller land use requirements and ability to deliver 24/7 power.

Powering Up

Underpinning the current announcement is a need to support state ambitions to encourage technology for power needs of planned corporate investment in semiconductor, cloud computing and AI capacity in New York—including a Micron semiconductor fabrication plant and other facilities set to be built in Onondaga County that state officials have described as a 20-year $100-million investment set to include a record-setting 2.4-million sq ft of clean room space. Its draft environmental impact statement was released on June 25.

“Micron is going to need so much power ... and there's only one commercially viable option that can deliver that much clean, renewable, reliable power, and that's what's been operating in New York for decades, nuclear energy,” said Hochul. The company said it expects to begin ground preparation for its facility late this year following completion of state and federal environmental reviews.

About 15% of New York nucear power, about 3.3 GW, is from three upstate plants: Ginna, Nine Mile Point and FitzPatrick that are located along Lake Ontario and now are owned and operated by Constellation Energy. Unit 2 at Nine Mile Point, completed in 1989, was the last nuclear plant built in New York.

With the 2021 shutdown of the 2.2-GW Indian Point plant in Buchanan, NY, 25 miles north of New York City, most of the downstate region receives the bulk of its power from natural gas, which makes up 46% of the state's overall portfolio. Nuclear power had provided about 5.4 GW, or about one-third of the supply at its peak, said advocacy group Nuclear New York.

The prospect of nuclear plant construction has gained organized labor support. “The expansion of our nuclear capabilities has long been a missing piece of New York's pursuit of our climate goals and the construction of a new power plant will be crucial to the success of our green economy,” said Gary LaBarbera, New York State Building Trades President.

President Donald Trump also signed four executive orders to propel buildout of U.S. nuclear power plants, with a goal to increase generation capacity to 400 GW by 2050, up fourfold from the current 100 GW level that is the output of more than than 90 operating reactors. The administration also seeks strategies for how reactors could be constructed with less, or possibly, no federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight.

Many environmental groups prefer that Hochul focus on renewable solar and wind energy, The state's Climate Act, enacted by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2019, calls for a 40% reduction below 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 85% by 2050 and zero-emission electricity by 2040. It also sets a goal of 70% of power from renewable sources, which exclude nuclear, but there is skepticism, including from some state officials that New York can meet this goal, particularly as projects have faced recent market challenges that administration orders are exacerbating.

The state ""should be laser focused on rapidly scaling up buildout of affordable solar and wind which is the only way to meet the state’s science-based climate goals and lower energy bills,” said a statement from Public Power NY.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/06/27/Gov-Hochul-NY-Niagara-Power.jpg?height=635&t=1751119329&width=1200,N,,2025-06-28 14:06:05.402319

Governor Kathy Hochul has ordered the New York State Power Authority (NYPA) to develop an advanced nuclear power plant in New York. advanced, emission-free nuclear emissions-free nuclear power plant. The initiative seeks to support a more reliable and affordable electric grid, in line with the state’s decarbonization and industrial growth goals.

Betting on a reliable nuclear plant

The directive is part of the actions stemming from the State of the State 2025 Report. Hochul emphasized that, with the closure of fossil fuel plants and growing energy demand, the advanced nuclear technology technology must be incorporated into the energy mix. In this regard, the plant will provide clean-based energy to complement intermittent renewable generation such as solar and wind.

NYPA will coordinate with the Department of Public Service (DPS) to evaluate technologies, business models and sites. The initial goal is to install a plant with a capacity of at least one gigawatt. Selection criteria include safety, community support, available infrastructure and availability of skilled labor.

Regional impetus and public-private partnerships

The project is linked to other regional initiatives such as collaboration with Ontario and other northeastern U.S. states to strengthen nuclear technology supply chains. Potential partnerships with the private sector to develop and operate the plant are also contemplated. The strategy is aligned with the Master Plan for Advanced Nuclear Development led by NYSERDA and DPS.

The Nine Mile Point Clean Energy Center could also benefit from an early permitting process for new projects. According to Infobae, currently, New York’s three active nuclear plants provide about 20% of the state’s electricity and more than 40% of its carbon-free energy..

Employment, economy and energy independence

The economic and social analysis is also central to this proposal. According to various business associations and organizations, the construction of new power plants will help generate unionized, stable and well-paid jobs. It will also facilitate the establishment of new energy-intensive industries such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence.

Governor Hochul emphasized that state control over key infrastructure such as this plant will enable New York to strengthen its energy independence, stabilize prices and secure supply in an uncertain global context. The commitment to a robust, secure and carbon-free electricity grid is consolidating as the backbone of the transition to a green and competitive economy.

While the president had previously broadly stayed out of discussions on what the bill would include, he pressured the GOP via social media to cut back on the clean energy tax credits faster than originally proposed.","The more aggressive cuts to clean energy, while in line with Trump’s priorities, could make the overall bill a tougher vote for some senators who have worried that the rollbacks could imperil projects already underway across the country.

The new text specifically slashes federal incentives for wind and solar projects that are not “placed in service,” meaning they are operating and plugged into the grid, by the end of 2027.

Originally, the Senate version of the bill provided a slower phase-out of these credits, starting in 2026 and ending by 2028. It also used language detailing that projects only needed to have begun construction by 2028 to qualify for the credits.

As before, the Senate bill targets electric vehicles by terminating tax credits for them. Previously, Republicans sought to end the credit 180 days after the legislation was signed into law. The updated text would cut the credit by the end of September.

Developers of clean hydrogen projects, though, would find some relief under the updated text, as it would extend subsidies for clean hydrogen projects to January 2028. Previously, projects would have had to begin construction this year to qualify.

Other changes include adding a new tax incentive for certain advanced nuclear projects, expanded funding for a new energy dominance loan program with the Energy Department, and a new tax on solar and wind projects that fail to meet restrictions on the use of Chinese materials.

Several provisions in the new text remain the same, including support for the nuclear and geothermal industries and the ability for project developers to use transferability. This allows companies to sell tax credits to a third party.

It also still includes Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) controversial proposal to sell tracts of public lands to help pay for Trump’s tax cuts and increase housing development in the West.

The proposal, which was modified last week after criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, mandates the sale of as much as 1.2 million acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management.

The sales must be limited to tracts located within 5 miles of a population center and cannot include land managed by the U.S. Forest Service, which was included in the original proposal.

Republicans have been facing increasing pressure from the White House to get the legislation on Trump’s desk by Friday.

While the president had previously broadly stayed out of discussions on what the bill would include, he pressured the GOP via social media to cut back on the clean energy tax credits faster than originally proposed.

Three people familiar with the legislation negotiations also told Politico this week that Trump was directly pressing Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to crack down on wind and solar subsidies.

With its dominance in data center GPUs—commanding an estimated 80–90% market share—NVIDIA's hardware underpins everything from generative AI models to autonomous systems. Yet, this revolution comes at a cost: energy consumption. Data centers powered by NVIDIA's GPUs now demand exponential amounts of electricity, creating a critical opportunity for energy infrastructure firms positioned to meet this surge.

NVIDIA's Data Center Dominance: A Powerhouse with a Price

NVIDIA's Blackwell GPU architecture, introduced in 2025, exemplifies the trade-off between computational power and energy use. These chips deliver a 40× performance leap over predecessors but consume up to 1,200 watts, with paired systems (e.g., the GB200) drawing 2,700 watts—a 300% increase over earlier generations. This has driven NVIDIA's data center revenue to $35.6 billion in Q4 2024, a 93% year-over-year surge.

Yet, the energy required to fuel these GPUs is staggering. Analysts estimate that global data center power demand could triple by 2027, exceeding 2022's total energy consumption if utilization rates hit 90%. This creates a paradox: AI's growth hinges on infrastructure that can scale energy supply while mitigating costs and emissions.

The Energy Infrastructure Play: Undervalued Stocks to Watch

The companies best positioned to capitalize on this demand are not silicon foundries but energy infrastructure firms. Five undervalued stocks identified by Morningstar analysts—Chart Industries (GTLS), Energy Transfer LP (ET), Enbridge (ENB), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and TC Energy (TRP)—offer exposure to critical energy systems supporting data centers. Here's why:

1. Chart Industries (GTLS): The Carbon Capture Specialist

GTLS designs equipment for carbon capture, gas storage, and specialty compression. With a $3.35 billion order backlog (double its 2022 total), GTLS is supplying the “batteries” for data centers: systems that store energy and reduce emissions. While its $200 fair value estimate (vs. current price) reflects growth potential, risks include execution challenges from recent acquisitions.

2. Energy Transfer LP (ET): Fueling Texas's Data Hub

ET's pipelines connect to 55–60% of Texas power plants, a key data center cluster. The firm projects 8 billion cubic feet/day of gas demand by 2030 from data centers alone. With an 8.23% dividend yield and a $21 fair value estimate, ET offers income and growth.

3. Enbridge (ENB): The Northern Grid Guardian

Enbridge's gas storage and renewables infrastructure serve regions like Ohio and North Carolina, where 45% of North American power generation lies within 50 miles of its assets. Its $41 fair value estimate and 7.54% dividend yield make it a stable play on data center energy needs.

4. Kinder Morgan (KMI): The Gas Transport Titan

KMI controls 20% of U.S. power demand and 40% of gas transport infrastructure. With AI-driven gas demand projected to hit 16 billion cubic feet/day by 2030, KMI's pipelines are indispensable. Its $22 fair value estimate and 6.08% dividend yield offer value despite a 24.98 P/E ratio, elevated but justified by its scale.

5. TC Energy (TRP): The Storage Solution

TRP's 650 billion cubic feet of gas storage (80% under take-or-pay contracts) acts as a “battery” for peak data center demand. Its $47 fair value estimate and 7.44% dividend yield highlight its reliability. However, its 5.36 P/B ratio underscores valuation risks.

Risks and Considerations

The path to profit is not without hurdles. Supply chain bottlenecks (e.g., steel and copper shortages), regulatory delays, and labor constraints could slow infrastructure expansion. For instance, U.S. grid interconnection timelines can stretch to 7 years, threatening data center timelines.

Moreover, the energy transition itself poses risks. While gas remains critical for grid stability, renewables' intermittency could amplify demand for gas “backstops.” Companies like GTLS and ET must balance these dynamics.

Investment Thesis: A Strategic Bet on Energy Resilience

Investors seeking to profit from AI's energy demands should prioritize dividend-paying infrastructure stocks with low valuations relative to their fair value. The five firms above offer exposure to gas transport, carbon capture, and storage—critical for data center reliability.

For income investors: ET, ENB, and TRP's high dividends (7–8%) provide steady returns while infrastructure grows.

For growth investors: GTLS and KMI's order backlogs and scalability position them to outperform as AI adoption peaks.

Avoid overpaying: while KMI's P/E is high by sector standards, its historical 10-year average (67.31) suggests current valuations are reasonable.

Final Word: Powering Progress, Prudently

NVIDIA's AI revolution is undeniably transformative, but its success hinges on energy infrastructure that is robust, scalable, and sustainable. The companies highlighted here are not just beneficiaries of this trend—they are enablers. For investors willing to navigate near-term risks, these undervalued energy stocks offer a compelling way to profit from the next era of computing.

In the race to power AI, the winners will be those who supply the electricity—and the wisdom—to keep the servers running.",,N,,2025-06-28 16:06:23.626895

One example: The Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit was first introduced in 1992, when wind energy was a nascent industry.
In other words, more wind and solar brings us the worst of two worlds: less reliable energy delivery and higher electric bills.
Since Day 1, President Trump has been focused on lowering energy costs and promoting affordable, reliable and secure energy sources.
The One Big Beautiful Bill brings us one step closer to cementing this legacy — and unleashing economic prosperity for the American people.","How much would you pay for an Uber if you didn’t know when it would pick you up or where it was going to drop you off? Probably not much.

Yet this is the same effect that variable generation sources like wind and solar have on our power grids.

You never know if these energy sources will actually be able to produce electricity when you need it — because you don’t know if the sun will be shining or the wind blowing.

Even so, the federal government has subsidized these sources for decades, resulting in higher electricity prices and a less stable grid.

President Donald Trump knows what to do: Eliminate green tax credits from the Democrats’ so-called Inflation Reduction Act, including those for wind and solar power.

The One Big Beautiful Bill seeks to do that: Along with other proposals, like canceling billions in Biden Green New Deal money and making much-needed investments in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it aims to set an aggressive end date for these subsidies and build on the president’s push for affordable, abundant, and secure energy for the nation.

The House bill begins phasing out these tax credits within three years, saving hundreds of billions for American taxpayers.

As secretary of energy — and someone who’s devoted his life to advancing energy innovation to better human lives — I, too, know how these Green New Deal subsidies are fleecing Americans.

Wind and solar subsidies have been particularly wasteful and counterproductive.

One example: The Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit was first introduced in 1992, when wind energy was a nascent industry. This tax credit, originally set to phase out in 1999, was sold on a promise of low-cost energy with fewer tradeoffs.

Since 1999, the REPTC has been extended a whopping 12 times, yet consumers continue to pay more on average for their home electric bills than in 1992, even after adjusting for inflation.

Plus, today, more than 75% of US electricity comes from natural gas, nuclear and coal — and they supply it 24/7, independent of the weather.

Climate change activists are predictably up in arms over efforts to end the subsidies. But like Uber rides, energy generation is pointless if it flunks the test of reliable delivery.

At 8 p.m. on Inauguration Day, amid bitter cold across much of the Eastern seaboard, we reached peak demand for electricity in the mid-Atlantic region. At that point in time, PJM Interconnection, which supplies the Mid-Atlantic United States, got approximately 44% of its power from coal, 24% from natural gas, 25% from nuclear, 3% from oil, 3% from wind, 1% from hydro and 0% from solar.

Think about that: When Americans most needed dependable power to heat their homes and businesses to stay alive, solar and wind were non-factors.

Our homes, hospitals and businesses only continued to operate because there was enough reliable, baseload energy from natural gas, coal and nuclear available to meet demand.

How valuable is a teammate who occasionally shows up for practice but is never there at game time?

And the more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand.

Subsidies are meant to drive prices down and boost supply. But subsidizing wind and solar has done exactly the opposite.

These sources force grid operators to maintain two separate systems — one for legacy power and another for renewable sources.

When wind and solar come online, legacy resources must be scaled back.

But it’s difficult to store electricity from wind and solar. So when wind and solar aren’t available at times of peak demand, reliable baseload sources must scale up.

Bottom line: higher costs. Indeed, wind and solar subsidies not only cost taxpayers but also force providers to add more dispatchable resources to the grid, at their expense.

These costs are then passed on to ratepayers.

In other words, more wind and solar brings us the worst of two worlds: less reliable energy delivery and higher electric bills.

It’s time to stop subsidizing such insanity in perpetuity. If sources are truly economically viable, let’s allow them to stand on their own, and stop forcing Americans to pick up the tab if they’re not.

Since Day 1, President Trump has been focused on lowering energy costs and promoting affordable, reliable and secure energy sources.

The One Big Beautiful Bill brings us one step closer to cementing this legacy — and unleashing economic prosperity for the American people.

If successful, commercial fusion plants using the X-point target radiator could begin operating in the 2030s.","Scientists at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne have developed a solution that prevents fusion reactors from overheating, Phys.org reported.

The breakthrough centers on a clever design called the X-point target radiator. This innovation adds a second magnetic control point to tokamak fusion reactors, creating a safety valve that sheds dangerous excess heat before it can damage the reactor walls.

Fusion reactors face a massive heat management problem. These doughnut-shaped devices, called tokamaks, use powerful magnetic fields to contain plasma heated to over 100 million degrees Celsius. When this superhot plasma touches the reactor walls, it can cause severe damage that shortens the reactor's lifespan and hurts performance.

The Swiss research team discovered that adding a secondary X-point along the reactor's heat exhaust channel creates localized radiation that pulls heat away from sensitive areas. Think of it like adding a second drain to prevent your bathtub from overflowing.

""Reducing divertor heat loads is a key challenge for future fusion power plants,"" Kenneth Lee, first author of the paper, told Phys.org.

The EPFL team used its TCV tokamak's unique magnetic shaping abilities to test this concept. Experiments showed the X-point target radiator stays stable across a range of operating conditions, making it much more reliable than previous heat management approaches.

""We found that the X-point target radiator is highly stable and can be sustained over a wide range of operational conditions, potentially offering a much more reliable method for handling power exhaust in a fusion power plant,"" Lee said.

Fusion energy could change how we power our world. Unlike coal and gas, fusion creates massive amounts of electricity without producing harmful gases or long-lived radioactive waste. A single fusion plant could power entire cities on fuel extracted from seawater.

The X-point target radiator makes fusion power plants more practical by solving the overheating problem that has plagued reactor designs. This means fusion plants could run longer and more efficiently, reducing electricity costs for everyone.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology plan to include the X-point target design in their upcoming SPARC reactor, which looks to demonstrate commercial fusion power.

Diversifying our energy sources with fusion power would dramatically reduce air pollution from coal and gas plants. Cleaner air means fewer respiratory problems, heart disease cases, and premature deaths in communities near power plants.

Fusion power could slash electricity bills once the technology scales up. The fuel comes from abundant hydrogen isotopes found in seawater, making long-term operating costs extremely low.

Cities and companies investing in fusion power could reap major savings compared to volatile coal and gas prices. The stable costs of fusion electricity would help businesses plan budgets and keep energy affordable for residents.

The SPARC reactor incorporating this heat management technology is scheduled for testing in the coming years. If successful, commercial fusion plants using the X-point target radiator could begin operating in the 2030s.

The researchers will continue refining their approach with high-power experiments and simulations.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/fusion-reactor-overheatingimage-reczVfff9cdqdeHim.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 14:06:10.106536

This dual focus on environmental and social governance is critical for accessing IRA-backed clean energy markets.
NAI, Li-FT, and Wallbridge are all domestic champions in their fields, insulated from trade wars and commodity swings.
Final take: These companies are not just digging for minerals—they're building the infrastructure of the clean energy economy.","As the world grapples with supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the accelerating demand for clean energy infrastructure, a new class of resource producers is emerging. Companies like North American Iron (NAI), Li-FT Power, and Wallbridge Mining are positioning themselves not just as commodity suppliers but as strategic partners in the global shift toward energy independence and decarbonization. Their projects—rooted in domestic production, advanced-stage development, and ESG alignment—offer investors a rare blend of growth potential and risk mitigation. Here's why they're worth watching.

North American Iron (NAI): Forging Steel Security in the Heartland

NAI's vision is simple yet transformative: end U.S. reliance on foreign pig iron. By converting legacy Minnesota iron ore into high-purity pig iron at its proposed North Dakota facility, NAI aims to supply 2 million tons annually by 2029—directly addressing a market where 50 million tons of imports face tariffs and geopolitical risks.

Why it matters: Pig iron is the backbone of steelmaking, a critical material for solar panels, wind turbines, and EV batteries. With the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) mandating domestic content for clean energy tax credits, NAI's project aligns perfectly with federal incentives. The Treasury's 2025 guidance explicitly rewards companies using U.S.-manufactured inputs, making NAI's timeline (groundbreaking in 2026, production by 2029) a race against surging demand.

Investment angle: NAI's focus on reducing carbon footprints (via domestic logistics) and its partnership with Minnesota/North Dakota governments suggest it could become a cornerstone of U.S. resource security. Risks include permitting delays and fluctuating steel prices, but the IRA's tailwinds make this a long-term bet.

Li-FT Power: Lithium's Canadian Upstart in a Battery-Hungry World

Li-FT Power's Yellowknife Lithium Project in Canada's Northwest Territories is a masterstroke of strategic resource development. With 50.4 million tonnes of lithium oxide reserves and metallurgical recoveries averaging 79%, the project targets a critical gap: North America's reliance on Chinese lithium.

ESG in action: The company's Environmental Baseline Data Collection Program integrates Indigenous Knowledge, with partnerships like Det'on Cho Environmental ensuring local employment and cultural preservation. This approach not only mitigates regulatory risks but also aligns with the IRA's emphasis on socially responsible sourcing.

Investment angle: Lithium prices have been volatile, but the IRA's domestic content rules and EV adoption rates suggest a sustained boom. Li-FT's proximity to rail infrastructure and aggressive exploration (50,000 meters drilled in 10 months) position it to capitalize. However, execution risk remains high—delays in permitting or lower-than-expected recoveries could dent valuations.

Wallbridge Mining: Gold's Quiet Role in the Clean Energy Shift

While gold is often seen as a pure commodity play, Wallbridge Mining's Fenelon gold project in Quebec offers a subtler angle: gold's hidden utility in renewable tech. Gold's conductivity and corrosion resistance make it a key material in solar panels, EV connectors, and wind turbine electronics.

ESG as a competitive edge: Wallbridge's GreenWISE 2.0 program integrates carbon-reducing technologies (e.g., battery electric vehicles, Mass Timber Hybrid construction) into its operations, while Indigenous partnerships ensure 25-30% of its workforce comes from local First Nations. This dual focus on environmental and social governance is critical for accessing IRA-backed clean energy markets.

Investment angle: Gold's price is volatile, but its role in tech could underpin steady demand. Wallbridge's 2023 PEA—projecting 212,000 ounces annually over 12 years—hints at stable cash flows. However, the lack of 2025 Q2 updates on Indigenous partnerships raises governance concerns. Investors should monitor regulatory approvals and community relations closely.

The Geopolitical Edge: Why Resource Security Matters Now

The U.S. and Canada are racing to onshore critical minerals, driven by the IRA's $369 billion clean energy push and fears of supply chain fragility. NAI, Li-FT, and Wallbridge are all domestic champions in their fields, insulated from trade wars and commodity swings.

Final take: These companies are not just digging for minerals—they're building the infrastructure of the clean energy economy. NAI's steel, Li-FT's lithium, and Wallbridge's gold are all vital cogs in a $12 trillion transition. For investors, the calculus is clear:

- Take measured positions in NAI and Li-FT for their IRA tailwinds and project timelines.

- Monitor Wallbridge's governance updates but bet on its gold's tech utility.

- Diversify: Commodity volatility demands hedging, but these firms' alignment with policy and ESG trends makes them essential holdings for the next decade.

In a world where supply chains are battlegrounds, the mineral mavens are winning.

While the Senate’s version keeps the tax credits for geothermal, hydro, nuclear, and energy storage through at least 2032, it offers only a slight improvement on the House’s evisceration of wind and solar credits for the commercial and industrial sectors.

The Senate proposal establishes the following phase-out schedule for commercial and utility-scale projects to qualify for the wind or solar production or investment tax credit:

Construction begins in 2025, receive 100%

Construction begins in 2026, receive 60%

Construction begins in 2027, receive 20%

Construction begins in/after 2028, receive 0%

In addition, no credit is allowed for a facility that commences construction after December 31, 2025 that includes certain levels of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity like China.

While energy storage projects can still access the investment tax credit through 2033, they are subject to the prohibition against material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity. Since China currently manufactures the majority of the batteries used in utility-scale storage projects, this provision will likely eliminate the viability of most battery storage projects.

Many think tanks and industry groups are trying to help members of Congress as well as the general public understand how the proposed changes will harm the economies of states where clean energy manufacturing and utility-scale clean energy installations have either already begun or are slated to begin soon.

One of these organizations, Clean Energy Tracker, recently released a four-page fact sheet on “How the Reconciliation Bill Would Impact Iowa’s Energy Future.” The report is full of excellent information that merits close reading and consideration.

That said, the report does not accurately reflect the amount of utility-scale clean energy projects that are planned through 2032 by Iowa’s investor-owned utilities. The Clean Energy Tracker report says “Iowa has 13.9 GW of clean electricity deployed, 0.01 GW under construction, and another 0.27 GW planned.”

Those numbers appear to be based on U.S. Energy Information Agency reports, which do not provide an accurate, up-to-date picture of Iowa utility plans. Recently, Alliant Energy and MidAmerican Energy released Resource Evaluation Studies that revealed their preferred planned investments in clean and fossil-based electricity generation..

The following table consolidates this information and focuses on Alliant and MidAmerican’s planned clean energy investments from 2024 through 2032.

*RPU = Approved by Iowa Utilities Commission--RPU Docket

This table reveals that Iowa's investor-owned utilities (MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy) plan to install an additional 2.25 GW of clean energy capacity–1 GW of wind, 0.75 GW of solar, and 0.5 GW of battery storage through 2032.

This is almost ten times more than the planned capacity additions stated in the Clean Energy Tracker report and would represent an almost 17% increase in existing clean energy capacity in Iowa by 2030.

In addition, the Clean Energy Tracker information does not include other utility-scale projects that may be planned by consumer-owned utilities or independent project developers eager to meet the power demands of the booming data center sector in Iowa.

Suffice it to say, as proposed, passage of the Trump administration’s ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" is going to clobber future utility-scale clean energy projects in Iowa, increase business and household energy costs, and have a deleterious impact on Iowa’s economy.",http://dircx6nshkvfy.cloudfront.net/360_Decorah_Live/0/0/0/0/19/40/19040_1,N,,2025-06-28 13:12:31.714158

In collaboration with energy services provider Ameresco and manufacturing partner Branch Technology, the Army is testing advanced 3D printing methods to improve building energy performance and reduce operational costs.

The initiative is supported by the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) and marks one of the first large-scale military applications of custom 3D-printed insulation panels. These panels are designed using Branch’s Cellular Fabrication (C-Fab®) process, which begins with a digital scan of existing building surfaces and ends with precisely manufactured insulation components tailored to fit complex architectural details.

This kind of precision allows the Army to sidestep the inefficiencies of off-the-shelf insulation solutions, particularly in older structures where standard materials often fall short. The retrofit project at Detroit Arsenal will address approximately 6,250 square feet of building envelope, with estimated energy efficiency improvements of up to 50%. That’s not just a boost for operational performance—it also supports the military’s ongoing push to meet federal sustainability goals.

Testing Innovation Before Scaling Across Federal Facilities

To validate performance, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is constructing a parallel 300-square-foot test installation at its research facility in Colorado. The monitored demo will collect real-world data on energy savings, installation complexity, and long-term value—key benchmarks that could guide future military infrastructure planning.

While the Detroit Arsenal retrofit is still in early stages, its inclusion in Ameresco’s 2025 federal project backlog signals growing momentum around these types of collaborative efforts.

Republicans in Congress have supported efforts to rescind the clean energy funds, but Democrats say Trump's fight against clean energy funding is leading GOP lawmakers to hurt their own constituents.","Rep. Nancy Mace has asked the Trump administration to release roughly $285 million in climate funding approved under President Joe Biden to help finance a Mercedes-Benz plant in her state in its efforts to convert to manufacturing electric vehicles, according to a letter she wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

In the letter, sent privately to Wright on Tuesday and obtained by The Washington Post, the South Carolina Republican asked that the funds be released for the Mercedes-Benz Vans plant, located north of Charleston, because the project will add 800 jobs in her area, the newspaper reported Saturday.

The funding is part of a $1.8 billion program approved during the Biden administration in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act to help at-risk auto plants make electric vehicles and convert supply chains.

However, the Trump administration has been pushing to withhold funding for the Biden-era climate programs, as well as to repeal hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy incentives in its ""big, beautiful bill"" under discussion in the Senate.

The South Carolina Mercedes plant plans to produce a light-duty electric van prototype, which Mace said in her letter will add jobs and capital to the Charleston region — much of which she represents — and would ""ensure America-made options remain available in the commercial vehicle sector.”

She added that while she continues to support President Donald Trump's initiative to cut waste and fraud in government, ""we believe that federal investments should continue to prioritize projects with sustained economic growth.""

Mace spokeswoman Sydney Long said in a statement that securing the grant means a ""major opportunity"" for South Carolina.

She added that the congresswoman has been ""incredibly successful"" in securing grant money, while she's ""always raised concerns about reckless federal spending.""

""But once the money is out the door, she's always fought to bring jobs and investment home to South Carolina,"" said Long. ""Congresswoman Mace has repeatedly stated South Carolina's tax dollars matter just as much as anyone else's. The $285 million grant tied to up to 800 jobs at the Mercedes-Benz Vans plant in North Charleston is a major opportunity for South Carolina.""

Meanwhile, the Energy Department said it's undergoing a department-wide review to determine that all its activities ""follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration's priorities"" and that the administration has a ""mandate"" to restore ""American Energy Dominance.""

Trump, shortly after taking office, signed an executive order to pause the disbursement of funding approved through the Inflation Reduction Act, along with other climate-related money from the bipartisan infrastructure law that was approved earlier in the Biden administration.

Republicans in Congress have supported efforts to rescind the clean energy funds, but Democrats say Trump's fight against clean energy funding is leading GOP lawmakers to hurt their own constituents.

According to an analysis last year by the bipartisan E2 group, roughly 85% of the money unlocked by the 2022 law was invested in Republican districts.

More than a dozen House Republicans have called on the Senate to preserve the clean energy initiatives in the pending legislation, but Mace was not among them.",https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=6a888634-95ce-4d2a-a435-09bd8815de60&SiteName=Newsmax,N,,2025-06-28 14:07:27.991187

Natural gas (NG=F) prices attempted a short-term recovery off the $3.40 floor but continue to face strong headwinds as momentum fades below $3.88. The commodity rebounded 5% to trade around $3.70/MMBtu, yet technical charts show stiff resistance between $3.79 and $3.88. Price remains compressed under the 50-period EMA ($3.79) and 200-period EMA ($3.88), and unless bulls can reclaim the $3.67–$3.76 range, downside pressure is likely to return. The failure to push above these zones opens targets at $3.49 and $3.40.

Canadian Gas Exports Decline While LNG Projects Reshape Regional Flows

Exports from Canada to the Pacific Northwest fell to 3.48 Bcf/d in June — their lowest since January and 0.74 Bcf/d below January’s average. This dip comes amid tepid regional demand and falling spot prices. Northwest Sumas closed May at $1.865/MMBtu and fell to 53 cents in late June, down 45 cents from last summer. In contrast, PG&E Citygate saw a 22-cent increase month-over-month, and its July forward contract is trading 40 cents above June’s average, indicating rising demand. LNG Canada’s Phase 1 startup — set to process 2 Bcf/d — may permanently alter North American gas flows by keeping more Canadian supply inland.

Political Tailwinds: Louisiana's Green Energy Law Shakes Up Narratives

Louisiana reclassified natural gas as green energy, joining Tennessee, Ohio, and Iowa. This follows similar moves in the EU, which recently deemed natural gas and nuclear as sustainable — moves that have sparked backlash from environmental groups but indicate a growing realignment in energy policy. With this designation, the regulatory outlook for natural gas investment may shift further, providing a new tailwind for infrastructure and exploration.

Spot Price Collapse in Northwest Undermines Broader Recovery

Despite the broader bullish tone, regional spot prices in the Pacific Northwest have collapsed. The 10-day average for Sumas gas has hovered near record lows, defying broader demand forecasts. That divergence underscores growing structural dislocation between domestic spot prices and global LNG-driven fundamentals. PG&E Citygate’s resilience, however, shows that California and West Coast hubs may still see firm demand recovery as temperatures rise.

WTI Holds Above Key Trendline With $66 Resistance Capping Rally

WTI crude oil (CL=F) closed near $65.65, rebounding from the $63.98 low after shedding $13 from its $77.17 peak. Price is consolidating under the 200-period EMA ($66.20) and faces overhead resistance at the 23.6% Fib retracement of $67.09. A break above $67.11 could unlock upside toward $69.02, while failure to hold the trendline may result in a test of the $64.00 level. Volatility remains elevated, with $15 weekly swings driven by geopolitical shifts and U.S.–China trade developments.

Brent Struggles Below $69.90 as Traders Await Directional Trigger

Brent crude (BZ=F) remains pinned below $67.91, capped by the 200-period EMA at $68.89. A failed rally toward the 23.6% retracement at $69.93 signals indecision. With resistance holding firm, a close above $69.93 could reignite bullish momentum toward $71.91–$73.52. On the downside, breaking $66.75 exposes $64.96 and lower. The tight consolidation band between $66.72–$69.90 suggests an imminent breakout, but direction hinges on macro catalysts.

Heatwave Demand Surge Balances Against Supply Build

Heatwaves in Maine, Pennsylvania, and India are driving short-term gas demand higher, with utilities relying on natural gas to fuel air conditioning and cooling systems. U.S. storage additions remain elevated, but consumption is accelerating. Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest’s mild start to summer has delayed broader demand pickup, though restocking trends in California hint at Q3 strength.

Norway Expands Supply to EU With Ormen Lange Output Boost

Shell has commissioned two seabed compressors at Norway’s Ormen Lange gas field, increasing recovery rates from 75% to 85% — unlocking up to 50 billion cubic meters of additional supply. This comes amid EU demand for non-Russian gas, with Norway now Europe’s top supplier. Coupled with Balder X and Johan Castberg oilfield expansions, Norway’s production strategy continues to pressure LNG pricing and add to global supply.

Natural Gas Outlook: Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Volatility Ahead

With resistance capped at $3.88 and spot prices collapsing in some U.S. regions, NG=F faces immediate headwinds. However, green energy reclassification, LNG export shifts, heatwave-driven demand, and Norway’s increased EU supply introduce complex, diverging factors. Until price breaks above the $3.88 ceiling with conviction, the trade remains a tactical hold.

Since Puna Geothermal will be downsizing, the Repower Project also will result in more efficiency and a smaller footprint.
Puna Geothermal is currently undergoing an environmental assessment and has been grading the land for the future equipment.","Puna Geothermal Venture’s long-awaited Repower Project was approved by the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission, enabling the plant to increase its electricity production while reducing its emissions footprint and energy costs to customers, the company announced Wednesday.

“Today, we have 12 generating units that have been in service since 1991 or 1993 and are over 30 years old,” Senior Director Michael Kaleikini said during the quarterly update meeting in Pāhoa. “The plan is to install three modern, more efficient generating units, which will replace the 12 that have been here for three decades.”

The three modern units will be able to produce 46 megawatts compared to the 38 megawatts now being produced by the 12 old generating units, he said.

This increase would mean that 68% of electricity on Hawaiʻi Island would come from renewable energy sources. As of 2024, nearly 59% of Hawaiʻi Island’s electricity generation comes from renewable sources.

Puna Geothermal Venture is an energy conversion power plant that utilizes the geothermal energy from volcanic heat stored beneath the Earth’s surface. Underground reservoirs of water heated by volcanic activity can be tapped for steam to generate electricity, which is sold to Hawaiian Electric Co. and distributed to customers on the Big Island.

Hawaiian Electric Co. said with the change in generating units, the average residential customer consuming 500 kilowatt-hours per month will see a $23.62 per month decrease on their electric bill.

Since Puna Geothermal will be downsizing, the Repower Project also will result in more efficiency and a smaller footprint.

“With the improvement to efficiencies, the three units will result in less rotating equipment, which means less noise, and less piping, which results in less potential geothermal emissions,” Kaleikini said. “We have been working on getting this project approval since 2022, and we’re very excited to be able to move ahead. All of it is an improvement.”

In a study that examined the lifecycle emissions for all parts of the expanded project, conducted by the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission, it was determined that the greenhouse gas intensity would be one of the lowest for any renewable energy project in Hawaiʻi.

Puna Geothermal is currently undergoing an environmental assessment and has been grading the land for the future equipment. The plan is to use the new equipment by the end of 2026. Until then, the plant will continue to provide updates during quarterly meetings as the project progresses.",https://cdn.bigislandnow.com/file/bigislandnow/2024/03/Puna-Geothermal-Venture-geothermal-energy-production-water-quality-study-in-lower-Puna-3-16-24-BIN-feature-pic-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 16:06:13.175785

Political uncertainty, largely influenced by proposed tax reforms, is the primary culprit. Ironically, many of the states most affected are Republican-led, which have historically benefited from advancements in renewable energy. This situation highlights the complex interplay between politics and the burgeoning clean energy industry, creating a ripple effect that impacts employment and economic growth across the nation.

Visible Impact on Employment

According to recent analyses, the cancellation of green energy projects has resulted in the loss of 10,000 potential jobs in the renewable sector. These jobs were tied to crucial technologies such as solar, wind, battery storage, and hydrogen energy. For instance, the Kore Power battery plant in Arizona and two electric vehicle production sites by BorgWarner in Michigan have been halted. Additionally, Bosch has put a significant investment of $200 million on hold for a hydrogen fuel cell plant in South Carolina. These projects were not just about job creation; they were integral to advancing sustainable technologies.

The pause on these initiatives underscores the importance of tax credits provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This legislation, passed under the Biden Administration, was designed to support emerging green technologies. However, proposed changes in tax policy threaten to dismantle these incentives, making the future uncertain for many planned and ongoing projects.

Republican States Face Greater Impact

Ironically, Republican-led states and districts are bearing the brunt of these cancellations. More than $12 billion in projects have been affected in these areas, which have seen substantial growth in renewable energy. Over the years, states like Georgia and Tennessee have invested heavily in the battery and electric vehicle supply chains. These investments have not only boosted employment but have also positioned these states as leaders in the clean energy transition.

Yet, the proposed fiscal reforms threaten to halt progress, potentially reversing years of growth and investment. The consequences extend beyond economic setbacks; they could undermine efforts to combat climate change, as these states are pivotal in the national strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The risk of job losses and stalled technological advancements looms large, with potential ripple effects across the broader economy.

The Role of Political Uncertainty

The central issue behind these project cancellations is the proposed tax reform by Republicans in the House of Representatives. This reform aims to dismantle significant portions of the tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act. These credits are vital for sustaining investment in clean technologies. Without them, many companies are reconsidering their commitment to the U.S. market, leading to a re-evaluation of planned projects.

Political uncertainty not only deters investment but also creates a volatile environment for innovation. Companies are less likely to invest in long-term projects if there is a risk that supportive policies could be revoked. This unpredictability may discourage future investments and collaborations, crucial for advancing the country’s renewable energy goals.

The Future of Clean Energy Initiatives

The current situation raises critical questions about the future of clean energy in the United States. While the potential of renewable energy remains vast, the political climate poses significant challenges. The need for bipartisan support in fostering a stable and conducive environment for green investments is more urgent than ever.

As we move forward, it is crucial to consider how policy decisions impact not only the economy but also the environment and society at large. The stakes are high, and the decisions made today will shape the country’s energy landscape for years to come. Will the U.S. manage to overcome these political hurdles and continue its path toward a sustainable future?

A 940-page version of the legislation that they released just after midnight contains key changes from what senators initially put forward. They include the creation of a $25 billion fund to help rural hospitals expected to be hit hard by the Medicaid cuts the legislation would impose, a faster phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects, and an increase in the cap on the state and local tax deduction demanded by lawmakers in the House.

There also appeared to be a number of parochial changes aimed at placating some of the most vocal opponents of the legislation, including several for Alaska, home to Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican who has said the measure would hurt her state.

G.O.P. leaders in the Senate are rushing to shore up support for the legislation so they can quickly pass it and send it to the House for final approval in time to meet the July 4 deadline Mr. Trump has set. An initial vote in the Senate could come later on Saturday.

Party leaders are trying to appease two flanks of their conference. Some, including Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, said they could not support it without greater reassurances that the Medicaid cuts it contains would not hurt rural hospitals in their states. And fiscal hawks like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, have said they do not want to back legislation that would only increase the deficit.

The core of the bill remains the same. It would extend tax cuts passed by Republicans in 2017 and add some new ones President Trump campaigned on, while slashing spending on safety-net programs, including Medicaid and food assistance. The biggest tax cuts and the biggest changes to those anti-poverty programs remained intact. Taken together, the bill would likely increase federal debt by more than $3 trillion over the next decade, though lawmakers are still shaping the bill and waiting on an official estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.

With Mr. Trump demanding quick action, Republicans in Congress have intensified their efforts to push it through to enactment even as many of them — including several who voted for it in the House — have been open about their reservations about a measure they are concerned could be a political loser.

It is unclear whether a $25 billion compensation fund will be enough to win their votes. Ms. Collins had suggested that she wanted to provide as much as $100 billion to ensure that rural hospitals, which operate on thin margins, were not adversely affected.

A new provision allowing “individuals in a noncontiguous state” to be exempt from enforcing new work requirements imposed on SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, appeared aimed at mollifying Ms. Murkowski of Alaska. Her state would be hit with billions of dollars in nutrition assistance costs as a result of the legislation, and she had cited the provision as one of her chief concerns. The bill also includes new health provisions designed to benefit Alaska, as well as new tax benefits for fishers in the state’s waters.

Some of the changes were aimed at appealing to members of the House, where Republicans from high-tax states like New York have threatened to sink the bill if it does not include a substantial increase in the state and local tax deduction, currently capped at $10,000. Senate Republicans, skeptical of the deduction, still ultimately decided to match the House plan to lift the cap to $40,000. But while the House made the increase permanent, the Senate keeps it for only five years, allowing it to snap back to $10,000 in 2030.

The newest draft makes even sharper cuts to subsidies for wind and solar power, something that Mr. Trump and other conservatives had explicitly called for this week. It remains to be seen whether those changes could cause friction with Republicans who have publicly supported green-energy credits, including Mr. Tillis, Ms. Murkowski and Senator John Curtis of Utah.

The bill would also impose additional taxes on renewable energy projects that receive “material assistance” from China, even if they don’t qualify for the credit. Because China dominates global supply chains, those new fees could affect a large number of projects.

The new Senate measure would more quickly end tax credits for electric vehicles, doing away with them by Sept. 30. It would also slow the phaseout of a lucrative tax credit to make hydrogen fuels, allowing such projects to qualify if construction were started by the end of 2027, instead of by the end of this year.

The bill also includes a provision written by Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, to sell as much as 1.225 million acres of federal land across the American West in order to build housing. Earlier versions of that proposal that would have auctioned off even more acreage had drawn fierce opposition from conservative hunters and outdoorsmen, and Republican senators from Montana and Idaho had said they would not vote for it.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/28/multimedia/28dc-reconciliation-zgpv/28dc-reconciliation-zgpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 12:13:26.964843

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, June 27, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- It has been one year since updates to the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen Title 24) were released on July 1, 2024. Last year's update requires new hotels to equip 50% of parking lots with EV charging infrastructure. However, given the time these development projects take, we have yet to witness the full impact of these stringent new electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure mandates. The updates specifically require new hotels and motels to equip 40% of parking spaces with EV-ready infrastructure, using either standard outlets or Level 2 chargers, and provide Level 2 chargers for the remaining 10% of parking spaces. Further increases anticipated in 2026 add significant urgency for developers and hotel operators looking to stay competitive in EV hotspots.

Consumer trends strongly support these mandates. In regions such as Santa Clara County, EV adoption rates have surpassed 40%. With the growing popularity of electric vehicles, guest expectations for accessible, reliable EV charging options are becoming critical, influencing hotel selection and satisfaction.

A recently opened hotel near Sacramento’s Exposition Blvd, permitted under the older 2019 code, underscores a regulatory gap. Despite its 180 rooms, this property provides only 12 EV charging spots, far fewer than the roughly 90 spaces mandated under current 2024 standards. In a recent email thread city building officials recognize this gap between previously approved projects and current EV requirements, emphasizing urgency for hotels planning new developments to quickly align with updated regulations.

Meeting these requirements with current popular solutions, such as what is recommended by flagship brands introduces substantial financial and logistical burdens astraditional Level 2 chargers typically cost between $3,000 and $4,000 per port. Besides significant upfront expenses, these charging stations require ongoing maintenance, including cable replacements and inspections. Maintenance issues can negatively affect guest experiences, creating dissatisfaction hotels strive to avoid.

To mitigate these challenges, hotels are exploring Alternative EV Supply Equipment (Alternative EVSE). This category includes smart outlets enabling guests to utilize personal portable chargers. These solutions significantly reduce costs, simplify installation, and minimize maintenance. Despite clear advantages, smart outlets face regulatory hurdles from California’s Department of Food and Agriculture’s Division of Measurement Standards (CDFA-DMS). Without certification allowing resale of metered electricity, adoption remains limited, creating substantial barriers to implementation.

San Jose-based startup Evolve Energy is developing smart outlet-based EV charging technology tailored specifically for the hospitality sector. The company plans to initiate a pilot project in summer 2025, aiming to refine its solution into a fully compliant, scalable product suited to hospitality operators' unique needs. To accelerate development and address the existing technology gap in hospitality EV charging infrastructure, Evolve Energy anticipates raising a funding round in late summer 2025.California’s building codes provide flexibility, allowing hotels to substitute five Level 2 chargers with one Level 3 charger. However, Level 3 chargers, costing 20 to 30 times more than Level 2 chargers, rarely align with typical overnight guest charging behaviors. Thus, practical application remains limited, emphasizing the need for scalable, economically feasible charging options.

Hilton’s recent industry trends report highlights the pressing nature of EV infrastructure demands. Competition and market dynamics further illustrate this importance. A JD Power survey found 19% of hotel guests actively seek EV charging availability, significantly influencing booking decisions. Currently, 30% of U.S. hotels provide EV charging: approximately 90% of luxury hotels, 58% of full-service hotels, and just 20% of limited-service properties. Hotels offering EV infrastructure report increased guest loyalty and new revenue streams tied to charger availability, pressuring those without EV chargers to quickly adapt or risk losing competitiveness.

As California accelerates its electrification agenda, hospitality providers must swiftly adapt. The challenge is no longer deciding whether to provide EV infrastructure but how to implement solutions affordably, effectively, and without negatively impacting guest experiences. Travelers should anticipate increased availability of alternative solutions such as smart EV outlets in hotel parking facilities and pack their mobile chargers for convenience.

The new resources added to the grid since last summer’s end, namely utility-scale solar and battery storage, have bolstered reliability as summer power demand ramps up, Vegas said.
Last year, solar and battery storage installation led capacity growth within ERCOT, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
For multiple days in June, renewables met more than half of the state’s peak energy demand.
Of the roughly 400 gigawatts of capacity accounted for in those requests, about 40 percent each are batteries and solar.","The ever-increasing demand for power in Texas—not only from data centers, but due to industrial electrification, manufacturing and population expansion—has outpaced anything the state’s electricity grid operator has seen or managed in the past, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Yet even with those demands—and most of what could be one of the state’s 10 hottest summers on record ahead—ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas predicts the lowest chance of power supply emergencies in years.

Last year, the risk of grid emergencies during the summer peak risk hour ending around 9 p.m. was 16 percent. This year, ERCOT reports, it’s fallen to less than 1 percent.

The new resources added to the grid since last summer’s end, namely utility-scale solar and battery storage, have bolstered reliability as summer power demand ramps up, Vegas said.

The addition of more than 9,600 megawatts of capacity to the state’s grid since last summer, coupled with conservative operations and reliable management, has produced this result, Vegas said at an ERCOT board of directors meeting this week.

“The state of the grid is strong, it is reliable—it is as reliable as it has ever been and it is as ready for the challenges of extreme weather,” Vegas said. “I feel confident that we are ready for this upcoming summer season.”

Of the new capacity added, 5,395 megawatts came from solar, 3,821 megawatts from energy storage and 253 megawatts from wind power. Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice president of system planning and weatherization, said the risk of emergency as the sun goes down and Texans continue to pump their air conditioners has been greatly reduced due to the large contributions from solar and battery storage.

“That does put us in a better position to get over those evening ramps as we go into late summer,” Hobbs said.

In the same time frame of the solar and storage additions, there’s been a net loss of natural gas capacity. Retirements, deactivations and derates, or a loss of available capacity, of gas plants resulted in a reduced capacity of 366 megawatts on the grid since last summer.

Last year, solar and battery storage installation led capacity growth within ERCOT, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Renewable energy continues to make up a record-breaking share of the grid’s mix during peak demand. For multiple days in June, renewables met more than half of the state’s peak energy demand.

Nonetheless, some conservative lawmakers unsuccessfully sought to curb the expansion of renewable energy in the state Legislature. Meanwhile, a $5 billion addition to the Texas Energy Fund, a low-interest loan program that incentivizes the development of gas-fueled power plants, passed this session and has been signed into law.

On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that the first finalized loan from the fund will support a 122 megawatt gas plant in Colorado County. The facility, backed by the 20-year loan of up to $105 million with 3 percent interest, is set to begin operations in June 2027.

There’s more solar and batteries on the horizon. The bulk of interest in ERCOT’s growing queue of generation interconnection requests comes from the two renewable energy sources, Hobbs said. Of the roughly 400 gigawatts of capacity accounted for in those requests, about 40 percent each are batteries and solar. About 10 percent are wind and a little less are gas.

Short term, the added capacity is beneficial, Vegas said. But in the long run, figuring out how to balance the growing supply resources on the grid with the state’s shrinking number of natural gas power plants continues to be a significant concern.

The sharp drop in chances of grid emergencies is also credited to changes in how the grid operator projects demand. The agency’s staff had previously relied on metrics that many saw as unrealistic, as a state law required ERCOT to consider facilities that had yet to sign power connection contracts in its projections.

These emergency-event risk predictions also run on the assumptions that things happen the way they’re meant to, said ERCOT meteorologist Chris Coleman. They assume, for example, that certain large loads are flexible, turning off when the price for power is too high or when there’s too much demand on the grid and batteries are available during tight supply times.

Above-normal temperatures contribute to the significant load growth ERCOT is expecting. The forecasted summer peak load is 87.5 gigawatts, or 2 gigawatts more than the peak demand of recent years.

The past three summers in Texas have been three of the six hottest summers on record, dating back to 1895. While 2011 was the hottest year, 2023 was the second hottest and 2022 the third. Last summer was the sixth-hottest on record: Austin had 32 days exceeding 100 degrees and San Antonio and Dallas both topped 20.

Climate change is driving more weather extremes, including worse heat, in Texas and around the globe.

Coleman expects 2025 to rank among the 10 hottest summers in state history. This year was slated to rival the summers of 2011 and 2023, but late-spring rain minimized that concern.

As temperatures continue to increase, temperature records that would have been regarded as above normal in the past have now fallen back on the list, creating challenges for ERCOT forecasters when determining what to make of summer temperatures.

“What we consider normal,” Coleman said, “that bar keeps going up.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2173339688-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 12:14:27.007643

“We are bringing laundry production to our global headquarters in Louisville because manufacturing in the U.S. is fundamental to our ‘zero-distance’ business strategy to make appliances as close as possible to our customers and consumers,” GE Appliances President and CEO Kevin Nolan said in a statement.

“This decision is our most recent product reshoring and aligns with the current economic and policy environment,” Nolan said, adding that the investment “positions” GE “to become the biggest American washer manufacturer.”

The announcement comes amid President Donald Trump using tariffs on a host of countries, including China, to help restore what he views as fair trade, American manufacturing, and also address national security issues, like illegal immigration and fentanyl.

Additionally, under Trump, inflation has cooled and gas prices have hit a four-year low.

GE’s Appliance Park, a massive industrial complex located in Louisville, already employs around 8,000 workers, the company said. Additionally, GE has invested $3.5 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the past ten years.

“This investment will move production of more than 15 models of front load washers to Building 2 at Appliance Park – bringing the total area of clothes care production to the equivalent of 33 football fields,” a statement from the company said.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, praised the move from GE.

“Today’s announcement further secures Louisville as the global headquarters of GE Appliances, a Haier company, and brings more world-class, unparalleled appliance manufacturing back to the United States,” he said in a statement on Thursday.

“This new investment strengthens one of our vital Kentucky assets and underscores our state’s reputation as America’s destination of choice for advanced manufacturing and job creation,” he added.

A number of companies have committed to investing in the U.S. since Trump took office, including South Korean-based car manufacturer Hyundai, which is investing $21 billion in U.S. onshoring, including a $5.8 billion steel plant in Louisiana.

The company reported a 27% increase in year-on-year electricity consumption as it struggles to decarbonise as quickly as its energy needs increase.
The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to 1,000TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, approximately Japan’s level of electricity demand.
In 2024, 25 of these came online to add 2.5GW of new clean energy to its operations.
It was also a record year for clean energy deals, with the company signing contracts for 8GW.","Google’s carbon emissions have soared by 51% since 2019 as artificial intelligence hampers the tech company’s efforts to go green.

While the corporation has invested in renewable energy and carbon removal technology, it has failed to curb its scope 3 emissions, which are those further down the supply chain, and are in large part influenced by a growth in datacentre capacity required to power artificial intelligence.

The company reported a 27% increase in year-on-year electricity consumption as it struggles to decarbonise as quickly as its energy needs increase.

Datacentres play a crucial role in training and operating the models that underpin AI models such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4, which powers the ChatGPT chatbot. The International Energy Agency estimates that datacentres’ total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to 1,000TWh (terawatt hours) in 2026, approximately Japan’s level of electricity demand. AI will result in datacentres using 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, according to calculations by the research firm SemiAnalysis.

The report also raises concerns that the rapid evolution of AI may drive “non-linear growth in energy demand”, making future energy needs and emissions trajectories more difficult to predict.

Another issue Google highlighted is lack of progress on new forms of low-carbon electricity generation. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), miniature nuclear plants that are supposed to be quick and easy to build and get on the grid, have been hailed as a way to decarbonise datacentres. There were hopes that areas with many datacentres could have one or more SMR and that would reduce the huge carbon footprint from the electricity used by these datacentres, which are more in demand due to AI use.

The report said these were behind schedule: “A key challenge is the slower-than-needed deployment of carbon-free energy technologies at scale, and getting there by 2030 will be very difficult. While we continue to invest in promising technologies like advanced geothermal and SMRs, their widespread adoption hasn’t yet been achieved because they’re early-stage, relatively costly, and poorly incentivised by current regulatory structures.”

It added that scope 3 remained a “challenge”, as Google’s total ambition-based emissions were 11.5m tons of CO₂-equivalent gases, representing an 11% year-over-year increase and a 51% increase compared with the 2019 base year. This was “primarily driven by increases in supply chain emissions” and scope 3 emissions increased by 22% in 2024.

Google is racing to buy clean energy to power its systems, and since 2010, the company has signed more than 170 agreements to purchase over 22 gigawatts of clean energy. In 2024, 25 of these came online to add 2.5GW of new clean energy to its operations. It was also a record year for clean energy deals, with the company signing contracts for 8GW.

The company has met one of its environmental targets early: eliminating plastic packaging. Google announced today that packaging for new Google products launched and manufactured in 2024 was 100% plastic-free. Its goal was to achieve this by the end of 2025.

In the report, the company also said AI could have a “net positive potential” on climate, because it hoped the emissions reductions enabled by AI applications would be greater than the emissions generated by the AI itself, including its energy consumption from datacentres.

Google is aiming to help individuals, cities and other partners collectively reduce 1GT (gigaton) of their carbon-equivalent emissions annually by 2030 using AI products. These can, for example, help predict energy use and therefore reduce wastage, and map the solar potential of buildings so panels are put in the right place and generate the maximum electricity.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/121f66176ac5e2d28c15f33d8dc3818937b584d1/917_0_4583_3667/master/4583.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2cc98b1f2aa920968528f269bec7a761,N,,2025-06-28 13:12:42.013641

Opened in 1967, Bull Run was the lone single-generator coal-fired plant in the TVA system.
How will the Bull Run smokestacks come down?
Since the decommissioning of Bull Run, TVA has been taking the facility apart and readying it for what’s next.","The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to implode the iconic smokestacks at its Bull Run coal-fired power plant.

Assuming the weather cooperates, the smokestacks will come down June 28.

Bull Run was opened in 1967 and the smokestacks became synonymous with Claxton.

The site will be used for two projects: one to stabilize the power supply and one to build a nuclear fusion power plant.

Residents in Claxton have known for years their skyline was going to change. That day has finally come.

Early June 28, weather permitting, the Tennessee Valley Authority intends to implode the giant smokestacks that have towered over the Bull Run Fossil Plant for generations.

The TVA board voted to close the plant in 2019, and it was decommissioned in 2023. Now the most iconic part of it will come down.

Opened in 1967, Bull Run was the lone single-generator coal-fired plant in the TVA system. Its 500- and 800-foot smokestacks are now symbols of a bygone era. The taller stack is original to the plant. The shorter scrubber stack was completed in 2008.

It was those smokestacks that became synonymous with Claxton, and they’re the reason people were stopping to take photos this week at the lookout off Edgemoor Road.

The smokestacks served as a emblem to the region of TVA’s power, both in jobs and industry.

They also served as a reminder of the coal ash the plant produced and how the waste product from burning coal became infamous after the disastrous 2008 spill at the Kingston coal-fired plant. A billion gallons of coal ash slurry were poured across the land 22 miles to the southwest, requiring a massive cleanup that in turn sparked a protracted legal fight initiated by cleanup workers who said they were sickened by the coal ash.

Making history, both good and bad

When it went online, Bull Run was the largest power generator in the world by volume of steam produced and outperformed the largest units of its time by 50%. The $140 million price tag − $1.4 billion in today’s dollars – was remarkable.

But the 800-foot chimney was built without a scrubber. Before regulations were put in place to clean the emissions, coal ash routinely rained down on Claxton. The community built a playground on it. Coal ash contains heavy metals and poisonous elements, each posing its own level of health concerns, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

TVA aims to retire all its coal plants by 2035, the agency's website says. Four coal-fired plants remain in TVA's fleet, including the Kingston Fossil Plant. At its peak in 1985, TVA's coal fleet included 12 sites.

How will the Bull Run smokestacks come down?

Since the decommissioning of Bull Run, TVA has been taking the facility apart and readying it for what’s next. The implosion is the next step.

The buildup to the operation involved advanced computer modeling, said spokesperson Tom Satkowiak. Engineers know which way they will fall (to the south, away from Edgemoor Road).

Dynamite has been rigged throughout the stacks in places that will take out structural integrity, Satkowiak said. Gravity will do the rest.

Along with the stacks, TVA will be taking down the Selective Catalytic Reduction building, a five-story steel structure next to the stacks. The main building – the one with “Bull Run Fossil Plant” written on the side – will remain.

What's coming to the Bull Run site next?

Plans for the campus are twofold. What becomes of the rest of the 750-acre site has not been determined.

To start, TVA will reuse portions of the plant to develop the utility’s first synchronous condenser operation, which generates or absorbs power in real time to help keep the grid stable for the region. TVA plans to start the condenser program in 2027.

The project will “keep a high inertial mass on the system,” said TVA Senior Manager of Construction Management Andrew Campbell, a process he admits is confusing.

“But if anybody's ever been at a tailgate and the generator bogs down when you plug too much into it, sure (this will) kind of help prevent that,” he said.

The second project is the planned world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant, to be built by Type One Energy, a Knoxville-based company.

The fusion power plant design uses powerful magnetic fields to contain plasma heated to around 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, according to six peer-reviewed scholarly papers the company published earlier this year. The machine is called a stellarator.

Type One Energy, which was founded in 2019, has not built a stellarator under the company name. It plans to begin constructing a prototype called Infinity One at Bull Run in 2026. But the company’s scientists have built and run experimental stellarators like the one planned around the world, including the world's largest and most powerful stellarator, the Wendelstein 7-X in Germany.

The company says the work will create 300 jobs, though it likely won't be operational until the 2030s.

BLM released the following about the project:

The Bureau of Land Management approved several major energy projects across the West — including a natural gas pipeline in Montana and three geothermal energy projects in Nevada — that will strengthen America’s energy supply and create jobs in local communities. These projects mark important progress in expanding both traditional and renewable energy infrastructure on public lands.

“Approving these projects reflects our commitment to strengthening America’s energy independence,” said BLM Acting Director Bill Groffy. “By responsibly developing energy resources on public lands, we’re helping to secure a reliable, diverse energy future for the nation while supporting jobs and local economies.”

In Montana, the BLM approved NorthWestern Energy’s proposal to construct the 74-mile Helena to Three Forks natural gas pipeline through an accelerated 14-day environmental review process, which is being used in response to the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump.

The pipeline route includes approximately nine miles of BLM-managed public lands and will follow an existing utility corridor to minimize new ground disturbance and ecological disruption. Construction of the 16-inch buried pipeline will occur in phases between spring 2026 and fall 2029. Preparatory activities, including increased survey traffic and engineering assessments, are expected to begin in 2025.

In addition to the Helena to Three Forks pipeline, the BLM has also approved three geothermal energy projects under an expedited timeline in Nevada that support the administration’s goals for energy development on public lands:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada): Ormat Technologies plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased lands to assess the commercial viability of the geothermal reservoir.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada): This project will upgrade and expand three existing geothermal power plants. Enhancements include new production wells, advanced heat exchangers, upgraded cooling fans, and the addition of a 15-megawatt solar photovoltaic field—aimed at improving overall efficiency and increasing output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada): Ormat will conduct exploratory drilling and geothermal resource evaluation on BLM-managed lands to determine the potential for future power generation.

These approvals align with BLM’s broader mission to support responsible energy development on public lands. Through strategic permitting, land stewardship, and environmental safeguards, BLM helps ensure a reliable domestic energy supply and reduces dependence on foreign resources. The BLM also plays a critical role in overseeing the extraction of essential minerals on federally managed lands, which are vital for sectors ranging from clean energy technologies to national defense.",https://nbcmontana.com/resources/media2/16x9/3079/986/665x0/90/7da6a73d-a0f1-4ffb-aa1f-d751ffddceb9-ButtePipelineMTDKs.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 11:07:06.414242

Here's a look at 15 notable new laws, in alphabetical order, Hoosiers may want to know: Cigarette tax — The state tax on cigarettes increases by $2 per pack, to a total of $3 per pack, to boost funding for Indiana Medicaid and other health programs.
(SEA 209) Emissions testing — The Indiana Department of Environmental Management must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ambient air quality in Northwest Indiana no later than Dec. 31, 2025.
All Indiana sheriffs, deputies and local police officers must also cooperate with ICE on all federal immigration enforcement matters.
(SEA 287) Sports commission — A 17-member Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Commission is established.","A total of 243 new Indiana laws were approved this year by the Republican-controlled General Assembly and enacted by Republican Gov. Mike Braun, mostly during the months of April and May.

While a few statutes, or portions of them, took effect immediately, such as Senate Enrolled Act (SEA) 1, adjusting numerous residential and business property tax provisions, and House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1390, banning all marijuana product advertising, the bulk of the new state laws — as usual — take effect July 1.

Here's a look at 15 notable new laws, in alphabetical order, Hoosiers may want to know:

Cigarette tax — The state tax on cigarettes increases by $2 per pack, to a total of $3 per pack, to boost funding for Indiana Medicaid and other health programs. Similar tax increases apply to cigars and other tobacco products, as well as vaping supplies and equipment. (HEA 1001)

College athletics — Transgender women are barred from women's sports teams at all public and private universities in Indiana that participate in interscholastic competitions against state schools, as well as girls' sports teams at all public and private elementary, middle and high schools. A student who is ""deprived of an athletic opportunity"" or ""otherwise directly or indirectly injured"" by a transgender woman participating in women's collegiate athletics can file a grievance and civil lawsuit against the university. (HEA 1041)

Data centers — A company that's 50% owned by a foreign adversary nation, or headquartered there, still may construct a data center in the state if it proves to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the Indiana Economic Development Corp. that the data center's anticipated electricity use will be self-generated and not affect the load supply of the state's electrical grids. The countries currently designated as foreign adversaries are China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and the Maduro regime in Venezuela. (SEA 431)

E-pull tabs — Eligible veterans and fraternal organizations can supplement their paper pull tab charitable gambling games with a limited number of electronic pull tab machines located in their primary meeting facility. The law requires e-pull tab players to manually open each row on every ticket by touching the screen or a button, no gameplay imagery can mimic a slot machine or casino table game and the winnings associated with any bonus feature must equal the value of the prize predetermined when the ticket was purchased. (SEA 209)

Emissions testing — The Indiana Department of Environmental Management must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ambient air quality in Northwest Indiana no later than Dec. 31, 2025. It is then required to identify strategies to reduce the Region's air pollution and remove it from the Chicagoland region for federal air quality assessment purposes in the hope of ending vehicle emissions testing in Lake and Porter counties. (SEA 103)

Gun crimes — The Indiana Gun Crimes Task Force, a specialized organization focused on reducing violent crime and bringing criminals to justice by tracing the firearms used in crimes in central Indiana and the Fort Wayne area, is expanding to Lake County to try to lower the number of violent homicides and gun crimes occurring in the Region. (HEA 1095)

Highway tolls — The governor can seek federal approval to charge tolls for the use of all interstate highways in Indiana without any further action by the General Assembly. A statutory protection for Northwest Indiana motorists that required the first new toll lanes in the state be located at least 75 miles away from the Indiana Toll Road is eliminated — opening the door to tolls on Interstate 80/94 and Interstate 65. (HEA 1461)

Illegal immigrants — County sheriffs must proactively notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement any time they have reason to believe a person not lawfully present in the United States is detained at the county jail. All Indiana sheriffs, deputies and local police officers must also cooperate with ICE on all federal immigration enforcement matters. (HEA 1393)

Illinois annexation — An 11-member Indiana-Illinois Boundary Adjustment Commission is established to discuss and recommend whether the boundary between the state of Indiana and the state of Illinois should be adjusted. Indiana’s governor must appoint six members to the commission who can meet and discuss the issue of Indiana incorporating secessionist portions of central and southern Illinois even if Illinois' governor declines to name the five commissioners allocated to his state. (HEA 1008)

Income tax — The 3% state income tax rate, already set to fall to 2.9% in 2027, automatically will decline by another 0.05% in 2030, and every even-numbered year through 2042, if state revenue grows on a year-over-year basis by at least 3.5% in each of the preceding four state budget years and also is projected to hit that growth target in the current budget year. Indiana's income tax rate would be among the lowest in the country for states that impose an income tax if all the potential rate reductions are implemented. (SEA 451)

Nuclear power — Indiana's investor-owned utilities may immediately pass along to ratepayers up to 80% of their costs to develop, or even just contemplate, small modular nuclear reactors — regardless of whether a utility ever actually constructs or operates one — subject to approval by the governor-appointed Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. (SEA 424)

Obscene performance — Any person living anywhere has legal standing to seek injunctive relief, attorney's fees, court costs and ""other reasonable expenses"" if they file a lawsuit claiming an Indiana governmental entity, including a public school or library, knowingly or intentionally organized or hosted an obscene performance, or used any taxpayer dollars to fund an obscene performance. (HEA 1014)

Referendums — School funding referendums and other local public questions only may be posed to voters on a general election ballot, typically alongside races for national, state and local elected offices, to ensure the greatest number of Hoosier voters participate. (SEA 1)

School boards — School board candidates may include their political party affiliation on the ballot without having to compete and win the party's nomination in a primary election, putting a potentially unlimited number of school board hopefuls on the general election ballot as either a Republican, Democratic, Independent or nonpartisan candidate. School board members also can vote to increase their own pay to $4,500 a year, up from $2,000. (SEA 287)

Sports commission — A 17-member Northwest Indiana Professional Sports Development Commission is established. It’s tasked with studying the possibility of attracting the Chicago Bears, or another major professional sports team, to Northwest Indiana, along with developing a master plan for doing so in order to promote economic development, create jobs, attract tourists and improve educational opportunities in the Region. (HEA 1292)

Andrew McKenzie, Commercial Leader for Consultancy UK&I at Schneider Electric, said: “This collaboration offers a valuable opportunity to support commercial and industrial clients in boosting operational resilience and achieving net zero goals.
The collaboration brings together Schneider Electric’s consultancy that helps organisations to map infrastructure and unlock sustainability opportunities, Signify’s connected lighting and Pineapple Partnerships’ systems-change consultancy.
A number of energy solutions are being implemented at its Clevedon, UK manufacturing site to reduce energy consumption and emissions.
Chris Adams, Site Manager for Edwards Vacuum in Clevedon, says: “Working with Pineapple Partnerships has been a game-changer in accelerating our factory’s carbon reduction efforts.","The buildings and construction sector is responsible for 37% of global emissions according to the UN Environment Programme.

They use a significant amount of energy in operation and the manufacturing of construction materials like cement is often carbon intensive.

Schneider Electric, Signify and Pineapple Partnerships have launched Pineapple CoRE, a collaboration designed to accelerate decarbonisation across the commercial and industrial property sector.

While initially focussed on the UK, it could be scaled for global deployment.

Andrew McKenzie, Commercial Leader for Consultancy UK&I at Schneider Electric, said: “This collaboration offers a valuable opportunity to support commercial and industrial clients in boosting operational resilience and achieving net zero goals.

“We will provide a clear roadmap for those facing aging infrastructure, rising energy costs and the need to modernise, helping them build a more efficient, optimised and safer estate.”

What is Pineapple CoRE?

The collaboration brings together Schneider Electric’s consultancy that helps organisations to map infrastructure and unlock sustainability opportunities, Signify’s connected lighting and Pineapple Partnerships’ systems-change consultancy.

Common barriers to decarbonisation include access to finance, fragmented supply chains and skills shortages, so the businesses aim to work together to address these.

Rupert Snuggs, Managing Director at CoRE, says: “We are delighted to work with our world leading collaborators Signify, Schneider Electric and Atlas Copco as we take the first step on our journey to accelerating the decarbonisation of the built environment by rapidly decarbonising more than 1m buildings in the coming years.”

Pineapple CoRE in action

Edwards Vacuum, part of the Atlas Copco Group, is the first organisation to use this partnership.

A number of energy solutions are being implemented at its Clevedon, UK manufacturing site to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

These include:

Deployment of a digital twin by Schneider Electric for real-time energy performance modelling

A new solar PV installation

LED lighting upgrades and IoT-based controls by Signify

Financing to accelerate capital investment by Pineapple Partnerships

The partnership says that these measures aim to reduce energy consumption by 35% and emissions by more than 80%.

Chris Adams, Site Manager for Edwards Vacuum in Clevedon, says: “Working with Pineapple Partnerships has been a game-changer in accelerating our factory’s carbon reduction efforts.

“Their expert assessment of our energy performance has enabled data-driven decisions, including the transition from gas heating to air source heat pumps and the installation of solar panels across our factory roof.

“The collaboration they’ve facilitated with experts such as Signify and Schneider Electric has significantly shortened our learning curve, allowing us to explore and implement best-in-class solutions with confidence.”

Nico van der Merwe, Cluster Leader for Europe West at Signify, says: “Signify thrives on partnerships, and CoRE is a powerful example of how collaborations can unlock decarbonisation at scale.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/2d4b39b266047c9f3642f5e1116909ba:164ed603ce7066ae395d9dc4c3275b9f/cms.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 13:12:45.512276

Epitome Energy is proposing building a $500 million soybean crush plant on the far northwest side of Grand Forks off 70th Avenue North.
Epitome received a key air permit from the state in June 2024, a key milestone to moving the project forward.","GRAND FORKS – Epitome Energy CEO Dennis Egan hopes to still begin construction this year and says new biofuel standards announced by the Environmental Protection Agency have prompted new confidence in the project.

“Announcements of those two federal policies have given the equity investors some guidance and confidence in terms of what this industry will look like moving forward,” Egan said. “We have had a number of discussions with project partners over (the first half of June) and we’re making some really good progress on identifying the right partners.”

Egan told the Grand Forks Herald that he is in conversations with several investors about the project to get it off the ground this year. Economic uncertainties, the mood of investors and delays in securing necessary environmental permits had previously delayed the project.

Egan said that since the last election, investors have become more receptive to the project due to the uncertainties a change of presidential administrations posed for environmental and economic policy for biofuels. Continued support from both the city of Grand Forks and the state also has solidified the project, Egan said.

The new biofuel standards are an increase to the renewable volume obligations for biofuel blends from the EPA. There is also a proposed extension of the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit being proposed as part of the next federal budget. The standards, combined with strong prices in the soybean oil market, have provided ""certainty,"" Egan said, especially in the path forward for the project.

“(Soybean oil prices) are the strongest they’ve been for probably four or five years, and so fundamentally, that just is a great indicator for projects like ours,” he said.

Epitome Energy is proposing building a $500 million soybean crush plant on the far northwest side of Grand Forks off 70th Avenue North. Epitome received a key air permit from the state in June 2024, a key milestone to moving the project forward. The project has previously received support from the state through grants, according to Agweek.

The facility is projected to be able to process 42 million bushels of soybeans into soybean oil, hulls and meal. The beans will come from farms across northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota.

As Eptiome continues development on the project, the city is moving forward with road improvements along 70th Avenue North. A $3.2 million grant from the Federal Economic Development Administration will help pay for the improvements. The grant stems from a 2023 major disaster declaration from an ice storm that year. The dollars are intended to support economic recovery.

Even though Epitome has not begun construction, the city has decided to move forward with the reconstruction of 70th Avenue North into an urban road. The $3.2 million from the EDA required a roughly $800,000 match

“We’re moving forward with it just in the eventuality that something’s going to end up out there,” Assistant City Engineer Christian Danielson told the Grand Forks City Council on June 9.

Funding for the road improvements had always been less clear, as there hadn’t been direct funding sources from the state like there are for water and sewer infrastructure, the city has said in the past.

If they are built, Grand Forks could see upwards of a billion dollars in agricultural processing facilities in the next five years between Epitome’s project and Agristo’s proposed potato processing plant on a site that once was the location for the planned Fufeng corn mill, which later fell through before construction began.

“Solidifying the old Fufeng site, and then for us to be on the heels of that, both projects are in that $500-plus million range, so it’s an exciting time for value-added ag in Grand Forks,” Egan said.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/6db3873/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1667+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fgrandforksherald%2Fbinary%2Fcopy%2F9a%2F7c%2Ff0da95464640036e729171ff2767%2F939391-630jkcover5-binary-1122003.JPG,N,,2025-06-28 13:13:37.308651

SABR Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) is a coalition of stakeholders that have invested in building out America's first advanced biofuel — biodiesel.","ALEXANDRIA, Va., June 27, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- NATSO, representing truck stops and travel centers, American Trucking Associations (ATA), Association of American Railroads (AAR), National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), National Energy & Fuels Institute, Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR), and SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers, commended the Senate Finance Committee for its tax reform package that would establish equal tax treatment for all advanced biofuels.

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation would modify the '45Z' Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to restore tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. Modifying '45Z' to be technology-neutral marks a critical step in revitalizing U.S. biofuel production, which has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO and SIGMA. ""Importantly, this provision reduces the overall cost of the '45Z' tax credit while also incentivizing more over the road fuel production – helping to lower prices for consumers. A win for everyone.""

""A level playing field for sustainable aviation fuels versus over-the-road biofuels is critical to restoring the biodiesel market,"" said Matt Durand, NACS Deputy General Counsel. ""Today, the biodiesel market is failing due to tax policy. Unless we act to ensure biodiesel is no longer disadvantaged, the market may never recover. NACS strongly supports the Section '45Z' parity proposal and urges the Senate to retain it.""

The Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a higher tax credit of up to $1.75 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. The higher aviation fuel tax credit signed into law by President Biden, coupled with the expiration of the Biodiesel Blenders' Tax Credit at the end of 2024, has decimated America's advanced biofuel supply chains.

Equal tax treatment between alternative biofuels represents a significant step toward the much-needed certainty that will encourage biofuel production and consumption. SAF is more costly than biodiesel and renewable diesel and results in the production of less gallons of overall fuel. Under the Senate legislation, SAF would have access to the same credit as all other fuels and producers will be able to gravitate toward the most efficient fuels in the market.

Kia is currently incentivizing the facelifted, Tesla plug-equipped 2025 EV6 by $3,000 with Customer Cash across all trims in addition to the $7,500 federal EV credit, which it now receives for purchasing because it's built in the United States.

With the discounts together and the requisite destination fees, the EV6 starts at $33,875 in the Light configuration and caps off at $49,875 with the top-tier GT-Line AWD model. (The performance-focused Kia EV6 GT will only get a $7,500 tax credit when leased, as it is still built in South Korea.)

The larger three-row EV9 is seeing a $4,000 Customer Cash discount for 2026 models, as well as the EV tax credit; it too is now built in the U.S. These discounts shave the 2026 EV9’s effective starting price down to $44,895, including destination fees. Current Kia owners, and anyone who can show they were shopping for a competitive vehicle, can secure another $1,000 off.

For those who would rather not purchase outright, the 2026 EV9 Wind AWD has a $459 monthly lease special that's good for 24 months—though it requires buyers to cough up a steep $4,999 upfront.

But are Kia’s electric SUVs worthwhile options with the recent discounts?

The Kia EV6: Now Effectively Starting At $33,875

The Kia EV6 launched into the US market for the 2022 model year. It has proven to be a great all-around option with excellent charging capabilities and impressive efficiency. It comes in many different trim levels: Light RWD, Light Long Range, Wind, GT-Line, and GT AWD. The Light Long Range, Wind, and GT-Line are available with both rear- and all-wheel-drive motor setups.

The Wind models tend to be the best buys, offering a great array of features and impressive efficiency thanks to the comparatively smaller wheels. Performance-focused buyers will want the GT, as it offers up to 601 horsepower (and 641 hp in Launch Mode.)

All models can charge from 10 to 80% in just 18 minutes, which is a class-leading figure. For comparison, a Ford Mustang Mach-E takes between 32 and 36 minutes (standard versus long range) to ascertain the same percentage.

The entire Hyundai Motor Group E-GMP lineup is full of fast-charging beasts. Plus, they come standard with a Tesla-style NACS port and native Supercharger access. Your results may vary, however, when using a Tesla Supercharger due to voltage differences.

One thing to consider is that the EV6 has a somewhat stingy options list. If you’d like all-wheel drive, a glass roof, ventilated seats, and a better-sounding audio system, you’ll need to buy the GT-Line model. For comparison, a Model Y All-Wheel-Drive with the same feature set costs $50,630 without any incentives or $43,130 with the EV credit alone.

The Kia EV9: The Most Affordable Electric Three-Row

With Kia and the Feds’ incentives, the 2026 EV9 Light RWD can be had at a very reasonable price for a three-row midsize SUV of any powertrain. And the EV9 has a solid array of standard features.

The base EV9 features a power liftgate, tri-zone climate control, and ventilated front seats. On the safety front, it offers a suite of autonomous driving features like adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and automatic lane changes.

Power, however, is lacking in the Light RWD, as it makes just 215 horsepower despite weighing over 5,093 pounds. The Light Long Range RWD is even worse. It makes 201 horsepower and weighs in at 5,324 pounds. For reference, the Light Long Range RWD has a lower power-to-weight ratio than the original Ford Focus EV. That said, all the all-wheel drive versions are better suited for acceleration with 379 horsepower via dual motors.

For those seeking more features, there’s the Land AWD, which runs $58,895 with the discounts (and destination fees included). It comes equipped with ambient lighting, dual sunroofs, second-row ventilated seats, and a 14-speaker Meridian audio system. The Land and GT-Line trims also feature headlights with LED patterns that progress into the front bumper and optional matte paint options.

Thanks to its 800V battery system and thermal management system, the EV9 has a stellar charging curve. It can charge from 10 to 80% in just 24 minutes. Moreover, the Light Long Range version can secure a standard efficiency rating just above 3.0 miles per kilowatt-hour, which is quite impressive for such a large three-row SUV.

Should I Consider A Discounted Kia EV?

The Kia EV6 and EV9 are not without downsides. For instance, the Light models are simply underpowered. The EV6 makes 167 horsepower and the 5,324-pound EV9 produces 201 horsepower. Buyers who crave performance must upgrade to all-wheel-drive models. Another issue comes in the form of an arguably antiquated infotainment system. The navigation is difficult to use, but necessary if you’d like the battery to precondition itself on the way to a DC fast charger.

But buyers who are willing to overlook the few drawbacks should very much consider the EV6 and EV9. I’d especially recommend the EV9 solely on the basis of its decent residual values. While EVs tend to depreciate more than the average internal combustion engine-powered vehicles, the EV9 is holding on relatively strong. Most EV9 Lights are still hovering around the $40,000 mark used. However, things change for the costlier variants.

That said, the higher trim level options are naturally seeing bigger price drops. For instance, the EV9 GT-Lines are already in the low-to-mid-$50,000 range. Considering a new 2026 GT-Line can be as low as $60,895, perhaps opting for a certified used EV9 for around $55,000 would make more financial sense. However, it’s vital to note that the interest rate on used cars is typically much higher.

Nevertheless, Kia has brought some incredible electric crossovers to the world. And considering these recent discounts, now might be the time to consider one of its offerings.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/40xoxM/s1/ev6-ev9-top.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 13:12:27.063435

For the week, the contract, however, was still down about 3% after gaining about 7% last week.

Even though meteorologists forecast the weather will remain hotter than normal for at least the next two weeks, those temperatures were not expected to return to the highs seen earlier this week.

In fact, some analysts have started to wonder if the market has already seen its highest price for the summer when it rose to around $4.15 per mmBtu on June 20 in anticipation of this week’s heat.

Futures for September 2025 started trading at a premium over August 2025 for the first time ever three days ago as the market bets supplies will be lower, demand will be higher and/or the surplus of gas in storage above normal levels will be lower (or even in a deficit) in September.

After adding more gas into storage than usual for 10 weeks in a row, analysts projected energy firms likely injected less gas than usual this week as power generators burned lots of the fuel to produce electricity to keep air conditioners humming during a brutal heat wave.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states rose to 105.6 billion cubic feet per day so far in June, up from 105.2 bcfd in May, but still below the monthly record high of 106.3 bcfd in March due primarily to normal spring pipeline maintenance earlier in the month.

Meteorologists forecast weather across the Lower 48 states will remain mostly warmer than normal through at least July 12.

With more summer heat still to come, LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, would rise from 103.9 bcfd this week to 106.0 bcfd next week and the week after. The forecasts for this week and next week were similar to LSEG’s outlook on Thursday.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big U.S. LNG export plants fell to 14.2 bcfd so far in June, down from 15.0 bcfd in May and a monthly record high of 16.0 bcfd in April. The feedgas average for June, however, was up a bit from where it was earlier in the month as units at some LNG plants returned from maintenance reductions.

The U.S. became the world’s biggest LNG supplier in 2023, surpassing Australia and Qatar, as surging global prices fed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Gas was trading at a four-week low of around $11 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and a two-week low of around $13 at the Japan Korea Marker (JMM) benchmark in Asia.

The updated legislation also includes Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee’s latest plan to sell certain federal public land for housing.

The new Senate Finance Committee text looks a lot more like the House-passed bill when it comes to an array of contested tax credits.

It would drastically phase out wind and solar credits while maintaining incentives for Republican-friendly energy sources like nuclear and geothermal.

Specifically, the bill would cut off incentives for projects that aren’t “placed in service” — or plugged into the grid — by the end of 2028. That’s more aggressive than the previous Senate draft that preserved those credits for projects that merely “start construction” by the end of the year.

On the other hand, the legislation has a notable victory for hydrogen. It would extend incentives for clean hydrogen production to 2028, instead of eliminating them this year, as the previous Senate version proposed.

Some provisions stayed the same. Senators kept credits for non-carbon energy sources, including nuclear, hydropower and geothermal, for projects that start construction by 2033.

Senators also kept “transferability,” which allows project sponsors to transfer credits to a third party. And the new language largely kept provisions barring companies from using materials from China or other adversary nations, while moving some deadlines for compliance sooner.

The Senate parliamentarian was reviewing at least portions of this section. Companies were hoping for more lenient treatment to allow supply chains to develop.

Senators continued to target wind turbines and their parts, which would no longer receive advanced manufacturing tax credits by 2028. Critical mineral incentives would be phased out, as well, except for metallurgical coal.

The bill proposes moving the end of the electric vehicle tax credits to Sept. 30, up from the six-month timeline previously proposed, while credits for charging infrastructure would end in June 2026.

Negotiators added a new bonus tax incentive for certain advanced nuclear power facilities built in areas with significant nuclear industry employment.

A number of House and Senate defenders of the climate law credits, under intense lobbying from companies, were looking to make sure renewable energy projects had more time to benefit. But conservatives and President Donald Trump fought in the opposite direction.

Public lands

Lee’s latest proposal would order the sale of up to 0.5 percent of Bureau of Land Management land across 11 states. Only lands that fall within five miles of a population center would be eligible, and protected lands excluded.

The parliamentarian had ruled an earlier land sales plan ineligible for passage by simple majority under the budget reconciliation process. She had yet to rule on Lee’s new framework Friday night.

The updated text would set aside money from each sale for hunting, fishing and recreational amenities. That after outdoor advocates on the right expressed concern.

Still, a number of Republican lawmakers in both chambers have balked at any public land sale plan in the megabill and would push to strip it before final passage.

Other provisions

The Energy and Natural Resources portion of the budget reconciliation package would still claw back Department of Energy money from the Inflation Reduction Act.

However, it would expand to $1 billion a new energy dominance loan program. Energy Secretary Chris Wright had lobbied for loan office funding, particularly for nuclear projects.

The broader legislation includes other IRA spending rollbacks, a decade-long delay of the methane fee and zero fees on automakers for not complying with the Department of Transportation’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

The megabill would mandate oil and gas lease sales onshore and offshore, including in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The state would increasingly share the revenues from development there.

Labor’s proposal to create a federal environment protection agency collapsed in the final months of the last parliament. A deal with the Greens was being negotiated by the then environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, but Anthony Albanese pushed the changes off the agenda, fearing an electoral backlash in Western Australia.

The newly appointed minister, Murray Watt, says Labor’s 3 May victory gives the government a “very clear mandate” to pass the so-called nature positive laws, which he says should be finalised and passed by parliament within 18 months.

That progress will require support from the Greens, which hold the sole balance of power in the Senate.

But Waters said Labor needed to do a “proper job” in redesigning the Howard-era rules and to ensure they were not pushed down the political agenda ahead of the next election.

“They were always written to facilitate development and not to protect the environment. I say that in all honesty,” Waters said. “What they are now very clearly weak on is meeting the challenges that we’re facing.

“They don’t have any reference to climate in them. Now that’s just ridiculous, to have environmental laws that don’t require explicit consideration of the climate.”

Waters called for Labor to stop approvals for new mines, describing the post-election extension of Woodside’s huge North West Shelf development out to 2070 as “a massive, dirty gas bomb”.

“They do need a drastic rewrite. With the 18-month delay that the minister has now said, I take two messages out of that.

“Because I’m an optimist … maybe they can now take the time to do a proper job.

“But the other message I take is that this is not a priority for them. And I’m also worried that in that 18-month delay, that so much destruction will just continue. Things will just get ticked off while they’re reviewing the laws – how convenient – and it’s a smokescreen to just continue on business as usual.”

The Queensland senator, who replaced former Greens leader Adam Bandt, made the comments in an interview for Guardian Australia’s Australian Politics podcast, released on Friday.

The National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) has been lobbying the Greens on Labor’s plans to make some superannuation tax concessions less generous for account holders with balances above $3m.

The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says the government is pressing on with the delayed changes and is expected to negotiate with Greens’ treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim.

The NFF chief executive, Troy Williams, recently wrote to Waters warning the proposal risks serious unintended consequences for family farming businesses, which often rely on superannuation for intergenerational succession planning.

“We would plead with you to use upcoming negotiations in the Senate to push for sensible changes to this tax to mitigate the unintended consequences for family-owned farms,” Williams said in a letter provided to Guardian Australia.

“This could include grandfathering existing arrangements, excluding agricultural land from valuations, taxing gains on realisation, and of course indexation.”

The Greens have promised constructive negotiations and expressed concern retirement savings accounts are being used as vehicles for wealth accumulation.

Waters told Guardian Australia the party would consider Labor’s final proposal carefully.

“We will support tax changes that make the tax system fairer and I will be having those discussions with Mr Chalmers as the weeks roll on,” she said.

“I think we’ll keep those discussions private.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8109359a03f31e7f19c66baa6b0295b8203eb418/464_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c38b320a57964717e222a86aa42436c0,N,,2025-06-28 12:14:06.902274

ENERGY TRANSITION 2025 is an ongoing series to place details of our current energy shift into historical context.","The “Big Beautiful Bill” threatens the renewable transition if not revised in the Senate, as it targets the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate.

While the Republican Coalition has appeared to be anything but reliable, if approved, the budget reconciliation now being considered by the US Senate could have a number of serious immediate impacts. Cost-cutting was a guiding principle for the “Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) that squeaked through the House in May and went to the Senate for review, potentially by July 4.

While a great deal of attention has been paid to the proposed cuts to Medicare and other government programs, some observers are specifically focusing on the bill’s attention to energy. As approved by the House, the BBB marks a significant shift in the federal approach to stimulating the market for energy.

Energy Transition Guidance From the Top

Particularly through its work on the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris administration’s policies promoted over $1 trillion in private investment in clean energy, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. The Inflation Reduction Act resulted in the most significant effort in American history to use governmental policy to stimulate and support an energy transition from fossil fuels.

A primary detail of the governmental approach was the federal support of grants and tax benefits that stimulated the construction of renewable power structures, such as solar panels, on businesses and homes. Additionally, federal benefits spurred the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs), including by private consumers. This was also supported by federal support to upgrade the electric grid and charging stations. Across the economy, the federal government used its resources to stimulate modernization of the energy market.

Many observers have argued that strengthening America’s renewable energy sector with policies that encourage the expansion of relevant technology keeps the nation competitive and promotes economic prosperity. Yet the Trump administration has cast Biden’s successes as “climate extremism.” While the Trump administration has deemed that its own policy will unleash “…America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources…” to “restore American prosperity…,” it uses a template of fossil fuel extraction perfected in models of previous eras of energy use.

The Atlantic reported that in a meeting with top energy executives during the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump assured them that if his opponent was elected, the industry would be “f—ed.” It is estimated that in response, the industry donated more than $450 million to support Trump’s 2024 election. In addition to overt initiatives, such as Trump’s call to “Drill, Baby, Drill,” that would spur energy development, there are more subtle efforts that seek to undercut the foundation of the Biden-Harris belief that federal initiatives might assist in encouraging a transition from fossil fuels. For instance, as part of a wholesale change in approach, the BBB seeks to discontinue many of the initiatives that support renewables.

Big Beautiful Bill’s Hidden Energy Strategy

As it now stands, the BBB would “slow renewable energy deployment and manufacturing over the next ten years,” say many analysts. According to Governing’s Cal Smith, the bill proposes “taking back unobligated clean energy funds from Inflation Reduction Act programs, eliminating tax credits for clean energy development and manufacturing, and imposing new registration fees for owners of electric and hybrid vehicles.” While the bill is likely going to be greatly revised in the Senate, as the Senate parliamentarian has ruled against certain Medicare cuts, its impact on the energy sector can help to shed light on this administration’s priorities.

Observers group the BBB’s proposed impact on energy markets into these broad categories:

Climate: The entire spirit and ethic of BBB initiatives is meant to reject any emphasis on or acceptance of climate change, particularly efforts to mitigate or adapt to a less carbon-intensive energy marketplace.

Renewable Energy: Estimates run that the BBB would cut new construction of solar and battery installation by at least twenty percent. The efforts at new construction would be particularly impacted by the restrictions placed on the use of materials constructed abroad.

Efficiency and EVs: For vehicles, the bill would not only repeal tax credits for electric cars, trucks, and chargers, but it also would impose a federal $250 annual fee on vehicles, on top of any state fees. Combined, the lost credits and increased fees could “cut projected US sales of electric vehicles by forty percent in 2030.”

Nuclear energy: For new nuclear plants, the bill would move up the deadline to 2028 to begin construction. According to one critic, “That deadline is too soon for some new reactor designs and would rush the vetting of others.”

Biofuels: The bill would spend $45 billion to extend tax credits for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.

Hydrogen: The bill would end tax credits for hydrogen production. This would likely end the effort for “hydrogen hubs” that was funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021, as well as a variety of other initiatives that had been organized around hydrogen made from natural gas with carbon capture.

An Overall Ethic to Extend the Energy Status Quo with Fossil Fuels

By design, the BBB is set to upend the previous advancements that allowed for a clean energy transition within the United States to seem realizable. With fewer efficiency improvements, fewer electric vehicles, and less clean power on the grid, analysts are projecting that American households would pay approximately $415 more per year in energy bills by 2035 over what would have been the case if BBB was not enacted. Also, by 2035, the BBB would increase gas emissions by one billion tons.

Although few observers expected the Inflation Reduction Act initiatives to remain intact, the proposed BBB cuts are targeting the technologies Americans count on to protect the climate and to save consumers money.

Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.
The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate.
45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually.
The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter.
A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.","A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.

“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code.

The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota.

Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota.

The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.”

Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate.

The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate.

“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline.

In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland.

“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read.

Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety.

According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually.

The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter.

“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read.

A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion.

The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.”

Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.

The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.

The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher.

“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”

Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

While there are major barriers to overcome if this ambitious plan is to be achieved, the potential impacts and implications for the U.S. energy sector of such a transitional shift in capacity and supply are significant and far‑reaching.

Today, the U.S. nuclear fleet’s 94 reactors have capacity of ~100 gigawatts (GW) and provide ~20% of the country’s electrons. More than 90% of the U.S. nuclear fleet was built in the 1970s and 1980s and, since the early 1990s, just six GW of nuclear capacity has been added across five reactors (Fig. 1). In order to quadruple U.S. nuclear energy capacity by 2050, an additional 15 GW per year of nuclear capacity would need to be commissioned from 2030 to 2050—versus a peak commissioning of 10.5 GW in 1974. We would also need to see the adoption of Generation III+ and Generation IV reactors and micro reactors, often referred to collectively as small module reactors, or SMRs.

New U.S. nuclear capacity commissioned per year

(Fig. 1)

Such a large scale of investment is not realistic without removing significant barriers to nuclear power growth, including: (1) licensing and permitting, (2) cost and bankability, (3) workforce and supply chain, and (4) development of SMRs. This paper examines these various challenges, how President Donald Trump’s executive orders attempt to address them, and how we, as investors, are looking to position ourselves to benefit from the potential growth in nuclear power.

1. Licensing and permitting

Two of the president’s four executive orders on nuclear energy focus on the barriers to new capacity, specifically licensing, permitting, and testing—predominantly overseen by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC is viewed as a global leader in nuclear safety licensing and regulation, but regulatory efficiency in the licensing review and approval process is an ongoing issue. The regulatory efficiency is impeded by a patchwork of legislatively mandated hearings and reviews, prohibitive head count levels, and competing designs seeking review and approval. Standardization of both the process and designs would go a long way toward allowing the NRC to remain a global leader while also increasing the speed with which designs and projects are approved.

This work is underway, and the president’s executive orders seek to expedite this needed reform. Specifically, President Trump has called for the deployment of new SMR technology at a domestic U.S. Army base by no later than September 2028. Importantly, the licensing, permitting, and testing process for nuclear power plants at military bases falls under the sole jurisdiction of the Department of Energy (DOE). Successfully deploying SMR technology at a government site could go a long way toward jump‑starting the addition of new nuclear power plants by the private sector.

2. Cost and bankability

The construction of additional nuclear power plants in the U.S. will need to overcome cost and bankability concerns. The most recently constructed nuclear power plant in the U.S., Vogtle in Georgia, saw Units 3 and 4 enter service in 2023 and 2024, respectively, more than seven years late and USD 18 billion over budget. Research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the DOE estimates that Vogtle unit construction costs today would be around USD 15,000/kilowatt (kW) in the U.S. This compares with estimated nuclear unit costs in other countries ranging from USD 3,000/kW to USD 10,000/kW (Fig. 2).

New nuclear capacity costs1 (USD/kW)

(Fig. 2)

At USD 15,000/kW, a nuclear plant would be uneconomical for both ratepayers and investors, and getting such a project approved by regulators or investors is a tall order. This is further exacerbated by the inability to secure debt financing or tax equity financing for a nuclear project. The construction of Vogtle Units 3 and 4 required DOE loan guarantees and caused the rating agencies to downgrade Georgia Power’s credit rating. Lower unit costs (USD/kW) can contribute to improved bankability, as the sheer size of the projects is a financing constraint.

The president’s executive order tasks the DOE with funding nuclear restarts, upgrades, and the construction of new nuclear projects—with a goal of starting construction for 10 new large reactors by 2030. In addition, the development of SMRs is expected to improve the economics of nuclear power deployment by significantly reducing the upfront capital costs required.

3. Workforce and supply chain

The DOE estimates that the U.S. would need an additional 375,000 workers to support the deployment of 200 GW—a tripling—of new nuclear power by 2050. This number includes around 100,000 workers to operate the new reactors and 275,000 related to construction and manufacturing for the new reactors. Today, the industry’s labor pool is constrained by a shortage of existing skilled labor and the new project pipeline, which contribute to challenges in training new workers.

The limited pipeline of nuclear projects also inhibits domestic development and manufacturing supply chain. For example, there are no domestic forging capabilities to support the material and component needs of the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor. Similarly, some materials that are required to construct a nuclear power plant are critical minerals where there is little to no domestic supply. Current domestic labor and vendor constraints will limit the U.S. grid to just three GW per year of new nuclear capacity, assuming no other constraints.

Another important bottleneck is enrichment capacity. Mined uranium must be enriched before being used in power plants. Currently, Russia and China control nearly 60% of world enrichment capacity. The U.S. once held a leading share of enrichment capacity, but this came to an end following the 1993 “Megatons to Megawatts” agreement, which was aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear proliferation by converting weapons‑grade uranium from Russian warheads to low‑enriched uranium for commercial power plants. This led to an oversupply of enriched uranium from Russia that shuttered domestic enrichment capacity. The last U.S. enrichment plant capable of unobligated production was shut down in 2013. Today, there is only one U.S. uranium enrichment facility with capacity to enrich just one‑third of existing U.S. reactor requirements.

""Today, there is only one U.S. uranium enrichment facility with capacity to enrich just one‑third of existing U.S. reactor requirements.""

Rick de los Reyes, Sector Portfolio Manager and Head of Commodities

The president’s executive orders attempt to address these issues. The Department of Labor has been tasked with growing the nuclear workforce. On the issue of enrichment, the DOE and the NRC are to “develop a plan to expand domestic uranium conversion capacity and expand enrichment capabilities sufficient to meet projected civilian and defense reactor needs…”. The orders also call for the use of the Defense Production Act to enter into commercial agreements with domestic suppliers for nuclear fuel supply.

4. Development of SMRs

Finally, the sheer magnitude of quadrupling installed nuclear capacity in the U.S. will require the adoption and use of a few different technologies. Existing nuclear plants in the U.S. use traditional large‑scale reactors. Vogtle Units 3 and 4, for instance, utilize Westinghouse’s AP1000 reactor, which is considered a large‑scale Gen III reactor. The appeal of newer SMRs is the significantly lower capital cost required to deploy them. This capital cost could decline even further if the technology is standardized, allowing it to be mass produced in a more cost‑effective manner.

As of today, there is one operating SMR in Russia and one that is under construction in China. There are also 80+ SMR designs currently in development across 19 countries. Over the past 70 years, the U.S. has constructed 50+ different commercial reactor designs. Lack of standardization, among other things, was a key contributor to the ballooning costs for nuclear reactors during the 1970s and 1980s.

As mentioned earlier, the president’s executive orders direct the Energy Secretary to speed the standardization of design and select a technology to be put into use at a U.S. military site. Standardizing reactor designs could improve costs and reduce lead times for approvals, labor, and equipment.

All solutions require uranium

From a natural resources perspective, we believe the best way to invest in this secular shift toward nuclear is through uranium. The technology behind nuclear power is still evolving. It is not entirely clear who will be the winners and losers among nuclear energy equipment providers, engineering and construction companies, or the power providers. What we do know for certain is that all potential solutions for providing nuclear power require uranium.

If the ambitions of President Trump’s executive order are to be achieved, and if the rest of the world’s projected growth in nuclear power also comes to fruition, the world will face a significant deficit in uranium supply (Fig. 3). The de‑emphasis of nuclear power over the last 10+ years, particularly since the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, has resulted in significant underinvestment in uranium mining. Given that building new uranium mines can take a decade or more, the necessary planning and investment to add new supply needs to be happening now.

Global uranium supply and demand

(Fig. 3)

Meanwhile, the diverging supply and demand numbers don’t tell the full story. It will also be crucial that uranium supply comes from reliable sources. The U.S. currently produces less than 1% of the world’s uranium and relies almost entirely on imports for its needs. Globally, 75% of uranium production comes from government‑owned sources, the majority of which comes from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Russia (Fig. 4).

Global ownership of uranium production

(Fig. 4)

Moving forward, the U.S. and its allies will likely want to decrease dependence on imports and increase domestic production. For this reason, uranium producers in North America look well placed to capitalize on this “reshoring” of demand. Saskatoon‑based Cameco, for example, is the largest private uranium miner in the world, operating large low‑cost mines in Canada. Cameco also has exposure to all parts of nuclear fuel production through its investment in nuclear technology pioneer Westinghouse. Similarly, Uranium Energy Corp also looks to be well positioned, boasting the leading uranium resource base and the largest licensed production capacity within the U.S. Growing production from large, low‑cost, uranium miners in safe jurisdictions like North America will be necessary to meet the growing demands for nuclear power now, and in the decades to come.

These projects mark important progress in expanding both traditional and renewable energy infrastructure on public lands.

“Approving these projects reflects our commitment to strengthening America’s energy independence,” said BLM Acting Director Bill Groffy. “By responsibly developing energy resources on public lands, we’re helping to secure a reliable, diverse energy future for the nation while supporting jobs and local economies.”

In Montana, the BLM approved NorthWestern Energy’s proposal to construct the 74-mile Helena to Three Forks natural gas pipeline through an accelerated 14-day environmental review process, which is being used in response to the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump.

The pipeline route includes approximately nine miles of BLM-managed public lands and will follow an existing utility corridor to minimize new ground disturbance and ecological disruption. Construction of the 16-inch buried pipeline will occur in phases between spring 2026 and fall 2029. Preparatory activities, including increased survey traffic and engineering assessments, are expected to begin in 2025.

In addition to the Helena to Three Forks pipeline, the BLM has also approved three geothermal energy projects under an expedited timeline in Nevada that support the administration’s goals for energy development on public lands:

Diamond Flat Geothermal Project (near Fallon, Nevada): Ormat Technologies plans to drill test wells and conduct geothermal resource confirmation activities on federally leased lands to assess the commercial viability of the geothermal reservoir.

McGinness Hills Geothermal Optimization Project (Lander County, Nevada): This project will upgrade and expand three existing geothermal power plants. Enhancements include new production wells, advanced heat exchangers, upgraded cooling fans, and the addition of a 15-megawatt solar photovoltaic field—aimed at improving overall efficiency and increasing output beyond the current 193 megawatts.

Pinto Geothermal Project (near Denio, Nevada): Ormat will conduct exploratory drilling and geothermal resource evaluation on BLM-managed lands to determine the potential for future power generation.

These approvals align with the BLM’s broader mission to support responsible energy development on public lands. Through strategic permitting, land stewardship, and environmental safeguards, BLM helps ensure a reliable domestic energy supply and reduces dependence on foreign resources. The BLM also plays a critical role in overseeing the extraction of essential minerals on federally managed lands, which are vital for sectors ranging from clean energy technologies to national defense.

He started working on tipping points in the 1990s, making him one of the first scientists in the world to study this form of planetary risk. In an upcoming book, Positive Tipping Points: How to Fix the Climate Crisis, he argues the Earth has entered an “unstable period” but humanity can still prevail if we can trigger positive social and economic tipping points to reverse the damage that has already been done. On 30 June, he will host a global conference on tipping points.

How do you define a tipping point?

A tipping point is where change becomes self-propelling within a system, meaning it will shift from one state to another. That can happen because the balance of feedback in the system switches from damping feedback to amplifying feedback. The result can look very rapid and irreversible.

How has our understanding of these risks changed?

We first published a map of climate tipping elements in 2008, Since then, we have added much more than we have subtracted from that map. And, unfortunately, in the intervening 17 years, the evidence suggests we’re much closer to some of these tipping points than we thought.

Which tipping points might we have passed?

Things are undoubtedly happening faster than anticipated. The tipping points of greatest concern include the West Antarctic ice sheet, where the loss of a significant chunk of the ice sheet is self-propelling, which could raise the world’s sea levels by about 1.2 metres. There is also the Greenland ice sheet, which is losing mass at an accelerating rate. Then we have the permafrost, parts of which are already passing localised tipping points – and that’s adding methane and carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Then there’s the unprecedented bleaching and dieback of coral reefs, which hundreds of millions of people depend on for their livelihoods.

And which are close?

There’s a tipping point in the circulation of the north Atlantic Ocean, when deep water stops forming in the middle of the subpolar gyre south-west of Greenland. That system seems quite volatile, and a tipping point there is like a small version of a bigger tipping point of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Amoc), which studies suggest is at much greater risk than we thought even a few years ago. That in turn could trigger monsoon tipping points in west Africa and India. I’d also note the risk of tipping Amazon rainforest dieback from a mixture of climate change and direct human disruption. Unfortunately, I could reel off quite a few more.

How accurate are the predictions?

If anything, we have underestimated the risks. When we did our first assessment in 2008, we thought Greenland was close to a big tipping point. We haven’t changed that judgment, but we thought West Antarctica would need at least 3C of warming [above pre-industrial levels]. Unfortunately, everything that’s been observed since suggests we were way too optimistic. As a rule, the more we learn, the closer we think the tipping points are – and meanwhile we’ve been warming the planet up. It’s like running faster into a sea that is rising to drown us.

Why has it taken so long for the world to talk about these catastrophic threats?

In the climate science community, we have tended to concentrate on assessing what’s the most likely thing to happen, but the more important question is: what’s the worst thing that could happen? That’s the difference between a scientific assessment and a risk assessment. I would argue we’ve not been treating climate change as a risk assessment.

That is also because a lot of well-funded entities have been systematically undermining the knowledge consensus on climate change, which has forced the scientific community to defend what’s in effect 19th-century physics. That hasn’t put us in a great position to emphasise tipping point risks, which inherently have more uncertainty around them.

Why do we need to talk about them now?

Because tipping point risks are real and potentially existential. If we have a tipping point in the Atlantic Ocean – the so-called Amoc – we could lose more than half the area for growing staple crops worldwide. It would cause water security crises and severely disrupt the monsoons in west Africa and India, which would affect billions of people.

We have to level up to those risks, better understand them and how close they are, and what things we can do in response. Even if we can’t stop the events happening, we can do things that reduce the vulnerability of people exposed to the risks. That is why we are drawing attention to tipping points. This is not as a council of despair; on the contrary, it is more like a council of practicality. In terms of the upfront costs to decarbonise the global economy, it is a great investment for the return you get, which is lowering the risk of otherwise catastrophic outcomes.

It would help if the IPCC [the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] took a more in-depth look at tipping points. A large number of countries wanted to see an IPCC special report on tipping points in this assessment cycle, but the IPCC said no. Instead there’s due to be a chapter in the next assessment report.

Is there an alternative?

Yes. I and more than 200 other researchers have published a global tipping points report, and we’re writing another one for Cop30, [the UN climate change summit which takes place in Brazil, in November]. We felt the risk was important to communicate and this is a timely moment. So we are trying to fill in the assessment gap in an accessible way. People are crying out for that.

I understand the global tipping points conference will also look at positive tipping points in technology, economics and politics?

Yes. [There are some] more optimistic scenarios; the impacts of wind power and photovoltaic innovation, or the knock-on effects of campaigning by Greta Thunberg and others. There are also policy feedbacks that could create a change in the landscape in a good way, where you start a policy path towards the renewable energy revolution that’s very hard to reverse. That is arguably what the architects of the German feed-in tariffs for renewables managed to do. They made it hard for the doubters to change course even after a change of government.

Has renewable energy reached a positive tipping point?

Yes, our analysis suggests that solar photovoltaic power is now in a phase of self-propelling global uptake with exponential growth of installed generating capacity, doubling every two years or less. Factoring in the cost of battery storage, solar is already the cheapest source of new power in most of the world, and for every doubling of installed capacity its price drops by nearly a quarter. This is rapidly making solar power the cheapest source of electricity ever, which brings many benefits, including access to electricity for the roughly 700 million people who don’t currently have it.

And electric vehicles?

Yes, the price of batteries plummeted nearly tenfold in a decade as the range you can get from a given mass of battery increased by nearly a factor of three. This has brought China and several European markets to the tipping point where adoption of EVs is self-propelling: the more EVs that get bought, the better and the cheaper they get, encouraging further adoption. The US is lagging behind, but the global south is starting to reap the benefits of electrifying mobility, as it is much cheaper to run an electric rickshaw in India or an electric motorbike taxi in east Africa than their fossil-fuelled equivalents.

Any other examples of potential positive tipping points?

I’m working on regenerative nature. We already see cases where degraded ecosystems have been tipped back into a better state – for example, when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and started preying on elk, it triggered abrupt vegetation recovery, or when sea otters returned to north Pacific coastal ecosystems and started feasting on sea urchins it tipped the recovery of kelp forests. We also see social tipping points that are nature-positive, where community conservation initiatives, like locally managed marine protected areas, spread rapidly and widely among and across societies.

Can you explain cascading feedbacks?

In all complex systems – such as the climate and the economy – if you can tip one thing, it can have consequences for other bits of the system. If you tip one part of the system it can make tipping another part of the system more likely. For example, if you’ve suffered a medical shock it can have knock-on effects on other parts of the body. In the climate, these causal connections can be quite significant and strong. In Earth’s history, when there were tipping points in the overturning circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, that tipped major shifts in the tropical monsoons of west Africa and India.

In the economy, a cascade can be more positive. For example, an investment in renewable energy can bring forward a tipping point in other sectors. It basically means renewables are making electricity cheaper than it has ever been, and that incentivises electrifying mobility, like cars and trucks and buses, or electrifying heating in homes. At the same time, batteries get cheaper because of economies of scale, which then helps to balance renewable electricity supply and demand. So feedbacks between sectors of the economy can create tipping points that reinforce each other. We’ve recently mapped out a bunch of positive tipping cascades that could help accelerate change to zero greenhouse gas emissions.

What should the world do at Cop30 in Belém to address tipping points?

We need policymakers to implement policies that bring forward the positive tipping points we need to stop greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the bad climate tipping points. If the EU and China were to coordinate, it could be enough to shift the balance towards clean green alternatives. Even with Trump in the United States, the beauty of tipping points is you don’t need everybody, you typically only need a fifth to tip to the new alternative and then you get to a situation where everybody else is compelled to follow.

The global imperative for decarbonisation is growing stronger, but the social and economic fabric of India—still marked by vast inequality and energy poverty—makes the path far from straightforward. The concept of a “just transition,” once peripheral to climate discourse, is now central to India’s low-carbon ambitions.

It demands that decarbonisation is not only rapid but equitable—ensuring reskilling, income security, and regional development, particularly in states dependent on fossil fuels. This is not merely a welfare concern but a structural requirement to prevent social disruption and economic regression as India retools for a green economy.

Recasting India’s global role

Emerging markets now account for nearly 60% of the global $1.6 trillion pipeline of clean industrial projects, with India as a key player. This shift reflects both demographic weight and strategic ambition. Yet, financial gaps, regulatory uncertainty, and fragmented infrastructure hamper delivery.

India has responded by deepening bilateral climate agreements, championing South-South collaboration, and using forums such as the International Solar Alliance to push for greater technology transfer and finance flows. The challenge now is to translate this diplomatic capital into on-the-ground transformation—through clear institutional pathways and bankable, inclusive projects.

Coal and the cost of transition

Coal still generates nearly 70% of India’s electricity, with states like Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh deeply dependent on coal-linked revenues and employment. Yet, signs of a pivot are emerging. India now ranks fourth globally in repurposing retired coal assets for clean energy, and Jharkhand has taken the lead by setting up a state-level task force on just transition.

But isolated initiatives are not enough. A credible exit from coal will require coordinated investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure—particularly in affected districts—to cushion the economic blow and avoid deepening regional imbalances.

The jobs challenge in renewables

India’s clean energy expansion has been rapid: solar capacity has exceeded 110 GW, while wind installations crossed 50 GW in early 2025, positioning India as the world’s fourth-largest wind energy producer. Government forecasts suggest that up to 35 million green jobs could emerge by 2047. But enthusiasm masks a structural fault line—an acute mismatch between available jobs and existing skills.

While pilot schemes such as women-led solar technician programmes in rural areas show promise, they remain the exception. A large-scale, multi-stakeholder effort—bringing together vocational education, industry alignment, and better labour protections—is now essential to build a workforce ready for the energy transition.

Climate change: Mobilising climate finance

India’s 2070 net-zero target carries a steep price tag—estimated between $10 and $19 trillion. Domestic institutions have made some headway. The Reserve Bank of India and SEBI are advancing green financing frameworks, and sovereign green bond issuances are gaining traction. But the numbers still fall short.

In 2025, the developed world continues to under-deliver on the $100 billion annual climate finance promise made under the Paris Agreement. India is now exploring alternative models—climate-resilient bonds, blended finance platforms, and sovereign-guaranteed loans to crowd in private capital and reduce risk for long-gestation projects.

Steel, growth, and green technology

India’s steel capacity is poised to exceed 330 million tonnes by 2030, reflecting the country’s infrastructure drive. But most planned investments still rely on coal-intensive processes. Experts now warn that unless India diversifies into cleaner production methods—such as hydrogen-based direct reduced iron, electric arc furnaces, and carbon capture technologies—the sector will lock in emissions for decades.

Strategic public-private partnerships and incentives for retrofitting existing plants with green technologies could help shift the trajectory. A clear industrial decarbonisation roadmap must follow.

Gender equity and social inclusion

Women make up less than 11% of the renewable energy workforce in India, with even lower numbers in engineering and technical roles. Initiatives supporting women entrepreneurs in solar microgrids and clean cooking solutions offer a way forward, but they require substantial scaling.

A just transition must address longstanding gender and caste-based exclusions in land rights, access to credit, and technical training. Without this, India risks reproducing existing inequalities in a new green economy.

Public perception and political momentum

Recent surveys indicate waning public concern on climate issues—only 64% of respondents in 2025 identified climate change as a major issue, down from 78% in 2022. Still, there is widespread belief that renewable energy can improve air quality and employment prospects. This creates a narrow but valuable window for public engagement. Civic education campaigns, school curricula integration, and empowered local governments will be critical to building long-term political support for climate reforms.

India’s climate and development pathways in 2025 are marked by contradiction. Renewables are scaling up and institutional frameworks are evolving, yet fossil fuels remain dominant and vulnerable communities risk being sidelined.

The promise of a just transition lies in resolving this contradiction. That means more than job creation or emissions reduction—it means embedding justice into every layer of policy: labour, finance, energy, and education. Only then can India lead not just as a participant in the global climate order, but as a model of inclusive and sustainable transformation.

The scale was noticeably smaller this year. Several leading companies opted out for a variety of reasons, including tight budgets. More tellingly, CEOs from major producers Longi Green Technology and Tongwei – keynote speakers last year – gave it a miss.

The weariness is not surprising. The industry, billed as one of China’s three new economic drivers along with electric vehicle and lithium battery manufacturing, is facing a double whammy: producers are swimming in a sea of red amid a price war and supply glut at home, while tariffs are blocking access to export markets.

Prices in every segment of the solar panel supply chain plummeted by 60 to 80 per cent in 2024 from a peak in 2023, according to the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, with 39 of the nation’s 121 listed producers in the red. Losses in the photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing value chain reached US$40 billion, according to Gao Jifan, chairman of Trina Solar. Including other business lines, the tally was US$60 billion, he said.

“Everyone is questioning how deep and prolonged this downturn will be,” Yang Liyou, general manager of solar-panel maker Jinneng Clean Energy Technology, said at a panel discussion during the conference. “It has not eased. In fact, it’s become deeper and longer than we anticipated.”

Shares of Jinko Solar, the world’s top solar panel maker in terms of shipment volume, have declined by nearly 30 per cent in New York this year, bringing the slump to more than 60 per cent from a peak in 2022.

Gov. Moore praised the unique collaboration on display.

“It does take our amazing local leadership … It does take our state leaders, it does take federal leadership, it does take nonprofit leadership, it does take the private sector – it does take everyday private citizens who understand that this is one of the greatest heirlooms we’ve got,” Moore said.

Moore said he was thankful his administration was able to sign the Chesapeake Bay Legacy Act, adding, “But we’re also really proud to be able to add a final signature” to the agreement with MCBP.

State Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, who has long advocated for equal recognition of the coastal bays alongside the Chesapeake, said the moment marked a milestone.

“One of the reasons I am so thrilled about the official signing of this comprehensive conservation and management plan is that it elevates our Maryland Coastal Bays as a shared priority at the local, state and federal level,” she said. “I have spent a lot of time as a member of the Senate Education, Energy and Environment Committee educating my colleagues that we also – in addition to supporting the Chesapeake Bay – should be supporting the Maryland Coastal Bays. So, it’s thrilling that we are here together.”

Worcester County Commissioners President Ted Elder offered praise and optimism, and thanked MCBP for protecting the local watershed.

“We’ve got a great agreement here, and I look forward in the future to working with everybody to keep our bays pristine and improve on our marshlands,” he said.

Josh Kurtz, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, said the CCMP reflects a forward-looking and science-based strategy.

“This is the strength of partnership. And empirical data shows us that what we’re doing is working,” he said, pointing to recent water quality report cards showing improvements.

“We’re seeing warmer waters, which makes it difficult to achieve the goals we want. We’re seeing more erosion [and] shrinking islands,” he continued. “But this plan takes that into consideration, and it looks into that future and helps us really build for what we want to see – which is a coastal bays that provide robust economic opportunity for all of our local communities, provides incredible places for all Marylanders and really everybody on the Eastern Shore to be able to get here and experience this incredible place.”

Kurtz also praised MCBP leadership.

“What an incredible job you all have done,” he said. “We really appreciate what you’ve done with us on the Watershed Act. I can’t get over how well this partnership is working – and I just see this as a model for everything that we do.”

Gov. Moore said “the Coastal Bays are like an heirloom that’s been handed down from prior generations. We didn’t create it, but we are responsible for its care and should honor what it means to us”

MCBP Board President Steve Taylor underscored the organization’s strong sense of responsibility in safeguarding the health of the Coastal Bay ecosystems.

MCBP Executive Director Kevin Smith expressed his thanks to all of the partners and supporters who came out on a very hot afternoon to reaffirm their commitment to keeping the bays healthy and robust.

“This only happens when we work together and this tremendous show of support and commitment ensures a healthy and productive future for our treasured coastal bays,” Smith said.

The Maryland Coastal Bays Program is one of just 28 National Estuary Programs designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to protect and restore estuaries of national significance.

How does the electric grid maintain stability?
Electric grid operators need to maintain a delicate balance of frequency and voltage, otherwise critical equipment can be damaged.
“Most of the conventional generation with dynamic voltage control did not act as expected,” he said.
In Spain, laws governing the electric grid dictated that traditional power plants were responsible for voltage control, but many failed during the emergency.","A widespread blackout like the one that plunged Spain and Portugal into darkness this spring is unlikely to happen in the U.S., according to a leading grid reliability expert. The U.S. electrical grid is better prepared than Spain to handle surges in voltage that caused the blackout.

Mark Lauby, senior vice president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., briefed federal regulators Thursday, June 26, on the April blackout that cut power to the entire Iberian Peninsula for up to 18 hours. The collapse happened in just 27 seconds after a series of power failures. The cause of the failure has been hotly contested, but U.S. officials agreed with Spain’s determination that renewable energy was not to blame.

The blackout was the result of a cascading “engineering and operations challenge,” Lauby said, involving the failure “to manage the grid’s static and dynamic voltage.” But when it comes to U.S. vulnerability to a similar crisis, Lauby declared, “It appears that we’re on the right track.”

The Spain blackout ignited a debate over the future of electric grids, which resources should be prioritized and how the system can be managed to keep the lights on. As the U.S. faces surging electricity demand, U.S. regulators are looking to learn from the European failure.

How does the electric grid maintain stability?

Electric grid operators need to maintain a delicate balance of frequency and voltage, otherwise critical equipment can be damaged. The frequency is the rate at which electric current changes direction in an alternating current (AC) system. Whereas voltage is more like the pressure or force utilized to move those electrons through the current.

If the voltage becomes too high, it can damage or even fry electrical equipment. If voltage is too low, the system cannot deliver sufficient power to meet demand.

The electrical grid is built to run at a frequency of 60 hertz, which is maintained by balancing electricity supply and demand. Traditional power plants are big spinning machines, so they have a natural inertia that can absorb slight changes in the frequency. However, wind, solar power, and batteries – sometimes referred to as inverter-based resources – do not possess the same natural inertia to absorb frequency fluctuations.

In the initial aftermath of the Spain blackout, there was widespread speculation that renewable energy, with its lack of natural inertia, was responsible for plunging the country into darkness. Spain’s grid is powered by 60% renewable energy, and critics have argued that this makes it vulnerable to blackouts because it lacks sufficient inertia.

Some questions still remain around the blackout, and a larger European electric reliability organization is conducting its own investigation into the incident. However, a report published by the regional grid operator suggests that while frequency played a role, the main problem was a failure to manage voltage spikes.

What caused Spain’s grid to collapse so quickly?

According to a report from Red Eléctrica, the county’s grid operator, Spain’s problems began with frequency oscillations between the Spanish and Portuguese grids around noon on April 28. Grid operators successfully dampened the shift in frequency by reducing how much power was exported to neighboring France and turning on an additional transmission line. But these corrective measures to manage frequency caused voltage to increase.

When high voltage is detected, substations can automatically trip offline to avoid equipment damage. One substation went offline, and with it, the grid lost 355 megawatts of generation. Seconds later, another 1.5 gigawatts of wind and solar installations disconnected from the grid to avoid damage from high voltage.

As the Red Eléctrica report puts it, ”with each generation disconnection, the system voltage increased and this in turn caused the disconnection of additional generation,” until the entire Iberian Peninsula and part of southern France went dark.

In Spain, traditional power plants are supposed to help manage voltage fluctuations. In his report to U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission members, Lauby said those power plants failed to provide adequate voltage control when needed most.

“Most of the conventional generation with dynamic voltage control did not act as expected,” he said.

After reviewing Lauby’s presentation, FERC commissioner David Rosner concluded, “This was not any particular resource’s fault.”

How does the US grid differ from Spain’s system?

American grid operators already require both conventional power plants and renewable energy installations to help control voltage, a crucial difference from Spanish regulations. In Spain, laws governing the electric grid dictated that traditional power plants were responsible for voltage control, but many failed during the emergency.

The U.S. also has continuous monitoring of voltage levels on the grid and requirements for power plants and inverter-based resources to keep their voltage control equipment updated. This enhanced monitoring and requirements are one of the primary reasons that regulators are not too worried about a similar crisis afflicting the North American grid.

Lauby highlighted another advantage being deployed on the grid: synchronous condensers. These are spinning machines that can be installed at strategic locations on the grid to help control unexpected voltage fluctuations. As an added benefit, synchronous condensers have their own inertia that can dampen changes in frequency.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CLEAN-spain-blackout_Getty-Images_featuredImage_Fri-Jun-27-2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 16:06:27.572632

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand.","A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.

Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.

""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Reams' group has called for lawmakers to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""

Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.

""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""

With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4469x2980+0+0/resize/1000?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F17%2F61dab62449e5a8487cf3f48a6bdc%2Fap23289829763983.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 11:06:48.909574

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" proposes making the Trump Tax Cuts permanent to incentivize domestic manufacturing and investment.

The EPA is streamlining regulations to encourage energy development and attract companies to the U.S.

President Trump has ignited a transformational manufacturing renaissance driven by his promise and policies to secure U.S. energy dominance.

This week, I spent time in the heart of the Rust Belt — Wisconsin — where 103-year-old Komatsu, the world’s second largest mining equipment manufacturer, is betting its next hundred years on U.S. coal and critical minerals.

The U.S. has the largest reserves of beautiful, clean coal in the world. President Trump has been its most ardent supporter, for power generation to meet an ever-rising power demand, but also for critical mineral mining as he is the first U.S. president to aggressively seek critical minerals in coal mines.

We also extract U.S. coal for export — steam coal for electricity generation and metallurgical coal for steel — to 71 countries.

President Trump has revived U.S. coal, despite the failed attempt of previous presidents to kill coal, and there’s a larger-than-ever mining market in the U.S. for manufacturing.

I visited Komatsu’s American subsidiary, Komatsu Mining Corp., at its new Milwaukee campus in the city’s Harbor District. It’s a former Superfund site that was remediated by President Trump during his first term. The campus is reminiscent of a time when Milwaukee was an industrial hub.

Against the backdrop of giant excavators, I saw a prosperous new industrial center being realized under President Trump.

EPA untangling red tape to encourage US energy development

Mining equipment manufacturing and the technology that comes with it is returning to America thanks to policies that support American energy development.

At EPA, we are untangling regulatory red tape at record speed, implementing durable, efficient policies that encourage U.S. energy development. By producing more American energy and removing barriers to deliver that energy, President Trump is attracting and keeping companies, like Komatsu, in the U.S.

Countries like China, Mexico and some in Southeast Asia, absorbed a great deal of U.S. manufacturing during the Biden administration, and emitted massive amounts of pollution.

President Trump’s tax policies help reshore U.S. operations and manufacturing, breathing life back into towns across our country where Americans suffered from massive job losses as industry shuttered on U.S. shores and reopened overseas.

In doing so, reshoring protects our environment because our standards to protect air, land and water far exceed those of any nation.

President's 'big beautiful bill' will reinvigorate US manufacturing

The path forward requires the passage of the president's budget which would make the Trump Tax Cuts permanent, providing certainty and consistency to American businesses and manufacturers.

The 'big beautiful bill' reinvigorates American manufacturing dominance by rewarding companies that build new factories in the U.S.

Extending the Trump Tax Cuts will make permanent a 15% corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturing and equivalent reductions for pass-through manufacturing activities.

One of the bill’s hallmark provisions would allow businesses to deduct, up front, the full cost of capital investments like new equipment or factories. They wouldn’t have to spread the write off over the life of the asset, which would cost more money by subjecting them to partial taxes on profits they did not make.

This savings would allow companies to invest in research and development to evolve and improve our technology and economy.

In 2018, R&D spending grew 7.4% because of the Trump Tax Cuts. In 2022, under President Biden, R&D spending grew just 3.6% annually.

The Trump Tax Cuts are good for businesses, but also everyday Americans. The cuts mean higher wages, $11,600 more per worker and $13,300 in take-home pay for a typical family with two children. For every $100 billion of investment, the White House Council of Economic Advisors estimates more than a million jobs would be created, and hundreds of thousands of new homes would be built to support workforce growth in economically disadvantaged communities, especially in rural areas.

The president's budget bill will unleash economic growth, ushering in a new Golden Age of prosperity for American workers, families, farmers, and small businesses.

(AMG) has emerged as a rare exemplar of operational resilience. Its Q1 2025 results, marked by an 8% revenue rise to $388 million and a stunning 88% jump in adjusted EBITDA to $58 million, underscore the effectiveness of its strategy to diversify into critical materials while maintaining strict cost discipline. Amid lithium's price slump and vanadium's volume headwinds, AMG's focus on high-margin segments—particularly its Technologies division—and strategic investments in long-term projects are positioning it to capitalize on the energy transition. Here's why investors should take note.

The Lithium Pivot: From Price Slump to Production Milestones

AMG Lithium's Q1 revenue fell 23% to $32 million, reflecting a 27% drop in lithium prices and reduced sales volumes. Yet the segment's strategic moves suggest a longer view. The Bitterfeld lithium hydroxide refinery in Germany—a $1.3 billion project—has begun producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide, with commercial shipments expected soon. This facility, designed to supply Europe's EV industry, is a linchpin of AMG's ambition to reduce reliance on volatile lithium prices.

Equally significant is AMG's partnership with Grupo Lagoa to develop Portugal's first lithium concentrate mine. Targeting 8,000–9,000 tons annually by mid-2027, the project taps into Europe's hunger for domestic supply chains, mitigating risks from Asian-dominated lithium markets.

Vanadium's Hidden Gains: Tax Credits and Strategic Expansion

AMG Vanadium also faced headwinds, with revenue down 7% to $154 million due to lower ferrovanadium sales. But the segment's adjusted EBITDA held up thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act's Section 45X tax credit, which boosted chrome metal profitability. The division's $15 million investment in a U.S. aluminothermic plant—set to produce 6,500 tons of chrome metal annually by early 2026—reflects a smart pivot toward higher-margin products. Meanwhile, the SARBV “Supercenter” in Saudi Arabia, now with an environmental permit, signals AMG's ambition to dominate vanadium processing in the Middle East.

The Growth Engine: AMG Technologies' Order Backlog and Antimony Boom

The real star of Q1 was AMG Technologies, which reported a 34% revenue surge to $202 million, driven by soaring antimony prices and strong demand for its high-tech furnace systems. Its order backlog hit a record $416 million, with a 1.71x book-to-bill ratio, highlighting pent-up demand for equipment used in turbine blades and advanced alloys. This segment's 271% leap in adjusted EBITDA to $39.4 million proves that AMG's bets on industrial technology are paying off.

Resilience Through Liquidity and Discipline

AMG's financial health underpins its ability to weather volatility. With $286 million in unrestricted cash and $486 million in total liquidity, it has ample room to fund growth without overleveraging. Despite a 2% rise in net debt to $476 million, its focus on “small, accretive investments”—such as the Portugal lithium project—avoids overextension. The raised 2025 EBITDA guidance to $170 million+ and its $500 million+ five-year target reflect confidence in these strategies.

Investment Case: A Play on Critical Materials with Execution to Match

AMG's Q1 results are a masterclass in turning sector headwinds into opportunities. While lithium and vanadium prices remain volatile, its vertical integration—from mining to advanced manufacturing—reduces commodity exposure. The Bitterfeld refinery and Portugal mine lock in future supply contracts, while Technologies' order backlog secures near-term cash flows. For investors, AMG offers exposure to two critical EV materials (lithium and vanadium) plus a high-margin industrial tech business—all underpinned by a strong balance sheet.

Recommendation: AMG's shares have lagged broader markets in recent quarters, but its Q1 outperformance and strategic clarity suggest a re-rating is overdue. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition should consider adding AMG to portfolios, especially as lithium prices stabilize and its new projects come online. The stock's current valuation—trading at ~8x 2025E EBITDA—appears undemanding given its growth trajectory.

Urge senators to retain clean energy tax credits

The House has recently voted to repeal from the budget clean energy tax credits previously passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.

This is bad — really bad — for both our wallets as well as our health.

Now, it is up to our senators to hold the line and prevent these clean energy credits from being repealed!

The four main reasons to reach out to our senators is to let them know that repealing these tax credits would:

Effectively be an electricity and gas tax of up to 7% by 2035, estimated to be $2,000 yearly on each American household.

Harm the clean energy projects under way, which represent hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of investment dollars to communities across the country. MIT and Rhodium’s Clean Investment Monitor illustrate that these investments are mostly in batteries, EVs and solar panel developments.

Cut the amount of new clean power generation built over the next decade in half. This puts Americans at greater risk of blackouts, as it is estimated that U.S. power demand will increase by 25%-50% over the next decade.

Cause our nation to experience increased pollution emissions of 3 billion tons over the next decade, worsening the health of Americans, leading to thousands of extra premature deaths in America.

Urge our senators, Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin, to work to retain these tax credits as their repeal would be a bad deal for us all.

What kind of Christian are you?

I was entertained by the recent conversation between U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Tucker Carson. While the exchange was heated, one mention from the senator caught my attention — when he explained his position on supporting Israel is because he is Christian.

While I applaud his candor for publicly acknowledging his faith position, it is still disturbing the only Christian value about which he is adamant is supporting the state of Israel.

What about the biblical messages of love thy neighbor, care for the poor and needy, help those in need, bear one another’s burden, do good and share with others, serve one another in love, be generous, and most importantly, love as Jesus loved?

I see a clear divide in the senator’s party on these core Christian values. The senator’s own voting record shows he is against any government-led program to help the less fortunate.

So, the question is: What type of Christian are you?

Our faith is our moral compass. However, for a sitting senator to assert in a public forum that U.S. foreign policy is based on the Bible is disturbing. Imagine a similar statement from a Muslim public figure. Never mind, Ilhan Omar was publicly smeared for her comments (translated incorrectly) as recent as last year.

We cannot separate ourselves from our faith. But we can be just in applying our faith values properly and equitably.

All faiths are universally promoting one core message: Love for Humanity. Let’s agree on that and make this a better world for ourselves and our children. Amen.

Fourth of July a time to honor our freedom and the duty that comes with it

As we celebrate this Fourth of July with fireworks and parades, I find myself reflecting on a deeper, quieter kind of patriotism — loyalty.

Loyalty is often best understood through the simplest of symbols: a dog. A dog does not waver. It stands by its owner in sunshine or storm, not for reward, but because its heart knows no other way. In that steadfast companionship is a lesson for all of us.

In a world full of division, loyalty may feel like a forgotten virtue. But in truth, it is the very thread that binds our families, communities and our country together. Without loyalty, no relationship — personal or national — can truly thrive.

It’s more than sentiment; it’s a commitment to serve, to stand by truth and to protect the greater good.

The loyal dog reminds us that true devotion asks for no spotlight — only presence, patience and an unwavering heart.

I think of those who serve the nation not with slogans, but with quiet acts of faithfulness.

As an American Ahmadi Muslim, loyalty to one’s nation is part of my faith. To me, true patriotism means contributing to peace, justice and unity — not just on holidays, but every day.

Let us honor not just the freedom we enjoy, but the duty that comes with it: to act with integrity, to uplift others and to protect the values that make this nation strong.

And on this Fourth of July, there is no better time to remember that.

Tell representatives to speak up against National Institutes of Health cuts

Prior to running for office, I volunteered for the Alzheimer’s Association — an issue I’m passionate about, partly because of its widespread impacts: in Wisconsin in 2020, there were approximately 110,900 individuals living with Alzheimer’s. In 2021, there were 2,371 deaths attributed to the disease.

When cuts to the National Institutes of Healt’s budget and research grants were announced, jeopardizing millions meant for Alzheimer’s research being conducted right here in Wisconsin, I was flabbergasted. I understand that cuts to research dollars may seem frivolous when most are worried about everyday expenses, but investing in this research doesn’t just save lives — it lowers costs of living, too.

Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s is painful, expensive and time intensive. Dementia caregivers are forced to cover higher out-of-pocket expenses than other caregivers, and last year, there was nearly $1 billion in Medicaid payments made to Wisconsinites with some type of dementia. Those who can’t afford care for a loved one are forced to work fewer hours or leave the workforce completely to look after them.

The search for efficient, cost-effective treatments is so important to address our aging population, and that’s what makes the recent NIH cuts so devastating. Wisconsinites across the board are the ones who will pay if we defund the groundbreaking research taking place within our very own state.

I urge you to make your voice heard. Contact your representatives in Washington and tell them to speak up against these cuts for the good of our communities.

From the future of AI to energy security and net zero, it’s a broad and ambitious plan. Our experts assess what it tells us about how the UK economy – and the jobs it offers – could look in future.

Nuclear placed firmly in the centre of the UK’s low-carbon future

Doug Specht, Reader in Cultural Geography and Communication, University of Westminster

For clean energy and industrial growth, the strategy presents an ambitious and comprehensive vision. And it seeks to establish the UK as a global leader in clean energy manufacturing and innovation. A key strength lies in its substantial investment commitments, however this includes £14.2 billion for the controversial Sizewell C nuclear power station and more than £2.5 billion for a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) programme.

Nuclear energy remains controversial – nevertheless, the strategy firmly places it as a central pillar for low-carbon, reliable energy and national security.

The strategy also targets high-growth sectors, prioritises regional development and introduces support schemes and regulatory reforms to tackle high electricity costs for industry, and slow grid connections. Yet despite these potential strengths, there are notable challenges. Implementation risks are significant, given the ten-year timeframe and potential shifts in political priorities.

And regional disparities and social inequalities may not be fully addressed, as the focus is on high-potential city regions. Some areas could be left behind. Skills shortages in engineering and digital sectors persist, and there is not enough detail on reskilling and lifelong learning. The importance of supply chain resilience, especially for the critical minerals needed for the green transition is acknowledged but not fully assured.

Overall, the strategy is ambitious and well-structured. But a reliance on nuclear rather than true renewables is seeking a quick win with high risks and high costs. A more radical and inclusive plan that expanded green infrastructure, and provided details of resilient growth across all regions and sectors, would have been welcomed.

An innovation boost for the UK’s world-leading creative industries

Bernard Hay, Head of Policy at the Creative Industries Policy and Evidence Centre, Newcastle University

The plan for the creative industries is a significant step forward for this critical sector. With multiple new commitments announced on areas ranging from scale-up finance and AI to skills, exports and freelance support, there is a lot to welcome for the sector. After all, it already accounts for over 5% of the UK’s annual gross value added (or GVA – which measures the value of goods and services) and 14% of its services exports.

One key aspect is boosting creative industries’ research and development (R&D), which is a driver of innovation, productivity and growth. This includes £100 million for the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s clusters programme, which supports location-based, creative R&D partnerships between universities and industry.

And by the end of the year, HMRC will publish clarification on what types of activity are eligible for R&D tax relief, to include arts activities that meet certain criteria. This is a nuanced change, but together with the other plans, it could have a catalytic effect on innovation in the sector.

Supporting regional creative economies is a golden thread running through this plan. A new £4 billion group capital initiative from the British Business Bank, announced earlier in the spending review, will be an important source of scale-up finance for small and medium-sized creative businesses that face barriers in accessing capital.

It is also welcome to see the government both increasing creative industries investment in several city-regions and supporting places to join up and work together through “creative corridors”. Coupled with the ongoing devolution of powers and funding in England, the next decade provides a huge opportunity for local policy innovation. This includes sharing and scaling proven strategies in growing regional creative economies.

An effective industrial strategy relies on high-quality data and analysis to support it. This is especially true when dealing with a rapidly evolving part of the economy such as the creative industries. The new plan includes commitments to strengthen the evidence base, including by increasing access to official statistics. This is good news not only for researchers, but for the whole sector.

Advanced manufacturing: promising plans, but persistent problems

Michael Lewis, Professor of Operations and Supply Management, University of Bath

The government plans to invest £4.3 billion in advanced manufacturing. This covers research-driven production in sectors including automotive, aerospace and advanced materials (engineered substances that are especially useful in these industries). Some firms may also get energy cost relief through green levy exemptions.

A long-term plan is overdue, but the challenges are huge. Automotive production is targeted to rise substantially, but the sector will still depend heavily on a range of critical imports. The aerospace sector will start 40,000 apprenticeships by 2035, yet further education funding remains below 2010 levels. Much of the promised investment appears to be the repackaging of existing funding.

Most importantly, how to deliver these changes remains unclear. There are good ideas, like £99 million to expand the relatively successful Made Smarter Adoption programme to help small and medium-sized enterprises employ digital technology. But when helping small firms adopt basic digital tools counts as policy success, it shows how far UK manufacturing has fallen behind competitors. Likewise, when you need a new “connections accelerator service” just to help companies connect to the grid, it shows the scale of basic infrastructure problems that undermine grander ambitions.

Overall, the strategy marks real progress. However, without clear delivery plans, it reads more like a wish list than an action plan. This explains why industry reactions have been cautiously optimistic at best.

A chance to take the lead in the global AI race

Kamran Mahroof, Associate Professor of Supply Chain Analytics and Programme Leader for the MSc in the Applied Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics, University of Bradford

From a digital and technologies perspective, the industrial strategy appears to signal a strong commitment to anchoring the nation at the forefront of the global AI race. The proposed Sovereign AI Unit shows an intent to ensure national control and access to critical AI infrastructure, computational power and expertise.

This is pivotal, not only for research and development, but also for national security and economic resilience in an increasingly AI-driven world. It points to a recognition that relying solely on external providers for cutting-edge AI capabilities carries inherent risks.

Besides, some of the world’s most innovative AI businesses are based in the UK. British companies are pushing the limits of what is feasible, from Synthesia’s advances in synthetic media to DeepMind’s developments in machine learning. In sectors including public safety, insurance and defence, smaller firms like Faculty, Tractable and Mind Foundry are also having a significant impact.

Complementing this, the AI Growth Zones are designed to act as regional magnets for investment and innovation, particularly in the realm of data centres and high-density computational facilities. By streamlining planning and providing preferential access to energy, these zones could accelerate the development of the physical infrastructure needed.

This decentralised approach has received more than 200 bids already from local authorities. It also has the potential to spread the economic benefits of AI beyond established tech hubs, encouraging new regional powerhouses and creating high-skilled jobs right across the UK.

Taken as a whole, these projects show a deliberate effort to develop core competencies and draw in private-sector funding. This puts the UK in a position to benefit from AI’s potential. This effort to develop national AI capabilities is not a new idea – it echoes the US AI executive order and the EU’s AI Act.

However, given the dominance of global tech giants, the UK needs to define “sovereignty” in practice and decide whether it is willing to provide large-scale funding. At a time when debates continue around the UK’s defence budget — a field now deeply intertwined with AI – more transparency is needed on how these ambitions will be funded.

Growth plans for financial services – and moves to share the benefits beyond London

Sarah Hall, 1931 Professor of Geography, University of Cambridge

One of the most striking elements of the new plan is that it places financial services much more centrally compared to previous approaches.

There are good reasons for doing this. Financial services are a vital component of the UK economy, contributing close to 9% of economic output in 2023. Clearly then, an industrial strategy without one of the most important economic sectors would make little sense.

There is also a welcome emphasis on the ways in which financial services can grow, not only as a sector in its own right, but also to be better integrated in supporting the growth of other parts of the economy. Some important policy moves have already been announced, such as changes to pension funds aimed at increasing their investment in large infrastructure projects.

In order to meet these ambitions, the strategy is right to note that financial services need to be supported, not only in London but also across the many clusters around the UK. These include, for example, Edinburgh, Manchester and Bristol.

There will be more details in the sector plan, released alongside Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ Mansion House speech on July 15. At that point, we will be able to assess the measures intended to grapple with two longstanding issues for UK financial services. That is, how does the government bridge the gap between finance and the “real” economy (goods and non-financial services)? And how does it bridge the gap between London and the rest of the UK?",https://images.theconversation.com/files/677039/original/file-20250627-56-cuqtnm.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C154%2C4000%2C2000&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-28 07:00:51.149058

The Joint Committee on Taxation released their score on the costs of these tax provisions under ‘current policy’ scoring—they estimated that the tax provisions would only cost $441 billion based on the assumption that expiring TCJA provisions would be extended. In reality, the Senate Finance Committee proposal would cost well over $4 trillion over the next decade.

Similar to the House-passed bill, the majority of the bill’s cost comes from the extension of tax credits included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. That price tag comes with a stark trade-off. The Finance draft preserves the priciest pieces of the 2017 tax law, sweetens biofuel (45Z) and carbon-capture (45Q) breaks, and lets oil-and-gas producers deduct drilling costs under the new minimum tax. To offset even a fraction of the cost, it would slash or kill nearly every Inflation Reduction Act credit—electric-vehicle, hydrogen, wind, solar, and manufacturing incentives—while layering on intricate foreign-entity rules that risk slowing investment more than stopping unwanted foreign influence. The net result is trillions in new debt, a thinner toolkit for cutting emissions, and a tax code tilting back toward legacy fuels.

Summary of Energy Tax Provisions in the Senate Finance Proposal

Expansion and Extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit

The Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is a per-gallon biofuel tax credit designed to subsidize production of transportation fuels with low or no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This credit came into effect at the beginning of 2025 and is intended to replace a suite of recently expired biofuel tax credits (Section 40, 40A, 40B, 6426, and 6427). The Senate Finance proposal would extend the expiration date of Section 45Z from the end of 2027 to the end of 2031, as well as lessen lifecycle GHG assessment standards. The latter change would significantly broaden eligibility for the credit and effectively allow first-generation, food-based biofuels like corn ethanol and biodiesel to qualify. The draft text would allow the use of distinct emissions rates for each feedstock and specifically prohibits negative emission rates, except for renewable natural gas.

The Senate proposal would also reduce the credit by 20% for fuels produced using foreign feedstock after 2025. It would end the double-dipping of 45Z and the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) excise tax credit under Section 6426(k) and established parity between and other transportation fuel under 45Z (SAF is currently eligible for a maximum credit of $0.35 per gallon, whereas other fuels are only eligible for a maximum credit of $0.20 per gallon).

According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) score of the Senate Finance proposal, the extension and expansion of 45Z would cost taxpayers $57 billion from FY2025 to FY2034.

Expansion of the 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit

Structured like a carbon production tax credit, Section 45Q provides a credit for every ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) captured from power plants or other industrial sources and permanently stored underground in geological formations. The IRA expanded and extended the credit by lowering the minimum capture threshold, increasing the credit amount, and extending eligibility to facilities that begin construction before the end of 2032. The Treasury Department estimates that 45Q will cost taxpayers $36.2 billion over FY2024-FY2033.

Under current law, facilities that are placed in service after 2022 can claim $17 ($36 in the case of a direct air capture, or DAC, facility) for every ton of carbon captured and then stored in geological sequestration, and $12/ton (or $26/ton in the case of a DAC facility) if carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or other uses. EOR is a technique that boosts production by injecting carbon into depleted wells to eke out more oil and gas. The credit amount is inflation-adjusted and can be multiplied by 5 if certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The Senate proposal would increase the credit amount for EOR and other uses to $17/ton ($36/ton in the case of a DAC facility) for facilities placed in service after 2022.

JCT estimates that this expansion of 45Q (combined with the effect of the foreign entity of concern restrictions) would cost taxpayers an additional $14.2 billion over the next decade.

No Changes to Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

The Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit provides up to $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced and sold by qualifying nuclear power facilities, with the credit reduced for plants that earn more income from electricity sales. The credit applies to electricity produced after calendar year 2023 and is currently set to expire at the end of 2032. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated it would cost taxpayers $30 billion from FY2022 to FY2031.

The Senate proposal does not include any changes to the Section 45U credit amount or expiration date, but does impose some foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions that also applies to another credit (see FEOC explanation below). It would also disallow credits for facilities using fuel produced in North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran after 2027 (except for contracts in effect before 2023).

No Changes to Section 45 and Section 48 Renewable Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits

The Senate proposal does not include any provisions related to the Section 45 and Section 48 Renewable Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits, which generally expired at the end of 2024 (except for geothermal heat pumps for the purpose of Section 48, which have a placed-in-service deadline of 1/1/2035). The credits have been largely replaced by the technology-neutral clean electricity production and investment tax credits—Section 45Y and Section 48E. (see changed to 45Y and 48E below)

Special Tax Treatment of Carbon Capture, Hydrogen Storage, Advanced Nuclear, Hydropower, and Geothermal Energy-Related Income

Under current law, Publicly Traded Partnerships (PTPs) whose interests are traded on public exchanges are generally taxed as corporations. However, if at least 90 percent of a PTP’s gross income comes from qualifying sources—such as rents, gains from the sale of real properties, or income from the exploration, production, processing, refining, transportation, or marketing of minerals or natural resources (including industrial source CO₂ and biofuels)—it can be treated as a partnership instead. This allows the entity to avoid corporate-level taxation by passing through its income to partners.

The Senate proposal includes a provision that would allow income to be considered “qualifying income” for PTPs:

transportation and storage of hydrogen;

generation of electricity or capture of carbon dioxide at certain carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities;

generation of electricity from hydropower, advanced nuclear, and geothermal energy;

operation of property to produce, distribute or use energy produced from geothermal deposits.

For CCS facilities that meet the minimum capture threshold under Section 45Q, income from electricity generation (for power plants), electricity storage, or carbon capture itself would qualify for the credit as long as the facility captures at least 50 percent of its carbon output.

This expansion of PTP qualifying income would cost taxpayers over $3.2 billion from FY2025 to FY2034.

Allowing Intangible Drilling and Development Costs Deductions for the Purpose of Computing Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax

Under current law, the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) imposes a 15% minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of large corporations with an average annual financial statement income exceeding $1 billion, effective in 2023. Corporations pay the larger of the minimum tax or the regular corporate tax, which is set at 21% and includes any additional tax from the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). The AFSI allows for tax depreciation, net of operating losses, and other adjustments that reduce the base of the CAMT.

The Senate Finance proposal would allow operators of oil and gas and geothermal wells to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) from AFSI when calculating CAMT, without any regard for depletion expenses that are taken into account in the financial statement with respect to IDC. Expensing of IDCs is a long-standing oil and gas subsidy established in 1913 that allows all of the non-salvageable costs for drilling an oil or gas well (e.g. wages, fuel, and drilling sit preparation) to be deducted the year these costs are incurred, while other industries must expense costs slowly over the life of an asset.

This provision would effectively allow oil and gas drillers to avoid the CAMT altogether. Although the JCT estimates that this provision would cost $427 million over the next decade, a prior JCT analysis of the H.R. 662 Promoting Domestic Energy Production Act, a bill that includes the same provision, found that allowing IDC to be deducted for purpose of determining CAMT would cost taxpayers $1.1 billion over a decade.

Dyed Fuel Excise Tax Refund

The Senate Proposal would allow refunds of federal fuel excise taxes on indelibly dyed fuel, starting 180 days after the date of bill enactment. Currently there’s no mechanism to refund the excise tax for fuel that went to non-taxable purposes—dyed fuel only sold for use in off-road vehicles and for agricultural purposes.

Termination of Certain Energy Tax Credits

The following tax credits would be terminated:

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit

This credit would expire for vehicles purchased more than 180 days after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Section 25E Used Clean Vehicle Credit

This credit would expire for vehicles purchased more than 90 days after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit

This credit would expire for vehicles purchased more than 180 days after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

The draft would eliminate the credit for vehicles sold above the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. This “manufacturer’s suggested retail price limitation” is currently in place for the 30D credit for personal vehicles.

For vehicles under 14,000lbs and acquired after June 16, 2025, the draft would impose critical mineral and battery component restrictions. These restrictions are currently in place for the 30D credit.

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit

The credit would expire for property placed in service 12 months after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit

The credit would expire for property placed in service 180 days after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit

The credit would expire for expenditures made 180 days after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2034.

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction

The deduction would expire for property that begins construction 12 months after bill enactment. The credit is currently permanent and not set to expire.

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit

The credit would expire for homes acquired 12 months after bill enactment. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Section 168(e)(3)(B) Cost recovery for qualified clean energy facilities, property and technology

The special 5-year cost recovery for 45Y- and 48E-eligible energy property is repealed if property is placed in service after bill enactment.

Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

The credit would expire for facilities constructed after 2025. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2032.

Early Sunset/Accelerated Phaseout of Existing Credits

Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit

Early phaseout for wind and solar facilities: 60% for facilities that begin construction in 2026, 20% in 2027, 0% thereafter, except for large projects of 1,000MW nameplate capacity and more than 25% on federal land leased before 6/16/2025.

The tax credit is currently set to begin phasing out (100%, then 75%, then 50%) for all facilities either after 2032 or the year after U.S. annual GHG emissions from electricity production are equal of less than 25% of 2022 emissions. The Senate draft would eliminate the “later of” phaseout under current law to start phaseout after 2032 (100% in 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035, and 0% in 2036) for other technologies/facilities.

Eliminate cost/unavailability exceptions to the domestic content requirement for entities electing to receive credit as direct pay for facilities constructed after 2025.

No credit allowed for wind and solar properties leased/rented by a third party

Allows the use of “existing studies” to determine lifecycle GHG emissions rates

Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Early phaseout for wind and solar facilities: 60% for facilities placed in service in 2026, 20% in 2027, 0% thereafter.

Eliminates “later of” phaseout under current law to start phaseout after 2032 (100% in 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035, and 0% in 2036) for other technologies/facilities.

Increases domestic content bonus requirement to be on par with 45Y:

Facilities that begin construction before 6/16/2025: 40%, or 20% for offshore wind

Facilities that begin construction before 2026: 45%, or 27.5% for offshore wind

Facilities that begin construction before 2027 50%, or 35% for offshore wind

Facilities that begin construction after 2027: 55%

No credit allowed for wind and solar properties leased/rented by a third party

Allows the use of “existing studies” to determine lifecycle GHG emissions rates

Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Terminates the credit for wind components produced and sold after 2027. The credit is currently set to expire for wind components sold after 2032.

Delayed phaseout for critical minerals by one year: 100% in 2030, 75% in 2031, 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033, 0% thereafter.

Keeps the same phaseout for all other components: 100% in 2029, 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031, 25% in 2032, 0% thereafter.

Section 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit

The 48C credit is capped at a total of $10 billion in allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Senate draft would disallow the reissuing of funds for any revoked project certification, effective on bill enactment.

Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions

Under current law, foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions apply only to the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit and the Section 48D Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit. The Senate proposal would apply complex FEOC restrictions to the credits that aren’t immediately terminated, with extensive rules for the 45Y, 48E, and 45X credits.

The Senate proposal denies credits to entities that are deemed to be “specified foreign entities” or “foreign-influenced entities”, and it would also deny credits if facilities (for 45Y/48E) or components (for 45X) include “material assistance” from prohibited foreign entities, which is determined by calculated material assistance cost ratios.

Here’re some key definitions related to FEOC:

Prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) (including specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities)

Specified Foreign Entity (SFE)

Similar to the definitions set forth in the House-passed bill, an SFE is generally a foreign entity related to or controlled by adversary nations.

Foreign Influenced Entity (FIE)

an entity whose covered officers can be appointed by SFEs

more than 25% owned by SFEs

more than 40% of its debt owned or held by SFEs

for 45Y, 48E, and 45X, an entity that makes a payment to an SFE under an agreement that gives the SFE “effective control” over either a qualified facility/energy storage technology or critical mineral processing/eligible component production

agreements do not include “bona fide” sales of intellectual property

Material assistance from PFEs

Credits are disallowed if an increasing “material assistance cost ratio (CR)” of content unrelated to PFEs is not met

For qualified facilities, CR = cost of non-PFE manufactured products incorporated into the facility/total cost of manufactured products incorporated into the facility

For eligible components, CR = cost of non-PFE direct material costs/total direct material costs

FEOC restrictions generally apply to 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45U, and 45Z beginning in the taxable year after the date of bill enactment. Additionally, FEOC restrictions apply to credit transferability as well. The IRA authorized “transferability” for various energy tax credits, which allows entities to transfer all or a portion of an eligible credit to an unrelated taxpayer. The Senate proposal disallows transfers of credit to SFEs.

Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for facilities that begin construction after 12/31/2025 and receive material assistance from PFEs. CR threshold percentages for receiving material assistance are:

Construction or sale during 2026 – 40% qualified facility or energy storage technology, 50% solar energy components, 85% wind energy components, 50% inverters, 60% battery components, 0% critical minerals.

Construction or sale during 2027 – 45% qualified facility or energy storage technology, 60% solar energy components, 90% wind energy components, 55% inverters, 65% battery components, 25% critical minerals.

Construction or sale during 2028 – 50% qualified facility or energy storage technology, 70% solar energy components, 60% inverters, 70% battery components, 30% critical minerals.

Construction or sale during 2029 – 55% qualified facility or energy storage technology, 80% solar energy components, 65% inverters, 80% battery components, 40% critical minerals.

Construction or sale after 2029 – 60% qualified facility or energy storage technology, 85% solar energy components, 70% inverters, 85% battery components, 50% critical minerals.

No transfers of credit to SFEs

Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for facilities that begin construction after 12/31/2025 and receive material assistance from PFEs. The same increasing CR threshold percentages for receiving material assistance apply.

Special 10-year recapture rule if the claimant makes a payment that is deemed to confer effective control under FIE definitions

No transfers of credit to SFEs

Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for facilities that receive material assistance from PFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment. The same increasing CR threshold percentages for receiving material assistance apply.

No transfers of credit to SFEs

Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year 2 years after enactment.

No credit allowed for facilities using fuel produced in North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran after 12/31/2027 (except for contracts in effect before 1/1/2023).

No transfers of credit to SFEs

Section 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No transfers of credit to SFEs

Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit

No credit for SFEs, beginning in the tax year after enactment.

No credit for FIEs, beginning in the tax year 2 years after enactment.

No transfers of credit to SFEs

H.R. 1, the budget bill containing many of the Trump administration's domestic policy priorities, would eliminate a number of tax credits for renewable energy projects, many of which were created by the Democratic-led Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Shapiro warned the hardest impact would fall on those slated to open soon. In the House version, most of the clean energy tax credits would end abruptly, instead of in 2032, when they were initially set to expire.

The Senate version is slightly more lenient. Tax credits for wind and solar projects would instead be phased out, with decreasing credits for projects that break ground in 2026 and 2027.

The Senate also moved to keep certain tax credits for nuclear, hydropower, battery and geothermal projects until 2034. Shapiro applauded this change.

Still, he specifically addressed several that have already been announced, which he said could suffer under the changes. That includes two projects in Clearfield County that he noted are collectively anticipated to create more than 900 jobs.

Shapiro said the bill could also effectively end state programs designed to help community institutions lower their energy bills. He said the Solar for Schools program, for example, could potentially lose over $30 million.

For the second straight Tuesday, various environmental groups have gathered in front of Sen. Thom Tillis’s office, as GOP senators push to pass a bill that would scale back clean energy tax credits ahead of their self-imposed July 4 deadline.

The protest, organized by Indivisible Guilford and the Guilford Clean Power Now Coalition (GCPN), continued to advocate for clean energy provisions in the upcoming reconciliation bill, known as “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

“We’re here today because it’s not clear that Senator Tillis is going to continue to stand up for clean energy and the current set of tax incentives,” said Margaret Rowlett, co-founder of the GCPN, pointing out a recent advancement of the bill in U.S. Congress. “We need continued federal support for renewable energy and the expansion of solar and wind energy, including residential solar.”

The Senate Finance Committee, of which Senator Tillis is a member, revised and released the House-passed bill last week, proposing a complete phase-out of tax credits for solar and wind energy by 2028 while extending incentives for hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal energy through 2036.

Rowlett referred to a letter sent in April to U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune by four Republican senators, including Tillis, in which they expressed support for renewable energy tax credits and opposed the full repeal of certain individual incentives, warning that such action would “create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning, and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy.”

Tillis did not immediately respond to The Journal’s request for comment.

North Carolina has received substantial funding and support through the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in 2022 under the Biden administration. Echoing the stance of his predecessor, Gov. Josh Stein has praised the law for creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs and drawing $24 billion in clean energy investments to the state, while warning that repealing tax incentives could cost North Carolinians an additional $200 per year on their household energy bills.

“With insufficient clean energy deployment, utility companies will burn more natural gas, not only increasing pollution but again raising demand and cost to consumers,” said Ellen Van Velsor, a NC state coordinator for Citizens Climate Lobby, during the protest.

“I’m here today, we are here, to urge Sen. Tillis to stand firm on his commitment by voting no on a reconciliation package that does so much damage to our health, the economy and the environment, and to continue to support NC clean energy investment and job growth.”

Some of the plaintiffs in the litigation say they were forced to reduce staff and adjust programming after their funding abruptly ended.

“If you cannot count on an awarded grant from the federal government, who can you count on?” she said.","The Environmental Protection Agency and its administrator, Lee Zeldin, face a class-action lawsuit after canceling $3 billion in grant funding for climate and environmental programs in disadvantaged communities.

The lawsuit, filed June 25 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues the EPA violated Congress’ spending power and legislative authority by eliminating the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Clean Air Act.

“The EPA’s termination of the program is unlawful,” the complaint says. “It violates the bedrock separation-of-powers principles by effectively repealing a congressional enactment and impounding funds based on nothing more than the President’s disagreement with policies Congress duly enacted.”

The litigation was filed on behalf of a coalition of more than 20 nonprofits, Tribes and municipalities from across the country that had secured funding for community-based programs aimed at disaster preparedness, workforce development, air quality, flood control and high energy costs. The programs involved things like installing pollution notification systems and replacing lead pipes and were designed to strengthen communities against more damaging weather events while including community members in decision-making that affected their environment and health.

The Southern Environmental Law Center, Earthjustice, Public Rights Project and Lawyers for Good Government filed the lawsuit, which calls on the court to compel the EPA to reinstate the grants on behalf of 350 recipients and also provide resources to help the funded programs succeed. The complaint names as defendants the EPA and Zeldin. Representatives for the EPA declined to comment on pending litigation.

The litigation recognizes that “this administration’s wholesale decisions are having significant impacts on communities across the country that are working together to solve environmental problems in their communities,” said Ben Grillot, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “The administration’s decision to do this was unlawful and is not based on the merits of the projects but on a disagreement with Congress, which is a clear violation of the separation of powers.”

The litigation centers on two executive orders President Donald Trump issued in January. The first, entitled “Unleashing American Energy,” directed federal agencies to stop disbursing funds allocated under the Inflation Reduction Act, a monumental measure enacted during the Biden administration that included clean energy initiatives. The other, called “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” mandated that all equity-related grants or contracts be terminated within 60 days.

Some of the plaintiffs in the litigation say they were forced to reduce staff and adjust programming after their funding abruptly ended. Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit, had planned to put its grant toward projects in five communities in rural Virginia, where declining coal resources have challenged the region’s economy.

“The coal industry in the area was not killed by regulation. It was not killed by tree huggers. It declined largely because all of the coal that it was financially feasible and safe to get was gone. It was mined,” said Emma Kelly, new economy program manager at Appalachian Voices. “It has not been clear what will replace that, and people have been struggling with that loss of identity.”

One project in flood-prone Pound, Virginia, involved the construction of a riverwalk designed to prevent floodwaters from disturbing dilapidated buildings and dispersing harmful substances associated with mold and asbestos. The town cannot fund the project on its own, and without the grant the work has not proceeded. Kelly said the loss has been heartbreaking in the region.

“People were disillusioned before we got these grants. This area has a very long history of being extracted from, being overlooked, being looked down upon, and our organization—especially my team—has spent several years working with these counties to build up trust,” Kelly said.

“If you cannot count on an awarded grant from the federal government, who can you count on?” she said. “That is supposed to be the most reliable source that you can get. So people, I think, felt foolish and as if their time had been wasted and like, if this wasn’t going to happen there’s not going to be anything else coming down the pipeline.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2216113400.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 06:01:10.404340

EPA, the EPA, under the George W. Bush administration, had declined to make an endangerment finding.
They’ve made the announcement they’re going after the endangerment finding, and I think they will, but they haven’t done it yet.
The career people who are the ones who are the real experts on this, and the biggest tragedy of the Trump administration is to try and destroy that expertise.
What do you make of the Trump Administration and its efforts to cut funding from EJ programs and close such offices altogether.
LAZARUS: It’s a great question.","From our collaborating partner “Living on Earth,” public radio’s environmental news magazine, an interview by host and executive producer Steve Curwood with Richard Lazarus, the Charles Stebbins Fairchild Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.

Record summer heat is scorching the northern hemisphere around the world from Japan and China to Europe and North America. Blistering heat waves in the U.S. have already smashed records from Minneapolis to Boston to Philadelphia with “dangerous” heat index numbers.

Records will likely keep getting broken as steadily increasing emissions of greenhouse gases continue to overheat the planet. But the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency no longer wants to use its authority to do something about the climate crisis. This June the EPA proposed eliminating regulations that limit climate warming gases from power plants, about a quarter of U.S. emissions.

Here to explain is Harvard Law Professor Richard Lazarus, an environmental and constitutional law scholar and author of The Rule of Five: Making Climate History at the Supreme Court. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

CURWOOD: Professor, what was your initial reaction to the EPA’s proposal to roll back rules for CO2-emitting power plants?

LAZARUS: Oh, I mean, obviously it’s devastatingly sad, but it’s no surprise, right? We have a president who campaigned on it, and we have an EPA administrator who, a few months ago, said that his goal was to basically put a dagger in the heart of climate change religion. So by the time this latest proposal came out, we were ready and steeled for it, but still in the greater arc of things, it’s discouraging. Climate change is not going away, and every day we lose in addressing it makes it exponentially harder to do anything about it.

CURWOOD: Indeed. Now, this decision flies in the face of, I guess, what’s called the endangerment finding by the EPA back in the day, which was based on a Supreme Court case called Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency. Please give us a brief overview of the case and the endangerment finding.

LAZARUS: So in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA, under the George W. Bush administration, had declined to make an endangerment finding. They didn’t say greenhouse gases didn’t endanger public health and welfare. They said, We’re not going to decide that issue. What this U.S. Supreme Court did in Massachusetts v. EPA is they first said, very importantly, for the first time ever, greenhouse gases are air pollutants within the meaning of the Clean Air Act. That’s actually the central holding of the case, because before that, their EPA had never regulated them. Under the Bush administration, they said they’re not air pollutants.

CURWOOD: So what would it mean for the EPA to be successful in going back on such a historic decision?

LAZARUS: Well, if they were successful in making a finding upheld by the courts, the admission to greenhouse gases cannot reasonably anticipate it to endanger public health welfare. That would end regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. And the Clean Air Act is our only federal tool for regulating greenhouse gases. So whether it’s airplanes, cars, power plants, landfills, oil and gas exploration, all of which emit greenhouse gasses, all that Clean Act regulation would end simultaneously.

CURWOOD: So from your perspective, as a lawyer, as a law professor, how likely is it that the Trump administration’s EPA will succeed in making such a reversal?

LAZARUS: Well, I will tell you, when I first heard they were contemplating this—they didn’t do it in the first administration—my reaction was, make my day. In other words, try to challenge it, because you’ll be wasting your time. I’ll have to tell you, in a Trump 2.0, my thinking has evolved, and I’m more concerned. And let me explain why. The science hasn’t changed at all. There’s no question that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. The question is whether the Trump administration can find some hook, some statutory hook, some technical error the EPA, they’ll allege, made in making those findings and use it to unravel it. The science is no less clear.

So let me tell you what they’re doing, so far. They’ve made the announcement they’re going after the endangerment finding, and I think they will, but they haven’t done it yet. What they’ve done is something that leads up to it, and that is they’ve said we’re no longer to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, which is a major source of greenhouse gases. And they haven’t done it by saying they’re going to withdraw the engagement funding. They’ve done it by saying to regulate those power plants, EPA must make a decision in the administrator’s judgment that greenhouse gas emissions from power plants maybe significantly contribute to air pollution that may reasonably anticipate endanger public health and welfare. So they’re not going after the endangerment finding yet itself. They’re saying it requires significant contribution, and here they’re playing some games with precedent and language. So they’re not really going after the science. They’re going after what significantly means in the statute. They’re trying to make this a question of law.

CURWOOD: And from your perspective, how successful will they be at picking this net?

LAZARUS: Well, I hope they’re not successful. I’ll tell you what the argument is and why I still worry. I wouldn’t have worried eight, nine years ago. They’re going to argue the word “significantly” is a word to which means it’s got to be important, and a word which the administrator gets a lot of discretion in deciding whether it’s met or not, and they’re going to say it’s not met because significance is a policy determination, and that allows the administrator to consider costs. And here, the administrator is going to decide that “significant” depends upon whether or not you can show that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage from power plants will affect climate change worldwide. And given how much emissions are worldwide, the power plants only consist of now 3.5 percent because they’ve gone down a lot. They say, look at such a small percentage, and you’re not going to reduce it to zero. So we don’t think that’s significant. I think that argument should lose, clearly. Power plants are one of the largest sources in the United States that meets, I think, any fair definition is significant. But here’s what worries me, Steve. I’m not worried about the D.C. Circuit. They’ll hear the case first. I worry about the United States Supreme Court. In the last several years, in case after case after case, the United States Supreme Court has ruled against environmentalists in sweeping opinions. They don’t seem to buy-in to the importance of these laws and the things they’ve successfully done for the past 50 years. So I’m worried when I shouldn’t have to be worried, but it makes me worried.

CURWOOD: So I mean, across the board, it sounds like the Trump administration is just trying to throw pretty much any regulation under the bus that they feel gets in the way of business. Or am I overstating?

LAZARUS: Unfortunately, you’re not overstating it. It’s astounding what the Trump administration has done. The day one executive order Unleashing American Energy targeted all the climate change regulation. They’re trying to eliminate not just existing regulations, like every single one, but they’re doing more than that. Even more troubling than that, they’re trying to eliminate the EPA bureaucracy, the career employees, the scientists, the engineers, the economists. They’re the ones who write the regs. They’re the ones who do the work, the political officials, the few that come in, whether it’s Obama, Biden or Trump or Bush, they come and go. The career people who are the ones who are the real experts on this, and the biggest tragedy of the Trump administration is to try and destroy that expertise. If they succeed, that’ll make it very hard three years from now, if there’s a more favorable administration to put Humpty Dumpty back together again. That’s my biggest worry.

CURWOOD: Now, they would argue that, look, all these rules and regulations get in the way of economic progress, that people need jobs, they need to make money, to support communities, and that they’re there to make the change that the voters told them to make.

LAZARUS: Yeah, I mean, I know you’re right. I know they’ll make that argument. It really is not an argument that can hold up. The fact is, we’ve had these tough laws for 50 years, and our economy has not cratered. Our economy has boomed, and we’ve had both economic growth and environmental protection. And the United States, we now have a gazillion dollar pollution control industry. We have thousands of jobs which depend upon these statutes. We have property values which depend upon these statutes. So at this point, it’s completely backwards to say that climate change regulation is inconsistent with economic growth. It is necessary for economic growth, and if Trump’s policies prevail, our economy will pay the price for it.

CURWOOD: By the way, many of the Biden-era regulations for the environment were designed to advance environmental justice. What do you make of the Trump Administration and its efforts to cut funding from EJ programs and close such offices altogether. How does this proposal fit in the bigger picture?

LAZARUS: Well, it’s tragically sad. Environmental justice is very simple. It’s simply saying, “Put your resources where the problems are greatest.” And historically, we hadn’t done that. Historically, government, including EPA, even when well meaning they had not paid adequate attention to the fact that pollution tends to go to the places least able to resist the powerful economic forces which are looking for the path of least resistance. And they were time and time again, poor communities in the country and communities of color. There’s a racial dimension to this too. And the lesson of environmental justice was unless you actually proactively look for that possibility, you’re going to repeat it on and on. So the Biden administration, more than any other, knew that, and they said, “We’re going to target those areas.” It’s actually figuring out where the biggest problems are, where the least enforcement is happening, where the standards are being ignored, and making sure they receive their fair share of a broader regulation. Make sure they receive their fair share of the resources needed to address the climate problems happening right now. It was an entirely sensible approach and the best we had ever done. And it’s really a tragedy to have them go after it as well.

CURWOOD: You’re a professor at Harvard Law School, and you’re tasked with educating the next generation of environmental lawyers, but what’s going on right now is certainly unprecedented. What are you telling your students as they head into this uncertain future?

LAZARUS: It’s a great question. I’ll tell you, there’s a lot for someone like me who’s devoted my life to these issues to be discouraged about right now, to see so much successful environmental law be unraveled for irrational reasons. The one joy I get these days are these students. They are what gives me hope, because they’re my classrooms. They’re ambitious. They want good things. They want to change the world, want to address climate issues and other issues which are really important. They come here, and they’re smart. And more important to me than smart—smarts are a dime a dozen—they’re hard workers. And basically what I tell them these days is the following: This is your time. Pick yourself up. You may be very discouraged by things, but this is your time. Pick yourself up and get to work. You wanted to make a difference on environmental issues? You wanted to make a difference on climate change? Well, guess what? We need you. The country and the world needs you now more than ever. This is not the time to sit back and be despondent. This is a time to work hard because we need you. You didn’t get the benefit of being able to be passive and say, I’ll sit back and enjoy the environment and take hikes. If you want to make a difference, you’ve got to work hard, you’ve got to be focused, you have to be strategic, and you have to be strong and steely and resilient, because a lot of political forces are going to be working against you. And they’re hopeful. I think their time horizon is a little bit different than mine because they’re pretty young. They’ve got about, you know, 50 years on me. They’re more likely to see Trump on what he’s doing, as something, yeah, they’ll live past it and they’ll be ready to go.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2150754047-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 07:00:55.243909

The new plan calls for ending the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV purchases and leases on September 30, along with the $4,000 credit for used EVs.

This marks a significant shift from the previous version of the bill, which proposed a 180-day phase-out for credits after the legislation became law. Under the revised plan, tax credits for leased EVs that are not assembled in North America or that fail to meet specific sourcing requirements would be terminated immediately.

The move underscores a broader Republican pushback against the Biden administration’s pro-EV agenda, which aimed to accelerate electric vehicle adoption and reduce carbon emissions through federal incentives. Republicans argue the current subsidies favor higher-income buyers and distort the auto market, while critics say removing the credits could stall progress toward cleaner transportation and impact domestic EV manufacturing.

If enacted, the rollback could have sweeping implications for automakers and consumers alike. Many carmakers, including Tesla, Ford, and GM, have relied on the tax incentives to boost EV sales, while consumers have used the credits to make EV ownership more affordable amid rising vehicle costs.

The proposed legislation is part of a wider GOP strategy to scale back federal spending on clean energy and shift policy focus away from climate-driven investments. Environmental groups and industry stakeholders are expected to challenge the bill, citing its potential to slow down the EV market and hinder U.S. efforts to combat climate change.

Creating a Civic Resilience Task Force to connect various city services and plan for climate-related emergencies is a crucial step.

Bloomington should actively seek federal funding for climate-readiness programs and leverage its unique position as a potential pilot city.

As summers get hotter and air quality alerts become part of the weekly routine, it’s clear climate change isn’t just happening to coastal cities. It’s happening here. And while that’s daunting, it’s also an opportunity — especially for cities like Bloomington.

We’re not Miami battling sea-level rise or Phoenix frying in 110°F heat. We’re a mid-sized, educated, civically engaged town with just enough resources to matter, and just enough flexibility to move fast. That makes us a perfect testbed for practical climate resilience. I’ve helped write policy language for environmental and disaster planning at different levels of government — mostly behind the scenes, rarely with a podium. What I’ve learned is this: The places that adapt best aren’t always the wealthiest or loudest. They’re the ones that act early, while they still have options.

So what would it look like for Bloomington to lead?

Step One: Treat resilience like infrastructure. Let’s create a Civic Resilience Task Force — a group that connects housing, health, energy and emergency services. Not just to talk, but to plan: What happens when the grid gets overwhelmed by summer heat? Or when wildfire smoke forces school closures? Or when drought hits Lake Monroe? We should stress-test our systems now, not wait for the 3 a.m. wake-up call. And we can partner with Indiana University to make that real. There’s no reason climate and engineering students shouldn’t be modeling urban heat islands or optimizing tree canopy coverage for local neighborhoods.

Step Two: Go after federal funding. Bloomington could be a pilot city for FEMA, EPA or Department of Energy climate-readiness programs. These agencies want cities to test what works — especially ones that aren’t already overloaded with billion-dollar projects. That’s us. Let’s make the most of it.

Step Three: Don’t ignore the weird stuff. Here’s where it gets a little sci-fi. Climate alerts, flood mapping and pollution tracking rely on satellites. If one gets jammed or hacked — whether by a storm, a glitch or international tension — emergency response here can suffer. Same goes for nuclear or chemical accidents that happen far away but impact our supply chains or hospitals. These aren’t abstract threats. They’re real-world risks that just haven’t hit us yet. And preparing for them now is cheaper than cleaning up later.

Bottom Line: We Have the Advantage — If We Use It. Bloomington has the tools, talent and tenacity to be a national example of climate smart readiness. We don’t need to wait for a catastrophe. We can lead by planning ahead — calmly, clearly and without breaking the budget. And hey, even if we only get halfway there, we’ll still be better off than most cities that waited until it was too late.

The Smackover project isn't just about minerals—it's about reshaping the U.S. energy landscape.","The partnership between Halliburton (HAL) and GeoFrame Energy to develop a geothermal and direct lithium extraction (DLE) project in East Texas's Smackover Formation represents a bold step in the convergence of two critical energy sectors. By combining lithium production with renewable geothermal energy, the project aims to address U.S. lithium dependency while advancing low-carbon energy solutions. For investors, this venture offers a rare opportunity to capitalize on the twin trends of energy transition and critical mineral scarcity.

Project Overview: A Dual-Purpose Energy Play

Halliburton's role in designing and drilling demonstration wells for GeoFrame's Smackover project is foundational to scaling production. The project's use of Ekosolve Inc.'s advanced DLE technology—which achieves a 92-95% lithium recovery rate at lower costs—is a key differentiator. Unlike traditional lithium brine extraction, which requires vast evaporation ponds, DLE uses chemical processes to capture lithium directly from geothermal brines. This method reduces land use and operational timelines, making it ideal for rapid deployment.

The first phase will produce up to 3,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate annually by Q1 2026, with full-scale production targeting 83,500 metric tons by 2029. To put this in context, the U.S. currently imports over 90% of its lithium, primarily from Australia and South America. If successful, GeoFrame's project could supply nearly all domestic demand, positioning the U.S. as a self-sufficient lithium producer.

Geothermal Integration: Energy Self-Sufficiency Meets Profitability

The project's geothermal component is equally transformative. Geothermal brines, rich in lithium, will also be harnessed to generate zero-emission electricity via binary cycle turbines. This energy will power the lithium processing facilities, with surplus electricity sold to the grid. Such a setup creates a dual revenue stream: lithium sales and geothermal power generation.

The Smackover Formation's geothermal potential is vast, with temperatures exceeding 200°C at depths of 5,000–10,000 feet. GeoFrame's control of 7,400 acres in this region, coupled with high lithium concentrations (up to 200 mg/L), positions the project as one of the most promising in the U.S. geothermal-lithium space.

Strategic and Environmental Imperatives

The project aligns with the Biden administration's push for domestic critical mineral production under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax credits for lithium projects. Moreover, the integration of geothermal energy reduces the carbon footprint of lithium production, a priority for EV manufacturers and battery suppliers seeking ESG-compliant supply chains.

GeoFrame's emphasis on community benefits—such as job creation and local infrastructure investments—also mitigates regulatory and social risks. In Franklin County and Mount Vernon, where the project is located, this could foster local support critical to long-term viability.

Investment Implications: Playing the Lithium and Geothermal Double Play

For investors, the partnership presents two avenues for exposure:

Halliburton (HAL): As a contractor, Halliburton's role in drilling and well design could boost its short-term revenue, particularly if the demonstration wells meet milestones ahead of Q1 2026. However, its upside is limited to project execution; long-term gains depend on GeoFrame's success.

GeoFrame Energy: While privately held, the project's success could lead to an IPO or acquisition by a major lithium player like Albemarle (ALB) orioneer (IOG). Investors tracking lithium stocks should monitor GeoFrame's progress as a potential disruptor.

Risks and Considerations

Technological Execution: DLE's scalability remains unproven at industrial scale. Any delays or cost overruns could dent investor confidence.

Regulatory Hurdles: Permitting geothermal projects in the U.S. can be lengthy and contentious, even with IRA incentives.

Commodity Price Volatility: Lithium prices have fluctuated wildly, driven by EV demand and China's market influence.

Conclusion: A High-Reward, High-Impact Opportunity

Halliburton and GeoFrame's venture is a pioneering example of how lithium and geothermal energy can be symbiotically developed. For investors willing to accept near-term risks, the project's long-term potential to reduce U.S. lithium imports while generating renewable energy makes it a compelling bet.

Investment Thesis:

- Short-Term: Monitor Halliburton's contract performance and lithium price trends.

- Long-Term: Consider positions in GeoFrame once publicly traded or acquired, alongside lithium miners with geothermal synergies.

The Smackover project isn't just about minerals—it's about reshaping the U.S. energy landscape. For investors, this is a chance to back a transformative convergence of technologies that could redefine energy independence.",,N,,2025-06-28 09:05:23.885069

It’s also the cheapest.” In these uncertain times for the solar industry, Fowler said, “We at Atlasta Solar Center are not panicking.","The future of that tax credit and other things such as tariffs is making for uncertainty for the solar industry in Colorado and across the country. But at least one thing that helped Kappius in deciding to pursue solar power is now available to other local residents thanks to the return of a solar co-op to the Grand Valley. Kappius participated several years ago in the first iteration of the program, organized by the nonprofit group Solar United Neighbors, or SUN.

“That went perfect. It was great. It went so well,” he said of his experience in the cooperative and the solar installation that resulted.

Solar power faces clouds on the horizon thanks to things such as the possibility that the “One Big Beautiful Bill” budget reconciliation measure that eventually emerges from Congress will eliminate a 30% tax credit for residential solar projects while also having other impacts on the industry. Also still a question mark is the degree to what level of U.S. tariffs ultimately will be applied to what countries, and how that will affect the cost of imported solar products.

‘We are seeing a … a rush in the residential solar space from individuals who are hearing that the energy tax credit that you get as a customer would go away, so there’s a sort of boost, a short-term boost in people seeking residential solar before the tax credit goes away,” said K.C. Becker, CEO of the Colorado Solar and Storage Association.

Matt Fowler, marketing director and co-owner of the longtime local company Atlasta Solar Center, said that credit, which actually was extended during the first Trump administration, could expire at the end of the year. For people who have been considering getting an estimate on a solar installation, they might want to consider doing that now, “because if this tax credit goes away it could be a big missed opportunity for these folks,” he said.

In other regards when it comes to solar, Becker said that because of the situation with tariffs and uncertainty over the future of other energy tax incentives due to budget reconciliation bill proposals, a lot of capital and investments is “sitting on the sideline, waiting to see what’s going to happen.”

“We’re seeing the onshoring of (solar product) manufacturing that had happened because of the Inflation Reduction Act also stopping,” she said.

She said while President Trump says he wants to onshore manufacturing, the budget bill could take away incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that encourage onshoring solar manufacturing.

Fowler said Atlasta isn’t too worried about tariffs. That reflects that it gets solar panels from a lot of other countries other than China, a particular target for tariffs by President Trump.

“We haven’t used any Chinese-specific manufacturers in quite some time,” he said.

He said something that has made a difference in the economics of going solar is higher interest rates.

“As interest rates have remained high there’s not a lot of financing of solar,” he said.

It used to be that people could get a loan for solar power and the monthly payments would be less than for an electric bill. That doesn’t tend to be the case now.

Fowler said Atlasta is now seeing situations where people will pay with mostly cash or a mix of cash and financing. Atlasta also is doing a lot more leases versus sales of solar power, and a lot of power purchase agreements, which involves a host having solar panels installed that are owned by a third party, and the host buying the solar power.

THE CO-OP APPROACH

Meanwhile, the launch of another solar co-op in Mesa County by Solar United Neighbors, partnering with the Western Conservation Alliance, Alpine Bank and Cleantech, provides an opportunity for local residents to team up and save on the cost of solar through bulk purchasing power.

SUN has facilitated two solar co-ops in the county since 2020, which has helped 83 homeowners obtain solar power.

An information session on solar technology, the finances of going solar and the new co-op will be held at 6 p.m. on July 22 at The Mesa County Central Library, 443 N. Sixth St., in the Monument Room. Anyone planning to attend is asked to RSVP at https://www.mobilize.us/solarunitedneighbors/event/801571/.

Once 20 or 30 members have joined the co-op, it will issue a request for proposals to local solar installers, and a committee made up of co-op volunteers will review bids and select an installer.

It’s free to join the co-op, and those who join it have no obligation to buy solar panels. They will receiver personalized bids from the installer and then can decide if they want to move forward with their solar installation. Hannah Mitchell, Colorado program associate for SUN, said that altogether a couple of hundred people participated in past co-ops in Mesa County.

“We definitely have an interest in working on the Western Slope. We know that the folks out there appreciate energy independence and you all get a lot of sunshine and so it’s a great area for this work,” she said.

‘MAKES THINGS A LOT EASIER’

Kappius said he and his wife participated in the first co-op. He had begun doing his own research into going solar and was looking into different solar companies when he learned about the co-op.

“I ended up realizing that if anybody’s interested in solar, that’s definitely the way to go, is through one of the co-ops,” he said.

He said it’s a unique program, and he pointed to Solar United Neighbors’ nonprofit status.

“Their main goal is just to help people who are interested in solar, and if it ends up being right for them, they kind of support you through the whole process.”

He particularly likes that SUN eliminates the work of individual homeowners getting multiple price quotes and figuring out companies that are the most reputable.

“I think people need to realize how unique this Solar United Neighbors is. … (The co-op) is really run by the community neighbors but the support that they provide and the education they provide to people who are interested in solar is really cool. It can be daunting just to try and do your own research, but having Solar United Neighbors’ support makes things a lot easier.”

Atlasta ended up installing solar panels on the townhome owned by Kappius and his wife. They now rent out that residence and have built a new house where they also had Atlasta install solar power.

“Right now I’m on track to pay off the whole system in about seven years with the savings” on his electric bill, Kappius said.

Kappius said that’s about the same situation for both of his properties. He said losing the tax credit could mean extending such a payback period for a homeowner to perhaps 10 or 11 years instead of seven.

While the tax credit was appealing to him, he said it wasn’t a make-or-break factor for him. He said he’s an engineer and big fan of renewable energy who did an internship while in college at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

“I think for other people, where cost is more of a concern, phasing out the tax credits could deter people” from pursuing solar, he said.

Mitchell said Solar United Neighbors already was planning to work in Mesa County this year when the possibility of the residential tax credit ending surfaced. With that threat now looming, for those who qualify, this year presents the best opportunity to secure not just the group installation discount obtained by the co-op but the federal tax credit. She said her group recommends that people talk to an accountant to be sure they qualify for the credit.

She said with it looking like the tax credit will at least remain in place through the end of this year, the goal of is to have co-op members have their solar installations completed by year’s end.

Fowler said if the residential tax credit goes away, it doesn’t mean that people are going to stop installing solar altogether, but it does change the economics a bit. He said even if installing solar initially costs a little more than a homeowner would have been paying for an electric bill, it can still make sense because utilities are going to increase electricity rates and solar power can save money over the long term.

JOBS IN JEOPARDY

Fowler said Atlasta has about 30 employees. Becker said the solar industry in Colorado directly employs about 8,000 people. She said it’s expected that if the budget bill as currently drafted in the Senate passes, Colorado will see the loss of 5,000 jobs involving direct employees or induced job losses.

She said she think solar accounts for about 11% of power on the grid now. She said there have been huge investments in solar in the past few years, and the rate of increase will really decline if the budget bill as now contemplated passes.

“We will still see projects come on line but not as many, and they’re going to be selling power at a higher rate,” she said.

She said international companies will keep investing and evolving their technologies while the United States won’t be a key player in solar power anymore.

“I think what’s going to happen is we end up ceding a lot of this space to China,” she said.

Becker said the bill is coming at a particularly bad time, with data centers coming on line that need a lot of power, a lot faster than nuclear power can be brought online to help supply it.

“What we’re going to see is just a decrease in reliability in the energy grid, because you can bring solar and wind onto the grid more quickly,” she said.

Said Fowler, “We’ve got a huge demand for US. energy production. Solar is the fastest-to-deploy source of energy. It’s also the cheapest.”

In these uncertain times for the solar industry, Fowler said, “We at Atlasta Solar Center are not panicking. We’re planning.

“We have been stressing to homeowners that there’s potential that this (residential tax credit) could go away, so if (solar) is something that you’ve been thinking about now is the time to at least take a look. We’re not saying that anybody has to do anything but if that goes away it certainly changes the economics, that’s for sure.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/22/8221df1f-7484-46fd-9dc3-76190b2cf79b/685edc3cc5b14.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-28 11:07:55.201309

A. Does this action apply to me?

Categories and entities potentially affected by this final action are those that operate OSWI units. OSWI units are not commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units (CISWI), hazardous waste combustors (HWC), hospital/medical/infectious waste incinerators (HMIWI), sewage sludge incinerators (SSI), or other incinerators regulated elsewhere under section 129 of the CAA. Although there is no specific North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for OSWI units, the units subject to the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Emission Guidelines (EG) for OSWI, hereinafter referred to as “the OSWI standards,” may be operated by the categories of sources listed in table 1 of this preamble:

This table is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides a guide for readers regarding entities likely to be regulated by this action. To determine whether your entity is regulated by this action, you should carefully examine the applicability criteria found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.2885, 60.2981, and 60.2991. If you have questions regarding the applicability of this action to a particular entity, consult the person listed in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble, your delegated authority, or your EPA Regional representative listed in 40 CFR 60.4 (General Provisions).

B. How do I obtain a copy of this document and other related information?

The docket number for this final action regarding the OSWI EG and NSPS is Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156. In addition to being available in the docket, an electronic copy of this final action will also be available on the internet. Following signature by the EPA Administrator, the EPA will post a copy of this final action at: https://www.epa.gov/​stationary-sources-air-pollution/​other-solid-waste-incinerators-oswi-new-source-performance. Following publication in the Federal Register (FR), the EPA will post the FR version and key technical documents at this same website.

C. Judicial Review and Administrative Reconsideration

Under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 307(b)(1), judicial review of this final action is available only by filing a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the D.C. Circuit) by August 29, 2025. Under CAA section 307(b)(2), the requirements established by this final rule may not be challenged separately in any civil or criminal proceedings brought by the EPA to enforce the requirements.

Section 307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA further provides that only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised during judicial review. This section also provides a mechanism for the EPA to reconsider the rule if the person raising an objection can demonstrate to the Administrator that it was impracticable to raise such objection within the period for public comment or if the grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule. Any person seeking to make such a demonstration should submit a Petition for Reconsideration to the Office of the Administrator, U.S. EPA, Room 3000, WJC South Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460, with a copy to both the person(s) listed in the preceding FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section and the Associate General Counsel for the Air and Radiation Law Office, Office of General Counsel (Mail Code 2344A), U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460.

II. Background

A. What is the statutory authority and regulatory history for this action?

Section 129 of the CAA, entitled “Solid Waste Combustion,” requires the EPA to develop and adopt NSPS and EG for solid waste incineration units, in accordance with CAA sections 129 and 111. Section 129(a) of the CAA requires the EPA to establish NSPS for new ( printed page 27912) sources, and CAA section 129(b) requires the EPA to establish procedures for states to submit plans for implementing EG for existing sources. The EPA initially proposed NSPS and EG for OSWI units on December 9, 2004 (69 FR 71472), and finalized them on December 16, 2005 (70 FR 74870), at 40 CFR part 60, subparts EEEE and FFFF. The 2005 OSWI standards applied to an incineration unit with a capacity of less than 35 TPD burning MSW (as defined in 40 CFR 60.2977 of subpart EEEE, and 40 CFR 60.3078 of subpart FFFF) or an incineration unit located at an institutional facility burning institutional waste (as defined in 40 CFR 60.2977 of subpart EEEE and 40 CFR 60.3078 of subpart FFFF) generated at that facility. The 2005 rule has yet to be fully implemented for existing sources because most states have not developed and submitted state plans for approval and EPA has not promulgated an implementing Federal plan. Following that final action, the Administrator received a petition for reconsideration of the OSWI standards, and on June 28, 2006, the EPA announced reconsideration of the final OSWI rules (71 FR 36726). After consideration of comments and information received through the reconsideration process, we concluded that no additional changes were necessary to the final OSWI rules (72 FR 2620, January 22, 2007).

In addition to the administrative reconsideration request, some entities petitioned for judicial review of the 2005 OSWI standards. The judicial review proceedings were initially stayed and, ultimately, the EPA requested a voluntary remand of the OSWI standards. By an order dated April 21, 2016, the D.C. Circuit granted the EPA's request for a remand. Order, Sierra Club v. EPA, No. 06-1066 (D.C. Cir. April 21, 2016). The remand was requested to allow the EPA to consider potential revisions, if any, to the OSWI standards that might be appropriate in light of certain legal developments, including 2007 and 2008 decisions from the D.C. Circuit.[ ]

The OSWI NSPS establishes maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limits for new or modified OSWI units. For new sources, the CAA requires that MACT limits be no less stringent than the emissions control achieved in practice by the best-controlled similar unit. The OSWI EG establishes MACT emission limits for existing OSWI units. For existing sources, the CAA requires that MACT limits be no less stringent than the average emissions limitation achieved by the best-performing 12 percent of units in a source category. The EPA must determine some measure of the average emissions limitation achieved by the best-performing 12 percent of units to form the floor regulatory option.

Under the 2005 OSWI standards, the term “OSWI unit” means either a very small municipal waste combustion (VSMWC) unit or an institutional waste incineration (IWI) unit. A VSMWC unit is any municipal waste combustion unit that has the capacity to combust less than 35 tons per day (TPD) of municipal solid waste (MSW) or refuse-derived fuel. An IWI unit is any combustion unit that combusts institutional waste and is a distinct operating unit of the institutional facility, such as a university or prison, that generated the waste.

As required by section 129 of the CAA, the OSWI NSPS and EG rules set emission standards for nine pollutants: cadmium (Cd), carbon monoxide (CO), dioxins/furans (D/F), hydrochloric acid (HCl), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). They also established opacity standards.

CAA section 129(a)(5) requires the EPA to review and, if appropriate, revise the requirements for solid waste incineration units no later than five years following the initial promulgation of any performance standards and at periodic five year intervals after that. However, in 2018, the D.C. Circuit found that the EPA had failed to undertake the periodic review of the OSWI standards and placed the EPA on a schedule to issue a proposed rulemaking and a final rulemaking.[ ] The EPA published a proposed rule on August 31, 2020, for the OSWI NSPS and EG rules that addressed the requisite CAA section 129(a)(5) periodic review (85 FR 54178, hereafter referred to as the “2020 Proposed Rule”). The EPA subsequently published three actions to address issues raised in the 2020 Proposed Rule: (1) withdrawal of certain provisions included in the 2020 Proposed Rule which proposed modifying the definition of “municipal waste combustion unit,” by removing pyrolysis/combustion units from the definition (88 FR 36524, June 5, 2023, hereafter referred to as the “2023 Withdrawal”); (2) a final rule promulgating certain provisions for OSWI air curtain incinerators (ACI) to remove the title V permitting requirements for ACIs that only burn wood waste, clean lumber, yard waste, or a mixture of those, and are not located at title V major sources or subject to title V for other reasons (89 FR 27392, April 17, 2024, hereafter referred to as the “2024 ACI Rule”); and (3) a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) to add a definition for “rudimentary combustion device” (89 FR 60342, July 25, 2024, hereafter referred to as the “2024 SNPRM”).

B. What changes did we propose for the OSWI source category in our August 31, 2020, proposal and subsequent notices?

The EPA published the 2020 Proposed Rule in the Federal Register to address the requisite CAA section 129(a)(5) periodic review (85 FR 54178). We proposed that no new developments in practices, processes, or control technologies existed for any OSWI units and that it was not necessary to revise the OSWI standards for new and existing units under CAA section 129(a)(5). In addition, we proposed some changes to the OSWI standards that were occasioned by the 2016 voluntary remand of the OSWI standards (and the legal developments related to that request for a remand). In accordance with the EPA's general authority under CAA section 129(a), we proposed: (1) revised subcategories and MACT standards that better reflect actual emissions test data from OSWI units and the population of OSWI; (2) changes to applicability provisions for the EG and NSPS including definitional changes; (3) revisions to regulatory provisions related to emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM); (4) testing and monitoring flexibilities so that VSMWC or IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD can demonstrate compliance with the rule; (5) provisions for electronic reporting of certain notices and reports; (6) revisions to recordkeeping and reporting provisions consistent with the revised testing and monitoring; (7) changes to title V permitting requirements for air curtain incinerators that burn less than 35 TPD and burn only only wood waste, clean lumber and yard waste; and (8) other technical edits, clarifications, and ( printed page 27913) revisions intended to improve the understanding of the rules and improve consistency with other CAA section 129 rules. For a more detailed discussion of these revisions, see section II.B of the proposal preamble (85 FR 54178; August 31, 2020).

In the 2020 Proposed Rule, the EPA proposed to change the applicability of the OSWI standards to remove the reference to pyrolysis/combustion units from the definition of “municipal waste combustion unit.” At that time, we considered that the reference to a pyrolysis/combustion unit as a municipal waste combustor (MWC) should not apply to OSWI units because such units are used to combust uncontained gases and do not involve the combustion of solid waste as defined in the OSWI rule.

The EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on September 8, 2021 (86 FR 50296), to gather more details on pyrolysis/combustion units, including how they are used, the inputs and products of the processes, and emissions from these processes. In response to significant adverse comment, the EPA subsequently withdrew the proposed revisions to the definition of “municipal waste combustion unit” (88 FR 36524, June 5, 2023). Accordingly, the EPA will not be taking additional action related to pyrolysis/combustion units in this action.

The EPA published the 2024 ACI Rule promulgating certain provisions related to the title V permitting requirements for OSWI air curtain incinerators (ACI) (89 FR 27392, April 17, 2024). Based on available data, ACIs that combust less than 35 TPD of wood waste, clean lumber, and yard waste are commonly located at facilities that would not otherwise require title V operating permits. Further, these types of ACIs are typically used temporarily at the locations for things like land clearing or storm cleanup. The EPA received overwhelming support from states and industry stakeholders to remove the title V permitting requirement for ACIs that only burn wood waste, clean lumber, yard waste, or a mixture of these wastes, and received no adverse comments on these revisions in the 2020 Proposed Rule. These changes were finalized, and a subsequent technical correction was published November 14, 2024 (89 FR 89928), to address inadvertent errors in the regulatory text in order to make the rule consistent with the description in the April 17, 2024, final rule preamble.

Following the EPA's analysis of comments received after the 2020 Proposed Rule, and discussions with the state of Alaska and Tribes, the EPA published the 2024 SNPRM on July 25, 2024, which proposed to add a definition for “rudimentary combustion device” to address the unique issues associated with these units. The EPA proposed to define a rudimentary combustion device as a combustion device with a capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD that is designed and constructed without one or more of the following elements: (1) a stack, chimney, or pipe designed for the purpose of managing air flow and discharging flue gases from combustion; (2) mechanical draft to provide air flow; (3) burners designed to manage the combustion process; (4) an ancillary power supply to operate; or (5) supplemental fuel burners or nozzles. Because rudimentary combustion devices lack one or more of these elements, the EPA proposed the emissions information, limits, and controls developed for the 2020 Proposed Rule would not be appropriate for them. Most rudimentary combustion devices are not equipped with stacks from which to sample emissions during a performance test, and a stack or extension would be needed in order to perform the testing required by the OSWI standards. Many of these devices are located within Native American villages and other remote or difficult to access areas of the country with limited road access to haul waste to a larger community for burning or landfilling. As a result, local waste disposal is the only option available, and these communities face significant challenges and constraints in addressing this issue. Given the numerous challenges regarding these units, in the 2024 SNPRM the EPA proposed postponing development of standards for units that meet the definition of rudimentary combustion devices at this time.

C. What outreach and engagement did we conduct?

In developing this rule, the EPA conducted outreach activities with states, Tribes, and communities located near OSWI facilities. In addition to public comments received, we obtained feedback from interested parties and evaluated and considered the information received as we developed this action. In June 2020, the EPA conducted four pre-proposal informational calls for federally recognized Tribes, including an overview presentation during the June 25, 2020, National Tribal Air Association call. On August 31, 2020, the EPA sent an email notification to stakeholders announcing that the action had been published with a 45-day comment period and an opportunity to request a public hearing. In September 2020, the EPA held six consultation meetings with Tribes including meetings with Northway Village, Qagan Tayagungin, Louden Tribe, and the Mescalaro Apache Tribe to give an overview of the OSWI proposal and provide instructions on how and when comments on the rule should be submitted to the docket (see Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156). The EPA also conducted four informational calls on the OSWI rule in September 2020 including an overview at the Small Business Environmental Assistance Program (SBEAP) Annual Training, Alaska Air Workgroup call, Tribal Environmental Leaders Summit call, and an update at the National Tribal Air Association (NTAA) call. Although a public hearing was not requested, the EPA continued to seek out additional opportunities for interested parties to be informed about potential requirements of this action. This outreach has included a presentation to the Small Business Environmental Assistance Program on June 5, 2023; regular meetings with the state of Alaska to discuss the operation of incineration units; and a presentation on this action during the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA) Permitting and New Source Review Committee meeting. In March 2025, the EPA held several informational calls with AOGA and industry to discuss their comments submitted on the 2020 Proposed Rule.

III. Summary of Final Action

This action provides the EPA's final determination pursuant to the requisite CAA section 129(a)(5) periodic review for the OSWI standards and requirements in the NSPS and EG rules (see section III.A of this preamble). This action also finalizes applicability-related and definitional changes, changes to OSWI subcategories, and related MACT floor redeterminations, as well as several changes from the 2020 Proposed Rule and changes from the 2024 SNPRM (see sections III.B through D of this preamble). In addition, we are finalizing changes to the SSM provisions (see section III.E of this preamble). Lastly, we are finalizing revisions to the testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and miscellaneous other technical and editorial changes to the regulatory text (see sections III.F.1 through III.F.4 of this preamble). The effective and compliance dates for these actions are discussed in section III.G of this preamble. ( printed page 27914)

A. What are the final rule amendments based on the CAA section 129(a)(5) review?

After considering the public comments received, we are finalizing our results of the CAA section 129(a)(5) periodic review for the OSWI standards as proposed (85 FR 54178). We have determined there are no developments in practices, processes, or control technologies that warrant revisions to the OSWI standards and requirements. Consistent with the 2020 Proposed Rule, we are not revising the OSWI standards and requirements for new or existing sources based on our review under CAA section 129(a)(5).

For a detailed discussion of our review pursuant to CAA section 129(a)(5), see section II.A of the preamble to the 2020 Proposed Rule. Comments on the CAA section 129(a)(5) review and our responses can be found in section IV of this preamble and in the document, Summary of Public Comments and Responses for the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration Units Review, which is available in the docket (see Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this rulemaking.

B. What are the final rule changes involving the applicability of OSWI requirements?

Although not predicated on the CAA section 129(a)(5) review, in this rule, we are finalizing certain changes to the OSWI standards. The EPA proposed several changes involving the applicability requirements for OSWI in the 2020 Proposed Rule and the 2024 SNPRM. The EPA is finalizing proposed changes to the applicability of the OSWI standards following our consideration of comments received on the 2020 Proposed Rule, the 2024 SNPRM, and data provided by the Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA) for small remote incinerators (SRIs) located in Alaska. As discussed below in this section, we are finalizing the proposed removal of the definition of the term “collected from” as used in the definition of “municipal solid waste”; the addition of a new definition for certain small units that were included in the 2024 SNPRM as “rudimentary combustion units”; and associated edits to the applicability requirements of 40 CFR 60.2885 and 40 CFR 60.2991.

In the 2020 Proposed Rule, the EPA proposed changes to the applicability of the OSWI standards. At that time, the EPA intended to resolve inconsistent definitions between OSWI and other CAA section 129 rulemakings and to update aspects of the OSWI rule based on new data used to develop revised emission limits for OSWI units with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD.

We are finalizing the proposed removal of the definition of the term “collected from” as used in the definition of “municipal solid waste” to place the focus on the source and type or nature of the waste. The term collected from (as defined in the OSWI rule) means the transfer of material from the site at which the material is generated to a separate site where the material is burned. We noted that the 2005 OSWI rule finalized a definition of “municipal solid waste” (refuse and refuse-derived fuel “collected from” the general public and from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources) that was similar to the definition of “municipal waste” provided in CAA section 129(g)(5), but was interpreted for the purposes of VSMWC applicability under OSWI, to mean that the municipal waste must be “collected from” certain types of sites or from multiple sites. Specifically, the 2005 OSWI rule stated that “small incinerators” that are located at commercial businesses (such as stores, restaurants and apartments) or industrial sites are not VSMWC units because they do not burn waste which has been “collected from” a site that generated the waste and transferred to a separate site where the waste is burned (70 FR 74882). The 2020 Proposed Rule reevaluated this interpretation, noting that other existing CAA section 129 incinerator rules (such as the municipal waste combustor (MWC) rules) do not necessarily place the same emphasis on where the waste is collected.

By removing the definition of “collected from”, such small incinerators located at commercial businesses or industrial sites would no longer be subject to this limitation and would qualify as VSMWC (provided these units burn more than 30-percent MSW) under OSWI. The CISWI NSPS and EG currently regulate small remote incinerators (SRIs) at commercial and industrial facilities that combust at least 30-percent MSW, but they would now qualify as VSMWC under OSWI in the final rule. These incinerators are primarily owned by oil and gas companies and burn municipal-type solid waste that is generated by the oil and gas workers and is not associated with oil and gas activities. The EPA's decision to regulate these SRI units located at commercial businesses under the OSWI standards is discussed further in sections III.C and IV.A of this preamble.

We are finalizing as proposed new subcategories and revised emission limits for new and existing OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. In the 2020 Proposed Rule, the EPA proposed new emission standards for OSWI units with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD, based on analysis of data collected during the development of the CISWI rules and data subsequently provided by AOGA for SRI units located in Alaska (see section III.C of this preamble for further discussion). In response to the 2020 Proposed Rule's new subcategories and emission standards for new and existing OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD, the EPA received numerous comments noting that it would be nearly impossible for most rural Alaskan communities to comply with the proposed requirements. Units in rural Alaskan communities are often very basic in design and function. Commenters stated that the proposed requirements are inapplicable or impractical for these types of small units ( e.g., burn boxes), which do not have stacks or other incinerator design elements, such as waste feed or flue gas systems, heat recovery, and bottom ash systems. Commenters stated that due to these limitations and other challenges, including the associated costs of compliance, rural communities operating these units would be unable to meet the proposed requirements and may be forced to return to less environmentally friendly waste disposal methods, such as open burning, barrel burning, or loose filling waste which could also attract wildlife that may present immediate health and safety risks. These comments are summarized in detail in the 2024 SNPRM (see section III, 89 FR 60345-60347).

Subsequent discussions with state and tribal agencies in Alaska demonstrated that most of these units have a capacity of less than or equal to 10 TPD, are rudimentary in design and function, and are generally located in remote areas. These units are not equipped with stacks with which to sample emissions during performance testing, likely cannot be physically modified to equip the unit with a stack, and may be difficult to access for testing due to their physical location.

Based on this new information, the EPA proposed a new definition for “rudimentary combustion devices” and associated edits to 40 CFR 60.2885 and 40 CFR 60.2991. Units that fall under the definition of rudimentary combustion devices are not considered VSMWC or IWI, and so are not required to comply with the emission standards for VSMWC or IWI (see section III.D of ( printed page 27915) this preamble for further discussion). As noted in the 2024 SNPRM, the EPA does not consider the emissions information, limits, and controls developed for the proposed OSWI rule to be appropriate for these devices, which lack one or more of these elements, and is therefore not setting standards for rudimentary combustion devices in this rulemaking. Further, these rules do not usurp existing local or state regulations that apply to these units, which will continue to apply as they currently do.

Comments on the proposed changes to applicability, including comments received on the 2024 SNPRM, and our responses can be found in section IV.A of this preamble and in the document, Summary of Public Comments and Responses for the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration Units Review, which is available in the docket (see Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this rulemaking.

C. What are the final rule amendments addressing OSWI subcategories and related MACT floor redeterminations?

The EPA is finalizing, as proposed, the revisions to the OSWI subcategories for both new and existing units and associated MACT floor recalculations included in the 2020 Proposed Rule. For the 2005 OSWI standards, the EPA lacked emissions data from OSWI units, and the emission limits were based on information for similar sources in the HMIWI unit source category, as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule (85 FR 54183). During the development of the 2020 Proposed Rule, the EPA collected additional information on two new OSWI units (constructed after the current OSWI standards were issued) with capacities greater than 10 TPD and emissions information for certain existing small remote incineration units located in Alaska that historically have been regarded as SRIs under CISWI, but which we proposed to treat as OSWI VSMWC units.

The EPA proposed to reconsider the dividing line between the OSWI and CISWI standards and to treat these existing units as VSMWC based on data submitted by AOGA showing that most of these units burn more than 30 percent municipal type solid waste generated by staff/personnel at commercial or industrial facilities (discussed in section III.B of this preamble). Because the data indicated that SRI units combust more than 30 percent MSW, even though they are located at commercial or industrial facilities and currently subject to CISWI, we proposed that they would be subject to the OSWI rule. As discussed in the 2020 Proposed Rule, this approach is more consistent with the EPA's other CAA section 129 MWC rules and the CAA definition of “municipal waste” in CAA section 129(g)(5), which defines the term “municipal waste” to mean refuse “collected from the general public and from residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources consisting of paper, wood, yard wastes, food wastes, plastics, leather, rubber and other combustible materials and non-combustible materials such as metal, glass and rock.” We did not read this definition as necessitating that, to constitute MSW, that the waste must be transferred from one site and burned at another site. Additionally, the information gathered for the two new OSWI units (VSMWC with capacities greater than 10 TPD located in Arizona and Texas) indicated that these units are continuously fed rotary combustors that use add-on pollution controls to comply with the OSWI standards.

For incineration units, differences in size typically reflect differences in operation and equipment complexity. Units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD typically feed waste to the unit in batches and some units may not even be equipped with stacks. Units larger than 10 TPD typically feed waste to the unit continuously or semi-continuously and also typically have stacks or flues that can be routed to air pollution control devices. Based on the differences in size, design, and operation of the SRI units and the two new OSWI units, the EPA proposed to subcategorize IWI and VSMWC units under OSWI based on size. These subcategories included VSMWC units with a capacity to combust less than or equal to 10 TPD of MSW or refuse-derived fuel; IWI units with a capacity to combust less than or equal to 10 TPD of institutional waste; VSMWC units with a capacity to combust greater than 10 TPD but less than 35 TPD of MSW or refuse-derived fuel; and IWI units with a capacity to combust greater than 10 TPD of institutional waste. The proposed and final subcategories for VSMWC and IWI units are summarized in table 2 of this preamble.

The EPA subsequently proposed revised MACT floor emission limits for existing and new VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD based on the updated inventory, emissions, and waste data provided by AOGA. We did not propose any revisions to the MACT floor emission limits for existing and new “large” OSWI units (greater than 10 TPD). Section II.B. of the preamble to the 2020 Proposed Rule provides additional information on the EPA's rationale for the proposed revisions to subcategorize OSWI units and the proposed emission limits.

Following review of the comments received on the 2020 Proposed Rule, we are finalizing the proposed subcategories and related MACT floor recalculations for new and existing VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD based on the data gathered during the 2020 Proposed Rule, which includes data collected for SRI units previously regulated under CISWI, and which better reflects the actual emissions test data from similar units. The final subcategories for OSWI units remain ( printed page 27916) appropriate based on the differences in the size, design, and operation of the units with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD and the two new OSWI units, that have capacities greater than 10 TPD. In addition, consistent with the proposal, we are not finalizing any changes to the 2005 OSWI emission limits for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities greater than 10 TPD (new and existing). Also, we conclude, as proposed, that revised beyond-the-floor limits are not appropriate for the OSWI subcategories (see section II.B.1 of the proposal preamble (85 FR 54178).

We have developed revised emission limits for existing OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD using the average emission limitation of the best performing 12 percent of such sources and also considering variability in emissions, consistent with CAA section 129(a)(2). The revised standards better reflect actual emissions test data from OSWI units and are more representative of and better reflect the emissions achievable for new and existing units in each category required under CAA sections 129(a)(2) and (4).

To calculate the MACT floor emission limits for these existing OSWI sources, we considered the available test run data provided in response to a 2010 information collection request (ICR) and test data from 2014 submitted in June 2017 by AOGA in their attempt to address concerns that they had with the 2010 ICR data pertaining to the emissions test data representativeness and waste variability. In the MACT floor analysis, we used the run data from the 2010 and 2014 emission tests to calculate the 99th percentile upper limits (UL) statistical interval for the best 12 percent of such incineration units for each pollutant to address the range of operating conditions of the incinerator. The UL is a common statistical interval used to address variability and was the same statistical interval used to calculate the CISWI SRI emission limits (76 FR 15723, March 21, 2011). We also applied a waste variability factor to account for variability in emissions expected to result from the varying waste profiles of OSWI units.

We are also finalizing revised MACT floors for new OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. Section 129(a)(2) of the CAA requires that MACT for new sources be no less stringent than the emissions control achieved in practice by the best controlled similar unit. Therefore, the approach for new sources was similar to that used with the existing sources ( i.e., UL with a waste variability factor applied for the pollutants influenced by waste composition), except the top performing unit's data were used to calculate the MACT floor emission limit instead of the average of the best performing 12 percent of units and a 95 percentile UL was used instead of a 99 percentile UL.

We also examined whether it was appropriate to adopt more stringent “beyond-the-floor” regulatory options to determine MACT. Unlike the floor minimum stringency requirements, the EPA must consider various impacts of the more stringent regulatory options in determining whether MACT standards are to reflect “beyond-the-floor” requirements, including considering the costs, non-air quality health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements of such more stringent control. OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD often are of very basic, rudimentary design and function. Requiring additional controls on these units is infeasible or simply would be cost prohibitive. For OSWI units with capacities greater than 10 TPD, the 2005 final rule already incorporated beyond-the-floor requirements. We do not have sufficient information for OSWI units with capacities greater than 10 TPD that would enable us to revise the beyond the floor limits. However, based on the information we have from the 2005 rule, requiring any further controls would likely only provide minimal emissions reductions with substantial cost investments. Considering these factors, we concluded that revised beyond-the-floor limits are unreasonable for the OSWI subcategories.

The final emission limits, including the new limits for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD and the unchanged limits for units with capacities greater than 10 TPD, are summarized in table 3 of this preamble. The limits for the VSMWC and IWI with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD are less stringent than the corresponding limits for VSMWC and IWI with capacities greater than 10 TPD. However, the VSMWC and IWI with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD operate intermittently (average 2,620 hours or 109 days per year) with a relatively low stack gas flow rate (average 686 dry standard cubic feet per minute at 7 percent oxygen), and so the actual emissions of pollutants are relatively low for these units.[ ] For example, the EPA estimates that a representative VSMWC with capacity greater than 10 TPD may emit between 0.006 and 0.01 tons of Cd per year while meeting its limit of 18 µg/dscm,[ ] while the highest-emitting VSMWC with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD emitting at the level of the standard (2,000 µg/dscm) would only emit 0.007 tons of Cd per year.[ ]

Comments on the proposed revisions to the MACT floor recalculations and OSWI subcategories and our responses can be found in section IV.B of this preamble. Additional information on the development of the emission limits may be found in section II.B. of the preamble to the 2020 Proposed Rule and in the memorandum, Emission Limit Calculations for Existing and New Sources for the Final Other Solid Waste Incinerator (OSWI) Rulemaking, which is available in the docket (see Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this action.

D. What are the final rule amendments addressing other definitions for the OSWI category?

In addition to the proposed changes to applicability-related definitions described in section III.B of this preamble, the EPA included in its 2020 Proposed Rule definitions for “waste profile” and “small OSWI unit.” As discussed in section III.C of this preamble, the EPA is finalizing the proposed subcategories and related MACT floor recalculations for new and existing VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. Accordingly, the EPA is finalizing separate flexibilities to the testing, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that require waste characterization and waste profile data (see section III.F.1 of this preamble). For these reasons, we are finalizing the proposed revision to add a definition for “waste profile” as related to compliance with the VSMWC and IWI with capacity of less than or equal to 10 TPD standards. The EPA proposed to define waste profile to mean the amount of each waste category burned as a percentage of total waste burned on a mass basis. We are not finalizing the proposed definition for “small OSWI unit,” but are retaining text for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD in keeping with the final subcategories and MACT floor redeterminations discussed in section III.C of this preamble.

Following consideration of the comments received and discussions with state and Tribal authority to gather additional data on the types of units referenced, the EPA proposed in the 2024 SNPRM to define a rudimentary combustion device separately from VSMWC or IWI because rudimentary combustion devices lack key features of commercially available incineration units and the emissions information, limits, and controls developed for the OSWI rule are not appropriate for them. The EPA proposed to define a rudimentary combustion device as a combustion device with a capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD that is designed and constructed without one or more of the following elements: (1) a stack, chimney, or pipe designed for the purpose of managing air flow and discharging flue gases from combustion; (2) mechanical draft to provide air flow; (3) burners designed to manage the combustion process; (4) an ancillary power supply to operate; or (5) supplemental fuel burners or nozzles. The EPA solicited additional comments and data to refine the definition of “rudimentary combustion device” and to better understand the number of devices and individuals using these devices in rural communities. Following review of the comments received on the 2024 SNPRM, we are finalizing revisions to the applicability requirements at 40 CFR 60.2885 and 40 CFR 60.2991 and adding a definition of “rudimentary combustion device”, with minor revisions from the 2024 SNPRM proposal. For the reasons described in section IV.A of this preamble, we are clarifying the proposed requirements and finalizing the definition of “rudimentary combustion device” as a combustion device with a capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD that is designed and constructed without one or more of the following elements: (1) a stack, chimney, or pipe designed for the purpose of discharging flue gases from combustion; (2) mechanical draft to provide air flow; (3) burners designed to initiate, and/or assist the combustion process, including burners designed to burn supplementary fuel; or (4) an ancillary power supply to operate. Additional information on this proposed revision can be found in section III of the preamble to the 2024 SNPRM.[ ]

E. What are the final rule amendments addressing emissions during periods of SSM?

Currently, the OSWI standards do not apply during SSM periods (see 40 CFR 60.2918, 60.3025). The EPA proposed to eliminate this limitation or qualification on the applicability of the OSWI standards. The EPA proposed this change in light of the 2016 remand and certain legal developments, including a decision by the D.C. Circuit that invalidated certain regulations related to SSM in the 40 CFR part 63 General Provisions ( Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019 (2008)). We are finalizing the proposed amendments to the OSWI standards from the 2020 Proposed Rule to remove and revise provisions related to SSM. ( printed page 27918)

For the reasons explained in the 2020 Proposed Rule (see section II.B.3 of the proposal preamble at 85 FR 54178), we determined that OSWI units can meet the applicable standards at all times, including during periods of startup and shutdown. In establishing the standards in this rule, the EPA has taken into account startup and shutdown periods and, for the reasons explained below, has not established alternate standards for those periods. As explained in the 2020 Proposed Rule, we have determined that during startup most OSWI units burn natural gas or clean distillate oil, and waste is not added until the unit has reached suitable combustion temperatures; and during shutdown periods, emissions are generally significantly lower than emissions during normal operations because the materials in the incinerator will be almost fully combusted before shutdown occurs.

Periods of startup, normal operations, and shutdown are all predictable and routine aspects of a source's operations. Malfunctions, in contrast, are neither predictable nor routine. Instead, they are, by definition, sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failures of emissions control, process, or monitoring equipment. (40 CFR 63.2) (definition of malfunction). The EPA interprets CAA section 112 as not requiring emissions that occur during periods of malfunction to be factored into development of CAA section 112 standards. This reading has been upheld by the court in U.S. Sugar Corp. v. EPA, 830 F.3d 579, 606-610 (D.C. Cir. 2016). The court's reasoning in U.S. Sugar applies equally to CAA section 129 standards given the similarities between the CAA section 112 and 129 standard setting criteria. Therefore, we are removing 40 CFR 60.2918 and 40 CFR 60.3025, which provided exemptions for SSM.

We are also finalizing, as proposed, other changes to the SSM standards in light of the EPA's experience with the CAA section 129 solid waste incinerator rules. These changes include harmonizing revisions to other rule provisions that reference SSM, such as: revising the definition of “Deviation” to remove language for periods of SSM; clarifying that the 12-hour rolling average values must include periods of continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) data during startup and shutdown by adding a definition of “CEMS data during startup and shutdown” in 40 CFR 60.2977 and 40 CFR 60.3078; revising the equations used to calculate the 12-hour rolling average for CO; and updating requirements related to SSM for recordkeeping and reporting in 40 CFR 60.2949, 60.2957, 60.2958, 60.3046, 60.3052, and 60.3053. These changes are further described in section III.F.2 of this preamble. We did not receive comments on the proposed removal and revisions of provisions related to SSM.

F. What are the final rule amendments addressing testing, monitoring and reporting requirements?

1. Initial and Continuous Compliance Demonstration

Consistent with the proposal, we are finalizing the substitute means of compliance demonstration (SMCD) for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. We have considered the cost of testing, and we recognize that testing and monitoring requirements can impose substantial financial burdens and technical challenges on owners and operators of these sources. The SMCD provides an alternative to the general testing and monitoring requirements for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. VSMWC and IWI units with capacities greater than 10 TPD must continue to demonstrate compliance by individual stack testing.

However, stack testing is unfeasible for some VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. As we stated in the proposal and confirmed by information we gathered between the proposal and this final action, we believe that many of these units are located in remote areas, such as SRIs located on oil and natural gas platforms on Alaska's North Slope in the Beaufort Sea and other areas that are similarly isolated which represent 29 of the 31 OSWI units that are not rudimentary combustion devices, surrounded by water or wetlands, or that have limited infrastructure or are difficult to access. Getting testing crews to those incinerators would be extremely challenging and costly. Other units could be considered readily accessible, but they are not equipped with stacks adequate to allow emissions sampling for performance tests. Such units would need to be modified to be able to conduct compliance testing. However, costs and logistics would prevent these types of incinerators from making the necessary changes. In still other cases, it simply may not be physically possible to modify an existing incinerator stack to allow compliance testing.

Therefore, we are finalizing, as proposed, an option for using a “representative” initial compliance demonstration. Owners and operators of VSMWC or IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD who have not previously submitted testing meeting the requirements of the final standards would have to submit detailed information about their units, including: the make, model, and manufacturer of the unit; the type and capacity of the unit; the unit's air pollution control devices (if any); the type and quantity of waste incinerated; and the charge rate. They would then identify a representative performance test in the EPA's WebFIRE database.

A representative performance test must be conducted on an OSWI unit that has similar throughput, methods of processing and burning waste, operating temperatures, types of wastes or supplemental fuels burned, and waste profile as the OSWI unit using the SMCD. A representative performance test must be conducted consistent with the requirements in the OSWI rule; demonstrate compliance with the OSWI standards; and include the following information in the report: unit design (including air pollution control devices), charge rate during the test, type of operation, combustion temperature during the test, types of waste burned during the test and the relative amount of each waste to the total waste burned (waste profile), type and amount of supplemental fuels used during the test, and, if the tested unit has an air pollution control device, the operating parameter data for the control device during the test. Not all tests in the WebFIRE database may qualify. If there is no representative performance test available in the WebFIRE database, the OSWI unit with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD cannot use the SMCD and must instead conduct its own initial performance test.

To use this substitute option for demonstrating initial compliance, the owner/operator must submit the following information: a notice of intent to use the SMCD; waste profile information; and a representative performance test.[ ] Each of these elements is discussed below.

a. Notice of Intent

We are finalizing provisions that offer VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD two options for initial performance tests: conducting an individual initial performance test or using the SMCD described below. New VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that were constructed after August 31, 2020, or ( printed page 27919) modified or reconstructed after December 29, 2025, must either complete initial performance tests within 60 days after reaching the charge rate at which they will operate, but no later than 180 days after initial startup,[ ] or they must submit a notice of intent to use the SMCD by December 29, 2025, or within 60 days after initial startup, whichever of these dates is later. The notice of intent should include the manufacturer, make, model, and type of unit, and documentation showing that the capacity of the unit is less than or equal to 10 TPD. Owners and operators of existing VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD (constructed on or before August 31, 2020, and not modified or reconstructed after December 29, 2025) are not required to submit a notice of intent to the EPA. However, they are required to either identify the results of an existing performance test in the EPA's WebFIRE database that is representative of their type of OSWI unit, if they intend to use the SMCD, or conduct an initial performance test; this must happen no later than 3 years after a state plan is approved or no later than July 1, 2030, whichever date is earlier.

b. Waste Profile Information

As we stated in the proposal, we recognize that the SMCD relies on the availability of the results of performance tests conducted on potentially representative sources in the EPA's WebFIRE database. Because we anticipate that owners and operators using the SMCD will need time to meet its conditions, we encourage them to submit their notices of intent to use the substitute means of compliance and collect data for waste characterization as soon as possible after this rule is promulgated. For this reason, beginning on December 29, 2025, and until the owner or operator identifies a representative performance test, but before March 30, 2027 or 60 days after the OSWI unit reaches the charge rate at which it will operate or 180 days after initial startup, whichever is later, each owner or operator of a new VSMWC and IWI unit with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD planning to use the SMCD must collect data on a weekly basis to characterize the unit's operations and waste profiles, as further discussed in section III.F.1.c of this preamble. The waste profile information will record the unit's differing waste streams and waste variability in order to develop a representative waste profile. The unit's profile can then be used to identify a representative performance test for the unit's SMCD.

c. Representative Testing

We are finalizing an SMCD alternative allowing owners and operators of VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD to identify a representative performance test in the WebFIRE database and submit information about the representative performance test and documentation of how the performance test is representative for their unit ( e.g., based on the unit type and design, charge rate, operating temperatures, types of waste burned, and any air pollution control devices) to the Administrator through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI). Owners and operators must maintain a record of the representative performance test report (acquired from the EPA's WebFIRE database) and the submitted documentation of how the test is representative. The EPA encourages owners and operators to find similar sources by reviewing the notices of intent to use the SMCD and/or performance tests, available in the EPA's WebFIRE database. The EPA still anticipates that similar sources will coordinate to develop test protocols and find cost sharing opportunities by having representative sources conduct a performance test that can be used by all sources in that group.

If owners and operators of existing VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD choose to use the SMCD, we are requiring them to submit SMCD information identifying the representative performance test through CDX using CEDRI beginning no later than March 30, 2027 or 60 days after the OSWI unit reaches the maximum charge rate at which it will operate, but no later than 180 days after initial startup, whichever date is later. This period will allow the owner or operator time for reviewing notices available on the EPA's WebFIRE database, finding and coordinating with similar sources, developing a testing protocol that will work for all sources within a group, conducting the performance tests, and electronically submitting the results of the test through CEDRI (see section III.E.3 of this preamble for a discussion of electronic reporting). The period will also allow time for the EPA to transfer these results to the EPA's WebFIRE database and for owners and operators to find a representative performance test and submit information on how it is representative to the Administrator.

Given the time needed to identify and coordinate similar source groups or develop test protocols, and because the compliance date for new sources is earlier than the compliance date for existing sources and it is uncertain how many tests will be conducted, owners or operators of existing sources are encouraged to start collecting information that would be useful for identifying similar sources and submit this information as soon as possible. This will greatly increase the likelihood that a representative test will be available in the WebFIRE database prior the compliance deadline.[ ] As noted in our proposal, owners and operators who do not provide their initial waste characterization data in a timely manner could miss the opportunity to avail themselves of this option due to the amount of planning, time, and resources required for similar sources to coordinate and perform performance tests. Owners and operators who cannot find a representative test conducted for a unit that is similar to their unit must conduct their own initial performance tests.

d. Continuous Compliance Demonstration

We are also finalizing, as proposed, an alternative waste characterization (AWC) option for demonstrating continuous compliance available to all VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that are subject to the OSWI rules. We are finalizing this AWC option in response to comments pointing out the difficulties of testing these units, which are generally located in areas that are remote and difficult to access.

In lieu of conducting annual performance tests, this alternative demonstration of continuous compliance will require recordkeeping. The recordkeeping requirements include recording the source-specific waste profiles and incinerator unit operating parameters, including the daily average charge rate and the 3-hour average combustion chamber temperature of the unit. As discussed in section IV.C of this preamble, in response to comments received, we have modified the final rule to require ( printed page 27920) that the facility use its records at the end of each calendar quarter to demonstrate that the waste combusted is consistent, within +/- 15 percent by weight, with the percentage established for the components of the waste stream according to the waste profiles established during the facility's initial performance test or established in the representative initial performance test for units using the SMCD.[ ] The facility must report any deviations from the quarterly average waste profile requirements in its deviation report. Additionally, the records must demonstrate that the unit is operated within the charge rate and temperature ranges established during the initial performance test or the representative performance test.

As described in the proposal, we are finalizing a requirement that if the facility anticipates combusting a waste stream with a different profile, the owner/operator must conduct a performance test of the unit with a waste stream representative of the new waste profile, or alternatively, must identify a representative performance test report in the WebFIRE database and submit the information required by the SMCD, before combusting the modified waste stream.[ ] Similarly, if the facility anticipates exceeding or operating outside of the established operating parameter ranges, the owner/operator must conduct a performance test of the unit while it is operating at the new parameter limits, or find a representative performance test with those operating parameter limits in the WebFIRE database and submit the information required by the SMCD, to confirm that the unit continues to meet the OSWI emission standards under the new operating parameter limits. Failure to comply with the retesting requirement is a deviation from the OSWI standards.

We are finalizing, as proposed in the 2020 Proposed Rule, revisions to monitoring to make the OSWI standards more consistent with the monitoring requirements in other CAA section 129 rules. For example, the only air pollution control device for which the 2005 final OSWI standards provide operating requirements is wet scrubbers. We are finalizing revisions to 40 CFR 60.2916 and table 2 to subpart EEEE and 40 CFR 60.3023 and table 3 to subpart FFFF to include operating limits and operating parameter monitoring requirements for additional controls that may be employed for OSWI units, including dry scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, and fabric filters. Additionally, we are finalizing a clarification to 40 CFR 60.2917 and 40 CFR 60.3024 that OSWI units that use an alternate method for air pollution control beyond a wet scrubber, dry scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filter, including other methods such as material balance, may petition the EPA for specific operating parameter limits in these cases. The final requirements add flexibility for facilities by expanding the control options available. In addition, we are finalizing as proposed revisions to the requirements in 40 CFR 60.2916, 40 CFR 60.2928, 40 CFR 60.3023, and 40 CFR 60.3023 for owners and operators of OSWI units using control options to require that the minimum operating parameters ( e.g., combustion operating chamber temperature, pressure drop, liquid flow rate) established for initial compliance are calculated based on the lowest 1-hour average as measured during the most recent performance test (or representative performance test) demonstrating compliance. The current OSWI standards required that these parameters be calculated using the average as measured during the most recent performance test. Similarly, we are revising the continuous compliance requirements in 40 CFR 60.2932(c) and 40 CFR 60.3023(c) to specify the averaging times for continuous compliances for operating parameters for the extended control options (generally, 3-hour rolling averages).

Moreover, as we proposed, we are removing the requirement for CO and oxygen (O2) CEMS for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that use the AWC option in lieu of complying with the annual performance testing requirements. We are making this change for the same reasons that we are finalizing an alternative to the annual performance test. In addition to the cost of maintaining CEMS, calibrating a CEMS generally requires an annual stack test to verify the operation of the CEMS. Providing an alternative to conducting annual performance tests while continuing to require CEMS, which need annual stack tests, would not achieve the stated goals and benefits of providing an alternative to annual performance tests for showing continuous compliance.

We are finalizing, as proposed, an option included in the 2020 Proposed Rule that allows OSWI units to use CO CEMS data in lieu of initial and annual testing for CO, provided the CEMS has been previously certified and is meeting the ongoing quality assurance/quality control requirements. Currently, facilities are required under 40 CFR 60.2927 and 40 CFR 60.3030 to conduct initial and annual performance testing to determine compliance with all emission limitations, including CO, and to also continuously monitor CO emissions using CEMS under 40 CFR 60.2939 and 40 CFR 60.3038. Facilities that opt to use CO CEMS data to demonstrate continuous compliance must use a 12-hour rolling average of the 1-hour arithmetic average CEMS data to determine compliance with the CO emission limitations. However, the initial performance evaluation (CEMS certification) must be completed prior to collecting CEMS data for the initial compliance demonstration. Under the final rule, such units could also use CO CEMS data in lieu of conducting an annual performance test for CO. This change provides flexibility for sources and reduces the cost burden associated with testing, while assuring compliance based on continuously measured emissions data.

As discussed in section IV.C of this preamble, for OSWI units that choose to conduct annual testing, we are revising the compliance timeline for the annual performance test in response to comments that weather and geographic constraints may prevent facilities from meeting the timeline on a 12-month basis. The final rule requires annual performance tests to be conducted within 14 months following the initial performance test and, subsequently, within 14 months from the prior years' tests.

For a more detailed discussion of these amendments addressing testing and monitoring requirements for VSMWC and IWI units see section II.B.4 of the proposal preamble (85 FR 54178). Section IV.C of this preamble provides a summary of the significant comments on the proposal and our responses to those comments. A full compilation of comments and responses can be found in the document, Summary of Public Comments and Responses for the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration Units Review, which is available in the docket (see ( printed page 27921) Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this rulemaking.

2. Recordkeeping and Reporting

For units using the SMCD to demonstrate initial compliance, we are finalizing, as proposed, a requirement that owners and operators maintain the following records: the notice of intent to use the SMCD, along with documentation of the unit's design, operation, and capacity; initial waste characterization and operating data; and documentation of how the selected substitute test is representative of the unit.

We are also finalizing recordkeeping requirements to be used with the AWC option. Owners and operators must maintain records on: start and end times of the unit's operation; the amount or weight of each waste type ( e.g., pounds of solid waste, food waste, wood, or yard waste); the percentage of each type of waste burned; the 3-hour average temperature and charge rate; and operating records for units using air pollution controls such as a wet scrubber, dry scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, or fabric filters. Unit owners and operators must also keep records of periods when the waste profile does not meet the requirements as tested. As stated in the proposal, these recordkeeping requirements will help ensure that VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD choosing the AWC option can demonstrate compliance with the emission and operating limits of the OSWI standards. The recordkeeping will also help to demonstrate that the percentage of waste components burned by VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD is within +/−15 percent of the percentages established for each waste category incinerated at a unit according to the profiles established during the initial performance test or representative performance test. We are also finalizing, as proposed, a reporting requirement that owners and operators include in annual reports a statement that there were no deviations from the waste characterization requirements and that the unit has been operated within the operating parameter limits. As we stated in the proposal, these recordkeeping and reporting requirements are intended to help ensure that there is adequate information available with which to determine compliance with the standards; to ascertain the severity of any failure to meet a standard; and to further assure compliance with the standards at all times.

Consistent with the proposal, we are also clarifying the timeline for owners and operators who choose the SMCD to submit their annual compliance reports. They must submit their annual compliance reports no later than 12 months after they submit the representative initial performance test and description of how the test is representative for the OSWI unit.

We are finalizing, as proposed, revisions to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for deviations included in the 2020 Proposed Rule to clarify that a deviation includes any “failure to meet an applicable standard” and to clarify what information must be recorded and reported. These changes include the following:

Revising the definition of “deviation” to remove language for periods of SSM, as discussed in section III.E of this preamble.

Revising40 CFR 60.2932(c) and 40 CFR 60.3033(c) to clarify the alarm time that constitutes a deviation from the operating limit for OSWI units with fabric filters and bag leak detection systems.

Revising40 CFR 60.2942(f) and 40 CFR 60.3041(f) to clarify that, for OSWI units using CEMS, failure to collect required data is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.

Revising40 CFR 60.2949 and 40 CFR 60.3046 to specify that facilities must retain a record identifying the calendar dates, times, and durations of malfunctions and a description of the failure and the corrective action taken.

Revising40 CFR 60.2956(e) and 40 CFR 60.3051(e) to clarify that for OSWI units with CEMS, the annual report must include a statement that there were no periods during which the CEMS were inoperative, inactive, malfunctioning, or out of control.

Removing and reserving deviation reporting requirements (previously40 CFR 60.2956(g); 40 CFR 60.3051(g)) previously included as part of the annual report to remove redundant reporting; these requirements are included in the deviation report submitted on a semiannual basis (40 CFR 60.2958; 40 CFR 60.3053).

Modifying the annual reporting requirements in40 CFR 60.2956 and 40 CFR 60.3051 to require facilities to provide a statement that there was no deviation identified from the waste characterization ( i.e., each quarter, the waste types burned are within 15 percent variation of the profiles established during the initial performance test) and the unit has been operated within the charge rate and temperature ranges established when no deviations have occurred during the reporting period.

For deviation reporting, revising the title of40 CFR 60.2957 and 40 CFR 60.3052 to “What other reports must I submit if I have a deviation?” and reorganizing 40 CFR 60.2957(a) and 40 CFR 60.3052(a) to be consistent with the definition of “deviation” and to better reflect the types of deviations which must be reported.

Modifying the requirements of40 CFR 60.2958 and 40 CFR 60.3053 to clarify the contents of the deviation report, including identifying the calendar dates, times, and durations of any deviations and a description of any corrective actions taken, and adding new requirements to report deviations from the waste characterization and operating parameter limits established for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD.

As discussed in section IV.C.2 of this preamble, we are making one minor change to the proposed reporting requirements for qualified OSWI unit operators at 40 CFR 60.2956(j) and 40 CFR 60.3051(j) to clarify that facilities must report “the start date, start time, and duration in hours for each period of operation when all qualified OSWI unit operators were unavailable for more than 12 hours but less than 2 weeks”. The proposed language referenced “each period when qualified OSWI unit operators were unavailable . . .” and unintentionally included periods of off-season, maintenance, or periods of shutdown. The final rule clarifies the text to “each period of operation” to exclude off-season, maintenance, and shutdown periods.

Lastly, we are finalizing, as proposed, additional changes to the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 40 CFR 60.2949(b) and 40 CFR 60.2956(d) and (f) and 40 CFR 60.3046(b) and 40 CFR 60.3051(d) and (f) from the 2020 Proposed Rule that include consistency edits based on the revisions to allow for use of CO CEMS data in lieu of annual testing for CO (for OSWI units that have capacities greater than 10 TPD) (discussed in section III.F.1 of this preamble) and the revisions to the monitoring requirements to ensure consistency with other CAA section 129 rules such as CISWI ( e.g., adding operating parameters for controls other than a wet scrubber that may be employed for OSWI units and clarifying the frequency of the data recording or averaging for each required operating parameter, discussed in section III.F.1 of this preamble).

For a more detailed discussion of these amendments to recordkeeping and reporting requirements, see section ( printed page 27922) II.B.5 of the proposal preamble (85 FR 54178; August 31, 2020). Section IV.B.2 of this preamble provides a summary of key comments we received on these amendments and our responses.

3. Electronic Reporting

To increase the ease and efficiency of data submittal and data accessibility, we are finalizing, as proposed, a requirement that owners or operators of OSWI units submit required performance test reports, performance evaluation reports, deviation reports, and annual compliance reports through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) using the Compliance and Emissions Data Reporting Interface (CEDRI), as included in the 2020 Proposed Rule. The final rule requires that performance test results be submitted in the format generated through the use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool (ERT) or an electronic file consistent with the extensible markup language (XML) schema on the ERT website.[ ] Similarly, performance evaluation results of CEMS that include a relative accuracy test audit must be submitted in the format generated through the use of the ERT or an electronic file consistent with the XML schema on the ERT website.

For deviation reports and annual compliance reports, the final rule requires owners and operators to use the appropriate spreadsheet template to submit information to CEDRI, beginning June 30, 2026, or once the reporting forms have been made available in CEDRI for at least 1 year, whichever date is later. The final version of the template for these reports will be located on the CEDRI website.[ ] If the reporting template specific to this subpart is not available in CEDRI at the time that the report is due, facilities must submit the report to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in 40 CFR 60.4. Once the form has been available in CEDRI for at least 1 year, facilities must submit all subsequent reports via CEDRI. Furthermore, we are finalizing, as proposed, provisions that allow facility operators to seek extensions for submitting electronic reports for circumstances beyond the control of the facility, i.e., for a possible outage in the CDX or CEDRI (see 40 CFR 60.2961(d) and 40 CFR 60.3056(d)) or, for a force majeure event, see 40 CFR 60.2961(e) and 40 CFR 60.3056(e) in the time just prior to a report's due date, as well as provisions outlining the process to assert such a claim.

For a more detailed discussion of these final amendments, see section II.B.6 of the preamble to the 2020 Proposed Rule (85 FR 54178), as well as section III.B of this preamble on compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). For a more thorough discussion of electronic reporting, see the memorandum, Electronic Reporting Requirements for New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Rules, which is available in the docket (see Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this rulemaking.

4. Technical Edits, Clarifications, and Additional Revisions

We are finalizing several of the revisions that we proposed for technical corrections, harmonizing changes, clarifications, and improvements to the OSWI standards in the 2020 Proposed Rule, with the exception of certain proposed changes related to testing or compliance requirements for VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that we are finalizing with revisions (see sections III.F.1 and III.G of this preamble). These revisions include:

Including operating limits and operating parameter monitoring requirements for additional controls that may be employed for OSWI units, including dry scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators, and fabric filters, and revisions to clarify that OSWI units that use an alternate method for air pollution control may petition the EPA for specific operating parameter limits.

Revising the requirements for owners and operators of OSWI units using control options to require that the minimum operating parameters (e.g., combustion operating chamber temperature, pressure drop, liquid flow rate, etc.) established for initial compliance are calculated based on the lowest 1-hr average as measured during the most recent performance test (or representative performance test) demonstrating compliance, and revising the continuous compliance requirements to specify the averaging times for continuous compliances for operating parameters for the extended control options (which is generally based on 3-hour rolling averages).

Clarifying that for continuous monitoring, the 12-hour rolling average values must include CEMS data during startup and shutdown.

Adding a requirement that the incinerator operator training course under40 CFR 60.2905(c) and 40 CFR 60.3014(c) must include coverage of good combustion practices as well as waste characterization procedures, and related actions for prevention and correction of malfunctions.

Adding a provision to40 CFR 60.2911 and 40 CFR 60.3020 to clarify that batch units must always have a qualified operator accessible times during the operation of the unit.

Updating40 CFR 60.2890 and 40 CFR 60.2998 to clarify the principal components of the subparts include definitions and table.

For existing units, adding new section40 CFR 60.3003 to clarify that certain substitute means of compliance demonstration requirements must be completed prior to the compliance date.

Modifying40 CFR 60.2910 to 40 CFR 60.3019 to clarify that site-specific documentation must include procedures for establishing initial and continuous compliance.

Updating requirements for initial and annual performance tests such that they must be conducted according to the methods and meet the revised emissions limitations specified in tables 1 through 1b to subpart EEEE and tables 2 and 2a to subpart FFFF, as applicable.

Updating40 CFR 60.2922(e), 40 CFR 60.2940(c), 40 CFR 60.3027(e), and 40 CFR 60.3039(c) to add references to ASME/ANSI PTC 19.10-198 Part 10 (2010), “Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses” (previously approved as an alternative method to EPA Method 3B in the 2005 OSWI rule).

Adding an additional test method, ASTM D7520-16, “Standard Test Method for Determining the Opacity of a Plume in the Outdoor Ambient Atmosphere,” as an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 9 for opacity. This test method was identified as an acceptable alternative to EPA Method 9 when specific provisions are followed.

Revising40 CFR 60.2932(d) and 40 CFR 60.3033(d) to specify that VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD using control devices must continuously monitor operating parameters and specifying the averaging values to demonstrate continuous compliance.

Revising40 CFR 60.2939 and 40 CFR 60.3038 (requirements for installation and calibration of CEMS) such that they apply only to OSWI units with a capacity greater than 10 TPD.

Clarifying the installation and calibration requirements for operating parameter equipment in40 CFR 60.2944 and 40 CFR 60.3043, including adding new requirements for bag leak detection systems.

Revising40 CFR 60.2949(b) and 40 CFR 60.3046(b) to incorporate ( printed page 27923) recordkeeping for data from OSWI units that use an alternate method for air pollution control beyond a wet scrubber, dry scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, fabric filter, or other method such as material balance.

Clarifying that for CO CEMS, records of annual performance evaluations must be maintained (40 CFR 60.2949(g) and 40 CFR 60.3046(g)).

Adding a recordkeeping requirement for notifications submitted for excluded units, such as temporary-use incinerators.

Revising40 CFR 60.2954 to clarify that a copy of the waste management plan must be submitted following the initial performance test, for consistency with 40 CFR 60.3049(c).

Clarifying that for facilities with a title V permit, the permit may address the submittal timeline of the annual report (40 CFR 60.2955, 40 CFR 60.3050).

Minor clarifications to the content of the annual reports and deviation reports, including what information must be submitted if a performance test is conducted during the annual period and what information may be excluded if the reports are submitted via CEDRI (40 CFR 60.2956, 40 CFR 60.3051).

Other minor grammatical or technical edits (e.g., corrections to typographical errors or cross-references within existing provisions, or to clarify existing provisions).

We are also including several additional minor clarifying edits in the final rule based on comments received during the public comment period, such as adjusting the testing requirements for seasonal weather issues. The comments and our responses can be found in section IV.B.1 of this preamble and in the Summary of Public Comments and Responses for the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration Units Review, available in the docket for this rulemaking.

G. What are the effective and compliance dates of the standards?

In the 2020 Proposed Rule, we established that OSWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD that commenced construction after August 31, 2020 are new units and those that commenced construction prior to August 31, 2020 are considered existing incineration units. We are finalizing the effective and compliance dates for OSWI units to distinguish between new and existing OSWI units and to require any incinerator already subject to a current OSWI standard to continue to comply with that standard until the effective date of the revised OSWI standards. Table 4 of this preamble provides the applicable compliance dates for new and existing OSWI units.

The effective date of this final action is August 29, 2025. We are finalizing the compliance dates for the amended rule as proposed. The compliance dates depend on whether the OSWI unit is a VSMWC or IWI unit with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD, or a VSMWC or IWI unit with a capacity greater than 10 TPD, and whether the OSWI unit is a new or existing unit.

However, we are are revising the dates by which a source is considered a new source to be consistent with the construct of CAA sections 111 and 129. A new VSMWC or IWI unit is a unit that commenced construction after August 31, 2020, or commenced modification or reconstruction on or after December 29, 2025. Sources that commenced construction after December 9, 2004, or commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 16, 2006, which are currently new sources under the 2005 OSWI rule, will become existing sources. However, these sources must continue to comply with the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart EEEE, including the emission limits in table 1 to the subpart, until the unit is subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart FFFF through an approved state plan or Federal plan. The 2005 OSWI rule emission limits for new and existing sources were identical, so the stringency of the limits and ability of the unit to comply with the limits is not changing for sources which were new sources under the 2005 OSWI rule and will becoming existing sources under the this final rule.

Similarly, as discussed in sections III.C and IV.A of this preamble, SRIs which are currently regulated under the CISWI rules will become subject to regulation under the OSWI rule in this final action. We believe that all or most of these units will be VSMWCs with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD. If any SRIs meet the definition of a new unit, then these new units must demonstrate compliance with the final rule by no later than December 29, 2025, or by the date the unit first begins operation, whichever is later. If any SRIs do not meet the definition of a new unit, then these units must demonstrate compliance by July 1, 2030 or 3 years after the effective date of the state plan approval, whichever is earlier. However, SRIs that do not meet the definition of a new unit, and which are currently regulated under the CISWI rules must continue to demonstrate compliance with subpart CCCC or DDDD of this part, or subpart IIIa of part 62, until the unit becomes subject to the requirements of an approved state plan or federal plan that implements subpart FFFF of this part (Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units).

( printed page 27924)

This action eliminates the SSM provisions at 40 CFR 60.2918 and 40 CFR 60.3025 and adds electronic reporting. Eliminating the SSM provisions will provide more data on emission limits and operating limits. As noted at proposal, the finalized electronic reporting provisions will reduce burden on regulated facilities, delegated air agencies, and the EPA. Accordingly, we are finalizing the removal of SSM provisions and the addition of electronic reporting for all OSWI units. As stated in section III.F.3 of this preamble, for deviation reports and annual compliance reports, the final rule requires owners and operators to use the appropriate spreadsheet template to submit information to CEDRI beginning June 30, 2026, or once the reporting forms have been made available in CEDRI for at least 1 year, whichever date is later. The final rule requires owners and operators to submit performance test reports and CEMS performance evaluation reports to CEDRI beginning on December 29, 2025.

1. OSWI Units With Capacities Less Than or Equal to 10 TPD

For VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD, we are finalizing revised MACT standards and revised compliance, monitoring, and testing requirements. For new sources, CAA section 129(f)(1) requires that performance standards and other requirements shall be effective 6 months after the promulgation of the final rule. For these purposes, a new VSMWC or IWI unit with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD is a unit that commenced construction after August 31, 2020, or commenced modification or reconstruction on or after December 29, 2025. We are finalizing, as proposed, that these new units must demonstrate compliance with the final rule by no later than December 29, 2025, or by the date the unit first begins operation, whichever is later.

For existing sources, CAA section 129(f)(2) provides that the performance standards and other requirements shall be effective not later than 3 years after the state plan is approved or July 1, 2030, whichever is earlier. For these purposes, an existing VSMWC or IWI unit with capacity less than or equal to 10 TPD is one for which construction commenced on or before August 31, 2020.

For existing VSMWC and IWI units with capacities less than or equal to 10 TPD, we are finalizing a compliance date of July 1, 2030, or 3 years after the effective date of the state plan approval, whichever is earlier.

OSWI units with a capacity less than 10 TPD that commenced construction after December 9, 2004, or commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 16, 2006, and that are subject to the 2005 OSWI standard must continue to comply with the 2005 OSWI standard until the unit is subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart FFFF through an approved state plan or Federal plan.

2. OSWI Units With Capacities Greater Than 10 TPD

Under the final rule, OSWI units with a capacity greater than 10 TPD continue, with limited changes, to be subject to the requirements of the OSWI standards that were promulgated in 2005—either the NSPS or a plan promulgated pursuant to the EG. With certain exceptions (discussed below), these sources will continue to follow the emission and operating limits, including compliance, monitoring, and testing provisions, associated with the 2005 OSWI standards. However, because the definition of a new source is being revised, the compliance dates are changing in the final rule. Emissions and operating limits apply to new OSWI units with a capacity greater than 10 TPD when they begin to operate, although there are some pre-construction requirements (see 40 CFR 60.2881). For existing OSWI units with a capacity greater than 10 TPD (that is, OSWI units that commenced construction on or before August 31, 2020, or commenced reconstruction or modification before December 29, 2025), CAA section 129(f)(2) provides that performance standards and other requirements shall be effective as expeditiously as practicable after approval of a state plan or promulgation of a Federal plan, but no later than 5 years after they are promulgated. Therefore, compliance for existing sources must be demonstrated by July 1, 2030, or 3 years after the effective date of the state plan approval, whichever is earlier. However, incineration units with a capacity greater than 10 TPD that commenced construction after December 9, 2004, or commenced reconstruction or modification on or after June 16, 2006, and that are subject to the 2005 OSWI standard must continue to comply with the 2005 standard until the unit is subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart FFFF through an approved state plan or Federal plan.

IV. Public Comments and Responses

Additional comments and our specific responses can be found in the comment summary and response document titled Summary of Public Comments and Responses for the Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: Other Solid Waste Incineration Units Review, which is available in the docket (see Docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0156) for this rulemaking. Key comments and responses are discussed below.

A. What key comments did we receive on the applicability of OSWI requirements, and what are our responses?

Comment: The EPA received several comments on the proposed revisions to add a definition of “rudimentary combustion unit”. One commenter did not support the proposed addition of a definition, expressing concerns that prematurely changing the definition puts the EPA on track to develop regulations without appropriate data. The commenter requested that EPA conduct an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to ask for additional data and work with and provide resources to Tribes to collect this data.

Other commenters supported the proposed changes, but at least one commenter recommended that the definition be simplified to provide ease of compliance. One commenter stated that the definition should include a “non-exhaustive” list of what units meet the definition of a rudimentary combustion device, such as cyclonic burn barrels, 55-gallon burn barrels, and locally obtained or manufactured burn receptables such as dumpsters.

The commenter also provided input on the individual criteria that EPA proposed as part of the definition. Specifically, commenters noted that the wording “managing air flow and discharging flue gases from combustion” is confusing. The commenters stated that in any combustion device, a stack, chimney or pipe is used to remove the post-combustion flue gases or to direct the exhaust gas to the atmosphere, and that the air flow (combustion air) is handled, controlled, and metered at the burden. Commenters therefore recommended that the text “managing air flow” be removed.

Commenters also questioned the meaning of the criterion “burners designed to manage the combustion process”. Commenters stated that EPA's intent is unclear and that if the criterion is meant to include any devices that have burners or a specific type of burner ( e.g., burner with modulating or staging controls) then the language should be updated to “designed to initiate and/or maintain or assist the combustion process” or to more clearly explain the type of burner. Commenters also ( printed page 27925) questioned the meaning of “supplemental fuel burners or nozzles” as included in the proposed definition. Commenters stated that if the intent is to not include devices with a specific type of burner and “supplemental fuel burners or nozzles” or to exclude devices equipped with secondary combustion, this should be more plainly stated.

One commenter added that the proposed definition's inclusion of a capacity limit of “less than or equal to 10 TPD that is designed and constructed without one or more of the following elements” may inadvertently discourage businesses or villages from acquiring small modern packaged incinerators that are cleaner burning but that are equipped with all five elements. The commenter noted that rudimentary combustion devices will almost exclusively be hand-fed in portable (hand-carried) batches, and that 10 TPD of hand-held or delivered batches would be equivalent to 500 individual batches, daily.[ ] The commenter stated that this amount exceeds the realistic expectations of the population statistics of the average village communities using such devices. The commenter suggested that the rationale of a specific number for capacity or throughput deserves additional consideration, especially in consideration of the recordkeeping requirements that would be required for compliance with weight throughput limitations (which would be excessive for remote areas and ineffective for most batch units). The commenter questioned what recordkeeping or reporting would be required to verify compliance, especially provided that these activities generally fall below permitting thresholds. The commenter suggested that the EPA may want to consider setting a volume limit threshold for these devices ( e.g., “smaller than a dump truck”), or consider adding the qualifier “uncompacted, loose” to the type of trash that may be burned in such devices. Another commenter requested that EPA consider the potential unintended consequences of any future regulation of such devices. Specifically, the commenter stated that the EPA must not force communities with few resources to purchase commercially available combustion devices.

Other commenters criticized the proposed definition as overly broad and lacking in protective provisions, by not adequately narrowing the circumstances, locations, or devices that would be eligible. Commenters supported including restrictions to ensure that the use of such units is limited to those areas that truly have no better options, including very clear descriptions and specifics about the types of devices that are included in the definition of “rudimentary combustion device” and the criteria that must be met for a geographic area to qualify, so that only those with the logistical challenges described in the proposal will be eligible for the exemption. Other commenters expressed that the proposed rule did not define the circumstances or restrictions under which rudimentary combustion devices may be used and recommended that the EPA add a clarification to the definition to avoid use of the devices where access to municipal solid waste disposal is readily available or where installation of such devices could result in the circumvention of the OSWI standards. Commenters also objected to the proposed definition as it would apply in their jurisdiction, which prohibits open burning; the commenters warned the definition is confusing and could lead to an increase in air pollution.

Several commenters requested that the EPA provide more clarity on what geographic areas would be qualified to be exempt from the OSWI regulations. A commenter noted that Alaska is geographically diverse, with areas of limited or no road access, and that the EPA should clarify whether units in the following circumstances are exempt: (1) devices located in rural areas not accessible by the Federal Aid Highway System, including what distance from the road area is necessary for exemption; (2) devices transported and utilized by oil spill prevention and response teams in remote areas for response cleanup; (3) devices located in municipal areas at businesses or other commercial institutions that may have refuse service provided they are only used for on-site generated waste; and (4) devices located at industrial facilities along the Federal Aid Highway system that are days away from waste disposal facilities, including what distance from an organized landfill or from an improved road system qualifies for exemption. One commenter added the rule should ensure that use of a rudimentary combustion device would not be allowed when it conflicts with more stringent state or local rules and regulations. Other commenters generally opposed the broad applicability of the definition of rudimentary combustion unit throughout the U.S., recommending that the EPA adjust the definition to pertain specifically to Alaska, and take time to develop standards for the rest of the country.

One commenter also requested that the EPA consider providing clear rules related to the use of rudimentary combustion devices during emergency remote spill responses. The commenter explained that the waste from such spills is effectively managed through incineration in small batch cyclonic burn barrels or other devices. The commenter requested that any rules on such usage b",https://www.federalregister.gov/assets/open_graph_site_banner.png,N,,2025-06-28 12:14:11.301297

It’s unclear what effect, if any, that lawsuit could have on the current election.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between WABE and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

The Georgia Public Service Commission will make two major decisions next month, on a proposal to temporarily freeze Georgia Power’s rates and on the utility’s long-term plan to make and deliver energy. Hearings on both issues this week got heated at times.

The rate freeze proposal comes after the commission approved six bill increases implemented over the last three years. Georgia Power was due to submit another rate plan by July 1. Company officials testified on Thursday that they were facing a revenue shortfall, meaning they’d likely have requested another rate hike.

Instead, the utility reached a deal with commission staff to leave base rates at their current level temporarily.

“We think this is a good, safe bet for ratepayers to keep rates where they are for the next three years,” said Tom Bond, the director of utilities at the commission.

Critics have raised concerns about the transparency of the process and its future impacts.

The energy plan, known as the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), seeks to meet an enormous increase in demand that the utility is predicting in the coming years, which it attributes mostly to new data centers. It calls for a mix of resources, including expanding solar, upgrading transmission lines and older power plants, and keeping coal plants open past their previously announced closing dates.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have criticized its use of climate-warming fossil fuels. Analysts have also criticized the demand forecast itself, arguing that it overestimates both the amount of energy new, large power users like data centers will need and how soon they’ll need it.

Commissioners are preparing to vote on both issues during the first Public Service Commission election in years, after two rounds of elections were canceled while a lawsuit worked its way through the courts. Another lawsuit could affect the current vote, though it’s not yet clear how.

During the public comment periods that begin each day of hearings, speakers have criticized the commission this week for not acting quickly and decisively enough to cut fossil fuel use in the face of climate change, and for raising power rates. Speakers make similar points during most commission hearings.

Some commissioners didn’t take kindly to the criticism.

Commissioner Tricia Pridemore on Tuesday claimed commenters get paid to come in and, as she put it, agitate.

“We’re doing all the things that you’re asking us to do, but yet you stand up there and chide us and accuse us and lie about us,” she said. “While the rest of us are being adults and running things, you might want to try it yourself.”

After healthcare workers raised concerns about rising energy bills and the health impacts of climate change and air pollution, Commissioner Tim Echols deflected, questioning a nurse about healthcare costs and a doctor about whether parents’ smoking contributes to kids’ asthma.

Doctor Preeti Jaggi, another commenter, pushed back against Echols’ input.

“I think the time here is for you to listen to the public, and we as clinicians are giving you our perspective,” she said. “And we appreciate you listening to us.”

Pridemore then chided Jaggi for that criticism.

Freezing rates

Several commissioners applauded the rate freeze proposal in advance of Thursday’s hearing on it — a move that advocacy groups objected to. A complaint from Georgians for Affordable Energy, the Center for a Sustainable Coast, Georgia Conservation Voters and Georgia WAND called on Echols, Commission Chair Jason Shaw and Commissioner Bubba McDonald to recuse themselves from voting on the issue. All three declined to do so.

The agreement would keep base power rates at their current level for three years, but Georgia Power could still pass on the costs of fuel and cleaning up Hurricane Helene to customers next year. Many critics of the deal worry that caveat means power bills would go up anyway.

The plan also relies in part on Georgia Power deferring some of its costs over the next few years. Some advocates worry that could add up to an even bigger rate hike in 2028.

Company officials denied both concerns.

“A lot of the adjustments we’ve made as a part of this stipulation will benefit customers well past the next three years, and into ‘28, ‘29, and 2030,” said Georgia Power chief financial officer Aaron Abramovitz.

Of the expected 2026 adjustment for storm and fuel costs, “there’s an opportunity for rates to stay flat or decrease next year,” he said, depending on the price of natural gas in the coming months.

The commission is set to vote on the rate freeze proposal on July 1.

Election complications

Echols and Commissioner Fitz Johnson are both running to keep their seats this year, in elections scheduled for Nov. 4. Echols defeated a primary challenger and will face Democrat Alicia Johnson in the general election. The democratic primary to choose Fitz Johnson’s opponent is headed to a runoff on July 15.

Both of these elections were originally set for 2022 but called off due to a voting rights lawsuit. Pridemore was also due to face reelection last year, but that election was canceled as well.

The state legislature passed a law in 2024 laying out a new schedule for elections. It extends the terms of the current commissioners past their original six years in order to keep the elections staggered — a provision that is the subject of a fresh legal challenge.

Last year, a group of advocates sued, arguing the law violates the state constitution by granting commissioners terms longer than six years. A judge dismissed the suit, but the plaintiffs have appealed. A judge granted a motion to expedite the case this month.

The company confirms that the build-out of the plant’s structure is now complete, with key mechanical, electrical, and piping systems well underway — a major step toward launching the first domestically produced lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells by a U.S. automaker.

Lisa Drake, Vice President of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, emphasized the importance of this milestone, stating, “We remain on track to start production of these batteries next year.” The facility marks a historic turning point, with Ford independently manufacturing LFP cells and packs — without relying on foreign joint ventures — using American talent and technology.

The nearly one-mile-long facility is already producing C-sample LFP cells at an off-site supplier location. These advanced prototypes will soon undergo design-confirmation testing for Ford’s next-generation electric vehicle program. Once the equipment arrives onsite, areas of the plant will transition into clean-room environments to meet rigorous quality standards essential for high-performance EV battery production.

The $3 billion investment in BlueOval Battery Park Michigan reflects Ford’s broader ambition for vertical integration, supply chain control, and energy independence. The plant will employ approximately 1,700 American workers, bolstering Michigan’s economy while pushing the U.S. forward in the global energy race.

LFP technology is celebrated for its safety, long lifecycle, and cost-efficiency — making it a key to Ford’s strategy to produce more affordable EVs. By investing in localized, large-scale LFP production, Ford aims to improve vehicle performance, reduce charging times, and drive down EV costs for consumers.

“This facility represents the return of advanced battery innovation to American soil,” added Drake. “It’s not just a factory — it’s the foundation for the future of electric mobility in the U.S.”

Ford’s BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is expected to begin full-scale production in 2026, positioning the company as a pioneer in the domestic EV battery manufacturing landscape.",https://emobilityplus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cqdam.web_.2400.webp,N,,2025-06-28 11:05:39.878072

As offshore wind projects proliferate and regulators accelerate leasing, the region is now at the vanguard of a dual mission: advancing renewable energy while securing domestic energy supply chains. Central to this transition are vessels like the ECO Liberty, a U.S.-built service operations vessel (SOV) that symbolizes the intersection of energy innovation and national security. For investors, this maritime renaissance presents a compelling opportunity to profit from a strategic pivot toward homegrown energy infrastructure.

The ECO Liberty: A Vessel of Strategic Importance

The ECO Liberty, a 262-foot SOV constructed by Edison Chouest Offshore (ECO), is more than a ship—it's a linchpin for Gulf-based offshore wind projects. Built with American steel and employing over 500 Gulf Coast workers, the vessel's hybrid propulsion system and dynamic positioning capabilities allow it to support wind farm construction, maintenance, and emergency response efforts.

This vessel's significance extends beyond its technical prowess. By leveraging the SHIPS Act, a bipartisan bill incentivizing domestic shipbuilding, ECO and its peers are ensuring U.S. control over critical energy infrastructure. As offshore wind projects like RWE's Gulf of Mexico Wind Auction 1 (1.24 GW capacity) and Hecate Energy's 2 GW proposal advance, vessels like the ECO Liberty will be indispensable. Their presence reduces reliance on foreign-flagged ships, strengthens supply chains, and creates high-paying Gulf Coast jobs.

Gulf of Mexico: A Hotspot for Renewable and Traditional Energy Synergy

The Gulf's energy renaissance isn't confined to renewables. Traditional oil projects—such as Beacon Offshore Energy's Shenandoah FPS, now producing 140,000 barrels per day—coexist with emerging wind ventures. Chevron's Ballymore project, which began production in April 2025 via a subsea tieback, exemplifies how older infrastructure can be repurposed to cut costs and accelerate timelines.

This dual focus is no accident. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has fast-tracked leasing for wind projects, including Gulf Wind Auction 2 (which could power 3 million homes), while also approving oil developments like Shenandoah South. The result is a $1.03 billion investment pipeline in Gulf energy infrastructure, supported by both private capital and federal policy.

The Gulf of Mexico's share is projected to grow from 0% to 15% of total U.S. capacity by 2030.

Strategic Implications: Energy Security and Technological Leadership

The ECO Liberty's role underscores a broader national strategy. By mandating U.S. shipbuilding for offshore projects, policies like the SHIPS Act ensure that energy infrastructure remains under American control. This reduces risks tied to geopolitical disruptions—think Russian or Chinese dominance in critical supply chains—and bolsters military applications. As OMSA President Aaron Smith noted, the same jacking systems used in wind installations can support naval operations, creating a dual-use advantage.

For investors, this means backing companies that bridge energy and maritime sectors. Edison Chouest, for instance, has a decades-long track record in Gulf shipbuilding and now commands a 30% market share in SOV construction. Meanwhile, wind developers like RWE and Hecate Energy are poised to benefit from BOEM's leasing momentum.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Look

U.S. Shipbuilders: Companies like Edison Chouest (part of Chouest Group) and Ferguson Marine are direct beneficiaries of the SHIPS Act. Their stock performance reflects this:

CHOU has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% over the past year, driven by SOV demand.

Offshore Wind Developers: RWE and Hecate Energy's projects could generate $5 billion+ in cumulative revenue by 2030. Investors might consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE), which includes exposure to offshore energy firms.

Gulf Oil Infrastructure: Firms like Morrison Midstream, which completed a deepwater pipeline in Louisiana in 2025, benefit from dual energy demand. Their stocks often correlate with oil prices but offer stability due to long-term contracts.

Risks and Considerations

Regulatory Volatility: While BOEM has accelerated leasing, projects like Shenandoah South still require approvals that could delay timelines.

Weather Risks: The 2025 hurricane season, forecasted to have 17 named storms, threatens both wind turbines and oil platforms.

Commodity Prices: Oil prices below $70/barrel could stall deepwater projects, though renewables are less sensitive.

Conclusion: A Gulf of Opportunities

The Gulf of Mexico's energy infrastructure boom—driven by U.S.-built vessels like the ECO Liberty—offers investors a rare trifecta: strategic national security benefits, high-growth renewable projects, and stable oil infrastructure plays. As offshore wind capacity expands and traditional oil fields optimize through technology, the Gulf is no longer just a supplier of crude—it's a proving ground for energy independence.

For portfolios, allocating 5–10% to Gulf-focused energy stocks or ETFs could yield outsized returns. The vessels, pipelines, and wind farms now taking shape in the Gulf aren't just about energy—they're about securing America's future.

Halfway into 2025, well-known brands like Audi, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Dodge, and Kia have all launched new electric vehicles, and Tesla (TSLA) rolled out its highly anticipated robotaxi service to a select group of riders in Austin, Texas.

The electric vehicle industry continues to grow, with global sales exceeding the expected $17 million in 2024, accounting for over 20% of total car sales.

While global sales continue to increase, financial challenges can lead even the most profitable companies to make some harsh decisions for the sake of the business.

Rivian exceeds growth expectations

Founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, Rivian is an American electric vehicle manufacturer and technology company.

However, like any other emerging business, making profits takes time, and the cost of producing electric vehicles is high.

Although it boasted continued financial progress, the company didn't achieve profitability until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, largely due to cuts in production costs.

Since then, Rivian (RIVN) has taken multiple steps to build on this success.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Rivian achieved a gross profit of $206 million, marking its second consecutive positive quarter.

The EV maker also received a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen Group as part of last year's $5.8 billion joint venture, Rivian and VW Group Technologies, LLC.

However, despite delivering good results, production costs continue to increase, especially as the company navigates an uncertain economy and looming U.S. tariffs.

This has led Rivian to make a harsh decision that may have come as a surprise to some.

Rivian cuts its workforce amid a major launch

Rivian revealed it has laid off around 140 employees from its manufacturing division, representing around 1% of its total workforce.

The downsizing comes when the company is only months away from launching its new R2 SUV in 2026, a new electric five-seat SUV that's a more compact and far more affordable alternative.

The layoffs began on June 25, and those affected were told that the company's decision to cut manufacturing salaried positions was made to improve its operational efficiency ahead of the R2 launch.

However, this is not the first time Rivian has made serious cuts within its workforce.

The company did two rounds of layoffs last year, cutting around 10% of its salaried employees in February and 1% in April.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA4MDU3NTczNDc4MjQ1ODI5/rivian-r2-unveiling-event.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 06:02:17.038418

“It’s outrageous that the President is suggesting reducing Army Corps construction funding by 53 percent.
I urge our leaders on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that California’s Army Corps projects are fully funded in 2026,” said Thompson.
Specifically excluded from the Budget request were four California projects which have previously received strong, unambiguous Congressional support.
“In Sacramento, we’ve long worked with the Army Corps—regardless of who is in the White House—to reduce flood risk and save lives.","Washington, D.C. – This week, Representative Mike Thompson (CA-04) joined a dozen Members of the California Congressional Delegation to send a letter to the House Appropriations Committee calling for the Committee to reject the Trump Administration’s drastic cuts to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).

The President’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) recommended a 53 percent lower level of funding compared to Fiscal Year 2024 and excluded vital flood prevention projects in California. This funding request is seriously insufficient to meet the flood risk management, navigation, ecosystem restoration, and other needs of communities across our state.

“It’s outrageous that the President is suggesting reducing Army Corps construction funding by 53 percent. The projects he proposes defunding include essential plans in California to repair and reconstruct levees and build and strengthen flood protection infrastructure. These projects have bipartisan support because our community knows too well the devastation from floods and other natural disasters. I urge our leaders on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that California’s Army Corps projects are fully funded in 2026,” said Thompson.

“Each of these projects has already received substantial federal funding to date. Leaving the projects half-finished would not be an efficient use of federal or non-federal resources...These projects are vital to the safety and prosperity of our constituents,” said the Congressmembers in their letter.

Specifically excluded from the Budget request were four California projects which have previously received strong, unambiguous Congressional support. The four projects are: the American River Common Features, Natomas Basin, CA project; the Pajaro River at Watsonville, CA project; the San Joaquin River Basin project; and the West Sacramento, CA project. The FY25 President’s Budget and both the House and Senate draft FY25 appropriations bills all included a total of $126.4 million in construction funding for four projects before the Trump Administration prevented them from receiving any FY25 funding.

The full text of the letter can be found here(link is external).

Joining Rep. Thompson in sending the letter were Reps. Zoe Lofgren (CA-18), Josh Harder (CA-09), Jimmy Panetta (CA-19), Ami Bera (CA-06), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Derek Tran (CA-45), Mike Levin (CA-49), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Robert Garcia (CA-42), Ro Khanna (CA-17), and Jared Huffman (CA-02).

“Californians are all too familiar with the devastating consequences of poor flood risk management. In California’s 18th District, the community of Pajaro has suffered significant damage and loss of life due to flooding for decades. The Pajaro River Project is vital for the area’s safety and livelihood, and I will continue to fight to ensure it receives funding until its completion,” said Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, Chair of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation.

“Yanking flood protection funding at the last-minute makes no sense and puts our Valley communities at risk,” said Rep. Harder. “We face flood threats every year because of aging infrastructure and we worked across the aisle to finally get the flood protection we need. Now, Washington is trying to steal back funding for our levees, and I refuse to let them get away with it.”

“The Administration’s decision to omit the Pajaro River Flood Risk Management Project from the Army Corps’ work plan not only ignores the bipartisan support behind this project, but also puts lives, homes, and livelihoods in the Pajaro Valley at continued risk,” said Rep. Panetta. “That’s why our delegation is urging Congressional appropriators to reject these devastating cuts and fund the critical, shovel-ready flood protection projects that have already been vetted, authorized, and previously funded. As we’ve done before, we will keep fighting to protect the people and produce of the Pajaro Valley and ensure the federal government lives up to its commitment to our community.”

“Sacramento County is one of the most at-risk areas in the nation for catastrophic flooding. In recent decades, we’ve seen firsthand how high-water events threaten our neighborhoods, small businesses, and critical infrastructure. The American River Common Features project in the Natomas Basin plays a vital role in strengthening levees to modern standards and ensuring that our region is better prepared for the future. Leaving this project unfunded not only puts Sacramento families in harm’s way—it risks wasting the significant progress and investments already made. We must keep our commitment to public safety by continuing to partner with the Army Corps of Engineers and fully funding these vital projects,” said Congressman Ami Bera.

“When it comes to the safety of our communities, politics needs to be put aside to build life-saving infrastructure improvements. That is how it has always been – and that is how it should stay,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “In Sacramento, we’ve long worked with the Army Corps—regardless of who is in the White House—to reduce flood risk and save lives. These partnerships have transformed our region’s outlook on disaster preparedness. That’s why I’ll keep fighting to restore funding for the Natomas Basin and West Sacramento projects that are critical to the future of the region.”

“The Trump Administration’s proposed cuts to the USACE will devastate communities across Orange and LA Counties that are still recovering from disastrous fires,” said Representative Tran. “Infrastructure capable of withstanding increased rainfall and flooding throughout California is essential to keeping our communities safe. I urge my colleagues to reject these drastic cuts and protect our neighbors from the impacts of serious flooding.”",https://mikethompson.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-28 14:06:26.618128

Final Verdict: Buy the Dip, Play the Long Game Lucid is a bet on two unstoppable trends: U.S. supply chain resilience and legislative favoritism toward domestic manufacturing.","The electric vehicle (EV) market is entering a new era of geopolitical and regulatory turbulence. As tariffs escalate and U.S. lawmakers tighten supply chain rules, Lucid Group (LCID) is emerging as a standout play for investors seeking exposure to EVs with minimal exposure to China's dominance. By anchoring its battery supply chain to U.S. partners like Graphite One and Panasonic, Lucid is positioning itself to thrive while rivals like Tesla (TSLA) grapple with tariff headwinds and legislative risks. Let's dissect why this strategy could turn Lucid into a long-term winner.

Supply Chain Resilience: The U.S. Playbook

Lucid's vertically integrated Arizona factory—spanning 3.9 million square feet—is the cornerstone of its domestic-first strategy. Unlike Tesla, which sources critical components like batteries and anode materials from China, Lucid is weaving its supply chain within U.S. borders. Key moves:

Graphite One & Syrah Resources:

Lucid's agreements with Graphite One (natural/synthetic graphite from Alaska and Ohio, starting 2028) and Syrah Resources (natural graphite from Louisiana, starting 2026) eliminate reliance on China, the world's largest graphite producer. This reduces tariff exposure and ensures stable supply for fast-charging batteries.

Synthetic graphite production in Ohio (via licensed Chinese tech) addresses domestic expertise gaps while keeping manufacturing local.

Panasonic's Kansas Battery Plant:

Transitioning to Panasonic's U.S. facility cuts ties to Japan and South Korea, where Tesla sources most of its batteries. This localization aligns with U.S. tax credit rules under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Lucid is poised to qualify for.

Contrast with Tesla: Tesla's China-centric supply chain—70% of its battery anode materials come from Chinese firms—leaves it vulnerable to escalating tariffs. The Biden administration's 2025 ban on Chinese-made EVs under the IRA could force Tesla to retool its supply chain at significant cost.

Legislative Tailwinds: The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" Advantage

The Senate's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (expected to pass this year) could eliminate tax credits for EVs relying on ""prohibited foreign entities"" (PFEs), such as Chinese manufacturers. Key provisions:

Material Assistance Thresholds: Starting 2026, EVs must source ≥40% of critical components (e.g., batteries, inverters) from non-PFE sources. This rises to 60% by 2030.

Final Assembly Rules: Vehicles must be assembled in North America (U.S., Canada, Mexico) to qualify for credits. Lucid's Arizona factory meets this; Tesla's Shanghai-made vehicles do not.

If enacted, Lucid stands to gain:

- Tax Credits Retention: Its domestic battery supply chain and U.S. assembly could secure full IRA incentives.

- Competitor Disadvantage: Rivals like BYD or NIO (if classified as PFEs) would lose U.S. tax credits, shrinking their market access.

Market Positioning: Luxury Now, Mid-Market Later

Lucid's dual-pronged strategy targets both high-end and mass markets:

1. Luxury Segment: The Lucid Air sedan and Gravity SUV (2025 launch) cater to premium buyers, leveraging its 520-mile range and software-defined architecture. Early Gravity pre-orders suggest strong demand.

2. Mid-Market Expansion: A planned 2026 midsize SUV aims to scale volumes, reducing per-unit costs and boosting margins.

While Lucid's current output lags Tesla's, its focus on high-margin, U.S.-focused products offers a safer path to profitability amid market shifts.

Investment Thesis: Ride the Geopolitical Wave

Bull Case:

- Graphite One/Syrah supply ramps on schedule (2026–2028).

- ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passes, disqualifying PFE-reliant competitors.

- Gravity SUV drives 2025 deliveries to 20,000+, with margins improving to 15–20%.

Bear Risks:

- Graphite One's Chinese tech dependency could delay Ohio plant timelines.

- Near-term losses (Q1 2025 net loss: $366M) may pressure liquidity.

Why Buy Now?

- Valuation: Lucid trades at ~5x 2025E revenue ($25B market cap vs. $5B revenue), cheaper than Tesla's 10x.

- Liquidity: $5.76B in cash gives it runway to 2026.

Final Verdict: Buy the Dip, Play the Long Game

Lucid is a bet on two unstoppable trends: U.S. supply chain resilience and legislative favoritism toward domestic manufacturing. While short-term losses and execution risks exist, its moat against tariffs and PFE restrictions positions it to outperform as the EV market consolidates. For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, LCID is a compelling play to own.

Action Item: Accumulate Lucid shares on dips below $15 (current price ~$18). Set a 12-month target of $28–32, assuming Gravity's success and tax credit wins.

In Washtenaw County, Torc Robotics – a Virginia-based independent subsidiary of Daimler Truck AG – will establish an engineering innovation center in Ann Arbor Township with support from a $3 million performance-based Michigan Business Development Program (MBDP) grant approved by the MSF. The company also considered Texas and Virginia for the project, which will create up to 500 new jobs and at least $5.59 million in investment in Michigan.

With plans to hire engineers and technologists at an average salary of $177,000 annually, Torc’s new hub will focus on advancing its cutting-edge autonomous driving software for long-haul trucking. While the facility will not host on-site vehicle testing, it will serve as a critical research and development engine for the company’s future innovations.

“This strategic location is a natural fit for Torc as we continue to advance our autonomous technology,” said Jamie Swaim, Chief People Officer at Torc. “Ann Arbor’s proximity to the Detroit automotive industry and a wealth of high-tech talent, combined with the exceptional concentration of high-caliber universities and colleges, makes it an ideal environment for our growth and productization strategy. This new center will complement the strong engineering talent we already have across the nation.”

In addition to the MBDP grant, Ann Arbor SPARK has been actively working with Torc and the MEDC to provide support for the project by job portal exposure and marketing support.

“With the launch of its new engineering and innovation center in Ann Arbor, Torc is helping tell the story that this region is where mobility companies come to scale,” said Paul Krutko, president and CEO of Ann Arbor SPARK. “As a 20-year-old startup now backed by Daimler Truck, Torc’s growth reinforces Ann Arbor’s position as a destination for world-class engineering talent and next-generation transportation innovation.

Kathy Hochul has tapped the New York State Power Authority to build the first major new US nuclear power plant in over 15 years.

Bad news: New York’s history of politicians pandering to anti-nuke hysteria will scare off a lot of potential private “partners” on building the one-gigawatt plant.

After all, it’s just four years since then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo forced the early closure of Indian Point — and four decades since then-Gov. Mario Cuomo killed the $6 billion Shoreham nuke plant before it even opened.

Hochul has belatedly recognized reality: New York has no hope of coming near meeting any of its clean-energy goals without nuclear power — and indeed is already hard-pressed for enough generating capacity to meet the natural growth in electric demands.

For example, Micron’s New York semiconductor plant will require massive amounts of reliable electricity, potentially 1.85 gigawatts at full capacity — enough to power half a million homes.

The windmills and solar power plants pushed by the state Climate Action Plan can never meet that need.

Yet nuke plants take a long time to build, and getting the state-of-the-art modular reactor Hochul envisions is a lot harder than calling for it.

The Cuomos’ anti-nuke actions — Long Islanders are still paying for Shoreham, while Indian Point had supplied 25% of the electricity needed for the city and Westchester — ensure that any company will demand a huge risk premium before investing a dime in building a nuke plant in the Empire State.

Which is why Hochul left the door open to the Power Authority footing the bills itself — without mentioning this means taxpayer support and/or stiff new fees on utility bills.

Foti, Jr., Esq., a partner at the law firm of Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (“KSF”), announces that KSF has commenced an investigation into Fluence Energy, Inc. (NasdaqGS: FLNC).

On February 10, 2025, the Company announced its financial results for 1Q 2025, disclosing a net loss of $57 million, or $0.32 per share, compared to a loss of $25.6 million, or $0.14 per share, for the same period in the prior year, revenues down 49% year-over-year to $186.8 million, and decreased revenue guidance for fiscal year 2025, to a range of $3.1 billion to $3.7 billion, from its prior outlook of $3.6 billion to $4.4 billion, due to “customer-driven delays in signing certain contracts that, coupled with competitive pressures, result in the need to lower our fiscal year 2025 outlook.”

Thereafter, the Company and certain of its executives were sued in a securities class action lawsuit, charging them with failing to disclose material information in violation of federal securities laws, which remains ongoing.

KSF’s investigation is focusing on whether Fluence’s officers and/or directors breached their fiduciary duties to its shareholders or otherwise violated state or federal laws.

From an estimated annual energy cost of around $65,000, an optimized design with a more-efficient HVAC system would cost an additional $250,000 up front but would yield an annual energy savings of $25,600, an almost 40% reduction.
As a result, the payback period for investing in energy efficiency is longer than with other states, at least at current rates.
Campuses with natural daylight, reduced energy demand and no fossil fuel combustion save energy and promote a district’s well-being goals.
“Investing in energy efficiency at the earliest stages will free up money for teacher salaries and the other pressing operation needs facing schools.”","Discussion about more sustainable schools often begins and ends with one statement: It’s too expensive. The realities of funding school construction make it difficult for districts to weigh the short- and long-term benefits of moving their campuses to cleaner, healthier, more energy-efficient environments.

But are energy-efficient strategies cost prohibitive? LPA’s Sustainability and Applied Research team recently worked with in-house designers and engineers, and frequent partner Joeris General Contractors, to explore the cost-benefit analysis of energy-efficient systems in Texas schools, considering the state’s unique financial and energy situation.

“The goal was to really understand what it would take to get to energy independence,” says Ellen Mitchell, LPA’s Director of Sustainability and Applied Research. “We want to be able to have a smart, informed conversation with our clients about up-front costs, return-on-investment and potential savings in annual operational costs.”

Discussion about more sustainable schools often begins and ends with one statement: It’s too expensive.

LPA’s Sustainability and Applied Research team recently worked with in-house designers and engineers, and frequent partner Joeris General Contractors, to explore the cost-benefit analysis of energy-efficient systems in Texas schools, considering the state’s unique financial and energy situation.

“The goal was to really understand what it would take to get to energy independence,” says Ellen Mitchell, LPA’s Director of Sustainability and Applied Research. “We want to be able to have a smart, informed conversation with our clients about up-front costs, return-on-investment and potential savings in annual operational costs.”

The study looked at the energy systems for a recent LPA project — the new Sheffield Elementary School in Dallas — and used a tiered approach to examine different levels of investment and associated efficiencies. The first stage focused on passive strategies, such as demand-control ventilation and increased roof insulation, which can dramatically reduce energy demand. Next, the team looked at system alternatives, selecting a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) and a heat pump option, both of which eliminate the need for natural gas infrastructure. The final stage focused on on-site energy generation and evaluating different photovoltaic (PV) options, including what it would take to achieve net zero.

“We were looking at the steps necessary to go from an LPA-designed building that was already exceeding code minimum to a really high-performance facility and up to a true net-zero energy building,” Mitchell says.

The Results

The results illustrate the significant operational savings available from creating more-energy-efficient buildings. From an estimated annual energy cost of around $65,000, an optimized design with a more-efficient HVAC system would cost an additional $250,000 up front but would yield an annual energy savings of $25,600, an almost 40% reduction.

Going a step further, adding PV on the roof would cost an additional $570,000 but would reduce the energy costs to less than $10,000 a year, a whopping 85% savings. To eliminate the electricity bills altogether, the school would need a total cost premium investment of around $1 million but would get a 30% rebate to the tune of $245,000 from the IRA for the PV panels. (Instead of a tax reduction, schools can set up an account with the Internal Revenue Service and receive a direct payment.)

Each of these three scenarios would result in a simple payback of 10 to 12 years — potentially much less if energy prices increase, as expected.

“As you work through the numbers, you start to see that there are a variety of ways we could address energy efficiency, starting from reevaluating what we consider best practices all the way to aggressive energy-independence goals,” says LPA Dallas studio director Craig Drone. “It is not a one-size-fits-all solution.”

The calculations also include new incentives available through the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, which returns money to schools for the installation of energy-efficient and renewable energy systems — benefits never before available to public entities. Researchers also included the reduction in construction costs for an all-electric building when the natural gas infrastructure is eliminated.

“The data gives ISDs an opportunity to make more informed decisions when choosing higher-efficiency systems versus one that has a lesser up-front cost,” says Jorden M. Dial, Director, Client Services, Joeris General Contractors. “ISDs have less maintenance and operation dollars to spread around, especially when so much of those dollars are used on salaries, in a tough recruiting and retention time.”

The research also highlights the challenges to any energy-efficiency calculation in Texas, driven by one basic reality: Energy is still relatively cheap in the state. The average retail price of electricity in Texas is 30% lower than the national average, and 63% less expensive than California, for example, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). As a result, the payback period for investing in energy efficiency is longer than with other states, at least at current rates.

“The return might take 10 years, but the life spans of our buildings are typically 50 to 100 years,” says LPA Director of K-12 Kate Mraw.

Beyond operational savings, the analysis didn’t include the intangible benefits found in energy-independent facilities. Energy strategies can play an important role in developing more resilient campuses, able to function no matter what happens to the grid. Texas energy and electricity customers experience the third-highest rate of power outages in the country, with almost 20 hours of outages in 2021, according to the most recent US EIA data.

“If we can make schools less dependent on the grid and keep them operating in all conditions, that’s good for students and the community,” Drone says.

More-sustainable schools are also, by nature, healthier schools. Campuses with natural daylight, reduced energy demand and no fossil fuel combustion save energy and promote a district’s well-being goals. They also serve as teaching tools, putting science and conservation on display on a daily basis.

The data reinforces the importance of including sustainability in the initial planning process, when energy efficiency can be integrated into the design process and tied to the district’s larger goals. In a recent $370 million bond measure, Alamo Heights ISD included a bucket of funds for “efficiency and sustainability,” earmarking dollars to address more-efficient energy-saving systems.

By taking a tiered approach to the initial analysis, districts can find a comfort level that fits their budget and the priorities of their community.

“Districts can test the waters, see the savings and incorporate more strategies into future projects,” says LPA San Antonio studio director Sara Flowers.

On first review, the systems may seem cost prohibitive, but the real world data illustrates there is an attractive return on investment that will save money operationally for years to come.

“So many of our districts are cash poor on the maintenance and operations side and not getting the proper funding,” Flowers says. “Investing in energy efficiency at the earliest stages will free up money for teacher salaries and the other pressing operation needs facing schools.”","https://img.bdcnetwork.com/files/base/ebm/bdcnetwork/image/2025/06/685ed14da2d0fd7c00b7004d-featurek12txenergywebgraphicshero_20240912201632_m.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-28 13:13:51.793715

The people that are out of power around here, we're all rushing to go in to get power back.","ALEXANDRIA, Minn. — Minnesotans in Arizona in April are hardly novelties.

But Mike McGrane and Bob Steidl, journeyman lineworkers from ALP Utilities in Alexandria, Minnesota, were hardly there on vacation.

Although if you ask them if they’d ever go back, they'll tell you “yes” before the question is completely out of your mouth.

In April, they went to work bringing electricity to families on the largest Native American reservation in the country: 17.5-million-acre Navajo Nation , which includes land in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

A total of five volunteers from three Minnesota communities joined a team of employees from Missouri River Energy Services (MRES), including Steidl and McGrane from Alexandria, and volunteers from Detroit Lakes Public Utilities and Westbrook Public Utilities. And they joined over 300 volunteers from 44 utility companies across the country to take part in a project called ""Light Up Navajo.""

Some 13,000 households living on the Navajo Nation’s reservation have no electricity, according to the US Department of Energy’s Office of Indian Affairs . In fact, Navajo households make up most of the 17,000 Native American tribal homes without electricity across America. Light Up Navajo is a collaborative project launched in 2019 by the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and the American Public Power Association. According to MRES, ""Every year from April to August, volunteer lineworkers from public power utilities across the U.S. journey to the Navajo Nation to provide power to homes without electricity.""

McGrane and Steidl admit they volunteered for the project without knowing a lot about what it was.

“I guess when we were first asked about it, we didn't really know what we were really getting into — what it was all about.” says McGrane. ""I didn't know what the Navajo Nation even was.”

So in April, McGrane and Steidl loaded up their own truck with their own tools (which proved to be a smart decision in hindsight) and headed south to Window Rock, where they would start their work in the Fort Defiance Utility District along the Arizona-New Mexico border.

Seeing for themselves that there are places in America where people don’t have electricity was an unwelcome surprise.

“That's crazy,” says McGrane, shaking his head. “There's 10,407 families that don't even have power there yet. And this is 2025.”

“This is the sixth year they've been doing it,” adds Steidl. “They took a year off for COVID and they got funding to 2028 to do it. They try to get to 200 or 300 customers a year.”

“I think the first or the second year they helped around 200 families and then they haven't been able to reach that since then,” McGrane says. “They were hoping to get 200 on (the grid) this year — that’s their goal.”

Did it shock them to see poverty like that?

“Oh, yeah,” says Steidl, quietly. “Well, you know, for being in the United States … I never thought it'd be what it is.”

“You see these garden sheds that they been hauling around? They'll go and buy one of those and put it out there,” says McGrane. “And that's a new house to them, to a lot of the people. And they insulate it. And that's what they live in. That's what they can afford. A garden shed.”

It’s the stories of the people that stick with Steidl and McGrane.

“There was that one lady. She was 85 years old, never had power before,” remembers Steidl.

“You know, her and her family sat there the whole day and watched us set about four poles,” says McGrane. “And they watched the whole day. She was pretty emotional when her lights came on. Before her, the last guy who we built a line to has been waiting 60 years for power.”

“And he doesn't even speak English (only Navajo),” added Steidl. “We got power to a family, they started their house four years ago, right when they were getting ready to have their first kid, and finally they got the roof on in July. They're supposed to be having their third kid and they’ll finally have power for their house.”

“Even like the kids,” says McGrane, “they go to school and then they come home and try to do homework, well they don’t have lights or internet or nothing. You know, it's tough for the kids to get their studies done. So the one family where the girl was in school and we got power to them. Just for her to be able to get the internet and have electricity to stay up, once it got dark out, to do her homework and stuff — it's going to be huge.”

Making a difference like that is why both men would volunteer again in a heartbeat.

“(The people were) just so thankful that we took time away from our families,” says Steidl. “I don't know how many times I heard, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.’ Just for coming out there and giving them power.

“It's just the nature of our job, just helping people, like when we go to a tornado. Not everybody can do our job. It's like being a fireman. You get more reward in return. There was a guy from California. He was out there once and he was going to retire, but his rotation was to go back another year. So he's going to hold off to retire so he can go back.”

And what else would they tell potential volunteers?

“Bring a lot of ChapStick,” says Steidl, and laughs.

“I would just say, they won't regret it,” says McGrane. “I just can't see anybody that would ever regret going down there.”

In the meantime, Mike McGrane is still thinking about the living conditions he saw first-hand.

“I just think, as a country, we need to do more for them,” he says. “I mean, man, this is crazy. That we have money going elsewhere when we have people in our own country that need that help. You know, right now, there's storms that went through Bemidji and out in the Dakotas. The people that are out of power around here, we're all rushing to go in to get power back. Well, this is an ongoing storm. It's been there their whole life. They don't have power. So it's time to get going and do something. That's the way I look at it.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/fd4c5fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x4032+0+0/resize/800x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2Fe2%2F89eeefcc44688f873ccfbf0b72d9%2Fbob-steidl-left-and-mike-mcgrane-from-alp.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 12:14:18.185520

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senate Republicans late Friday released a revised tax and budget bill that would end the $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicle sales and leases on September 30 as well as the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs.

The prior version would have ended the credit for new sales 180 days after the bill was signed into law, 90 days for used vehicles and immediately ended the credit for leased vehicles not assembled in North America and meeting other requirements.

Republicans have taken aim at EVs on a number of fronts, a reversal from former President Joe Biden’s policy that encouraged electric vehicles and renewable energy to fight climate change and reduce emissions.

The House of Representatives version would allow the $7,500 new-EV tax credit to continue through the end of 2025, and through the end of 2026 for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs before killing it.

The Senate bill also includes a provision to eliminate fines for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules in a move aimed at making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

The Republican bill exempts interest paid on auto loans from taxes for new cars made in the U.S. through 2028, but phases it out for individual taxpayers making more than $100,000 annually.

Senate Republicans dropped a bid to force the U.S. Postal Service to scrap thousands of electric vehicles and charging equipment in the bill following a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian.

The U.S. Postal Service has 7,200 electric vehicles, made up of Ford e-Transit and specially built Next Generation Delivery Vehicles built by Oshkosh Defense and warned scrapping its EVs would cost it $1.5 billion.

President Donald Trump this month signed a resolution approved by Congress to bar California’s landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, which has been adopted by 11 other states representing a third of the U.S. auto market.

Energy tax credits were intended to increase the country’s electricity supply, reinvigorate its battery and electric vehicle supply chains and cut carbon pollution.

But what appears in the “Big, Beautiful Budget Bill,” which is now before the U.S. Senate, seems to be a war on renewables and gift to the fossil fuel industry.

Without clean energy tax credits, which were voted on by Congress with the Inflation Reduction Act, we miss most of the “above.” In Washington County we are seeing plans for data centers as part of economic development, for example with the repurposing of retired coal-fired power plants, these data centers will require lots of energy — from natural gas AND from clean energy sources. Clean Energy Tax Credits will boost the economy in Washington County, in the Mid-Ohio Valley, create jobs and lead to economic stability, which is sorely needed at this point. Without Clean Energy Tax Credits, residents will experience high utility rates; it is estimated by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (2025) that the average American residential consumer would experience an increase of $110 in the next year without these additional sources of energy. These tax credits will also serve the purpose of achieving energy independence for our national economy.

Energy tax credits were intended to increase the country’s electricity supply, reinvigorate its battery and electric vehicle supply chains and cut carbon pollution. These initiatives have helped drive a clean-energy manufacturing boom across the country. The Inflation Reduction Act improved on decades of failed policy by going technology-neutral — its tax credits support any new power plant that doesn’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That means technologies that even Republicans like, including nuclear fission, geothermal power and nuclear fusion, could benefit.

Furthermore, these tax credits are driving private investment, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening American energy independence. Businesses across Ohio and West Virginia — especially in manufacturing, construction, and energy–are already benefiting. Rolling back these incentives would disrupt job growth and hurt local economies. By expanding domestic energy production, we reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. These investments in renewable energy are about leveling the playing field, letting businesses compete, and ensuring taxpayers get a return on investment.

Instead, the budget bill before the Senate grants subsidies to oil drillers, provides for drilling on federally owned public lands, gives drillers the benefit of avoiding paying the alternative minimum tax annually, and grants a subsidy for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology that is scientifically unproven, economically impractical, and dangerous to our environment. All of these gifts to the fossil fuel industry involve billions of lost tax revenue and, more notably, will drive up our national debt by the trillions.

As we are experiencing our first major heat wave of what is predicted to be another scorching summer, we are reminded of the environmental costs of the expansion of burning fossil fuels, specifically global warming. Natural gas, which its congressional advocates are so actively supporting, is responsible for over 80 times the greenhouse gas emissions as carbon dioxide — more pollution, more captured heat, and other environmental consequences.

Regional advocates of the natural gas industry falsely claim that the extraction and processing of natural gas are important for the economy and for job creation in Appalachian Ohio and West Virginia.

This is a myth. The natural gas industry is not a major employer in Ohio. In a report by the Ohio River Valley Institute (2025) it was noted that of more than five million jobs in Ohio the natural gas industry provides fewer than 10,000. In recent years it has been in decline, laying off 40% of its employees since 2018. This trend has also been apparent in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The employment deficiency in the natural gas industry is particularly striking in Ohio’s eight major gas-produciing counties, which have lost 11,000 jobs since the beginning of the fracking boom in 2008. ORVI has based this report on publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

So, for the sake of our local and national economies, job growth, energy independence, the environment, let’s put ALL of the above back in the pending budget bill.

If you live in West Virginia, contact Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Senator James Justice; in Ohio contact Senator Jon Husted and Senator Bernie Moreno and urge them to put clean energy tax credits back into this bill. Now is the time — Senate leaders are looking at a July 4 deadline.

Senate Republicans have proposed a revised tax and budget bill that aims to end electric vehicle tax credits and eliminate fines for automakers failing to meet fuel economy standards. This bill contrasts with previous policies promoting EVs and renewable energy, while the House version seeks to extend the new-EV tax credit.

U.S. Senate Republicans late Friday released a revised tax and budget bill that would end the $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicle sales and leases on September 30 as well as the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs.

The prior version would have ended the credit for new sales 180 days after the bill was signed into law, 90 days for used vehicles and immediately ended the credit for leased vehicles not assembled in North America and meeting other requirements.

Republicans have taken aim at EVs on a number of fronts, a reversal from former President Joe Biden's policy that encouraged electric vehicles and renewable energy to fight climate change and reduce emissions.

The House of Representatives version would allow the $7,500 new-EV tax credit to continue through the end of 2025, and through the end of 2026 for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs before killing it.

The Senate bill also includes a provision to eliminate fines for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules in a move aimed at making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Live Events

The Republican bill exempts interest paid on auto loans from taxes for new cars made in the U.S. through 2028, but phases it out for individual taxpayers making more than $100,000 annually.

Senate Republicans dropped a bid to force the U.S. Postal Service to scrap thousands of electric vehicles and charging equipment in the bill following a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian.

The U.S. Postal Service has 7,200 electric vehicles, made up of Ford e-Transit and specially built Next Generation Delivery Vehicles built by Oshkosh Defense and warned scrapping its EVs would cost it $1.5 billion.

President Donald Trump this month signed a resolution approved by Congress to bar California's landmark plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, which has been adopted by 11 other states representing a third of the U.S. auto market.

A diversified portfolio—split between ICE revival plays, nuclear energy, and geographically shielded EV firms—offers the best defense against regulatory whiplash.","The U.S. Senate's push to eliminate electric vehicle (EV) tax credits by 2025 has ignited a legislative firestorm, pitting Republicans against Democrats and reshaping the investment landscape for automakers, battery suppliers, and energy firms. As bipartisan disagreements deepen and state-level policies resist federal rollbacks, investors must navigate a complex web of risks and opportunities. This analysis dissects the immediate and long-term implications for key sectors and offers actionable strategies to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty.

The Legislative Crossroads: Stalemate and Sector Impacts

The Senate Republican proposal seeks to immediately end EV tax credits for leased foreign-made vehicles and phase out new-EV incentives within 180 days of passage. In contrast, the House bill extends credits through 2026 for automakers below a 200,000 sales threshold. Meanwhile, President Trump's recent veto of California's 2035 gas-vehicle sales ban has intensified state-federal tensions, creating a fragmented regulatory environment.

The stakes are high. Princeton's ZERO Lab estimates that repealing credits could reduce U.S. EV adoption by 8.3 million units by 2030, while household energy costs could rise by $140–$220 annually by 2040. Automakers like Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM), which derive significant value from federal incentives, face immediate headwinds.

Immediate Sector Risks: Automakers and Battery Supply Chains

Automotive Giants Under Pressure

Tesla's stock price—already volatile due to macroeconomic concerns—could face further declines if Senate Republicans succeed in repealing credits. The company's reliance on the $7,500 tax credit for leased vehicles in non-North American markets (e.g., China, Europe) amplifies its exposure.

Ford (F) and GM, which have invested heavily in U.S. EV manufacturing, may see delayed ROI if credits vanish. GM's Ultium battery rollout and Ford's F-150 Lightning production could stall, though their diversified ICE (internal combustion engine) portfolios offer some cushion.

Battery Suppliers in a Pinch

Battery manufacturers like CATL (300750.SZ) and LG Energy Solution (3735.KQ) face reduced demand from U.S. automakers if credit cuts slow EV adoption. However, their global footprint—serving Europe, China, and Asia—mitigates risks. Investors should prioritize firms with geographically diversified revenue streams or contracts with state-backed EV programs.

Alternative Energy: Tax Credit Sunset and Nuclear Opportunities

The Senate bill's elimination of technology-neutral clean energy tax credits (45Y/48E) by 2028 threatens $200 billion in investments. Solar and wind projects may stall unless developers rush to meet 60-day construction deadlines.

Meanwhile, the bill's carve-out for nuclear projects through 2028 creates a rare bright spot. Companies like Westinghouse (a Toshiba subsidiary) and NuScale Power could benefit from renewed interest in baseload carbon-free energy.

Long-Term Opportunities: ICE Revival and Geographically Insulated Markets

The ICE Comeback?

If EVs become less affordable, demand for traditional ICE vehicles—especially high-margin trucks and SUVs—could rebound. Toyota (TM) and Ford's F-150 (which still dominates U.S. sales) stand to gain.

State-Level Resilience

California and its 11 “compliance states” will likely proceed with their 2035 ban despite federal pushback. This creates a geographically insulated market for EVs, favoring automakers like Tesla and Rivian (RIVN), which cater to these regions.

Global Diversification

Investors should look beyond U.S. borders. In Europe, the EU's $630 billion Green Deal guarantees EV incentives until 2030. China's subsidies and battery gigafactories (e.g., CATL's partnership with Tesla) also provide growth avenues.

Cross-Border Strategies and Defensive Plays

Short-Term Plays:

Short Tesla or EV ETFs (e.g., ARKQ) if Senate Republicans advance their bill.

Long ICE stocks: Toyota, Ford's F-150, or diesel specialists like Cummins (CMI).

Long-Term Bets:

Nuclear energy: Westinghouse, NuScale.

Geographically insulated EVs: Tesla, Rivian for U.S. compliance states; CATL, BYD (002594.SZ) for China/EU.

Risk Mitigation:

Diversify globally: Allocate 30–40% of clean energy portfolios to non-U.S. assets.

Monitor state policies: Track California's regulatory moves and lawsuits challenging federal rollbacks.

Conclusion: Position for Uncertainty, Not Certainty

The EV tax credit debate underscores the fragility of policy-driven markets. Investors must balance short-term risks (e.g., automaker stock dips) with long-term structural trends (e.g., global decarbonization). A diversified portfolio—split between ICE revival plays, nuclear energy, and geographically shielded EV firms—offers the best defense against regulatory whiplash. Stay agile: the next chapter of this saga hinges on Senate reconciliation rules and state defiance, both of which remain fluid.

In this high-stakes game, hedging with options or inverse ETFs could protect gains while leaving room for upside in resilient sectors. The EV era isn't over—just more unevenly distributed.",,N,,2025-06-28 04:00:02.772499

In the end, Stellantis' future hinges on whether Filosa can replicate his South American success in North America.","The automotive industry is in flux, with electric vehicles (EVs) and supply chain complexity reshaping the landscape. Amid this upheaval, Stellantis—once a poster child for operational missteps—has positioned itself for a comeback under CEO Mario Filosa. By anchoring his strategy in North American dominance, leveraging his turnaround expertise, and assembling a leadership team steeped in industry knowledge, Filosa is betting that Stellantis can capitalize on strong demand for trucks and SUVs while resolving years of structural inefficiencies. For investors, this pivot raises a compelling question: Is Stellantis finally poised to turn its vast potential into sustained profitability?

The Dual Role: Why Filosa's North America Focus Matters

Filosa's dual role as CEO and head of North American operations is no accident. The region accounts for roughly 60% of Stellantis' global profits, driven by the Jeep and Ram brands, which together command nearly 30% of the U.S. SUV and pickup truck markets. Under his leadership, Stellantis has prioritized stabilizing this critical engine of growth after years of missteps under predecessor Carlos Tavares.

A would reveal a volatile trajectory, but Filosa's early moves suggest a path to stability. His focus on reducing dealer inventories—from 500,000 to 300,000 units in nine months—has eased liquidity strains, while accelerating product launches like the redesigned Jeep Cherokee and the Ram 1500 EV have reignited dealer enthusiasm.

The Turnaround Track Record: South America to North America

Filosa's credibility hinges on his prior successes. As head of South America, he revitalized Fiat's presence and turned Brazil into Jeep's top market outside the U.S., boosting shipments by 19% in 2024 despite currency volatility. This localized production strategy, exemplified by the Pernambuco facility, became a blueprint for his North American play.

By shifting Jeep Grand Cherokee production to the U.S., Filosa avoided €2.5 billion in European tariffs annually, a move that underscores his knack for geopolitical risk mitigation. His tenure as Chief Quality Officer also paid dividends: centralized quality control reduced warranty costs, improving customer trust.

Leadership Continuity: A Team Built for Complexity

Filosa's leadership team is a masterstroke. Key hires like CFO Doug Ostermann (ex-Ford) and Ned Curic (Product Development & Technology) bring deep automotive expertise. Notably, 80% of the team has spent over a decade in Stellantis or its predecessors, ensuring institutional knowledge. This continuity matters in an industry where missteps in supply chains or product launches can crater profits.

The team's focus on localization—expanding U.S. EV production while phasing out European tariffs—aligns with Stellantis' $17 billion EV transition plan. The STLA platform, which aims to cut development costs by 20% by 2026, positions the company to compete in both ICE and EV markets.

Why Jeep and Ram Are the Keys to Profitability

Jeep and Ram are Stellantis' crown jewels. Together, they generated $14 billion in operating cash flow in 2024, nearly half of the company's total. Jeep's electrification push, including the $25,000 Recon EV, targets price-sensitive buyers without diluting its premium image. Ram's shift to electric pickups, such as the Revolution OEM, aims to rival Ford's F-150 Lightning in the booming U.S. EV truck market.

A would highlight the alignment between Stellantis' product focus and market demand. With U.S. light truck sales expected to grow at 5% annually through 2030, these brands are well-positioned to capture share.

Resolving Governance Issues: Detroit-Based Leadership

Filosa's Detroit base is symbolic. Tavares' Paris-centric leadership had strained U.S. dealers, who felt sidelined in global cost-cutting. By centralizing North America decision-making in Detroit, Filosa signals a return to regional accountability. This shift has already improved dealer relations, with inventory levels dropping to manageable levels and retail orders surging 82% in early 2025.

Risks and the Bull Case

The path is not without hurdles. Underutilized U.S. plants and the EV transition's capital demands pose challenges. However, Filosa's focus on stabilizing cash flow—reducing cash burn from €10.4 billion in 2023 to €6.8 billion in 2024—suggests he's buying time for the EV pivot.

The bull case hinges on three factors:

1. North America Profitability: Sustaining Jeep/Ram's dominance while reducing legacy costs.

2. Dealer Stability: Maintaining inventory discipline and avoiding past overstocking.

3. EV Execution: Leveraging STLA to launch competitive models at scale.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play for the Automotive Turnaround

Stellantis is a stock for investors willing to bet on operational turnarounds. At a P/E ratio of 6.5x (vs. Ford's 12x), it trades at a discount to peers, reflecting lingering skepticism. However, Filosa's track record and strategic clarity suggest a re-rating is possible.

The best entry point? Consider a gradual position if Stellantis hits its 2025 EV launch targets and North America margins expand to 15%+—a level achieved by rivals like Ford. Monitor cash flow closely; if the $17 billion EV spend doesn't derail liquidity, the stock could outperform as the U.S. truck/SUV boom continues.

In the end, Stellantis' future hinges on whether Filosa can replicate his South American success in North America. If he does, this could be the decade's most compelling automotive turnaround story.",,N,,2025-06-28 04:00:46.294409

The court’s decision does not address the merits of California’s regulations but allows the case to be returned to the lower courts for further litigation. Fuel producers argue that the waiver exceeds the EPA’s statutory authority and harms their business by reducing demand for liquid fuels. The justices found that the plaintiffs had sufficient grounds to bring the case, rejecting the D.C. Circuit Court’s earlier conclusion that the challengers failed to show direct harm.

The ruling reflects the Supreme Court’s ongoing skepticism toward the broad regulatory powers of federal agencies, particularly the EPA. In recent years, the court has scaled back the agency’s authority to address environmental issues, including its jurisdiction over power plant emissions and water pollution.

California officials have pledged to defend their regulatory authority, stating that Congress intended for the state to have the power to implement stronger standards to protect public health and combat climate change.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, June 27, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- It has been one year since updates to the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen Title 24) were released on July 1, 2024. Last year's update requires new hotels to equip 50% of parking lots with EV charging infrastructure. However, given the time these development projects take, we have yet to witness the full impact of these stringent new electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure mandates. The updates specifically require new hotels and motels to equip 40% of parking spaces with EV-ready infrastructure, using either standard outlets or Level 2 chargers, and provide Level 2 chargers for the remaining 10% of parking spaces. Further increases anticipated in 2026 add significant urgency for developers and hotel operators looking to stay competitive in EV hotspots.

Consumer trends strongly support these mandates. In regions such as Santa Clara County, EV adoption rates have surpassed 40%. With the growing popularity of electric vehicles, guest expectations for accessible, reliable EV charging options are becoming critical, influencing hotel selection and satisfaction.

A recently opened hotel near Sacramento’s Exposition Blvd, permitted under the older 2019 code, underscores a regulatory gap. Despite its 180 rooms, this property provides only 12 EV charging spots, far fewer than the roughly 90 spaces mandated under current 2024 standards. In a recent email thread city building officials recognize this gap between previously approved projects and current EV requirements, emphasizing urgency for hotels planning new developments to quickly align with updated regulations.

Meeting these requirements with current popular solutions, such as what is recommended by flagship brands introduces substantial financial and logistical burdens astraditional Level 2 chargers typically cost between $3,000 and $4,000 per port. Besides significant upfront expenses, these charging stations require ongoing maintenance, including cable replacements and inspections. Maintenance issues can negatively affect guest experiences, creating dissatisfaction hotels strive to avoid.

To mitigate these challenges, hotels are exploring Alternative EV Supply Equipment (Alternative EVSE). This category includes smart outlets enabling guests to utilize personal portable chargers. These solutions significantly reduce costs, simplify installation, and minimize maintenance. Despite clear advantages, smart outlets face regulatory hurdles from California’s Department of Food and Agriculture’s Division of Measurement Standards (CDFA-DMS). Without certification allowing resale of metered electricity, adoption remains limited, creating substantial barriers to implementation.

San Jose-based startup Evolve Energy is developing smart outlet-based EV charging technology tailored specifically for the hospitality sector. The company plans to initiate a pilot project in summer 2025, aiming to refine its solution into a fully compliant, scalable product suited to hospitality operators' unique needs. To accelerate development and address the existing technology gap in hospitality EV charging infrastructure, Evolve Energy anticipates raising a funding round in late summer 2025.California’s building codes provide flexibility, allowing hotels to substitute five Level 2 chargers with one Level 3 charger. However, Level 3 chargers, costing 20 to 30 times more than Level 2 chargers, rarely align with typical overnight guest charging behaviors. Thus, practical application remains limited, emphasizing the need for scalable, economically feasible charging options.

Hilton’s recent industry trends report highlights the pressing nature of EV infrastructure demands. Competition and market dynamics further illustrate this importance. A JD Power survey found 19% of hotel guests actively seek EV charging availability, significantly influencing booking decisions. Currently, 30% of U.S. hotels provide EV charging: approximately 90% of luxury hotels, 58% of full-service hotels, and just 20% of limited-service properties. Hotels offering EV infrastructure report increased guest loyalty and new revenue streams tied to charger availability, pressuring those without EV chargers to quickly adapt or risk losing competitiveness.

As California accelerates its electrification agenda, hospitality providers must swiftly adapt. The challenge is no longer deciding whether to provide EV infrastructure but how to implement solutions affordably, effectively, and without negatively impacting guest experiences. Travelers should anticipate increased availability of alternative solutions such as smart EV outlets in hotel parking facilities and pack their mobile chargers for convenience.

Among the rollbacks proposed are a pause on developing the price gouging penalty rule enacted by the legislature in 2023 and increased oil well permitting in Kern County.

The groups pointed to new state data showing oil refiners making a killing off California consumers – with a combined gross refining margin and distribution margin of $1.71 in April, twice the national and historical averages.

""California oil refiners do not need a bailout. New data posted by the California Energy Commission shows oil refiners made a retail gross refining profit margin of $1.02 per gallon in April,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""In addition, the data shows that the distribution margin, which includes the Mystery Gasoline Surcharge, was .69 cents per gallon in April. Combined these extraordinary profit and overhead costs add more to a gallon of gasoline than the cost of crude oil, as CEC created graphic below shows.""

""California's oil refining and distribution sector are charging Californians more than double what they take in elsewhere. It would be perverse to give this industry more subsidies.""

The groups include:

""We urge you, instead, to insist that the Administration finish the job it started and that the legislature directed it to do in special sessions in 2023 and 2024: propound rules for a price gouging penalty, finalize and enforce the ABX2-1 re-supply inventory rule and begin the minimum inventory rule-making. In addition, we call on you to reject rollbacks to refinery process safety management (PSM) rules which protect refinery workers and communities while preventing sudden outages that trigger price shocks.""

The gross margins are what the refiners keep after the cost of crude oil, environmental fees, and taxes are deducted. The only refiner cost included in the gross margin is the operating costs for the refinery, which are reported by the refiners to the SEC at about 20 cents per gallon.

This effort is part of an “energy sovereignty” emphasis among Native peoples. “We’ve always been stewards of the Earth,” said Samuel Strong, secretary of the Red Lake Nation. “Our ancestors always lived in harmony with nature. And this is just a small piece of that puzzle, but a very important piece.”

People came and went throughout Friday’s open house event, which was held at the Red Lake Nation Embassy on Cedar Avenue in Minneapolis.

One sponsor was Robert Blake, a tribal citizen of the Red Lake Nation and executive director of Native Sun Community Power Development, a Minneapolis nonprofit that promotes renewable energy in the Midwest. Blake stressed the importance of bringing affordable transportation to Indigenous communities and spoke about the benefits — environmental and financial — of electric vehicles.

“We deal with a lot of issues around energy poverty and around poverty in general,” Blake said. “If we can lighten the load on people’s vehicle ownership options, they could put those excess dollars into other needs.

“You fill up your car for $50,” he added. “You’re probably going to be paying about 15 bucks to fill up your electric vehicle.”

As part of its initiative to encourage transition to electric vehicles, Native Sun Community Power Development will install a DC electric fast charger at the embassy by the end of this year.

As with any public charger, users will pay to charge their vehicles. All proceeds will go to support the embassy’s energy efficiency work in the community.

Blake is also spearheading a five-state Native-led project called Electric Nation that is using a federal grant from the Department of Energy to deploy charging stations and free electric vehicles throughout tribal country in Minnesota and North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan.

A Volkswagen electric bus, set to be donated to the Red Lake Nation Youth Shelter, was showcased at Friday’s event. “We see this as an opportunity to bring rural America along with the energy transition,” said Blake.

This event was part of the embassy’s first open house since a mass shooting in May killed six people and injured two others in one of the country’s largest urban Indigenous communities.

But what appears in the “Big, Beautiful Budget Bill,” which is now before the U.S. Senate, seems to be a war on renewables and gift to the fossil fuel industry.

Without clean energy tax credits, which were voted on by Congress with the Inflation Reduction Act, we miss most of the “above.” In Washington County we are seeing plans for data centers as part of economic development, for example with the repurposing of retired coal-fired power plants, these data centers will require lots of energy — from natural gas AND from clean energy sources. Clean Energy Tax Credits will boost the economy in Washington County, in the Mid-Ohio Valley, create jobs and lead to economic stability, which is sorely needed at this point. Without Clean Energy Tax Credits, residents will experience high utility rates; it is estimated by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (2025) that the average American residential consumer would experience an increase of $110 in the next year without these additional sources of energy. These tax credits will also serve the purpose of achieving energy independence for our national economy.

Energy tax credits were intended to increase the country’s electricity supply, reinvigorate its battery and electric vehicle supply chains and cut carbon pollution. These initiatives have helped drive a clean-energy manufacturing boom across the country. The Inflation Reduction Act improved on decades of failed policy by going technology-neutral — its tax credits support any new power plant that doesn’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That means technologies that even Republicans like, including nuclear fission, geothermal power and nuclear fusion, could benefit.

Furthermore, these tax credits are driving private investment, creating good-paying jobs, and strengthening American energy independence. Businesses across Ohio and West Virginia — especially in manufacturing, construction, and energy–are already benefiting. Rolling back these incentives would disrupt job growth and hurt local economies. By expanding domestic energy production, we reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. These investments in renewable energy are about leveling the playing field, letting businesses compete, and ensuring taxpayers get a return on investment.

Instead, the budget bill before the Senate grants subsidies to oil drillers, provides for drilling on federally owned public lands, gives drillers the benefit of avoiding paying the alternative minimum tax annually, and grants a subsidy for carbon capture and sequestration, a technology that is scientifically unproven, economically impractical, and dangerous to our environment. All of these gifts to the fossil fuel industry involve billions of lost tax revenue and, more notably, will drive up our national debt by the trillions.

As we are experiencing our first major heat wave of what is predicted to be another scorching summer, we are reminded of the environmental costs of the expansion of burning fossil fuels, specifically global warming. Natural gas, which its congressional advocates are so actively supporting, is responsible for over 80 times the greenhouse gas emissions as carbon dioxide — more pollution, more captured heat, and other environmental consequences.

Regional advocates of the natural gas industry falsely claim that the extraction and processing of natural gas are important for the economy and for job creation in Appalachian Ohio and West Virginia. This is a myth. The natural gas industry is not a major employer in Ohio. In a report by the Ohio River Valley Institute (2025) it was noted that of more than five million jobs in Ohio the natural gas industry provides fewer than 10,000. In recent years it has been in decline, laying off 40% of its employees since 2018. This trend has also been apparent in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The employment deficiency in the natural gas industry is particularly striking in Ohio’s eight major gas-produciing counties, which have lost 11,000 jobs since the beginning of the fracking boom in 2008. ORVI has based this report on publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

So, for the sake of our local and national economies, job growth, energy independence, the environment, let’s put ALL of the above back in the pending budget bill. If you live in West Virginia, contact Senator Shelley Moore Capito and Senator James Justice; in Ohio contact Senator Jon Husted and Senator Bernie Moreno and urge them to put clean energy tax credits back into this bill. Now is the time — Senate leaders are looking at a July 4 deadline.

Within the industry, the solar energy segment has proven to be unique because it is particularly vulnerable to cybercrime, necessitating the quick implementation of protective measures.

When it comes to cybersecurity in the solar industry, it’s important to consider more than just smart cities and homeowners with solar panels. Solar adoption has dramatically increased in recent years, with utility-scale solar installations alone reaching 182 GW (AC) in 2024. Additionally, the U.S. heavily relies on satellites for communication and military surveillance. Most satellites are powered by solar array systems, which convert sunlight into electricity. Because of this, the U.S. government has increasingly grown more concerned with solar cybersecurity, and the U.S. Department of Energy has prioritized the issue—describing secure, safe and reliable operation of solar energy as critical for the country’s national security and economy.

Recent surveys and reports have highlighted significant cybersecurity challenges in solar energy. A SecurityScorecard report released last year revealed that data breaches have impacted 90% of the largest energy companies globally, including all of the top 10 power companies in the U.S. Furthermore, a survey of professionals in the electric power and renewable energy sector by Applied Risk, a DNV company, indicated that only 54% of respondents believe their companies have strong visibility into cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In this same survey, alarmingly, only 36% of professionals consider cybersecurity a critical risk, and a mere 42% think their companies are adequately investing in protection against cyberattacks. These statistics emphasize the urgent need for effective cybersecurity technologies within the solar industry to prevent potential disruptions and financial losses.

Vulnerability of distributed energy resources

One key vulnerability that leads to challenges securing the solar energy segment against cybercrime comes from distributed energy resources (DER). DER technologies, including solar energy systems, produce and supply electricity on a small scale, which then is spread out over wide areas. DER devices are unregulated and have no mandated cybersecurity standards. Unlike centralized power plants, DER systems are often managed independently and connected directly to the internet for monitoring and control purposes. This internet connectivity introduces significant security risks, as many DER system managers do not have the expertise or resources to implement robust cybersecurity measures. Additionally, most DER devices are accessed by their owners remotely through cloud servers. While remote access is convenient for operations and maintenance of DERs, it opens a gateway for cyber threats. Hackers can exploit these access points to infiltrate DER networks, leading to their control of the entire system.

Cybersecurity challenges in IT and OT

Another area in which solar organizations are often targeted by hackers is the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). IT encompasses technologies that manage data and support administrative functions within solar institutions such as billing, customer service and accounting systems. OT involves programmable systems that interact directly with the physical environment such as solar arrays, inverters and building control systems that monitor and manage the production and distribution of solar energy. Like DERs, OT systems have become increasingly digital and connected to the internet without any regulation, introducing new security concerns.

One of the major challenges the solar sector faces with OT technology is the complexity of those systems and the high costs associated with upgrading or replacing equipment. Unlike IT systems, OT systems are designed for long-term use and are very infrequently replaced. This results in a mix of old and new technologies within the same infrastructure, creating gaps in cybersecurity coverage.

Barriers to achieving secure DER, IT and OT systems

Several barriers hinder secure DER, IT and OT systems in the solar industry. One of the most prominent challenges is the shortage of cybersecurity professionals with the necessary knowledge, experience and skills. Cybersecurity is a dynamic field where threats evolve rapidly. Hackers are continually developing new strategies and techniques to breach defenses, making it imperative for cybersecurity professionals to stay current with the latest developments. For the solar industry, this means not only securing existing systems, but also anticipating and mitigating future threats. However, many solar organizations lack the resources to provide ongoing training and professional development needed for their employees, further enlarging the skills gap.

Additionally, due to the nature of DER, IT and OT systems, the solar industry must be able to adapt quickly to the latest threat and implement innovative technologies. Some renewable energy organizations are implementing static, one-size-fits-all solutions in an environment where threats are continuously evolving. Solar companies must adopt adaptive, real-time security measures that can respond to new threats as they emerge. This requires a significant investment in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as skilled employees.

Regardless of the use of cutting-edge cybersecurity tools and artificial intelligence, employee education and behavior are critical. Even the best cybersecurity technology fails when an unsuspecting employee clicks on the wrong link embedded in an e-mail from a hacker posing as a legitimate entity. Solar companies must regularly train employees and communicate best practices to spot and identify bad actors.

Shaping the future of cybersecurity in solar energy

So, where is the industry headed? The future of cybersecurity will likely involve increased regulation and collaboration between global entities. For example, the European Union (EU) and the United States are currently working together to bolster mutual cyber resilience and foster a secure global cyberspace through ongoing dialogues and joint initiatives such as the Joint CyberSafe Products Action Plan.

While the EU implemented the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) to enforce mandatory regulations for all digital products, the U.S. has taken a more voluntary approach with U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, which focuses specifically on the voluntary labeling of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Both initiatives are aimed at addressing the shared challenge of IoT security, and could dramatically change the landscape of cyberattacks by implementing cybersecurity standards for DER and OT devices. These regulations and programs could provide a framework for solar organizations to address current vulnerabilities and ensure the future security of critical infrastructure in the solar energy sector.

Moreover, the demand for solar energy is projected to continue rising – solar power is projected to remain the fastest-growing source of electricity, with BloombergNEF reporting that the world installed 600 GW of solar in 2024. This exponential growth coupled with rapid economic expansion within the utility industry resulted in an increase in stock values in 2024. As demand and stock prices rise, solar energy organizations will have more resources to invest in cybersecurity improvements. Financial capability combined with the anticipated regulations will drive significant advancements in the cybersecurity of solar energy systems, ensuring its reliability and safety.

Solar and renewable energy organizations face significant challenges in cybersecurity that must be addressed to establish consistent and secure operation. The increase in skilled professionals, adoption of cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies, increased regulation and continued economic growth will all be critical components to bolstering cybersecurity in the solar sector.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/1024px-Cybersecurity.png,N,,2025-06-28 04:00:06.539177

1. The U.S. Gave Up Its Lead in Clean Energy Sectors Before. It Might Be Doing It Again. — The Wall Street Journal

The U.S. has lost its leadership in EVs, batteries, wind, and nuclear, and with Trump’s cuts to clean energy subsidies, we could also lose the lead in clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Carbon capture startups, in partnership with the DOE, wanted to base their first-of-a-kind plants in the US because of its favorable geography and supportive policies. But now, with uncertainty from Trump’s tariffs, some of these startups are experiencing layoffs or factory opening delays.

2. Blackouts, Brownouts, and Freaked-Out Grid Operators: The Summer of Load Has Arrived — Heatmap News

Grid operators are dealing with blackouts, brownouts, and high prices this week due to the heat wave that affected most of the Eastern US.

PJM, the largest U.S. electricity market, nearly hit its all-time demand record on Monday with over 161 gigawatts used, and had to call on generators and transmission owners to defer or cancel maintenance so they could continue producing power.

Last year, PJM sent billions to fossil fuel generators, pushing up consumer costs by 20%. But if an additional 10GW of data center demand comes online, this could lead to even higher prices and more emergency conditions.

3. ‘Throwing us off a cliff’: Megabill could derail hundreds of planned clean energy projects — POLITICO

If Congress rolls back the IRA, a POLITICO analysis found that 794 wind farms, solar plants, battery storage facilities, and other clean electricity generation projects that haven’t started construction could lose two major tax breaks and be put in jeopardy. Three out of four projects that would benefit from the tax credits are located in Republican districts.

Many clean energy advocates are fighting to relax the Senate language, but it has support from those concerned that the tax credits will add to the national debt and supporters of Trump’s promise to dismantle Biden-era climate policies.

4. New York to Build One of First U.S. Nuclear-Power Plants in Generation — The Wall Street Journal

New York wants to start building the first major new U.S. nuclear power plant in more than 15 years. Only five new U.S. commercial reactors have come online since 1991, which hasn’t been enough to offset plant retirements. Governor Kathy Hochul has directed the state’s public electric utility to add at least 1GW of new nuclear capacity, enough to power about 1 million homes.

Hochul is a major proponent of nuclear buildout. She has advocated for changes to the federal permitting process for nuclear plants and even asked DOGE to focus on streamlining operations for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Electricity demand in the PJM Interconnection and ISO New England (two regional grid operators covering the Northeast United States) reached multiyear highs on June 23 and June 24, respectively. Electricity demand increased significantly due to a heat wave that affected most of the Eastern United States this week.

PJM Interconnection

Electricity load in the PJM Interconnection, the largest wholesale electricity market in the country, peaked at 160,560 megawatts (MW) on Monday, June 23, between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. according to data from our Hourly Electric Grid Monitor. The load on the grid surpassed PJM’s seasonal peak load forecast of 154,000 MW but remained below the record load of 165,563 MW in 2006 (PJM has expanded numerous times, and this data point is based on PJM’s current footprint). PJM’s footprint includes 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Real-time wholesale electricity prices on June 23 peaked at $1,334 per megawatthour (MWh) at 7:00 p.m. according to PJM, compared with peak prices of $52/MWh on June 16.

At peak load on June 23, 44% of PJM’s generation came from natural gas, 20% from nuclear, 19% from coal, and 6% from solar. The remaining generation came from a mix of hydro, wind, petroleum, and other generation. Petroleum generation, which is generally the most expensive form and therefore only used to meet large demand loads, was three times greater compared with the same hour the day prior.

As the hot weather moved eastward, demand peaked the following day in ISO-NE—the integrated grid operating in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Peak demand on Tuesday, June 24, between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. eastern time was 25,898 MW, according to the data in our Hourly Electric Grid Monitor. ISO-NE reported that Tuesday’s evening peak electricity demand was the highest level seen in the region since 2013.

Real-time wholesale electricity prices on June 24 peaked at $1,110/MWh at 6:00 p.m. according to preliminary data from ISO-NE, compared with peak prices of $65/MWh the previous week on June 17.

New England’s electricity grid depended on a combination of oil-fired power plants, electricity imports from Canada, and increased natural gas power production to meet peak demand this week. At peak load on Tuesday, 47% of ISO-NE generation came from natural gas, 12% from imports, 13% from nuclear, 12% from petroleum, 1% from coal, and 4% from renewable sources including wind, batteries, and solar. The last remaining coal-fired plant in the region, the Merrimack facility in New Hampshire, supplied 280 MWh on average to the grid on Tuesday.

The hybrid process combines conventional, oven-based convection drying with laser drying based on high-power diode lasers. It achieves a web speed of 30 meters per minute and reduces drying times by more than 60% while maintaining the same quality of results.

The laser booster at the beginning of the process halves the required oven length, reducing the need for energy-intensive drying rooms and reducing operational costs by 20-30%.

This approach allows the new process to be used in existing plants, which can then be retrofitted with laser modules.

The IDEEL project, which was completed on December 31, 2024, after a three-year term, looked for alternative drying processes using highly efficient large-area laser irradiation.

The project was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of the Battery 2020 funding program and was carried out under the leadership of Laserline.

The Fraunhofer FFB participated with the Production Engineering of E-Mobility Components (PEM) center at RWTH Aachen University, Coatema Coating Machinery, Optris, the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology (ILT) and the Münster Electrochemical Energy Technology (MEET) Battery Research Center at the University of Münster.

The focus of the IDEEL research collaboration was initially the development and step-by-step optimization of an appropriate laser drying process. For this purpose, new materials for anode and cathode coatings were specifically designed for laser applications, and aqueous formulations based on graphite, lithium iron phosphate, and silicon-graphite were successfully tested at PEM and MEET.

A high-efficiency diode laser system with an electrical efficiency of over 50% and a new processing optics with coaxial thermography coupling and a rectangular laser spot over 0.5 meters wide supplied by Laserline was used as the heat source. Optris, Laserline and Fraunhofer ILT developed a highly integrated thermography camera with industry-PC-compatible data output for contactless, automatic process monitoring and control, ensuring a constant adherence to the target temperature at varying web speeds and coating thicknesses.

Coatema developed a modular laser drying unit with a specialized air concept and custom double-chamber wide-slot nozzles for the fast and secure application of water-based battery slurries. Within this demonstrator, the laser-based R2R drying process was scaled to industry-standard feed speeds, and Fraunhofer determined and validated the optimal process configuration.

The hybrid process developed within the IDEEL project will be integrated into the work of Fraunhofer FFB, which is to be expanded into the development center for modern battery cell production for Germany and its European partners.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Komprimiert-Laser-dried-electrode.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 11:05:50.998022

Don’t look to Washington, where Congress is debating repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. Look to London.

London Climate Week — historically overshadowed by New York’s version — has become a new epicenter for investors who are scouting alternatives to an increasingly uncertain U.S. market.

“This year, it feels completely different,” said Kim Zou, the CEO of Sightline Climate, speaking from the event, which is currently ongoing. “We’re seeing investors from the U.S., Middle East, Asia, Canada, all over the world coming to Climate Week and trying to see what’s going on in Europe for the first time.”

The reason, she said, is “definitely pullback in the U.S.”

Zou joined us on Open Circuit this week to talk about how climate tech investors are navigating policy and economic uncertainty. The conversation touched on a rapid reversal underway: European companies that once flocked to the U.S. market are staying home, while American investors are scouting European opportunities for the first time.

This shift reflects deeper anxieties that investors face, highlighted in Sightline’s latest investor sentiment survey. The firm polled venture, private equity, and growth investors and found a sector grappling with “a trickier, more tactical market.”

Here are some takeaways from our Open Circuit conversation on the state of investing in 2025.

Policy uncertainty has become a primary risk factor

Unsurprisingly, policy whiplash ranked as the top investor concern. But it’s tariffs — not IRA repeal — that worry investors most. According to Zou, 54% of climate tech companies tracked by Sightline have hardware components dependent on global supply chains.

“Tariffs, out of all the different policy pieces that are uncertain right now, were causing the most fear,” Zou said.

Preparing for the worst, many investors are now searching for “policy-proof” business models. But that may be impossible in an industry where government support has been foundational.

“There’s no such thing as policy-proof because in clean energy, there’s a policy in everything,” Zou explained. “How can you ensure your business isn’t reliant on policy? So maybe it’s like, rather than policy-proof, it’s policy-independent.”

Beyond tariffs, the reconciliation bill currently moving through Congress could dramatically reshape the entire landscape through what investors see as a “domino” impact on private-public partnerships for infrastructure.

The House passed a version of the bill last month, which slashed Inflation Reduction Act provisions, including clean energy tax credits. As the Senate considers its own version, the finance committee released a markup with somewhat less aggressive timelines. Open Circuit co-host Katherine Hamilton, who advises funds on policy navigation, said that version “gave more of a runway for all of the renewables.”

But the Senate version is still not final — and the clean energy industry is wasting no time in trying to convince lawmakers to save more of the IRA. Congress has self-imposed a deadline of July 4 for finalizing the bill.

“Part of this is just about getting them to land somewhere,” Hamilton said. “It is more about uncertainty than it is about where this actually ends up.”

A widening gap for companies ready to scale

Beyond policy concerns, there’s a structural problem that’s getting worse. Zou identified “the missing middle within the missing middle” — a $45 million to $100 million funding gap that is stranding companies just as they’re ready to commercialize.

This is a longtime problem for the industry. These businesses need infrastructure-scale capital to build their first commercial facilities, but they still carry venture-level risk.

“You’re still dealing with venture-level risk, but infrastructure-style returns,” Zou explained. “It’s high risk, low returns, and most private investors aren’t really willing to accept that type of risk-reward ratio.”

The timing and competition for funding are tough. Companies that raised in the 2019 to 2023 time period are hitting this inflection point simultaneously. Zou called it “a massive wave of companies that are all around that same missing middle stage.”

Listen to Kim Zou’s whole interview on Open Circuit:

Making matters worse, a critical partner for navigating this gap is pulling back: the U.S. government. “That’s where DOE was so crucial,” said Hamilton. “With those programs being closed or shut down, some of those contracts being walked away from, that’s what you’re going to get,” she added, referring to the growing commercial chasm.

As a result, companies and investors are getting creative with financing solutions. Instead of traditional equity rounds, new structures are emerging. Zou pointed to Fervo’s recent $206 million raise for its Cape Station project, which combined a $60 million loan from Mercuria, $46.5 million in bridge debt financing, and $100 million in project preferred equity — none of it dilutive at the corporate level.

Open Circuit co-host and former DOE Loan Programs Office director Jigar Shah said recapitalizations are also becoming more common, where growth equity firms buy out early investors entirely rather than participating in traditional Series B rounds: “Instead of raising a B round, you’ve got people like NGP or EQT or Warburg Pincus who are actually just taking everybody out and saying, ‘We’re going to basically buy the whole company and put $150 million of fresh capital in.'”

These structures mean that companies can plan for infrastructure-style returns, rather than venture-style — typically 16% to 18% rather than the 10x multiples that early-stage investors target, said Shah.

Exit strategies are changing

According to fresh data from Sightline, climate tech investment dropped 19% in the first half of 2025. But acquisitions doubled, with most at undisclosed valuations.

“There were a lot of these bargain-hunting acquisition plays where corporates and strategics are buying up companies at more opportunistic costs,” Zou said. That creates a lot of opportunities for smart investors, while also forcing companies to rethink how they’ll exit.

“I think what you’re finding in this marketplace right now is that people just never bothered to check to see what their exit was,” Shah said.

This lack of exit planning creates practical problems. Companies that keep raising at higher valuations can price themselves out of an acquisition. “Some of those people there to buy you can’t pay a lot,” Shah said. “They can only pay, let’s say, $100 million. If you just raised another $40 million round of capital, well, then you now have to sell for $200 million. You’ve now priced yourself out of your best acquirer.”

The issue, according to Shah, is that companies got comfortable assuming “as long as I’m executing and I’m doing a lot of good in the world and people are buying my products, the exit will take care of itself.” But that’s not how it works anymore. “You need to spend a lot more time thinking about it,” he added.

Some sectors are thriving despite the headwinds

Not everything is struggling. According to Zou, grid-enhancing technologies had their best quarter ever, driven by AI power demands. Energy efficiency is also attracting more attention as more American households fall behind on their energy bills.

As Shah put it, “There are so many sectors that save people money.” In a moment of economic uncertainty, investors are backing companies that save customers money rather than asking them to pay more for sustainability benefits — reflecting a more pragmatic market, and a shift in what investors will fund. Meanwhile, companies that have historically relied on customers paying green premiums are struggling the most.

“The sectors where they have historically been reliant on a green premium have definitely been challenged,” Zou said, pointing to industrial decarbonization and carbon removal as examples. “I think carbon removal in particular, it’s almost like at a 100% green premium because you don’t have to buy it, and it’s always been a market that’s voluntary.”

The voluntary market for green premiums is “definitely drying up,” according to Zou, except in places where regulation creates the demand. She pointed to Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel) in Sweden as a rare exception, where customers will pay a 25% to 50% premium for green steel because EU carbon pricing makes it a hedge against future costs rather than just an environmental choice.

When asked how this year will be remembered, Zou said it’s not just about the funding numbers declining: “It’s about what solutions are scaling”

She pointed to technologies like GETs and distributed energy resources that are hitting the “exponential part of the curve” — scaling without needing venture funding to prop them up.

Shah takes a longer view. “I generally look at these things in 10-year cycles,” he said, noting that investment has grown dramatically since 2017, despite the recent decline. “I feel like people are benchmarking us to the unsustainable $60 billion number from 2022, but we’re actually doing a lot right now.”

Zou agreed. “It might not look good when you look at overall funding numbers, but when you’re actually going deal by deal and seeing deployment and good companies scale, that’s the measure of success.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-06-27T112756.245.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 03:02:56.424930

It's unclear to what extent Louisiana's utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy.","Louisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy under a new law the Republican governor signed this week, even though it's a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Three other states led by Republicans— Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee— have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.

President Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state's petrochemical industry, says the new law “sets the tone for the future” and will help the state “pursue energy independence and dominance.”

Environmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It's ""pure Orwellian greenwashing,” said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.

Globally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute — solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana's law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.

Natural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.

Switching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

Besides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.

Redefining natural gas

Louisiana’s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to “prioritize” natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state's electricity.

The law’s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.

“I don’t think it’s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don’t blow all the time and the sun don’t shine every day,” Landry said. The legislation “is saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,” he added.

Landry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry’s billionaire Koch family.

ALEC helped shape Ohio’s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post.

ALEC spokesperson Lars Dalseide said that just because an Ohio lawmaker left the 2022 ALEC convention with what he described as a model for legislation to define natural gas as clean energy does not mean the group shaped Ohio law. Dalseide said the convention is “a place where legislators from across the country gather to exchange ideas.”

Ohio's legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.

According to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.

“The goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities' ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,” Anderson said, adding that ALEC's legislation makes natural gas “eligible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.”

Questions over grid reliability

Gov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s grid is already powered by natural gas.

Landry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state's electric grid. He highlighted Meta's plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.

Louisiana’s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the U.S. does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.

Consumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.

Legally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is “blind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,” Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana's law.

It's unclear to what extent Louisiana's utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law “unenforceable” and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas “aligns well” with the state's economic growth.

Benton Solar would be a midsize solar energy development, Adam Gracia, NextEra's project manager for the development, said.
Minnesota, a good spot for solar energy He also said Minnesota makes a good spot for solar projects due to its sun exposure.","Benton Solar near St. Cloud is expected to generate a $300 million investment in the area and create nearly 600 jobs, boosting the local economy.

The project will be NextEra Energy Resources' first combined solar and battery facility in Minnesota and will support the state's renewable energy goals.

Benton Solar wants to start construction next year, and it is currently in the permitting process with plans for a public hearing in late August.

The St. Cloud area may soon see a new addition to its power supply with a unique energy project taking shape along Highway 23 toward Foley.

Benton Solar, a 951-acre major energy development in Minden Township, is expected to start construction next year. The facility includes 100 megawatt solar energy capacity and a 100 megawatt battery for energy storage.

The development from Benton Solar, LLC, a subsidiary of Florida-based NextEra Energy Resources, is also expected to bring major economic impacts to central Minnesota, according to a new economic impact study recently completed by St. Cloud State University.

It would likely generate an approximately $300 million investment into the St. Cloud area, the study found, with $139.7 million in labor income and $188.6 million added to St. Cloud area output. It is also expected to create nearly 600 jobs during construction, including other elements of the development process.

The economic impact of the project can have wide-reaching impacts in a number of ways, King Banaian, the St. Cloud State University economics professor who led the study, said.

""There's two strands you think about. One: will Benton Solar hire local people, provide inputs to the construction?"" he said. ""And then the other questions would be (about) the workers, those workers are going to now have extra income, and they'll go to our stores and our restaurants, they'll use our health care services, and maybe they're here long enough that their kids are in one of our schools.""

Banaian said the developers will likely buy construction parts from local manufacturers and hire locally, which can also boost the area's economy.

The majority of the jobs generated would likely occur during the construction phase, with about 300 people needed to build the facility, Banaian said. Once it is up and running, NextEra also plans to have about three full-time employees monitoring the site.

However, Banaian noted the study was somewhat speculative, as there are few combined solar and battery facilities to base it off of.

""I don't want anyone really hung up on this number versus that number, what I do want to say is there is a net impact,"" he said. ""I actually feel pretty comfortable about the construction features, because there have been enough of those built, we kind of know what that's like, but particularly a solar plus battery facility, there aren't a lot of other examples you can draw on.""

Adam Gracia, NextEra's project manager for the Benton Solar project, said the combined solar and battery project was the first of its kind for NextEra in Minnesota. The company currently operates a solar facility in Marshall and a battery storage facility in Anoka County.

NextEra also has about 50 battery projects and 85 solar sites nationwide, including about 25 sites with both solar and battery storage.

Benton Solar would be a midsize solar energy development, Adam Gracia, NextEra's project manager for the development, said. It is significantly larger than a home's rooftop solar panels, putting it in the utility-scale solar range, though it is dwarfed by other larger projects like Xcel Energy's Sherco Solar Project at the power plant in Becker, which could reach up to 460 megawatts.

The farmland designated for Benton Solar is also organized through a voluntary lease with the farmer, and it can give them another way to generate income, Gracia said.

""A lot of landowners see it as a way to kind of diversify their income,"" he said. ""We see all sorts of arrangements, but ultimately, it's a lease between Benton Solar and the landowner to utilize the land for the life of the project, which is about 25 to 30 years.""

Banaian said the development adds new options for land and can also generate more income for a farmer to spend in the local community.

""Solar energy gives you another option for how you can use the land, and it might in fact increase land values on pieces of land that aren't necessarily all that great for growing crops,"" he said.

Benton Solar will also include a 115 kilovolt half-mile long transmission line to transport the energy generated to the grid, where it will likely stay around St. Cloud to serve the area's energy needs.

During a public scoping period in January, responses to the project were mixed. Several people expressed concerns about its aesthetics, impacts on property values and road use, among other worries.

However, both Banaian and Gracia see the project as a promising sign for Minnesota's future. The state has a goal to reach 100% renewable energy by 2040, and Gracia said the Benton Solar project is aligned with this benchmark.

""Solar farms are very safe; we do a significant amount of environmental studies on these projects prior to building them,"" Gracia said. ""Beyond just the landowners participating in the project, there are broader benefits to the community through the induced effects of this investment.""

Minnesota, a good spot for solar energy

He also said Minnesota makes a good spot for solar projects due to its sun exposure. NextEra uses internal modeling tools to identify areas with high wind or lots of sun, as well as opportunities to connect to the grid, which have highlighted Minnesota as a promising location.

Benton Solar is currently completing its Public Utilities Commission permitting process, Gracia said, and will host a public hearing in late August. The environmental assessment of the project will also likely be available in July.

The Commission is expected to make its decision on the project by the end of the year, and the company plans to start construction in spring of 2026 and be operational by the end of 2027.

The late-stage effort has involved direct conversations between Trump and Thune over the past two days. The intervention from Trump centers around a technical provision that could determine whether hundreds of planned projects are able to qualify for the wind and solar incentives, according to the people granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the conversations.

The president’s involvement has emerged as a complicating factor as Republicans aim to start voting on the megabill as soon as Saturday.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a close Trump ally, confirmed that Trump is directly involved in the push to further temper the Inflation Reduction Act credits.

“I talked to POTUS about it this morning and he certainly wants the renewables out ASAP,” Cramer said Friday.

The approach pushed by Trump would match restrictive language in the House-passed reconciliation bill, H.R. 1, that would determine eligibility for wind and solar investment and production tax credits based on when those projects enter into service.

It’s a departure from Senate Finance Committee language backed by moderates allowing projects to receive credits based on when they begin construction.

It’s unclear whether Thune plans to include the so-called “placed in service” standard in the final bill text. Doing so would put moderate senators who have pushed a slower schedule for sunsetting those incentives in a major bind, forcing them to choose between rejecting Trump’s agenda or allowing the gutting of tax credits that could lead to canceled projects, job losses and higher electricity prices in their states.

Thune’s office and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

Trump’s new push follows his Truth Social post last weekend declaring, “I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL.”

Renewable energy industry officials and advocates argue that a “placed in service” requirement is difficult for energy project developers because their timelines could be derailed by permitting delays, snags in connecting projects to the grid and other factors outside their control. Such a requirement would functionally end the credits for many planned projects, they say.

Reverting to more restrictive placed in service language would likely see pushback from moderate senators such as Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who said Thursday that such a move would be “disastrous in my state.”

Another moderate who has pushed back on IRA rollbacks, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), declined to say Friday night whether he had heard about a decision on placed in service language, but called the Senate Finance Committee’s approach “a more rational way of doing it.”

“There are lawsuits, regulatory hurdles and other things that would make it virtually impossible to get [projects] in service” even if they are essentially complete and would otherwise qualify, Tillis said.

Some Senate conservatives have backed the change, which they said will help keep Republicans’ campaign promise to end the Inflation Reduction Act subsidies.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said earlier this week “there is a strong commitment to end the Green New Deal subsidies by the end of President Trump’s term” — an objective, he said, “that we’re working hard to accomplish.”

The effort has been supported by outside conservative voices in recent days, including Alex Epstein, a vocal opponent of wind and solar subsidies who has met with Senate Republicans in recent weeks.

Epstein said Friday night that Trump is “aware that the Senate had watered down in some significant way what the House did.”

But he said moving to a placed in service standard is not a done deal and he is “not letting up myself until I see a law with this in it.”

Leading Trump officials like Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who also chairs the National Energy Dominance Council, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, have also repeatedly criticized wind and solar energy, arguing those intermittent resources are unreliable and overly reliant on tax subsidies.

In a post to X Friday night, Burgum wrote that Trump “promised to reverse the Biden administration’s disastrous energy policies, and the One Big Beautiful Bill delivers on this promise by ending the Green New Scam and investing in reliable, affordable baseload power!”",https://static.politico.com/f9/80/0586ff8a47fda2adeeab44690416/unlimiteduse-06-27-2025-white-house-0006.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 00:00:36.323363

The power generated will be optimized through Gridmatic’s AI-based market forecasting, with a segment supplied to EdgeConneX under the 24/7 CFE, which was recently renewed.

The 24/7 CFE program works through matching every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption with CFE generation, measured on hourly increments.

In comparison to Renewable Energy Credits, where the offtaker acquires the ‘environmental attributes’ of a renewable energy project, 24/7 CFE measures carbon-free energy rather than renewable energy and requires time matching to ensure that electricity used at any given time is matched by the generation of clean energy at the same time.

“Our continued partnership with Gridmatic reflects our commitment to leading-edge sustainability,” said Phillip Marangella, chief marketing and product officer at EdgeConneX. “Hourly matching of clean energy is a critical step toward truly accountable decarbonization, and Gridmatic enables us to achieve that with precision.”

Gridmatic and EdgeConneX first implemented the 24/7 CFE program in 2021 as part of a pilot tied to one data center site in the ERCOT market.

The pilot had an original target of 62 percent 24/7 CFE in 2023 and 63 percent in 2024. To achieve the project goals, Gridmatic assembled a portfolio of off-site Gridmatic-contracted CFE generation and storage assets, with matching completed on an hourly basis.

According to the companies, within a few months of the pilot, they realized they were able to overachieve the original targets, subsequently raising them to a high figure. As a result, in 2023, the partners were able to achieve an average of 86.2 percent total CFE.

EdgeConneX has one operational data center in Texas, located in Houston. The Edge facility has 1.95MW of capacity, scalable to 7.55MW. In addition, the company is developing another facility in Austin. Phase I of the colocation facility is currently under development, and is expected to offer 96MW at full buildout across a 130-acre plot.

In fact, the DOE’s clean energy loan portfolio outperforms venture capital-backed companies by a wide margin and holds up well compared to traditional bank loans [4].","Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) takes the United States off the path toward renewables-based energy independence and will directly result in higher energy prices for consumers. Since January, uncertainty over tariffs and IRA repeal has prompted companies to cancel or downsize $14 billion in clean energy investments [1] and cut more than 10,000 jobs. That’s just the beginning if fossil fuel interests—and their “Chaos Monkey”—prevail.

A Chaos Monkey is a tool — and a broader concept — used in software engineering and IT operations to intentionally disrupt systems in order to test their resilience and fault tolerance. As a metaphor, it captures exactly what the House and Senate versions of the One Big Beautiful Bill do—jettison core IRA provisions that underpin America’s clean-energy economy, injecting unpredictable policy shocks that threaten our transition.

Let’s cut to the chase – who will benefit from repealing the IRA? Only legacy fossil fuel interests, and those who seek major disruptions to the economy (e.g., Chaos Monkeys). The IRA is a monumental piece of legislation that has single-handedly shifted the trajectory of the nation’s energy future. The billions of dollars that have been—and are to be—invested in the grid of the future are creating jobs, safeguarding our energy needs, enhancing energy resilience, catalyzing a much-needed infrastructure buildout, and resulting in almost 60 gigawatts (GW) of newly deployed renewable capacity by the end of 2025, and spurring innovation. And its benefits reach far and wide—82% of funds have flowed to traditionally Republican districts [2].

Repealing the IRA is a way to needlessly increase chaos, shattering the chance for a long-term unified energy policy that prioritizes a sustainable supply of reliable and affordable energy in favor of doubling down on outdated and cost-inefficient fossil fuel technologies. The Senate’s version of the budget reconciliation bill, intended to be more palatable than the initial version passed by the House, still cuts IRA incentives by 90%. The impact of passing the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ will directly hit consumers’ wallets in both the near and long-term in the form of higher utility bills. Analyses show electricity rates rising 5%–7% by 2030 (adding $75–$100/year) and 6%–10% by 2035 (adding $100–$150/year) if a repeal occurs.[3] Translating the loss of tax credits to real per project cost terms, one estimate from Coho’s Market Pulse suggests that Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) prices could be elevated by as much as 45%. High prices and a lack of tax credits would likely reduce the amount of clean energy that would have been deployed under the IRA by 72% in the next decade.

Summary of Clean Energy Impacts from the Senate’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”

Category Senate Bill Action Wind & solar credits Phased out by 2028. 60% in 2026 & 20% in 2027. Project must take service to receive tax credit. Transferability maintained. Geothermal, nuclear, hydro Extended through 2033; phased out by 2036 Residential/efficiency credits Eliminated 90–180 days after bill enactment. EV credits Fully repealed shortly after bill enactment. FEOC restrictions Foreign Entity of Concern. Anything purchased from an FEOC is not eligible for tax credits. Expanded for six IRA credits, likely to substantially reduce energy storage deployments. DOE Loan Programs Office (LPO) Mandate repealed by pulling administrative funds ($5 billion cost to distribute $250 billion). New clean energy financing authority created to re-invest in legacy infrastructure with 0.2% of the original LPO budget.

Targeting the LPO is especially misguided—it guts a proven program just as the LPO scales to deploy IRA funds. In addition to repealing administrative funding required to run the office, the bill also cancels the LPO’s ability to issue clean energy loans through the Federal Finance Bank (FFB). The FFB is a government corporation housed under the Department of the Treasury (DOT) with the power to issue capital with loans financed at treasury rates. The low cost of capital normally only available to government entities enables a high project success rate. In fact, the DOE’s clean energy loan portfolio outperforms venture capital-backed companies by a wide margin and holds up well compared to traditional bank loans [4]. Albeit mostly from the pre-IRA period, 97-99% of DOE LPO projects [5] financed by the FFB are successfully operating.

Defunding the LPO and slashing critical tax credits are powerful tools for undoing the progress driven by the IRA. Rolling back these policies risks reversing economic and environmental gains, leading to higher costs for taxpayers and increased climate vulnerability. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of renewables, especially solar, along with the long project development timelines has largely made deploying new fossil fuel plants financially untenable (See the image below) [6]. Doubling down on fossil fuel infrastructure would not only reverse technological and environmental progress, it is economically infeasible.

Renewable energy sources consistently offer the lowest LCOE, remaining far more affordable than fossil fuel-based generation. Renewables are also dropping in cost faster than fossil fuels, making them the most economically viable path forward.

The CEO of American Clean Power, argues, “Absent reasonable timelines for businesses to adjust… good-paying jobs, technology innovation, and AI data centers will be driven overseas,” [7] while the CEO of Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) cautioned that jobs will be lost in every state if the bill is passed [8]. In other words, an IRA repeal would threaten jobs and innovation from coast to coast.

Tariffs—and now the One Big Beautiful Bill—have acted like a Chaos Monkey, threatening the very foundations of our clean-energy economy. Yet progress remains strong: in 2024, renewables supplied over 90% of new grid capacity, and they’re on track to lead again this year [9]. Still, tariff hikes and looming Senate budget reconciliation language continue to erect barriers to project development, rather than dismantling them.

The Chaos Monkey won’t stop our clean-energy future—but it injects costly uncertainty, stalls small business growth, and risks missing our climate goals. Stakeholders must unite to educate lawmakers and block these harmful policies. Anyone with a vested interest in the energy industry and a sustainable society needs to push back against the Chaos Monkey in all forms. That starts by doing everything possible to educate our lawmakers and combat the unconscionable policy actions retained in the Senate version of the One Big Beautiful Bill.

For the average residential customer, that’s an increase of about $23 a month, or 16.75%, phased in beginning Tuesday and into 2026.

NIPSCO had requested an increase of $32 a month, but as is customary in rate cases, the IURC whittled it down to a smaller though significant amount.

Rate cases are complicated, and so is a utility’s billing structure. For residential customers, actual bills will depend on usage and future potential changes in market prices.

The IURC’s approval came after a settlement reached between NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor and other key stakeholders, including NLMK Indiana, U.S. Steel Corp., Walmart, the RV Industry Users Group and the NIPSCO Industrial Group. The Citizens Action Coalition objected to the agreement.

NIPSCO plans to use the additional revenue to support more than $2 billion in capital investments to shift from coal toward greener energy for long-term savings and environmental benefits. An additional $769.5 million will address infrastructure needs, including replacing aging poles and lines, building new substations and modernizing the electric grid to improve reliability and reduce the duration of outages.

“NIPSCO is committed to connecting our customers with safe and reliable energy that adds value to their everyday lives,” NIPSCO President and Chief Operating Officer Vince Parisi said in a news release. “We’re proud of the collaborative outcome reached through this process, which balances the need for critical investments with the importance of minimizing the impact on our customers.”

“We understand that any increase in bills is significant, and we remain focused on supporting our customers through this transition with new assistance programs and continued improvements to service and reliability,” Parisi said.

Customers who experience difficulty with paying their bill can contact NISPCO at (800) 464-7726 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. Additional information is at NIPSCO.com/FinancialSupport.

A National Focus on Green Skills

The strategy recognises the importance of growing a skilled workforce to meet the demands of the renewable energy sector. It commits to the publication of a Workforce Strategy by the Office for Clean Energy Jobs, and a dedicated Solar Roadmap, both of which will address skills and job creation in the solar sector.

For us, this reinforces the mission of the Solar Careers UK initiative: to raise awareness of the wide range of career opportunities in solar, improve access to training and employment, and promote a more inclusive, diverse and future-ready workforce.

More Projects, More Jobs

With measures such as a 13-week target for planning decisions on major projects and the recruitment of 300 new planning officers, the barriers to solar deployment are being reduced. Faster development means more solar farms, more rooftop installations, and ultimately, more jobs across everything from engineering and project management to marketing, supply chain, and community engagement.

Situated just over 10 kilometers from Velyka Novosilka, the village itself may appear unremarkable, but the land beneath it is rich in valuable resources. According to Le Figaro, the occupation grants Russia access to a significant mineral asset—an estimated 1.2 million tonnes of lithium-rich ore with a concentration exceeding 1.5%.

Lithium has grown increasingly vital in recent years, primarily due to its central role in battery manufacturing for electric vehicles. Beyond this, the metal is also widely used in electronics, aerospace alloys, glass ceramics, and energy storage systems. The global demand for lithium has driven its market price to extreme highs. In 2022, it peaked at over $80,000 per tonne. However, as of June 27, 2025, lithium prices in China have dropped significantly, with a tonne selling for approximately $8,500.

This development comes against the backdrop of broader strategic initiatives involving Ukraine’s mineral wealth.

By Janet McCabe and Stan Meiburg

To understand the federal government’s true priorities, follow the money.

After months of saying his administration is committed to clean air and water for Americans, President Donald Trump has proposed a detailed budget for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal year 2026. The proposal is more consistent with his administration’s numerous recent actions and announcements that reduce protection for public health and the environment.

To us, former EPA leaders – one a longtime career employee and the other a political appointee – the budget proposal reveals a lot about what Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin want to accomplish.

According to the administration’s Budget in Brief document, total EPA funding for the fiscal year beginning October 2025 would drop from US$9.14 billion to $4.16 billion – a 54% decrease from the budget enacted by Congress for fiscal 2025 and less than half of EPA’s budget in any year of the first Trump administration.

Without taking inflation into account, this would be the smallest EPA budget since 1986. Adjusted for inflation, it would be the smallest budget since the Ford administration, even though Congress has for decades given EPA more responsibility to clean up and protect the nation’s air and water; handle hazardous chemicals and waste; protect drinking water; clean up environmental contamination; and evaluate the safety of a wide range of chemicals used in commerce and industry. These expansions reflected a bipartisan consensus that protecting public health and the environment is a national priority.

Federal budgeting is complicated, and EPA’s budget is particularly so. Here are some basics:

Each year, the president and Congress determine how much money will be spent on what things, and by which agencies. The familiar aphorism that “the president proposes, Congress disposes” captures the Constitution’s process for the federal budget, with Congress firmly holding the “power of the purse.”

EPA’s budget can be difficult to understand because individual programs may be funded from different sources. It is useful to consider it as a pie sliced into five main pieces:

Environmental programs and management: the day-to-day work of protecting air, water and land.

Science and technology: research on pollution, health effects and new environmental tools.

Superfund and trust funds: cleaning up contaminated sites and responding to emergency releases of pollution.

State and Tribal operating grants: supporting local implementation of environmental laws.

State capitalization grants: revolving loans for water infrastructure.

The Trump administration’s budget proposals for EPA represent a striking retreat from the national goals of clean air and clean water enacted in federal laws over the past 55 years. In the budget document, the administration argues that the federal government has done enough and that the protection of gains already achieved, as well as any further progress, should not be paid for with federal money.

This budget would reduce EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment to a bare minimum at best. Most dramatic and, in our view, most significant are the elimination of operating grants to state governments, drastic reductions in funding for science of all kinds, and elimination of EPA programs relating to climate change and environmental justice, which addresses situations of disproportionate environmental harm to vulnerable populations. It would cut regulatory and enforcement activities that the administration sees as inconsistent with fossil energy development. Other proposed changes, notably for Superfund and capitalization grants, are more nuanced.

These changes to EPA’s regular budget allocation are separate from changes to supplementary EPA funding that have also been in the news, including for projects specified in the Inflation Reduction Act and other specific laws.

Environmental programs and management

Funding for basic work to protect the environment and prevent pollution would be cut by 22%. The reductions are not spread equally, however. All activities related to climate change would be eliminated, including the Energy Star program and greenhouse gas reporting and tracking. Funding for civil and criminal enforcement of environmental laws and regulations would be cut by 69% and 50%, respectively.

The popular Brownfields program would be cut by 50%. Since 1995, $2.9 billion in federal funds have produced public and private investments totaling $42 billion for cleaning and redeveloping contaminated sites, and created more than 200,000 jobs.

A program to set standards and conduct training for safe removal of lead paint and other lead-containing materials from homes and businesses would be eliminated.

The administration has been clear that EPA will no longer do environmental justice work, such as funding to monitor toxic air emissions in low-income neighborhoods adjacent to industrial areas. This budget is consistent with that.

Science and technology

Scientific support functions would be cut by 34%. The Office of Research and Development would go from about 1,500 staff to about 500 and would be redistributed throughout the agency. This would diminish science that supports not just EPA’s work but that of organizations, industries, health care professionals and public and private researchers who benefit from EPA’s research.

Superfund and other trust funds

Superfund is by far the largest of EPA’s cleanup trust funds. It allows EPA to clean up contaminated sites. It also forces the parties responsible for the contamination to either perform cleanups or reimburse the government for EPA-led cleanup work. When there is no viable responsible party, Superfund gives EPA the funds and authority to clean up contaminated sites.

Prior to 2021, Superfund was funded through EPA’s annual budget. In 2021 and 2022, Congress restored taxes on selected chemicals and petroleum products to help pay for Superfund. During the Biden administration, EPA reduced the Superfund’s line in the general budget, with the expectation that the Superfund tax revenues would more than make up for the reduction. Administrator Zeldin, who has said that site cleanup is a priority, is proposing to shift virtually all funding for cleanups to these new tax revenues.

There is risk in this approach, however. The Superfund tax expires in 2031 and has raised less than Treasury Department predictions in both 2023 and 2024. In fiscal year 2024, available tax receipts were predicted to be $2.5 billion, but only $1.4 billion was collected. Future funding is uncertain because it depends on the amounts of various chemicals that companies actually use. Experts disagree on whether this is significant for the Superfund program. The petrochemical industry, on whom this tax largely falls, is lobbying for its repeal.

Funds to address leaks at gas station tanks would be cut nearly in half. Funds to clean up oil and petroleum spills would be cut by 24%.

State operating grants

The budget proposal seeks to reset the EPA’s relationship with state agencies, which implement the vast majority of environmental regulations.

EPA has long delegated some of its powers to state environmental agencies, including permitting, inspections and enforcement of regulations that govern air, water and soil pollution. Since the 1970s, EPA has helped fund those activities through basic operating grants that require minimum state contributions and reward larger state investments with additional federal dollars.

The proposed budget would eliminate all of those grants to states – totaling $1 billion. The document itself explains that federal funding over decades has totaled “hundreds of billions of dollars” and has resulted in programs that “are mature or have accomplished their purpose.”

States disagree. They note that EPA has delegated 90% of the nation’s environmental protection work to state authorities, and states have accepted that workload based on the expectation of federal funding. The states say reduced funding would greatly diminish the actual work of environmental protection – site inspections, air and water monitoring, and enforcement – across the country.

State capitalization grants

Since 1987, EPA has given states money for revolving loan programs that provide low-interest loans to state and local governments to clean up waterways and provide safe drinking water. The proposed budget would cut that funding by 89%, from $2.8 billion to $305 million.

These capitalization grants were originally envisioned as seed money, with future loans available as the initial and subsequent loans were repaid. But the need for water infrastructure continues to grow, and Congress has for many years allocated additional money to the program.

In protecting the environment, you get what you pay for. In past years, Congress has refused to accept proposed drastic cuts to EPA’s budget. It remains to be seen whether this Congress will go along with these proposed rollbacks.",https://www.environmentalprotectionnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/timothy-abraham-up_8-0l5DeA-unsplash-2400x1602.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 03:03:00.783346

H.R. 1, the budget bill containing many of the Trump administration’s domestic policy priorities, would eliminate a number of tax credits for renewable energy projects, many of which were created by the Democratic-led Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Shapiro warned the hardest impact would fall on those slated to open soon. In the House version, most of the clean energy tax credits would end abruptly, instead of in 2032, when they were initially set to expire.

The Senate version is slightly more lenient. Tax credits for wind and solar projects would instead be phased out, with decreasing credits for projects that break ground in 2026 and 2027.

The Senate also moved to keep certain tax credits for nuclear, hydropower, battery and geothermal projects until 2034. Shapiro applauded this change.

Still, he specifically addressed several that have already been announced, which he said could suffer under the changes. That includes two projects in Clearfield County that he noted are collectively anticipated to create more than 900 jobs.

Shapiro said the bill could also effectively end state programs designed to help community institutions lower their energy bills. He said the Solar for Schools program, for example, could potentially lose over $30 million.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is a commonsense, pro-growth solution that locks in President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, protecting hardworking Texans from devastating tax hikes. What Democrats won’t tell you about the bill is that if Congress fails to pass this legislation, families, farmers, and small businesses in TX-11 will face the largest tax increase in history. To put this into perspective, over 475,000 taxpayers in TX-11 are at risk, with the average taxpayer facing a 26% tax increase if this bill is not passed. In practical terms, an average family of four in TX-11 making an annual income of $67,226 would see their taxes rise by $1,293—roughly the cost of seven weeks’ worth of groceries.

Congress cannot allow this to happen. Failure to pass this legislation would deliver a crippling economic blow to every hardworking Texan. Extending the 2017 tax cuts through the One Big Beautiful Bill will keep tax rates low across all income brackets, preserve the child tax credit, maintain generous deductions for families, and ensure that small businesses continue to grow—not struggle under Washington’s weight.

While extending these tax cuts is a key component, the urgency of passing this legislation goes far beyond that. On our current path, the national debt is projected to reach $150 trillion by 2055. This is unsustainable by any measure and will harm every single person in TX-11. If we continue down this course, interest payments will crowd out critical federal spending, leaving future generations ill-equipped to meet their challenges. The One Big Beautiful Bill garners over $1.7 trillion in savings, righting the ship and steering us toward a leaner, more responsible federal government.

This bill also makes vital investments in border security— from $46 billion to complete President Trump’s border wall to funding 18,000 new immigration enforcement personnel who will detain and deport illegal aliens—making our country safer.

In addition to increased border funding, we secured $12 billion in reimbursements for border states forced to bear the brunt of the previous administration’s open-border policies. While these impacts were certainly felt nationwide, no state bore the burden more than Texas, which spent $11.1 billion on border security—$5.87 billion on personnel costs and $4.75 billion on border wall and barriers. When the federal government failed to secure our border and protect our communities, Texans stepped up. This bill finally ensures our state receives the reimbursement it’s owed.

Furthermore, this legislation commits almost $150 billion to rebuild America’s military and strengthen our national security—including $34 billion to revitalize our naval fleet and $25 billion for missile defense. If the past week has taught us anything, it is that America’s military is the best in the world. Congress must ensure our military is adequately funded to guarantee we have the capabilities to defeat our adversaries.

The One Big Beautiful Bill also kicks President Trump’s energy agenda back into high gear by opening federal lands for drilling, easing burdensome regulations, and eliminating hundreds of billions in Green New Deal subsidies that have made U.S. energy more expensive and less reliable.

These accomplishments are historic. In November, 77 million Americans demanded change, and the One Big Beautiful Bill will go down as promises made, promises kept. It will dramatically improve the lives of my constituents—restoring American energy dominance, delivering vital support to our farmers and ranchers, securing historic tax cuts for hardworking families, reining in wasteful government spending, and making the strongest investment in border security in decades.

We’ve done our job in the House. Now it’s time for the Senate to do theirs and uphold the major wins we secured. My constituents—and all Americans—are counting on it.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/August_Pfluger_official_photo.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 01:01:25.981998
,Texas American Energy ,2025-06-28 01:02:21+00:00,Los Angeles Times,How big batteries could prevent summer power blackouts - Los Angeles Times,Kyle Stock,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-27/how-big-batteries-could-prevent-summer-power-blackouts,"But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries.
In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a new record.
Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.
Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.
Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects.","In any other year, May 14 may well have been an energy disaster in Texas.

Temperatures climbed to seasonal levels not seen in over a century: 92 in Dallas, 95 in Houston and 104 in Laredo. Air conditioners hummed en masse and power demand surged.

Meanwhile, scores of natural gas-powered generators were offline, getting tuned up for summer.

But Texas skies were pretty sunny and windy and startups had spent the preceding months building big banks of batteries to store electricity. When power demand peaked around 4:30 in the afternoon, almost half of the electricity on the grid was coming from renewables, according to the energy analytics platform GridStatus.io. As the sun set, battery banks that had been soaking up electrons in the heat of the day stepped up to cover 8% of demand, keeping power flowing.

“Batteries are very good at handling these types of events,” said Andrew Gilligan, director of commercial strategy at Fluence Energy, a battery developer with three storage sites in Texas. “Things have gotten a lot better than a couple years ago.”

This summer will be an energy doozy in the U.S. as climate change exacerbates heat waves and a rash of new data centers and crypto mines come online. But these new power vacuums arrive in concert with a stack of big batteries.

America, particularly its Sun Belt, has been a gusher of renewable energy for years; now, utilities will be able to bottle up much of that sun and wind and discharge it around the clock.

In the 12 months through April — the most recent data available — energy storage in the U.S. surged from roughly 18 gigawatts to 25 gigawatts, a 41% increase, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of federal data. In Arizona, battery bandwidth nearly tripled; in Texas, it has almost doubled. In the evening of April 8, more than 11% of Texas electricity was coming from batteries, a new record.

If the U.S. is able to reach the Biden administration’s goal of emissions-free electricity by 2035 — or even get close — batteries will be a big reason why. Renewable electricity is setting records every few days and comprised almost one-third of all U.S. power generation in March.

Batteries can make sure those electrons hit at the most opportune time — or at least that they don’t go to waste. Along the way, they’ll drag electricity prices down, speed the retirement of fossil fuel plants and preclude plans for new ones, according to Jan Rosenow, head of the energy program at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute.

“Twenty years ago, the main problem with renewables was that they were so expensive,” Rosenow said. “Now, renewables are cheap, but we need to be able to match that supply to demand. For that, battery storage is clearly one of the best tools in the box.”

Summer is always a fraught time for grids and utilities. Cooling takes more electricity than heating and with a fast-changing climate, Americans are doing it more and more. Annual cooling degree days, an indicator of AC use, have increased 17% compared with the 1990-99 average, according to BloombergNEF. Last summer was the fourth hottest on record in North America and meteorologists are forecasting a similarly sweaty sequel.

“An increase in heat extremes is the most obvious symptom of climate change,” said Karen McKinnon, a professor who studies the statistics behind climate change at UCLA. “Even seemingly small changes in temperatures of a few degrees can make summers feel substantially more extreme.”

As a result, three of the continent’s six major power grids are at risk of power outages this summer, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. All told, 104 million Americans — roughly 1 in 3 people — live in areas where extreme heat and rising demand could shut out the lights, though NERC says the risk would be far higher without the new banks of batteries.

In Texas, for example, NERC’s odds of an energy emergency this summer have dropped from roughly 15% a few months ago to 3.6% thanks to battery capacity. Meanwhile, NERC expects batteries to juice roughly one-quarter of California’s peak power demand in coming months.

“Reliability is the ability to react to sudden changes in the grid,” said Chris McKissack, chief executive officer of Fullmark Energy, which is building two storage sites in Texas. “And when it comes to reacting, nothing moves faster than battery storage.”

Homeowners have realized as much, adding their own small battery systems to keep the lights on and avoid time-of-use electric price peaks. Last year, residential storage surged by 64%, systems that also help lower summer demand peaks and stabilize the grid.

Last summer, there were no major power outages in the U.S., a success the Department of Energy primarily attributed to new solar generation and storage.

Officials who run the Texas grid say batteries have also been critical in lowering prices, particularly in the summer. They expect storage in the state to triple over the next five years.

To be sure, it’s still very early days for storage. In 2024, it represented just 2% of U.S. power capacity, but that’s ramping up quickly. BNEF expects utility-scale battery storage to nearly double again this year regardless of how much the Trump administration manages to dial down green incentives, with some 18 gigawatts of new capacity.

Utilities and developers are building battery stacks because they are often the most affordable way to add capacity, essentially by stretching power generation that’s already built. The average price for stationary storage systems in 2024 was $125 per kWh, 19% lower than in 2023, according to BNEF.

Storage systems are also getting more resilient. A decade ago, industrial batteries generally discharged all of their electrons in 30 minutes or less. Today, the average system can put out energy for four hours straight, and some are tuned for cycles as high as eight hours. This means they can kick in more frequently and stay on for longer, not just during brief windows in the morning and evening.

Rosenow, at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, says big batteries are surging and affordable enough that their adoption will steepen quickly.

“Storage is now where solar was maybe 10 years ago,” Rosenow said. “That’s kind of how it feels to me. It’s really mind-blowing.”

As the battery blitz evolves, Rosenow says, people will pay less for electricity, outages will abate and the largest energy hogs, including AI data centers, will spool up with minimal added emissions. But there are diminishing returns.

Storage systems thrive on being able to sock in electrons when they are cheap and sell them when power prices surge. As storage capacity ramps up, those arbitrage opportunities narrow. McKissack at Fullmark says battery executives are becoming much more strategic about what they build and where.

“The race for quantity is over,” he said. “At this point, very few of us want to bolster up the number of dots on a map.”

What’s more, recent federal tariffs will likely raise the cost of big battery projects from 12% to 50%, depending on how high the levies go and how long they stay elevated, according to Woods Mackenzie. And while American battery factories are booting up, it will be a long time before domestic supply meets even more than a small fraction of U.S. demand, the company says.

Trump’s spending plan also threatens to throttle big batteries and green energy projects. Sabah Bayatli, president of OCI Energy, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to encourage senators to maintain Inflation Reduction Act incentives or, at the very least, step them down gradually.

“If [the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’] passes as is, it’s an overnight kill for the solar industry,” he said.

Bayatli may more easily make his case after a summer of heat-wave drama and power outages, but the solar and storage that’s already been built could preclude all that.

McKissack concedes that most people and businesses won’t realize how big of a part renewables and batteries will play in keeping the grid healthy in coming months. Charts of disaster averted because of them aren’t all that powerful, he explained.

“It’s almost easier to talk about when there’s a blackout, but then people’s lives are at risk,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/839710d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F74%2Fac%2F01f14dc544aebe4c71ee8c021a30%2Fbiden-renewable-energy-transmission-54717.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 23:04:13.232030

The factsheet highlights energy projects driving economic growth in Tennessee as Congress considers budget reconciliation proposals that would impact jobs and economic development in the state by altering and drastically limiting the timeline of key energy tax credits.

“Companies rely on long-term business certainty in the tax code to plan projects and allocate capital,” said BCSE President Lisa Jacobson. “As we face an era of unprecedented energy demand growth, now is not the time to disrupt the market by making unnecessary changes to the tax structure. Tennessee needs more energy now to keep the lights on for homes and businesses – and these tax incentives are unleashing homegrown energy across the state.”

Tennessee is already experiencing sharp increases in energy demand coupled with concerns about rising energy costs. The House-passed budget reconciliation bill would increase household energy spending in Tennessee by an average of nearly $120 per year in 2030 and more than $380 per year in 2035.

Clear, predictable, and long-term tax policy is essential for market confidence that will get projects deployed quickly and urgently. The changes proposed in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill are expected to result in the loss of 9,900 jobs in Tennessee by 2030 and nearly 18,000 jobs by 2035, due to a decline in new investments in domestic energy and manufacturing. Additionally, annual GDP in Tennessee would shrink by $1.7 billion in 2030 and $2.9 billion in 2035.

“Tennessee is emerging as an attractive place for energy businesses, from startups to manufacturers to project developers, creating good-paying jobs and taxpayer revenue in communities across the state,” said Lynn Abramson, President of the Clean Energy Business Network. “But these growth industries are in jeopardy as Congress considers reopening the existing energy tax code.

The Committee on Transportation favored the PERMIT Act, known also as House Resolution 3898, that amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Three proposals introduced by U.S. Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., former chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, are included in the bill authored by Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga.

“Congressman Rouzer has long been a leader in Congress in working to bring commonsense to Clean Water Act programs and permitting processes, so that our farmers, builders, businesses and many others can operate in a manner that protects water quality and allows for economic growth,” said Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo.

The acronym is for Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act.

Rouzer, sixth term representative from the southeastern part of the state known as the 7th Congressional District, has been in the Beltway as long as U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and is only behind Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Alma Adams, D-N.C., in tenure from the state. He proposed a similar though not as expansive package in the last Congress.

Rouzer’s Improving Water Certifications and American Energy Infrastructure Act (HR3928) would “end the weaponization of the water quality certification process to stall critical infrastructure and energy projects.” His Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act (HR3824) “eliminates a duplicative regulatory process at the Environmental Protection Agency” involving pesticides.

And the congressman’s Nationwide Permitting Improvement Act (HR3927) “codifies longstanding, historical interpretation and practice around the Nationwide Permit process and provides clarity regarding several areas where challenges have risen against the well-established process.”

In a release, Rouzer said, “I am pleased to see the PERMIT Act advancing in the 119th Congress.

H.R. 3898, the Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act included three bills introduced by Congressman Rouzer. These commonsense reforms are designed to increase permitting efficiency by providing more predictable guidance for applicants and clearer standards for permitting agencies.

This package is a more expansive version of the Creating Confidence in Clean Water Permitting Act, a similar package led by Rep. Rouzer in the 118th Congress when he served as Chairman of Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee.

“I am pleased to see the PERMIT Act advancing in the 119th Congress. Everyday Americans should not be burdened by unnecessary red tape and uncertainty while trying to grow their business and contribute to our economy,” said Rep. Rouzer. “I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Graves for his leadership throughout this process. This legislation will have a significant, positive impact for our communities, farm families and small businesses in North Carolina.”

“Congressman Rouzer has long been a leader in Congress in working to bring commonsense to Clean Water Act programs and permitting processes, so that our farmers, builders, businesses, and many others can operate in a manner that protects water quality and allows for economic growth. I commend him for his important contributions to this legislation and for his ongoing leadership on these issues,” said Chairman Sam Graves.

Details :

Improving Water Quality Certifications and American Energy Infrastructure Act (H.R. 3928): Clarifies process and scope of Section 401 CWA approvals by states are limited to only impacts to water quality to end the weaponization of the water quality certification process to stall critical infrastructure and energy projects.

Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act (H.R. 3824): Eliminates a duplicative regulatory process at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the use of pesticides while maintaining public health and environmental protections.

Nationwide Permitting Improvement Act (H.R. 3927): Codifies longstanding, historical interpretation and practice around the Nationwide Permit (NWP) process and provides clarity regarding several areas where challenges have risen against the well-established process.

Budd joins Cotton, colleagues in to reform, improve, streamline ODNI

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-N.C.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, in introducing the Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act, legislation that would realign resources to intelligence missions, eliminate duplicative efforts and inefficient, non-functioning bureaucracies across the intelligence community (IC) and return the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to its original size, scope, and mission.

“The ODNI was established to unify America’s intelligence community, enhancing coordination among agencies efficiently and collectively focusing on the threats to our nation. Over the years, the ODNI has become a bloated bureaucracy, contrary to the vision laid out for this vital agency. I’m proud to join Senator Cotton and our colleagues in introducing needed reforms to stop ODNI from stumbling over bureaucratic red tape and return the agency to its original, lean form—one solely focused on our nation’s security, said Senator Budd.”

“Created after the September 11th attacks, ODNI was intended to be a lean organization to align America’s intelligence resources and authorities, not the overstaffed and bureaucratic behemoth that it is today, where coordinators coordinate with other coordinators. These reforms will be vital to keeping our country safe from the wide range of threats that we continue to face,” said Senator Cotton.

Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Rounds (R-South Dakota), and James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) are also cosponsoring the legislation.

The Intelligence Community Efficiency and Effectiveness Act would:

Cap ODNI full-time staff at 650.

Eliminate certain reporting requirements and the transfer of personnel authorities.

Modify the National Intelligence Council’s duties and terminate the National Intelligence Managers’ positions.

Terminate the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) at ODNI and transfer its responsibilities to the FBI.

Redesignate the National Counterterrorism Center as the National Counterterrorism and Counternarcotics Center and limit its mission to foreign intelligence authorities.

Terminate the National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center (NCBC) at ODNI, transfer NCBC’s responsibilities to the CIA, and redesignate it as the National Counterproliferation Center.

Repeal various positions (including the Director of the NCSC, the Director of the NCBC, and the Intelligence Community Chief Data Officer) and seven units, centers, councils, offices, and programs (including obsolete bureaucratic entities that have failed to function, such as the Joint Intelligence Community Council).

Prohibit National Intelligence Program funds from being used to outsource IC analytic efforts to organizations that take funds from foreign governments.

Require the DNI to wind down and terminate the National Intelligence University within 180 days.

Prohibit the use of National Intelligence Program funds to implement any diversity, equity, or inclusion practice in the intelligence community.

Job growth above long-run average in May

Texas employment grew an annualized 2.6 percent in May (31,000 jobs) after expanding 4.0 percent in April. Significant job gains were seen in leisure and hospitality, oil and gas, and leisure and hospitality, all growing above 4 percent. (Chart 1) The Dallas Fed Texas Employment Forecast is for 2.0 percent growth in 2025 (December/December).

Labor force growth trends down but remains positive

In May, the Texas labor force grew an annualized 1.9 percent, while the nation saw a 4.3 percent annual decrease.

“Not only are we proud of this recognition from Inc., but we’re also incredibly excited about the continued growth ahead,” said Paul Errigo, CEO of Greencrown Energy in an April 1 press release. “We’re partnering with nationally recognized multi-facility organizations to help them take control of their utility risk, reduce energy spend, and support long-term sustainability goals.

“We’re just getting started.”

‘We do so much more’

In addition to providing strategic consulting, Greencrown also features its proprietary Utility ROI software platform. The tool is designed to simplify data, uncover savings opportunities, and support intelligent, results-driven energy decisions.

Greencrown focuses on simplifying energy management for its clients through its proven process of reducing energy spend, decreasing consumption, and driving sustainability for commercial and industrial clients nationwide.

NJBIZ recently spoke to Errigo about Greencrown’s start, its growth, its future, as well as the overall energy space and challenges/costs.

“We were founded back in 2007. I’m one of the of the founders of the company,” Errigo told NJBIZ. “We started out strictly as an energy procurement company. So, really an energy advisory firm. And from the beginning, we set out to be the nation’s most trusted and professional energy management advisory firm.”

He said those services would typically be regarded as being an energy broker.

“But I am so anti, against the term ‘energy broker’ – because we do so much more,” Errigo stressed. He said the word broker often has a negative stigma associated with it. “We do much more than just broker pricing. We’ve spent all the years just really branding ourselves to rise above that broker reputation – to truly become an advisor.

“That’s how the company was built. We really are built with former energy supply executives on our team.”

Devil in the details

That leadership team also includes President Sal Ritorto.

“We have the ability to analyze data, produce the best advice out there,” Errigo continued. “What we do at our core is not only do we find the best pricing that’s available out there for our customers. But our approach is to customize what we’re doing for them.”

Errigo said that there is much more than goes into it than just the pricing aspect, which people don’t often recognize.

“And our specialty is multiple facility portfolios. Whether it’s a real estate portfolio that has five, 10, 15, 20, 30 buildings; a Morgan Stanley, or even franchises,” Errigo explained. “We service a lot of Jersey Mike’s, Gold’s Gyms, health clubs, restaurant chains. The idea is with the multiple facilities – there’s a lot more things that go into it than just the price of energy.

Get a quick look at what Greencrown Energy offers here:

“Because the devil is in the details with the terms and conditions of a contract. If they add-on new accounts or open up new facilities – or shut some of their locations down – all of that affects the price of their energy. If they turn their energy on at the same time, when they first come in at 9:00 – when they open up the lights. That has a dramatic effect on the price that they pay for their energy over the course of the year.

“There’s so many different nuances and ways that we can reduce their energy spend, reduce their energy costs – that the typical broker is not going to do.”

Rising costs

“Rising energy prices are the issue of the day here in New Jersey. What are some of the things that you’re hearing from clients?” NJBIZ asked.

“Everyone is super concerned,” said Errigo. He pointed to the June 1 rate hikes that took effect. The changes have ratepayers set to pay up to 20% or more during these peak summer months. “It’s not just the supply that’s going up – but it’s the demand charges. The demand, we really don’t have control over – that’s the generation. That’s who’s generating the energy themselves versus just the supplier.”

He noted that utilities like PSE&G and JCP&L faced massive rate hikes stemming from last year’s energy auction, which NJBIZ has reported extensively about.

“Everybody’s going to see a significant increase in their bill over the summer. Of course, perfect timing for when everybody consumes the most amount of electricity. It’s imperative now – we’re reaching out to all of our clients and basically telling them right now is a good time to take a look at renewing some of the agreements that you have – looking into the future,” said Errigo during the early May interview, before the June 1 threshold.

“You’re not going to be able to control some of these generation charges that are going to go up. So, let’s fix, as long as we can, something that we can be definitive about – to control your pricing for budget certainty moving forward. For a guy that’s using a couple of hundred kilowatt hours a year, it’s not that big of a deal. But when you’re talking about major real estate portfolios, manufacturing facilities where the movement of a half a penny or a penny is tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars – it’s a big deal.”

At the core

Errigo said the company primarily focuses on three areas, beginning with the procurement of electricity and natural gas. He said that energy risk management is Greencrown’s core business.

“That’s what we do. We help navigate all of the risks, the challenges; what we think in our best opinion moving forward; how long they should fix an agreement for,” Errigo explained. “Should we buy it at six months, one year, 18 months, two years – up to three years? And that’s really what we do in terms of advice.

“The procurement is really the reason for our growth; the reason we why earn customers’ trust – because we don’t burn people. We give them the advice – and we let them make the decisions. But we give them our experience.”

That’s what we do. We help navigate all of the risks, the challenges.

– Paul Errigo, CEO, Greencrown Energy

He spoke about the other areas of focus including demand side management (pointing companies to potential incentives available during peak usage when utilities are struggling with demand).

“These companies – we get them incentive money, $10,000, $100,000 a year, that they are there during an event,” Errigo explained. “So, during an energy demand event, the grid becomes overburdened and prompts utilities to give financial incentives to customers for reducing consumption. So, in a high-rise building, they can shut off a few elevators, turn off one of their air conditioning units.

“And there’s all kinds of programs out there.”

Real-time data

Errigo also noted the final area of focus – the aforementioned Utility ROI platform.

“It’s basically software as a service solution,” he said. “What it does is – we have integration with every single meter with every single utility that’s out there. So, it can tap into people’s electricity meters, their gas meters, their water meters, their steam meters – any utility that’s out there. We can get real-time energy data management and we monitor everything.

“Our platform automates the processes by allowing the customers and giving them the ability to audit their existing electricity, gas, water, steam, consumption in real time. What does that do? It allows them to benchmark. Let’s say they have 10 locations – it allows them to benchmark: why is location two so much cheaper in energy bills than location seven?”

He said that it allows customers to see the real-time spending and adjust accordingly – in a much more efficient manner.

“It eliminates time waste by them trying to figure out, manage their bills; saves money; reduces and conserves energy,” said Errigo. “And it streamlines all their investments.”

The next level

“What excites you most about the point the company is at right now – and what’s to come?” NJBIZ asked as the conversation began winding down.

Errigo said, “What excites me most right now more than the industry or the business itself – is our team.”

He noted how the growth of the company has allowed it to recruit high-level talented and experienced people in this space.

What excites me most right now more than the industry or the business itself – is our team.

– Paul Errigo, CEO, Greencrown Energy

“That’s what’s I’m most excited about. Our team is continuing to get better and stronger. Our team is getting more efficient, stronger, more educated. A lot of our people have been with us for years – and the newer people that are coming on already had the education. So, we’re not having to train people that are green behind the ears. We built a great team over the years to get where we’re at right now.

“But, now we just keep on adding some more executives that are really going to help to take it to the next level.”

Snowball effect

He said that getting recognition as with making the Inc. list has helped with talent recruitment efforts.

“Instead of us constantly trying to search for better talent – better talent is finding us. And that’s exciting. People want to come work for us. And that’s part of the culture that we built, the reputation that we built – the recognition that we’re getting.

“We’re continuing to get these accolades and the names and the brands that we are servicing are getting larger and larger.”

Errigo believes that the sky is the limit for the company.

“I think we are exponentially just going to really snowball and just continue to grow faster and faster,” said Errigo.

He noted having been here before in terms of growth as an executive – and he and his team know how to mange the growth in sales as it scales operations.

“We are continuing the put the team on that has the capability to handle it – which is the most exciting thing,” said Errigo, stressing that having the right people in the right places is paramount. “And we continue to play that chess game.”",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/06/Data_Depositphotos_615373070_L.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 01:01:33.173514

Funds for Septic Conversions in Jackson County, System Improvements in Hancock County

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) today announced the award of two RESTORE Act grants worth more than $3.0 million for wastewater improvement projects in Jackson and Hancock counties.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury awarded the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund grants to the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) to continue work on the Jackson County Utility Authority Colonial Estates Area Septic System Abatement Project and for the Hancock County Utility Authority Cedar Point Wastewater Pump Station Improvement Project.

“I’ve heard from constituents and local leaders about the problems caused by old septic systems and the need for wastewater infrastructure improvements on the Gulf Coast. The use of RESTORE Act trust funds for work in Jackson and Hancock counties is not only welcome, but warranted for the health of the people and our coastal ecology,” said Hyde-Smith, who as a Senate Appropriations Committee member fought a previous attempt to block Gulf Coast states from receiving these funds.

The Jackson County Utility Authority (JCUA) project will receive $1,700,919 for phase II of the septic abatement process, which will allow the conversion and connection of 125 household septic to the JCUA public sewer system. The work is a continuation of an effort to decommission septic tanks in order to lessen the risk of downstream water contamination.

The Hancock County Utility Authority project will receive $1,368,081 to upgrade the existing Cedar Point pump station in Bay St. Louis to reduce the potential of wastewater overflows due to pump station reliability and capacity issues. This project would mitigate the threat of overflows contaminating adjacent coastal streams, the Jourdan River, the Bay of St. Louis, and the Gulf of America.

Hyde-Smith in 2023 fought a Biden administration effort to restrict the use of RESTORE Act funding, threatening to derail the FY2024 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill unless the measure included her language to block the previous administration’s initiative.

Congress established the Gulf Coast Restoration Fund in 2012 with enactment of the RESTORE Act. The fund provides a portion of revenues derived from Deepwater Horizon disaster fines to Gulf Coast states—Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Texas—for ecological and economic recovery.

At a critical moment for Indian Country, Native News Online is embarking on our most ambitious reporting project yet: ""Cultivating Culture,"" a three-year investigation into two forces shaping Native community survival—food sovereignty and language revitalization.

The devastating impact of COVID-19 accelerated the loss of Native elders and with them, irreplaceable cultural knowledge. Yet across tribal communities, innovative leaders are fighting back, reclaiming traditional food systems and breathing new life into Native languages. These aren't just cultural preservation efforts—they're powerful pathways to community health, healing, and resilience.

Our dedicated reporting team will spend three years documenting these stories through on-the-ground reporting in 18 tribal communities, producing over 200 in-depth stories, 18 podcast episodes, and multimedia content that amplifies Indigenous voices. We'll show policymakers, funders, and allies how cultural restoration directly impacts physical and mental wellness while celebrating successful models of sovereignty and self-determination.

This isn't corporate media parachuting into Indian Country for a quick story. This is sustained, relationship-based journalism by Native reporters who understand these communities. It's ""Warrior Journalism""—fearless reporting that serves the 5.5 million readers who depend on us for news that mainstream media often ignores.

We need your help right now. While we've secured partial funding, we're still $450,000 short of our three-year budget. Our immediate goal is $25,000 this month to keep this critical work moving forward—funding reporter salaries, travel to remote communities, photography, and the deep reporting these stories deserve.

Every dollar directly supports Indigenous journalists telling Indigenous stories. Whether it's $5 or $50, your contribution ensures these vital narratives of resilience, innovation, and hope don't disappear into silence.

The stakes couldn't be higher. Native languages are being lost at an alarming rate. Food insecurity plagues many tribal communities. But solutions are emerging, and these stories need to be told.

Support independent Native journalism. Fund the stories that matter.

Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.
The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate.
45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually.
The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter.
A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.","A group of Republican lawmakers, who have opposed carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa, penned a letter to U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst this week asking her to remove a tax credit incentivizing carbon sequestration from the budget reconciliation bill.

“Repeal 45Q now!” the letter read, naming the section of tax code.

The budget reconciliation bill, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” has removed or substantially altered a number of clean energy credits for things like wind power or solar projects, but it has retained the 45Q tax credit, which was initiated in 2008 and expanded under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The Senate has not finalized its version of the bill yet, but is aiming for a Fourth of July deadline.

Iowa lawmakers from both the House and the Senate have been opposed to 45Q credits and to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, which plans to lay nearly 1,000 miles of pipeline in Iowa alone to transport carbon dioxide captured at ethanol facilities to underground storage in North Dakota.

Six GOP lawmakers from North Dakota also signed on the letter. A similar letter that circulated earlier this month was headed by lawmakers in South Dakota.

The opponents in the Iowa-led letter said the federal tax credit “bankrolls private corporations” to “bulldoze our land, intimidate our communities, endanger lives, and bury opportunity.”

Carbon sequestration pipelines have brought about arguments surrounding private property rights. Summit was granted the right of eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission last year. The Iowa House passed a bill to ban carbon sequestration pipelines operators from using eminent domain, and the state Legislature passed a bill significantly limiting a CO2 pipeline’s ability to operate.

The bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds June 11, and House lawmakers have submitted a petition to return for a special session to override the veto, but the effort will likely not be picked up by the Senate.

“For four years, we have fought a grueling legislative battle to defend the constitutional property rights, safety, and economic vitality of our constituents—80–90% of whom reject the 45Q,” the letter read, referencing a survey from the fall conducted by a group opposed to the pipeline.

In addition to opposing the use of eminent domain, opponents of the CO2 pipeline worry about potential safety issues associated with the project and damage to cropland.

“Why would we bulldoze our way through some of the best farmland in the world to bury CO2 into formations with unknown consequences and deprive the Corn Belt of adding value and purpose to one third of each bushel of corn in the form of methanol and other fuels?” the letter read.

Summit has said it will restore cropland impacted by the pipeline to its original condition and holds that it is “going above and beyond” federal standards to ensure safety.

According to its website, the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline would have the capacity to put more than 18 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually into storage. 45Q credits carbon sequestration projects of this kind at $85 per metric ton of CO2, meaning Summit could receive around $1.5 billion in the tax credits annually.

The letter said federal lawmakers have “dismissed” the pipeline and 45Q issue as a state matter.

“This is no state issue —it’s a federal travesty, with 45Q’s unlimited borrowed billions fueling corporate aggression,” the letter read.

A 2023 report on the tax credit from the Congressional Budget Office estimated by the 2030s the expanded use of carbon sequestration and companies claiming the credits could result in federal revenue loss between $30 billion and “well over” $100 billion.

The letter from lawmakers said the cost was “staggering.”

Carbon capture and sequestration would allow the Iowa biofuels industry to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market, which it says would be hugely beneficial to struggling farmers and the state.

The CBO report also projected that if all of the projected carbon capture and sequestration projects across the country were brought online, it could remove close to 3% of the nation’s annual CO2 emissions.

The letter argues if the industry attempts to reach “net zero” emissions, the cost of these tax credits to the federal government, and taxpayers, would be even higher.

“Repealing 45Q in (the budget reconciliation bill) would halt this federally funded nightmare, save trillions of additional debt, and empower our farmers and ethanol plants to lead a new renewable fuels revolution,” the letter said. “Our constituents demand it, our farmland deserves it, and our future depends on it.”

Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

A draft of the bill from a Senate committee shows some changes to the 45Q tax credit, like standardizing the credit across project types and prohibiting foreign entities from claiming the credit.

But while electric cars continue to increase their share of the global passenger vehicle market, BloombergNEF has a less positive outlook for the American EV market.
Given America’s position in the world, this will undoubtedly impact global electric vehicle sales and hamper worldwide efforts to curb transportation emissions.
In the meantime, China is still the largest EV market and will remain so as it accelerates its transition to electric cars.
BloombergNEF notes that China is the only market where electric cars are, on average, cheaper than similar petrol- and diesel-powered cars.","BloombergNEF has predicted that the global market for electric vehicles (EVs) will grow by 25% in 2025 but forecasts slower short- and long-term growth in the American market. The market research provider recently published its EV sales forecast for the year and revealed relatively optimistic projections for electric vehicle sales.

According to BloombergNEF’s report, cumulative battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales will reach 22 million units in 2025, 25% more than the BEVs and PHEVs sold worldwide last year.

The Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025 report notes that growth in the global EV market will be primarily driven by falling lithium-ion battery prices and a growing lineup of affordable EVs. Unsurprisingly, two-thirds of the projected 2025 sales will occur in China, while Europe and the U.S. will account for 17% and 7% of sales respectively.

As the largest electric vehicle market on the globe, as well as the only country that is mass-producing cheap and affordable electric cars, China has almost all the conditions it needs to achieve widespread electric mobility.

The report projects that 1 in 4 cars sold worldwide in 2025 will either be a plug-in hybrid or a battery electric car, a major milestone for the nascent electric vehicle industry. But while electric cars continue to increase their share of the global passenger vehicle market, BloombergNEF has a less positive outlook for the American EV market.

It states that there has been a ‘notable’ fall in electric vehicle adoption in the U.S. due to the Trump administration’s decisions to phase out federal EV tax credits, repeal fuel economy standards, and challenge California’s ability to set its own tailpipe emission limits. President Donald Trump, who has long spoken against electric cars, renewable energy, and climate action, took the axe to the former administration’s climate-related policies as soon as he assumed office.

Given America’s position in the world, this will undoubtedly impact global electric vehicle sales and hamper worldwide efforts to curb transportation emissions. As per the report, EV sales in the U.S. are projected to increase from an estimated 1.6 million cars this year to 4.1 million units in 2030, a major downgrade from past projections.

In the meantime, China is still the largest EV market and will remain so as it accelerates its transition to electric cars. BloombergNEF notes that China is the only market where electric cars are, on average, cheaper than similar petrol- and diesel-powered cars.

Furthermore, the East Asian market also dwarfs other markets in EV production and manufactured 69% of all the electric cars sold worldwide in 2024. Many Chinese EV makers also enjoy increasing popularity in emerging markets like Brazil and Thailand, BloombergNEF states, enabling less affluent countries to adopt electric cars at higher rates than the U.S.

The projected growth of electric vehicle adoption around the world could attract additional investor attention to firms like SolarBank Corp. (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: GY2) that are working to deepen their battery production deals with EV makers around the world.

He added that global competitors, in particular China, seek to dominate automotive innovation.
That starts with strengthening and modernizing NHTSA.” Bozzella said that the relationship between NHTSA and its chief safety regulator has become fractured.
“With the right reforms, NCAP can promote innovation, encourage continuous safety improvements, and empower consumers with clear, comparable information about vehicle safety,” Bozzella said.
Just as concerning, this program exemplifies a deeper issue: a breakdown in transparency and collaboration between NHTSA and the auto industry.” Partnership no longer exists between the industry and NHTSA, Bozzella said.","A common theme heard during testimony of a Congressional Committee hearing Thursday focused on how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has failed to meet modern expectations.

The hearing “Looking Under the Hood: The State of NHTSA and Motor Vehicle Safety” was held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), committee vice chairman, said the hearing is being held to receive stakeholder input in a bipartisan congressional effort to develop motor vehicle legislation.

“Automobiles are deeply woven into the fabric of American life, from commuting to work, to picking up kids at school, to taking a cross-country road trip,” Fulcher said. “Automobiles are both a cultural icon and a pillar of the American dream.”

Yet, America’s roadways are facing safety concerns, with more than 40,000 dying annually from vehicle collisions.

NHTSA plays a role in the safety of the nation’s roadways through education programs, regulatory work, and enforcement efforts, Fulcher said.

“Congress must make sure that the agency is properly equipped,” Fulcher said.

When evaluating safety standards, Congress must also understand the economic importance of the automotive sector — the largest manufacturing base in the nation, he said.

He added that global competitors, in particular China, seek to dominate automotive innovation. He said the nation needs a regulatory structure that can foster, rather than hinder, the industry.

This includes modernizing or streamlining regulations while maintaining strong safety standards, Fulcher said.

NHTSA must also embrace the future of mobility with autonomous vehicles, including creating a framework for them.

Any motor vehicle legislation created must save lives, strengthen American competitiveness, and shape the future of mobility, Fulcher said.

John Bozzella, Alliance for Automotive Innovation (Auto Innovators) president and CEO, told the committee this is a consequential moment for motor vehicle safety and the future of the American auto industry.

“The global environment in which this industry operates is more complex and uncertain than it has been in decades,” Bozzella said in his written testimony. “The current trade and tariff landscape — combined with ongoing negotiations between the Administration and key trading partners— has introduced instability for our sector. The auto industry is uniquely exposed: our supply chains are global, our lead times are long, and our capital investments are high-risk. As trade policies evolve, it is more important than ever that the domestic regulatory environment is predictable, collaborative, and modernized. That starts with NHTSA.”

He said nations are racing to lead next-generation mobility technologies, including electrification, automation, and connectivity.

“China, in particular, has made massive strategic investments in electric vehicles and battery supply chains, positioning its manufacturers for long-term advantage,” Bozzella said. “Two decades ago, the U.S. was the world’s top auto producer. Today, China manufactures 30 million vehicles annually — compared to roughly 10 million in the U.S. — with one-third of that volume being new energy vehicles. China’s EV production alone now rivals the entire U.S. industry’s output.”

Automakers and suppliers have made unprecedented investments in the U.S. to remain globally competitive, he said. This includes $130 billion in electric vehicle and battery-related projects, and overall, more than $274 billion in U.S. operations over the past 15 years.

“But these investments must be matched by a modern, stable, and forward-looking regulatory framework,” Bozzella said. “If the United States is to remain the global leader in automotive innovation—while preserving affordability, promoting safety, and supporting domestic jobs—we must get our regulatory house in order. That starts with strengthening and modernizing NHTSA.”

Bozzella said that the relationship between NHTSA and its chief safety regulator has become fractured.

“Innovation is being stymied,” Bozzella said. “And as NHTSA struggles to modernize its standards and procedures, the risk grows that the U.S. will fall behind in the global race, ceding leadership to others.”

NHTSA is stifling the industry with decades-old safety regulations and lacks a clear strategic roadmap for emerging technologies, he said.

“The Alliance for Automotive Innovation believes that regulatory reform at NHTSA is one of the most critical levers to ensure American competitiveness,” Bozzella said. “By streamlining outdated rules, embracing a holistic approach to safety, and fostering a more collaborative relationship with industry, NHTSA can unlock innovation, accelerate the deployment of life-saving technologies, and ensure that the next generation of vehicles is designed, engineered, and built here in the United States.”

Bozzella said that today’s vehicles are safer than ever, but overall traffic fatalities remain far too high.

“This disconnect between safer vehicles and persistently high fatalities demands a serious recalibration of our national approach to road safety,” Bozzella said. “It is no longer sufficient to rely on vehicle mandates alone.”

He said a holistic, systemic approach is needed that includes:

Safer vehicles;

Better infrastructure;

Informed and accountable road users;

Stronger enforcement of traffic laws; and

Enhanced post-crash care.

A pathway to modernizing NHTSA begins with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), Bozzella said.

“With the right reforms, NCAP can promote innovation, encourage continuous safety improvements, and empower consumers with clear, comparable information about vehicle safety,” Bozzella said. “But today, NCAP is underperforming. It lags behind similar programs in other countries, hasn’t kept pace with the speed of innovation, and fails to reflect the many technological advancements that are reshaping vehicle safety. Just as concerning, this program exemplifies a deeper issue: a breakdown in transparency and collaboration between NHTSA and the auto industry.”

Partnership no longer exists between the industry and NHTSA, Bozzella said.

“Automakers are making major voluntary safety improvements, yet too often, NHTSA appears indifferent to this progress — issuing proposals in isolation rather than through an iterative, collaborative process,” Bozzella said. “A strong NHTSA is one that works hand-in-hand with industry, not around it. Rebuilding that relationship must start with NCAP.”

He said Auto Innovators recommends the following reforms:

Establish a dedicated NCAP office within NHTSA;

Create a federal advisory committee;

Develop a 10-year NCAP roadmap;

Enable self-reporting by manufacturers; and

Expand consumer education initiatives.

Bozzella also asked for the reforming and modernization of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).

“As automotive technology evolves at a breakneck pace, NHTSA must keep up. Unfortunately, many of the current standards are outdated, overly prescriptive, or simply misaligned with modern vehicle design, safety data, and international best practices,” Bozzella said. “Rather than enabling progress, they increasingly serve as regulatory roadblocks that stifle innovation, delay deployment of life-saving technologies, and erode U.S. leadership in the global auto market, while prices for new cars climb higher.”

Other recommendations include an autonomous vehicle framework for the future and reassessment of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets and penalty rates.

“With the right policies in place and with Congress and regulators working in partnership with industry, we can position the United States not only to win the global race for the future of mobility, but to do so in a way that creates American jobs, enhances the U.S. geopolitical leadership role in the automotive industry and ensures vehicles remain affordable for the families who depend on them,” Bozzella said.

David Harkey, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) president, also told the committee that IIHS is alarmed by the rising toll of crashes and dismayed by an apparent lack of urgency about fixing the problem.

“Despite its many important roles and significant past achievements, NHTSA is failing to meet the moment,” Harkey said. “In recent years, it has approached its job with a lack of urgency, using flawed methodologies that underestimate the safety benefits of obviously beneficial interventions.”

NHTSA sometimes drags its feet even when Congress has directed it to act, Harkey said. He said IIHS has, at times, filled in the gaps where NHTSA fails. But it does not have regulatory authority, and it cannot completely make up for NHTSA’s lack of substantive action, he said.

Jeff Farrah, Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association CEO, said a federal policy framework for AVs is needed to provide U.S. companies the ability to compete in other countries.

“Congress can and should lead the way on a federal policy framework that both answers key questions on vehicle design, construction, and performance and facilitates safer roads, more accessible vehicles, and strengthened supply chains,” Farrah said. “A federal AV policy framework will allow the continued growth of America’s AV industry and ensure we retain leadership over China in a vital emerging technology.”

However, subsequent budget negotiations and federal energy policy changes have put the long-term stability of this credit in question. If Congress does not extend or revise the program again, the credit is scheduled to begin phasing out after 2025, just a few short months away.

After 2025, the credit would drop to 26 percent in 2026, 22 percent in 2027, and then disappear entirely for residential systems starting in 2028.

For homeowners, this means that systems installed after the end of this year may no longer qualify for the full 30 percent benefit. And with potential delays in permitting and installation timelines, waiting until the last minute could mean missing the window altogether.

Rising Fuel Prices Add Urgency

In recent weeks, oil and fuel prices have spiked in response to mounting instability in the Middle East and increasing global tensions. Some experts warn that energy prices could remain volatile for the foreseeable future, especially as hurricane season ramps up and geopolitical pressures intensify.

These factors have led to a surge in interest from homeowners looking to lock in long-term savings through solar energy before the cost of electricity rises further—and before federal incentives begin to disappear.

A Local Perspective

“We’ve definitely seen an uptick in homeowners asking questions and wanting to move quickly,” said Randy from Affordable Solar Services, a state-licensed, locally owned solar contractor based in Brevard County. “People are realizing that not only is the tax credit going away soon, but the cost of doing nothing is going up.”

Affordable Solar Services, which also provides removal and re-installation services after storm damage, says they are increasingly fielding calls from homeowners who had previously postponed solar installation but are now reconsidering in light of rising utility costs and changing federal incentives.

Next Steps for Homeowners

For those considering solar, time is becoming a critical factor. Systems must be fully installed and operational before the end of the year to qualify for the 30 percent credit under current federal guidelines. That means getting estimates, securing financing if needed, and initiating installation well before the December deadline.

Experts recommend working with licensed, insured contractors who are familiar with the permitting process and can help homeowners ensure their system is eligible under IRS guidelines.

Affordable Solar Services is one such company locally offering free consultations to walk homeowners through the process, from financing and design to installation and tax filing requirements.

“The biggest thing we tell people is not to wait until the last minute,” the company said. “Even if you’re just exploring your options, now is the time to ask questions.”",https://thespacecoastrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Solar-Tax-Credit-Expiring-1024x576.png,N,,2025-06-27 21:02:19.863318

Hello and welcome to Eco Report.

Today on the program, we have award winning screenwriter Angelo Pizzo, whose film ‘Hoosiers’, about a small town basketball team winning the Indiana state championship, has been honored as the best sports film of all time. He speaks with us today about preserving our state’s natural heritage.

And now for your environmental reports:

For decades, utilities disposed of coal ash — the hazardous substance left after burning coal for energy — by dumping it in unlined ponds and landfills. Kentucky has 68 coal ash dumpsites.

Kentucky is one of the nation’s top coal ash-generating states, ranking fourth in ash production in 2020.

In Illinois, the number of active and inactive coal ash ponds in 2025 is not explicitly stated in the provided search results, but the total is approximately 70. The state has regulations and ongoing efforts to address coal ash disposal and environmental impact.

In 2025, Michigan is seeing both the continued environmental challenge of coal ash and innovative solutions for its remediation. While some coal plants are facing closure and coal ash is being removed and repurposed, others are being kept open by federal orders, leading to concerns about pollution and grid reliability.

Ohio has a significant issue with coal ash disposal, ranking as one of the top coal ash-generating states and facing widespread groundwater contamination from its coal ash ponds and landfills.

Heavy rains this April flooded parts of central and southern Indiana. Fortunately, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management said it didn’t receive any reports of damage to the state’s coal ash ponds.

Indiana is home to more than 73 million cubic yards of coal ash stored on at least 16 sites that lack a liner. There are about 65 coal ash ponds with liners according to data compiled by Earthjustice in 2022 based on companies’ own reporting required under federal rules. For the ponds without liners, that’s the equivalent of more than 22,000 Olympic swimming pools.

A recent pact between North Dakota and the Trump administration shows how coal-friendly states could enshrine lax standards and block future federal enforcement on toxic coal ash pollution.

North Dakota earned preliminary approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month to regulate coal ash — a byproduct of burning coal — at the state instead of federal level. Indiana environmentalists fear that their state will follow the same path.

Picking a state outside the Midwest reveals a different mentality. In New York, there are 12 known coal ash dumpsites, with at least 8 regulated coal ash disposal sites and 4 legacy ponds and inactive landfills. The exact number may be higher, as utilities were not required to report all such sites. The EPA issued a new rule in 2024 requiring power plants to clean up their toxic coal ash.

Advocates say it could go bust without incentives | WUNC,Michael Copley,,,,,https://www.wunc.org/2025-06-27/solar-manufacturing-is-booming-advocates-say-it-could-go-bust-without-incentives,"A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States.
On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.
Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.
But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term.
However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand.","A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.

Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.

""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Reams' group has called for lawmakers to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""

Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.

""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""

With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.

""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese.""

UBS maintains a long-term price forecast of $77/lb (real 2025) and $81/lb nominal from 2030.

Uranium spot prices...

Ariyasinghe's stock views within the industry:

Paladin Energy (PDN): Maintains a BUY rating with price target lifted 3% to A$9.40/share. Restart at the Langer Heinrich mine is ahead of schedule; FY26 production revised slightly down to 4.5Mlb due to blending lower-grade ore, but this is offset by higher prices and improved costs.

Boss Energy (BOE): Downgraded to SELL despite production success at Honeymoon mine and a 6% price target increase to A$3.50/share. UBS views the stock as overvalued after an 81% YTD rally and cites risks in long-term growth clarity, wellfield geology, and expansion capex.

Among the rollbacks proposed are a pause on developing the price gouging penalty rule enacted by the legislature in 2023 and increased oil well permitting in Kern County.

The groups pointed to new state data showing oil refiners making a killing off California consumers – with a combined gross refining margin and distribution margin of $1.71 in April, twice the national and historical averages.

""California oil refiners do not need a bailout. New data posted by the California Energy Commission shows oil refiners made a retail gross refining profit margin of $1.02 per gallon in April,"" the groups wrote in the letter. ""In addition, the data shows that the distribution margin, which includes the Mystery Gasoline Surcharge, was .69 cents per gallon in April. Combined these extraordinary profit and overhead costs add more to a gallon of gasoline than the cost of crude oil, as CEC created graphic below shows.""

""California's oil refining and distribution sector are charging Californians more than double what they take in elsewhere. It would be perverse to give this industry more subsidies.""

The groups include:

""We urge you, instead, to insist that the Administration finish the job it started and that the legislature directed it to do in special sessions in 2023 and 2024: propound rules for a price gouging penalty, finalize and enforce the ABX2-1 re-supply inventory rule and begin the minimum inventory rule-making. In addition, we call on you to reject rollbacks to refinery process safety management (PSM) rules which protect refinery workers and communities while preventing sudden outages that trigger price shocks.""

The gross margins are what the refiners keep after the cost of crude oil, environmental fees, and taxes are deducted. The only refiner cost included in the gross margin is the operating costs for the refinery, which are reported by the refiners to the SEC at about 20 cents per gallon.

Everything about it is massive.

The $10 billion project, one of the largest private investments in the state's history, will construct a 4-million-square-foot facility — about the size of 70 football fields — outside tiny Holly Ridge in Northeast Louisiana.

Entergy will be providing the flow of electricity needed to keep the AI center up and running. The facility - on 2800 acres of Richland Parish farmland rapidly being reconfigured by hundreds of earth-moving machines and eventually 5,000 construction workers- will require three new Entergy power plants to feed it.

“Two will be on this site, and one in South Louisiana, and we we're doing that sort of balance the system, to optimize how we construct and serve that load, to minimize how much we need to spend, how much Meta will need to spend to support all of this,” said Entergy CEO Phillip May.

Step one is the Smalling substation. Though “small” may be in the name, May says it will be anything but.

“We haven't said how large our project is, but it's the largest project, maybe the largest electric service agreement in the history of the electric utility industry.”

Four high voltage 500kV transmission lines, 14 single phase auto transformers each weighing about 300 tons; each detail of the project May shared with those at the groundbreaking showed the project's complexity and sheer size.

“This will be the largest substation in terms of load surging capability that we have ever taken on,” he said.

Amperical Solutions, headquartered in Covington, is the contractor hired to make it all work.

“It’s the world’s biggest machine,” said Matthew Saacks, Amperical’s CEO, about the U.S. energy grid he will be working with. “What a lot of people fail to realize, what makes it more unique than anything else is you can't store it so, unlike liquids, unlike natural gas, unlike physical product, everything that is being generated has to exactly match the load at every microsecond, every day, and so it's just challenging.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/shreveportbossieradvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/64/864a2db6-b9f1-5cb1-a8e0-944286309b38/685ef601db503.image.jpg?crop=1598%2C839%2C436%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-27 21:03:30.138558

Hotels offering EV infrastructure report increased guest loyalty

New Infrastructure Alternatives Emerges to Meet Rising Demands of USA’s Hotels Electric Vehicle Requirements.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, UNITED STATES, June 27, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- It has been one year since updates to the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen Title 24) were released on July 1, 2024. Last year's update requires new hotels to equip 50% of parking lots with EV charging infrastructure. However, given the time these development projects take, we have yet to witness the full impact of these stringent new electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure mandates. The updates specifically require new hotels and motels to equip 40% of parking spaces with EV-ready infrastructure, using either standard outlets or Level 2 chargers, and provide Level 2 chargers for the remaining 10% of parking spaces. Further increases anticipated in 2026 add significant urgency for developers and hotel operators looking to stay competitive in EV hotspots.

Consumer trends strongly support these mandates. In regions such as Santa Clara County, EV adoption rates have surpassed 40%. With the growing popularity of electric vehicles, guest expectations for accessible, reliable EV charging options are becoming critical, influencing hotel selection and satisfaction.

A recently opened hotel near Sacramento’s Exposition Blvd, permitted under the older 2019 code, underscores a regulatory gap. Despite its 180 rooms, this property provides only 12 EV charging spots, far fewer than the roughly 90 spaces mandated under current 2024 standards. In a recent email thread city building officials recognize this gap between previously approved projects and current EV requirements, emphasizing urgency for hotels planning new developments to quickly align with updated regulations.

Meeting these requirements with current popular solutions, such as what is recommended by flagship brands introduces substantial financial and logistical burdens astraditional Level 2 chargers typically cost between $3,000 and $4,000 per port. Besides significant upfront expenses, these charging stations require ongoing maintenance, including cable replacements and inspections. Maintenance issues can negatively affect guest experiences, creating dissatisfaction hotels strive to avoid.

To mitigate these challenges, hotels are exploring Alternative EV Supply Equipment (Alternative EVSE). This category includes smart outlets enabling guests to utilize personal portable chargers. These solutions significantly reduce costs, simplify installation, and minimize maintenance. Despite clear advantages, smart outlets face regulatory hurdles from California’s Department of Food and Agriculture’s Division of Measurement Standards (CDFA-DMS). Without certification allowing resale of metered electricity, adoption remains limited, creating substantial barriers to implementation.

San Jose-based startup Evolve Energy is developing smart outlet-based EV charging technology tailored specifically for the hospitality sector. The company plans to initiate a pilot project in summer 2025, aiming to refine its solution into a fully compliant, scalable product suited to hospitality operators' unique needs. To accelerate development and address the existing technology gap in hospitality EV charging infrastructure, Evolve Energy anticipates raising a funding round in late summer 2025.California’s building codes provide flexibility, allowing hotels to substitute five Level 2 chargers with one Level 3 charger. However, Level 3 chargers, costing 20 to 30 times more than Level 2 chargers, rarely align with typical overnight guest charging behaviors. Thus, practical application remains limited, emphasizing the need for scalable, economically feasible charging options.

Hilton’s recent industry trends report highlights the pressing nature of EV infrastructure demands. Competition and market dynamics further illustrate this importance. A JD Power survey found 19% of hotel guests actively seek EV charging availability, significantly influencing booking decisions. Currently, 30% of U.S. hotels provide EV charging: approximately 90% of luxury hotels, 58% of full-service hotels, and just 20% of limited-service properties. Hotels offering EV infrastructure report increased guest loyalty and new revenue streams tied to charger availability, pressuring those without EV chargers to quickly adapt or risk losing competitiveness.

As California accelerates its electrification agenda, hospitality providers must swiftly adapt. The challenge is no longer deciding whether to provide EV infrastructure but how to implement solutions affordably, effectively, and without negatively impacting guest experiences. Travelers should anticipate increased availability of alternative solutions such as smart EV outlets in hotel parking facilities and pack their mobile chargers for convenience.

The long-term move away from coal generation has been remarkably consistent, averaging about 10,000 megawatts of capacity closures annually.

Renewables and dispatchable battery storage in the electricity market

IEEFA’s research has consistently shown that strong demand growth and a renewable energy transition can go hand in hand. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s hourly grid monitor, total U.S. generation from utility-scale wind and solar has increased 298.8 million megawatt-hours since 2019, easily exceeding the growth in overall U.S. power demand.

IEEFA has shown that Texas in particular provides an excellent example of a rapidly transitioning energy grid. The growth in solar generation, coupled with the system’s existing wind capacity, is reshaping the ERCOT grid, which supplies 90% of the load in Texas—even as it continues to grow. In March of 2024, for example, solar generation topped coal’s output for the first time in any month. In addition to solar’s growth, the rapid development of dispatchable battery storage capacity within ERCOT has added greatly to system reliability, even with demand increases due to heat waves in the summer of 2024.

Solar has played a significant role in the energy transition in Puerto Rico as well. Residents and businesses have moved rapidly to install rooftop solar and storage in recent years to improve their resiliency in the face of an unreliable power system.

The coal industry is in decline

While renewables and dispatchable battery storage are taking hold in the electricity market, the coal industry is clearly in structural decline. Based on current announcements and research, IEEFA expects operating coal capacity to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade, pushing the total down to about 112,000 MW in 2030. In 2024, IEEFA reported on the planned closure of the last coal plant in New England, marking a significant milestone in the region’s energy transition. Coal closures continue to sweep the Southeast, and solar continues to compete with coal in Texas, topping coal’s output for the first time in any month in March of 2024.

Much of the currently operating coal capacity is also nearing expected operational lifespans. Even remaining coal plants are likely to operate significantly less frequently, continuing another decade-plus trend that has seen the capacity factor at operating coal plants fall steadily since 2011.

What federal programs are supporting rural renewable energy development?","Renewable energy policies are turning rural America into multi-million-dollar economic powerhouses. Electric cooperatives serve 13% of the US electricity load and lead this rural energy transformation. These cooperatives include 832 distribution co-ops and 63 generation and transmission co-ops that power most of rural America, including over 90% of the country’s persistent poverty counties.

A complete renewable energy policy creates new opportunities for economic growth in these regions. Clean energy policy could bring $4.8 billion to Arkansas and $4.2 billion to North Dakota through new wind and solar projects. The retirement of Ohio’s 1,265 MW Cardinal coal plant could generate nearly $2 billion through over 4,000 MW of wind and solar development. Florida’s numbers look promising too. The Seminole coal plant could lead to 4,400 MW of solar projects that would pump $2.3 billion into rural communities.

The numbers tell a compelling story. A $10 billion investment to support co-ops’ green energy policy implementation could generate over $50 billion in economic development. These energy initiatives create high-skilled, well-paying jobs and reduce energy costs for residents and businesses. Farmers receive steady income through land leases for renewable projects. European Commission estimates suggest that by 2030, citizen-led energy communities could own up to 17% of wind and 21% of solar power. This shows a growing trend in community-driven solutions.

This piece explores how renewable energy policies will build $100 million rural economies in 2025. We look at federal initiatives, economic models, and the vital transition from coal to clean energy in cooperative territories.

Federal Renewable Energy Policies Driving Rural Investment

The federal government has released unprecedented financial support to develop rural renewable energy through targeted policies and programs. Rural communities that were once overlooked are now becoming economic powerhouses in 2025, thanks to these initiatives.

The Inflation Reduction Act serves as the lifeblood of these efforts with historic provisions designed for rural communities. The USDA’s Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program has allocated $9.7 billion in grants and loans. Electric cooperatives can use these funds to purchase or build new clean energy systems. The program gives co-ops the flexibility to invest in renewable energy, storage, and transmission efficiency improvements based on their specific needs.

The Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program offers $1 billion in partially forgivable loans to renewable energy developers and electric service providers. The USDA has put more than $1.6 billion in PACE program funds to work on clean energy projects that serve rural Americans.

Rural cooperatives have seen a significant change through the direct-pay tax credit provision. A co-op CEO put it simply: “Without direct-pay, investment in rural America was being stifled”. Tax-exempt co-ops can now receive payments equivalent to tax credits for clean energy projects, putting them on par with investor-owned utilities.

The economic effects are significant. The USDA announced clean energy investments exceeding $6 billion through these programs. Rural electric cooperatives have pledged to build or purchase more than 13 gigawatts of clean energy. The USDA has awarded about $14.5 billion in grants and loans that benefit 35 states.

These policies fund various projects:

Solar, wind, and battery storage systems

Community solar projects serving neighborhood families

Electric vehicle charging infrastructure

Biofuel-related infrastructure

These investments stimulate job creation, reduce energy costs, and make the grid more resilient in rural areas. The scale of federal support shows a steadfast dedication to rural communities. They are not just keeping pace with the clean energy transition but becoming centers of economic growth through renewable energy development.

Economic Modeling of $100M Rural Growth Scenarios

Renewable energy investments are bringing significant economic value to rural communities. These communities can now reach $100 million in local economic activity. Different revenue streams work together to build thriving rural economies.

Farmers and ranchers who host wind turbines get substantial land lease payments. These payments are the lifeblood of economic change in rural areas. Wind farms pay out $245 million annually to these landowners. States like Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas see landowners receiving $10 million annually from wind leases. Solar development brings even better returns. Farmers can earn $1,000 per acre, which is much higher than the national average of $146 for non-irrigated cropland.

Property tax growth plays a vital role in this development. The small town of Colfax, Illinois, with just 1,000 residents, saw its property tax base jump from $61 million in 2006 to $102 million in 2008. Local schools used this money for new projects and stayed strong during tough economic times. Renewable projects now generate $1.7 billion annually in various taxes nationwide.

New jobs complete this economic success story. Wind projects of 100 megawatt size create 80-100 jobs during construction. These projects need 2-16 full-time workers to operate and maintain them over their 30+ year lifespan. Local businesses like hotels, restaurants, and services also see more customers during construction.

Investment capital powers these economic benefits. Iowa has attracted $25 billion in renewable energy investments. Michigan follows with $8 billion. The United States’ total stands at an impressive $499 billion in renewable energy investments.

Rural electric cooperatives now lead the way in renewable energy adoption. Kalona’s Farmers Electric Cooperative generates 15 percent of its power from solar. This shows how local energy control keeps economic benefits within rural communities.

Transitioning from Coal to Clean Energy in Co-op Territories

Rural American electric cooperatives are beginning a historic change from coal-fired power plants to renewable energy systems. These co-ops heavily depend on coal, and their customers just need to deal with high energy bills and major health and environmental effects. All the same, 2025 will be a crucial year as electric generators plan to retire 12.3 gigawatts of capacity. This represents a 65% increase in retirements compared with 2024, and coal makes up 66% of planned retirements.

The Biden Administration’s USDA programs have sped up this switch through strategic collaborations. Rural Colorado co-ops received a combined $800 million in New ERA and PACE funding, making Colorado the state with the most recipients. The Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association got $679 million to retire coal units in three states and purchase 1,480 megawatts of wind, solar, and battery storage.

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) now serve as the technological foundation of this transition. These systems improve energy resilience by storing excess energy and releasing it when people just need it most. This reduces rural areas’ dependence on diesel generators. Of course, these systems work well—the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia has handled grid instability in milliseconds since 2017, which saved millions in stabilization costs.

Ohio’s Buckeye Power shows this transition through its Cardinal coal plant. The company spent $1 billion on environmental controls over 20 years, but now plans to shut down Cardinal Unit 3 by 2028’s end. Xcel Energy will also close Comanche 2 in Colorado and convert its 505MW Pawnee unit from coal to gas.

Progress continues, but challenges exist. Co-ops serve 92% of counties with persistent poverty, where low-income households pay up to three times more than their higher-income neighbors for energy. Clean energy transitions aim to create affordable, reliable power systems that boost economic growth in America’s struggling rural communities.

Conclusion

Renewable energy policies have turned rural America into economic powerhouses worth $100 million and beyond. This piece shows how federal initiatives, economic modeling, and the shift from coal to clean energy create new opportunities for overlooked communities.

Rural renaissance has electric cooperatives at its vanguard. The Inflation Reduction Act’s $9.7 billion Rural America initiative and the $1 billion PACE program have stimulated this growth. Direct-pay tax credits have leveled the playing field for rural co-ops, which led to 13 gigawatts of clean energy commitments in 35 states.

Economic benefits flow through many channels. Farmers now earn $1,000 per acre from solar installations, compared to $146 from traditional cropland rentals. Wind farms generate $245 million in lease payments nationwide each year. Property tax bases have grown substantially – Colfax, Illinois’s values jumped from $61 million to $102 million after wind development. Each 100-megawatt project brings 80-100 construction jobs plus permanent maintenance positions.

The shift away from coal marks a vital part of rural America’s economic revival. Electric cooperatives serve 92% of persistent poverty counties and now deploy renewable alternatives with battery storage systems faster than ever. We have a long way to go, but we can build on this progress, especially for low-income households that pay higher energy costs.

This change means more than environmental progress – it brings economic justice to rural America. These communities now lead the renewable energy revolution after decades of neglect. Rural economies reaching $100 million by 2025 show what happens when smart policy meets local determination. These soaring wins are the foundations for other communities seeking economic revitalization through renewable energy development.

In collaboration with energy services provider Ameresco and manufacturing partner Branch Technology, the Army is testing advanced 3D printing methods to improve building energy performance and reduce operational costs.

The initiative is supported by the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) and marks one of the first large-scale military applications of custom 3D-printed insulation panels. These panels are designed using Branch’s Cellular Fabrication (C-Fab®) process, which begins with a digital scan of existing building surfaces and ends with precisely manufactured insulation components tailored to fit complex architectural details.

This kind of precision allows the Army to sidestep the inefficiencies of off-the-shelf insulation solutions, particularly in older structures where standard materials often fall short. The retrofit project at Detroit Arsenal will address approximately 6,250 square feet of building envelope, with estimated energy efficiency improvements of up to 50%. That’s not just a boost for operational performance—it also supports the military’s ongoing push to meet federal sustainability goals.

Testing Innovation Before Scaling Across Federal Facilities

To validate performance, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is constructing a parallel 300-square-foot test installation at its research facility in Colorado. The monitored demo will collect real-world data on energy savings, installation complexity, and long-term value—key benchmarks that could guide future military infrastructure planning.

While the Detroit Arsenal retrofit is still in early stages, its inclusion in Ameresco’s 2025 federal project backlog signals growing momentum around these types of collaborative efforts.

""This bill would make it harder for the state to keep people’s drinking water clean from PFAS and other dangerous chemicals, their air free from toxic pollutants, and their health care facilities providing high quality care,"" Stein wrote.

House Bill 402 requires:

The General Assembly to ratify any rule that is deemed to have a cost of at least $20 million over a five-year period.

A board or commission to pass by a two-thirds vote any rule that is deemed to have an economic impact of at least $1 million over a five-year period.

A board or commission to pass unanimously any rule that is deemed to have an economic impact of at least $10 million over a five-year period.

Agencies to prepare a fiscal note describing the impact of any rule or regulation that would have an impact of $1 million over a five-year period, up from $1 million over a one-year period.

It also prevents agencies from measuring the potential benefits of a regulation when considering which level of scrutiny is required.

The REINS Act would apply to new rules, but the boards and commission thresholds would also apply to existing rules that are already on the state's books. In 2013, legislative Republicans passed a law requiring state agencies to review every regulation once in a 10-year period.

Effectively, the REINS Act would give legislative Republicans the ability to thwart or scale back rules and regulations that are already part of state law, so long as they meet certain thresholds.

The REINS Act passed the House with votes from three Democrats who have reputations for siding with Republicans on some controversial measures. Those include Rep. Cecil Brockman, D-Guilford, Rep. Carla Cunningham, D-Mecklenburg and Rep. Shelly Willingham, D-Edgecombe.

Those lawmakers will be the focus when considering a veto override in the House. In that chamber, Republicans need at least one Democrat to join them on an override vote if every lawmaker is present.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand.","A couple of years ago, Mick McDaniel started a company in Indianapolis to make solar panels in the United States. Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.

Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.

""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

“We can’t make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,” said Johnson.
But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.
Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York said Friday he hasn’t “seen a deal to which I can say yes.”","A day after Mr. Trump hosted an event at the White House to pressure lawmakers to pass the bill that includes tax cuts and funding for his border and national security priorities, the president signaled he’s open to Republicans’ self-imposed deadline slipping past July 4.

“It’s important, it’s not the end-all,” Mr. Trump told reporters Friday about the deadline. “We’d like to get it done by that time, if possible.”

Later in the day, Mr. Trump changed the goal posts again, posting on Truth Social that it “must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also acknowledged the date may slide past the holiday, but said “I don’t want to even accept that as an option right now.”

“We’ll see,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota, said Friday afternoon when asked if Mr. Trump’s initial comments on the timeline bought him more time to get the package through the Senate.

Senators expect to begin voting on the bill Saturday, but have yet to release the final legislative text. The parliamentarian is continuing to determine which provisions comport with the rules governing the reconciliation process that allow Republicans to pass it with a simple majority.

“That’s aspirational,” Thune said about holding the first test vote midday Saturday, noting that they are still waiting on the parliamentarian to advise on a number of issues.

The Senate leader also wasn’t certain whether he had the votes to advance the legislation.

“We’ll find out tomorrow,” Thune said.

House Democratic leadership issued guidance to members that votes are not expected over the weekend in the lower chamber and members would receive 48 hours notice before any potential votes next week.

“We can’t make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,” said Johnson. “I’m going to give all of my members plenty of time to digest that. The House will not be jammed by anything. I made that commitment.”

Johnson said members would have 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote.

The Senate parliamentarian’s guidance has delivered several blows to key GOP provisions, including an effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and a plan to lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs.

Republicans have already struggled to reach a consensus on the provider tax as a handful of senators have expressed concern about the effects it could have on rural hospitals.

Other recent ruled-out provisions include rolling back regulations on gun silencers, a religious carveout from an expansion of the college endowment tax, a $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and fees on diversity immigrant visas.

But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.

One such provision that received a green light from MacDonough was a revised plan to push some of the costs of food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto states. The benefits are currently funded by the federal government. The revision gives states more flexibility in calculating what their cost share requirement will be beginning in 2028.

The parliamentarian also approved a revision on a proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance “as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.”

Meanwhile, House Republicans have drawn red lines on issues including the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and clean energy tax credits. Blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support for the bill before it passed the House in May if the SALT cap was not increased from $10,000. They ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000.

Johnson said he believed the blue-state Republicans would ultimately get on board with a proposal that would set the cap at $40,000 for five years and then revert back to $10,000.

The Company reported net income of $1,712,368, or $0.81 per diluted share, a 27% increase compared to fiscal 2024.

Operating revenues for fiscal 2025 were $7,358,066, an 11% increase when compared to fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas production volumes and partially offset by a decrease in the average sale prices of oil and natural gas. Natural gas prices have been low due to limited pipeline capacities in the Permian Basin. For the year ended March 31, 2025, the average realized price for oil was $73.54 per barrel and the average realized price for natural gas was $1.70 per thousand cubic feet.

The Company participated in the drilling of 35 horizontal wells at a cost of approximately $1,100,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, of which 17 are to be completed this fiscal year. Twenty-nine of these wells are in the Delaware Basin located in the western portion of the Permian Basin in Lea and Eddy Counties, New Mexico. The Company also expended approximately $300,000, the balance required to complete 19 horizontal wells which were drilled during fiscal 2024.

In addition to the above working interests, there were 120 gross wells (.09 net wells) drilled by other operators on the Company’s royalty interests. Approximately 31% of the fiscal 2025 operating revenues were produced from royalties free of operational costs to Mexco.

The Company currently expects to participate in the drilling of 27 and completion of 17 horizontal wells at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $1.2 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, of which approximately $300,000 has been expended to date. The Company is evaluating other prospects for participation during this fiscal year.

The Company’s estimated present value of proved reserves at March 31, 2025 was approximately $23 million based on estimated future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum, pricing and other assumptions set forth in “Item 2 – Properties” of Form 10-K. The Company’s estimated proved oil reserves at March 31, 2025 decreased 15% to 675 thousand barrels of oil and natural gas reserves decreased 4% to 4.360 billion cubic feet compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased prices of oil and natural gas in the past fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, oil constituted approximately 51% of the Company’s total proved reserves and approximately 86% of the Company’s oil and gas sales.

The President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company said, “We have approximately $2.2 million cash on hand, no outstanding indebtedness on our bank line of credit and are actively seeking opportunities.��

Throughout the year, the Company acquired various royalty and mineral interests in 840 gross wells (2.31 net wells) primarily in Adams, Broomfield and Weld Counties, Colorado; DeSoto Parish, Louisiana; Eddy County, New Mexico; Karnes, Live Oak, Reagan, Reeves and Upton Counties, Texas; Laramie County, Wyoming; and, multiple counties in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Montana, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. These and other related expenditures were funded from cash on hand.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program was established in 2021 by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) for the purpose of building out a national network of EV charging stations. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is administering the program in coordination with the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation. Each state plus DC and Puerto Rico was apportioned a share of the program’s $4.155 billion total budget to build EV charging infrastructure in accordance with the program’s rules.

Federal regulations dictated many of the program requirements to the states, including charging station characteristics, and a requirement for the states to first fully build out charging throughout their designated Alternative Fuel Corridors before installing chargers in other areas. However, much of the procurement process, including the timing of RFPs for building the charging stations was left in the hands of the states. To receive its allocation, each state was required to submit a NEVI Deployment Plan to the Joint Office as well as annual updates to the plan.

In February 2025, the FHWA notified the states that it was reviewing the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI program, and would be updating its Program Guidance to align with the current Department of Transportation policy and priorities. It aimed to have a draft version of the Program Guidance published in the Spring, but as of June 2025, it is not publicly available. Until such time as the Final Program Guidance is available, FHWA has suspended approval of all state NEVI plans for all fiscal years and informed states that they may not make any new awards under the program. While the NEVI program is frozen in place, states may continue honoring awards they issued prior to FHWA’s February notice. This pause gives us an opportunity to assess NEVI’s impact to date, and the progress the states have made in building out their charging networks.

Status of NEVI Contracting (June 2025)

Twelve states have yet to grant an award. Ten of these states never issued an RFP, while Idaho and Washington issued their first RFPs just before the FHWA announcement was published and are unlikely to issue awards while awaiting further guidance from FHWA. The remaining 38 states plus Puerto Rico and DC have all issued awards through at least one RFP. In some cases, a state’s awards may be conditional or provisional pending final agreement on contracting terms or other factors. The analysis presented here assumes all projects that have been selected through an RFP process are receiving awards. There are also minor gaps in this analysis where complete information is not publicly available.

In November 2024, the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation announced that there were 126 NEVI-funded public charging ports in operation across 31 charging stations in 9 states. Since then, new NEVI-funded charging stations in Michigan, Texas, and Wisconsin have pushed the total to 12 states, 36 NEVI stations, and 148 ports.

See the status of NEVI RFPs by State here.

It is unclear what the future holds for the NEVI program. To date, states have awarded grants totaling more than $670 million, representing just over 16% of the total allocated by Congress. In May 2025, 17 states filed a complaint with federal courts arguing that the FHWA acted unlawfully in revoking all state NEVI plans and withholding funds. The Government Accountability Office also weighed in on the issue in May, issuing a ruling that the FHWA violated the Impoundment Control Act in withholding funding. This is all happening while the FHWA still has not released its updated program guidance, so it is still not known what outcome they seek. However, if this is the end of the NEVI program, we can still expect the installation of more than 900 additional charging stations and 4,000 charging ports as work is completed on the existing awards.",https://nccleantech.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-NCCETC-logo-No-Text-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-28 03:03:22.224239

I had the pleasure of visiting Boviet Solar, a global solar photovoltaic module manufacturer, at the opening of its first United States manufacturing facility in Greenville, NC in the spring of 2025.

According to Marco Marques, General Manager of Boviet’s Greenville plant, the plant will initially support up to 450 direct jobs in module assembly, and will later add as many as 900 jobs in solar cell manufacturing, for a total of 1,300 jobs created.

Zhaochun “Jimmy” Xie, CEO of Boviet Solar, told the audience assembled for the opening that the reasons they selected Greenville, North Carolina for their first U.S. manufacturing facility was that our state’s forward looking energy vision, location near point of use and filled workforce.

Boviet’s initial investment in the facility is close to $200 million, and the ultimate investment will be $294 million. As we toured the module assembly area, we learned that the two lines have the capacity to produce as many as 10,000 modules per day, for an annual total of 2 gigawatts.

The Company currently expects to participate in the drilling of 27 and completion of 17 horizontal wells at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $1.2 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, of which approximately $300,000 has been expended to date. The Company is evaluating other prospects for participation during this fiscal year.

The Company’s estimated present value of proved reserves at March 31, 2025 was approximately $23 million based on estimated future net revenues discounted at 10% per annum, pricing and other assumptions set forth in “Item 2 – Properties” of Form 10-K. The Company’s estimated proved oil reserves at March 31, 2025 decreased 15% to 675 thousand barrels of oil and natural gas reserves decreased 4% to 4.360 billion cubic feet compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased prices of oil and natural gas in the past fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, oil constituted approximately 51% of the Company’s total proved reserves and approximately 86% of the Company’s oil and gas sales.

The President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company said, “We have approximately $2.2 million cash on hand, no outstanding indebtedness on our bank line of credit and are actively seeking opportunities.”

Throughout the year, the Company acquired various royalty and mineral interests in 840 gross wells (2.31 net wells) primarily in Adams, Broomfield and Weld Counties, Colorado; DeSoto Parish, Louisiana; Eddy County, New Mexico; Karnes, Live Oak, Reagan, Reeves and Upton Counties, Texas; Laramie County, Wyoming; and, multiple counties in Nebraska, North and South Dakota, and Montana, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.0 million. These and other related expenditures were funded from cash on hand.

Open Letter From US Energy Investors

To Members of Congress and the American Public,

Thank you for your commitment to strengthening America’s energy leadership and rebuilding our nation’s industrial base and supply chains. As you know, low-cost, reliable, and abundant energy is fundamental to America’s economic competitiveness and national security.

We are a group of more than 70 energy investors representing hundreds of billions in capital committed to building America’s energy future. As Congress considers changes to the tax code through the budget reconciliation process, we write to express concern over proposals that would undermine American energy production and manufacturing, and to urge you to protect what is working and pursue improvements to unleash more energy, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation.

We commend the Senate for incorporating key improvements to the House-passed budget reconciliation bill, which—as written—would raise American households’ annual energy bills by a combined $170 billion and reduce cumulative GDP by $1.1 trillion during the budget window, eliminate 790,000 jobs in 2035, and forgo 330 gigawatts of new electricity capacity by 2035.

We support the Senate’s revisions, including preserving transferability and aligning the credits to a commence construction timeline, which will safeguard projects important to meeting near-term demand and manufacturing goals. We strongly urge that the final bill also include the following changes to address provisions that would cause uncertainty and instability in the energy and financial sectors.

Narrow the definition of “effective control” and clarify rules around material assistance and cost ratio rules within Foreign Entities of Concern (“FEOC”) restrictions.

Keep Sections 45Y and 48E for wind and solar projects through 2030 based on the ‘commence construction’ timeline.

Delay the sunset of the 25D Residential Solar Credit until the end of 2027 and restore 48E access for third-party ownership and financing for wind and solar.

These changes will help ensure the final bill does not unintentionally undermine American companies and drive investments abroad. They’ll help keep energy costs low for American households and businesses.

The current approach, while improved, sends the wrong signal to the market and does not provide enough time to ensure responsible compliance. It would abruptly roll back investment and production tax credits that have catalyzed hundreds of billions in private capital to quickly bring electricity to the grid and reshore manufacturing. This sudden change in policy creates financial uncertainty for American energy companies at a time when the country needs more energy than ever.

This is an economic, security, and geopolitical issue. If the U.S. abandons its domestic energy markets now, we risk ceding future leadership in energy, innovation, AI, and critical infrastructure. The bill’s current structure would weaken our hand in a global economic race we can—and must—win. The AI race will be won by 2030, and we must deploy all sources of energy available to support the United States in that effort.

Investors and relevant businesses are creating American jobs, using American steel, building American-made inverters, and generating more energy security, not less. They are producing resilient, affordable power throughout the country and building a grid capable of supporting both our industrial economy and our national defense. We need to give them the tools to keep going, not slow them down.

We look forward to working with Congress to ensure the final bill strengthens domestic supply chains and secures American energy independence.

Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement that the court's decision was a ""meaningful win"" for farmers.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- A federal court vacated a 2024 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule the Texas Corn Producers, Texas Sorghum Producers and the National Sorghum producers contend unfairly penalized ethanol in federal fuel-economy calculations.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sided with the ag groups this week, ruling against EPA's use of an ""Ra factor"" when certifying fuel economy in newer vehicles. The Biden administration implemented the factor for E10 gasoline in 2024, which replaced the use of E0 in testing with E10. The court found the value set for E10 was ""arbitrarily low"" and penalized ethanol.

The nature of test fuels is important because it affects measured fuel-economy values, essentially determining whether automakers meet fuel-economy standards.

The ag groups argued the EPA's use of a 0.81 factor undervalued ethanol's contribution to fuel economy. The groups contend that a factor closer to 1 was more accurate.

A low Ra factor for ethanol essentially pushed automakers to adopt more electric-vehicle and higher-efficiency engine technologies, rather than using ethanol to comply with the standards.

""EPA's Ra Rule is unreasonable and unreasonably explained,"" the Fifth Circuit said in its ruling. ""The agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act by ignoring comments that flagged flaws in EPA's determination of the Ra factor. We therefore grant the petition for review and vacate the challenged portion of the Ra rule.""

The court also took the agency to task for not considering public and industry input in conducting a rulemaking.

""EPA offered zero response to extensive comments about the test program's insufficient sample size,"" the Fifth Circuit said. ""That is fatal to the rule because those comments, 'if true and adopted,' would require a change to the rule.""

The court criticized EPA's ""half-hearted defense"" of the rule as ""lipstick on a pig,"" concluding the agency ""identifies no evidence to support (its) 'trust-us-we're-the-experts' response.""

Tim Lust, CEO of the National Sorghum Producers, said in a statement that the court's decision was a ""meaningful win"" for farmers.

""The court's ruling restores fairness and transparency to how ethanol is treated in fuel economy rules and holds the government accountable to sound science,"" he said.

David Gibson, executive director of the Texas Corn Producers, said ethanol should be considered by the EPA as a solution to clean air.

""This ruling ensures ethanol isn't penalized by flawed methodology and it gives the current EPA administration a fresh opportunity to get this right,"" Gibson said.

Wayne Cleveland, executive director of Texas Sorghum Producers, said the court ""affirmed what growers have long said, that the science matters and so does the way agencies engage with it.""

That would be great news for the energy industry ahead of the hard (or maybe soft, like some tacos) deadline on the 90-day pause on his “Liberation Day” tariffs that caused all sorts of uncertainty in supply chains and project timelines. As many have relayed to Factor This, the scale of the duties is not as significant as the confidence in accurately predicting how much something is going to cost you and when you’ll be able to get it built.

Frankly, this needs to get sorted out, like, yesterday. Accelerating generation and transmission buildout in the United States needs to be a top priority, especially considering how some regional grids are already struggling with summer temperatures. PJM Interconnection, often found slipping on banana peels on this site, experienced a preliminary peak load that surpassed 160 GW during this week’s heat wave, exceeding the RTO’s summer forecast of 154 GW and requiring the deployment of pre-emergency demand response.

Oh, and PJM is only procuring 160 GW in its coming capacity auction for delivery in 2026-27, so that means current demand has already eclipsed future projections. No big deal, right?

Our offices are closed next week for the 4th of July holiday. For that, I am thankful, just like I am for you, dear reader. Until the other side, be good to yourselves and each other. And don’t blow off any fingers with fireworks.

Meta Moves on More EAPAs with Adapture

This week, utility-scale solar and storage developer, owner, and operator Adapture Renewables announced the execution of two more Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreements (EAPAs) with Meta. The data farm formerly known as Facebook procures the most clean energy in the country.

The agreements total 360 megawatts (MW) across two solar projects located in ERCOT territory that are expected to reach commercial operation in 2027. As demand for electricity surges, driven in part by the rapid growth of data centers and AI technologies, utility-scale solar projects like these are increasingly critical to meeting grid-wide energy needs. The new EAPAs build on the three previously executed agreements between Adapture Renewables and Meta in 2023, bringing the total number of agreements between the companies to five, and total capacity to nearly 700 MW across three states.

What they’re saying: “This expanded partnership reflects the trust and alignment we’ve built with Meta over time,” said Jesse Tippett, VP of origination at Adapture Renewables, noting the new deals reinforce the ongoing collaboration between the two companies to advance clean energy deployment at scale. “By structuring long-term agreements that balance risk and value for both parties, we’re helping to scale meaningful projects while enabling our partners to meet their clean energy goals.”

Gates-backed startup Breaks Ground on Pilot Site

This week, Airloom Energy, a U.S. energy generation startup backed by Microsoft tycoon Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, broke ground at its pilot site near Rock River, Wyoming. There, Airloom Energy will build out its first utility-scale turbine, designed to generate energy more efficiently and cost-effectively than traditional methods.

Airloom’s proprietary, U.S.-manufactured turbines replace bulky, costly models with compact designs that generate more energy in less space, according to the company. The next-gen modular turbines feature rectangular swept areas instead of traditional circular ones, increasing wind capture and improving energy conversion efficiency. Unlike traditional turbines that can take years to deploy, Airloom claims, its 30-year models can be constructed in less than a year.

Airloom is on track to complete its pilot site build-out ahead of commercial demos beginning in 2027. At this site, Airloom will be installing and testing its proprietary turbine designs to validate its power curve, ensure efficiency of production, refine the cost of deployment, and expand maintenance documentation. Beyond standard onshore integration, Airloom Energy will evaluate future use cases, including defense, disaster relief, and offshore wind energy generation.

According to a report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), approximately half of the United States is at risk of energy shortfalls that could lead to power outages and reduced supply by 2035. In part attributable to surging demand from the increased use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers, global research and advisory firm Gartner estimates that 40% of existing global facilities will be constrained by access to sufficient power by 2027. That means low-cost, high-efficiency energy is (and will be) critical for the grid.

What they’re saying: “Current energy technologies can’t meet the growing complexity and demand of the next decade,” ventured Neal Rickner, CEO of Airloom Energy. “We need more flexible systems that can be built quickly, and deployed anywhere at large scale. That’s the only way we’re going to achieve and maintain energy security and independence.”

“Breaking ground on a first pilot site is a major inflection point for any wind technology product,” echoed Paul Judge, former head of product management at GE Onshore Wind and advisory board member for Airloom Energy. “Airloom has reached this point with remarkable speed and clarity of purpose… This pilot is more than a test site; it’s the beginning of a fundamentally new approach to resilient renewable energy generation: wind energy that’s faster to deploy, land-efficient, and built for the energy challenges ahead.”

Utilities in the Midwestern United States are tackling tough challenges posed by increasingly extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and an ongoing race to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. State decarbonization laws add complexity to the process of bringing power generation online, and as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives, they are simultaneously managing supply chain issues, labor shortages, and new cybersecurity risks. Service providers must modernize their infrastructure to satisfy increasing demand while keeping pricing affordable, which is a tall task for any-sized utility. A new regional DISTRIBUTECH event, DTECH Midwest, will provide a unique opportunity to dive into the specific issues faced by the power industry in Midwest and includes tailored content for municipal and cooperative utilities.

Arevon Starts Up San Diego BESS

Arevon Energy, a leading developer, owner, and operator that has been wrangled into this roundup before, has started operations at its Peregrine Energy Storage Project in San Diego, California. The 200 MW/400 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system (BESS) is located in the Barrio Logan community. It marks Arevon’s fifth utility-scale energy storage facility in operation in California.

The $300 million lithium iron phosphate battery project dispatches on-demand power when it is needed most in the San Diego area, helps stabilize peak energy prices, and promises to reduce the likelihood of brownouts and blackouts. During peak electricity demand, Peregrine can power up to 200,000 homes for two hours per day. At the height of its construction, the project employed more than 90 full-time equivalent personnel and will disburse long-term property tax benefits estimated to total more than $28 million over its lifetime.

What they’re saying: “The successful completion of Peregrine Energy Storage is a result of the collaborative efforts of the project’s stakeholders and the local community who collectively support California’s renewable energy goals,” said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer at Arevon. “Peregrine signifies Arevon’s ongoing commitment to energy storage, and its importance in ensuring a reliable, stable energy system, as well as to advancing domestically made energy in the state and throughout the country.”

Happy Batteries, Happy Valley

Prevalon Energy LLC, a Mitsubishi Power Americas and EES joint venture, has announced that its Prevalon Battery Energy Storage Platform has officially entered commercial operation at Idaho Power’s Happy Valley project. Idaho Power selected the project through a competitive RFP process that determined it to be a low-cost resource and ideally suited to serve the company’s rapidly growing resource needs.

The Happy Valley site, completed on schedule, features an 80 MW four-hour duration BESS with a total capacity of up to 320 MWh. It features Prevalon’s fully integrated modular AC energy storage platform, which includes advanced battery enclosures, inverters, medium-voltage transformers, and its proprietary U.S.-designed and built insightOS Energy Management System (EMS). Purpose-built for utility-scale operations, the EMS delivers real-time control, secure network segmentation, and advanced diagnostics to optimize performance and safeguard critical infrastructure.

What they’re saying: “This project reflects the kind of trusted partnership Prevalon is built for,” said Tom Cornell, CEO of Prevalon Energy. “By combining our expertise with Idaho Power’s commitment to a sustainable energy future, we’re delivering reliable, flexible, and secure energy storage solutions that will serve this region for decades to come.”

RWE Commissions First Kentucky Solar Project

German-born RWE, which has grown to become the third-largest renewable energy company in the United States, has commissioned its first energy project in Kentucky, Ashwood Solar, located in Lyon County. Initially developed by a joint venture between Open Road Renewables and Eolian, the 86 MW facility is the largest solar PV installation in the state. It will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent of more than 15,000 Kentucky Municipal Energy Agency (KYMEA) member customers, strengthening energy independence and fostering economic growth.

Ashwood Solar has a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with KYMEA. The project created 250 local jobs during its construction. It will feature local pollinator plants onsite, promoting bee stuff and enhancing biodiversity in the region. Additionally, Ashwood Solar will generate $6 million in state property tax revenue over its operating lifetime.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-26-5.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 18:14:45.737030

Robinson, Current Affairs, Emily Topping",,,,,https://www.currentaffairs.org/news/why-are-we-still-subsidizing-fossil-fuels,"The standard right-wing talking points about clean energy are hollow at best, and rage-inducing at worst.
In the most recent version of the bill, released by the Senate Finance Committee, there are enough cuts to halt America’s clean energy momentum.
Even if you’re unwilling to count the indirect subsidies, this idea of fossil fuels as free market exemplars is completely ahistorical.
When they seek to repeal the clean energy incentives from the IRA, they just want to boost the fossil fuel industry.
Without clean energy subsidies, the timeline for an energy transition is decades or even centuries.","The standard right-wing talking points about clean energy are hollow at best, and rage-inducing at worst. It’s always some variation on the same basic narrative. Clean energy isn’t ready to supply Americans’ needs because it’s too expensive and unreliable; electric vehicles and other clean tech can’t compete without subsidies; the energy transition will happen on its own terms and within its own time frame, but we should drill and double down on oil and gas in the meantime. These are the public justifications, as made clear in Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which has now passed the House and currently sits with the Senate. In his “Unleashing American Energy” Executive Order, from President Trump’s very first day in office, he hits these points hard, saying that “burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of these resources, limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity” and that it’s “in the national interest to unleash America’s affordable and reliable energy and natural resources.” But contrary to this narrative, it’s actually fossil fuel use that’s beginning to die a slow death, and is in need of subsidies and market manipulation to maintain dominance. It’s time we stopped providing this edge.

The Senate has given itself a deadline of July 4 to make changes to the gigantic bill, ask for a new House vote, and send the legislation to the President for a signature. Despite some controversy in both the House and Senate negotiations, the holdouts on the Republican side of the aisle (all of the Democrats will oppose the bill, but that won’t matter) seem more concerned about the proposed cuts to Medicaid and the debt ceiling, and less concerned about the repeal of clean energy incentives passed through the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

In the most recent version of the bill, released by the Senate Finance Committee, there are enough cuts to halt America’s clean energy momentum. Solar and wind power both take big hits, basically losing all government incentives over the coming years. Energy storage incentives are spared, and geothermal, hydroelectric, and nuclear incentives will also be extended. That’s good. But EVs and home energy improvements will basically be eliminated. It’s worth remembering that solar and wind are the cheapest technologies for new power generation projects, and we’re at a critical juncture with electricity demand increasing more than anyone thought it would, due to electrification of things like household appliances and commercial equipment, as well as AI and data center growth. Renewables advocates are pinning their hopes on just a handful of Republican senators, notably Thom Tillis of North Carolina, to salvage at least something of the incentive system created by the IRA. The battle is still being waged, and for clean energy advocates, winning is so difficult in large part because while one side does a great job of hammering its talking points and pulling the wool over the eyes of the public, the other is unable to articulate meaningful counterpoints that meet people where they live.

The conservative argument is exemplified by remarks like those of Energy Secretary Chris Wright. At an event with the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship on the 18th of February, he correctly pointed out that the modern world was built on hydrocarbons. The 20th century and the incredible industrial growth that has changed all of our lives is undeniably a product of coal, oil, and gas. But he suggests that this historical dominance is necessarily predictive of the future and makes vague allusions to “obvious scale and cost problems” with clean energy. This is an absurd argument. It’s just weaponizing common but misinformed sentiment. The fact is that the legacy energy system—read, the fossil fuel industry—is the most heavily subsidized ‘free market’ on the planet. And we now have alternatives that pollute less, cost less, and improve energy security and stability. Wind and solar power have long been the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Why wouldChina have brought online more than 350 gigawatts of solar and wind in 2024, shattering its 2030 goal six years early, if not for the fact that it’s sensible and costs less? The modern Republican party was partially built on the rhetoric of free-market conservative ideals, but current Republican policy actions suggest that what they really want is a market that’s distorted in fossil fuel companies’ favor through policy and regulatory mechanisms, as well as subsidies.

Global subsidies for the consumption of oil and gas exceeded $1 trillion in 2022. That’s not a typo; we’re talking about more than a trillion dollars per year in the form of direct grants, vouchers, tax reductions and price regulations. And that’s only counting explicit subsidies. The International Monetary Fund published a study in late 2023 that counted implicit subsidies, like undercharging companies for environmental costs or giving them tax breaks on consumption, which translates to government revenue that is sacrificed to artificially lower the cost of things like gasoline or heating fuel for consumers. That rounded out to nearly $6 trillion in the same year. In other words, if one counts the explicit and the implicit together, we’re talking about $7 trillion in a year, worldwide. That’s more than 7 percent of global GDP.

The U.S. share of that number is $757 billion. And there are very strong arguments to count both the direct and indirect subsidies here, because of the well-confirmed environmental harm we’re causing, for which the check will absolutely come. It’s already coming. The recent Los Angeles wildfires, for instance, may have been the costliest disaster in U.S. history. The economic (to say nothing of the human) cost of not avoiding the worst effects of climate change will be devastating. And let’s not equivocate on who’s leading the charge on the pollution: the Climate Accountability Institute found that the biggest 100 oil and gas producers, including major fossil fuel companies, state-owned producers, state oil agencies, and the like, are responsible for more than half of the global greenhouse emissions since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

Even if you’re unwilling to count the indirect subsidies, this idea of fossil fuels as free market exemplars is completely ahistorical. In fact, for the last century, U.S. direct oil and gas subsidies are estimated at around $4.8 billion per year (in 2010 adjusted dollars). That’s roughly a half trillion dollars over the course of the century. Nuclear power was similarly subsidized, especially early on: annualized, the average direct subsidy in nuclear energy, for the second half of the 20th century, was around $3.5 billion per year. Some of the tax credits and incentives that large companies still benefit from were put in place in a very different historical time. It was 1916, for example, when the tax deductions on drilling expenses that major oil companies still enjoy were put into place. This is why the conservative talking points on this are shallow and misleading. Energy policy professionals on both sides of the issue are well aware that virtually all new energy technologies have been subsidized in the beginning, and that we’ve spent a century directly subsidizing oil and gas.

The more generous among you might be tempted to say, fair, but historical subsidies don’t justify continual deficit spending, especially not when the U.S. national debt sits at around $37 trillion dollars. But that’s not what this is about. The Republicans have shown that there aren’t many real deficit hawks, or that they’ve shamed that wing of their party into silence. All of the independent analyses of this “Big Beautiful Bill” indicate that it will raise the deficit by trillions over the course of the next decade. This is about support for coal, oil, and gas.

But don’t just take my word for it. For the climate watchdog organization Field Notes and her own publication, “Heated,” investigative reporter Emily Atkin recently got ahold of insider information about the workings of the American Exploration & Production Council, or AXPC, an important pro-fossil fuel lobbying group. From internal documents (including the board book from a recent meeting), we know exactly how AXPC plans on engaging with policymakers on the promotion of oil and gas and the elimination of climate protections. And much of what they called priorities has ended up in the “Big Beautiful Bill,” including the halting of taxes on excess methane and mechanisms for faster approval of fossil fuel projects (via the limitation of environmental review). The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 made these priorities clear well before the election.

Apart from the budget bill itself, the Trump administration has also been making non-fiscal moves all over the country that confirm its intentions here. President Trump recently declared an ‘energy emergency’ in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), a power grid operator that serves 15 states in the middle of the country as well as Manitoba, in order to delay the closure of an aging coal-fired power plant in Michigan. The engineers on the ground and independent analysts have all confirmed that the emergency isn’t real, that the move is really about providing life support for coal power plants. Over in Texas, lawmakers recently put up for consideration SB 388, which passed in the Senate and is waiting for a House vote. The bill is another attempt at an old idea to structurally favor the natural gas industry, and would require that 50 percent of all new electricity plant capacity come from ‘dispatchable sources,’ which is code for natural gas and coal. Conservatives again mask the support for hydrocarbons in the language of concern for grid reliability in the face of variable sources of power like wind and solar. What it actually does—and again, they know this and this is the point—is distort what has become a highly dynamic and impressive clean energy market.

For example, consider the case of ERCOT, which is highly illustrative. ERCOT stands for Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. It’s a nonprofit, and doesn’t own any generation infrastructure itself. Instead, the job of ERCOT is to manage a highly complex, competitive, and open market that has become a model for how clean energy can be integrated into grids with efficiency and speed. Independent Power Producers (IPPs)—those who operate power generation plants to provide electricity capacity for markets—can sell power to be used on the Texas grid, either in voluntary day-ahead markets or during real time operations. ERCOT is known for providing independent power producers with a structure in which the market rewards producers by paying for what is most needed at that time. In other words, this is a pretty good example of those open and free markets that make Republicans start frothing at the mouth and that a certain famous Chicago school was always talking about.

Here’s how it plays out: in recent years, it’s been so hot in Texas that people are using air conditioners more during daytime hours, and the energy consumption is staying high after sundown too. In other words, the typical demand spike is now larger and lasts longer. For a while now, solar has been the cheapest way to add power generation capacity, and so the Texas grid has added solar in giant quantities, but this after-dark dynamic has also encouraged the addition of battery storage at a giant scale. For example, Texas added 4 gigawatts of battery storage between 2023 and 2024, and according to Bloomberg Green, it will likely double capacity in 2025. Around 1 gigawatt of solar and batteries come online each month in Texas. You may still be wondering why this matters so much and how it relates to the market manipulation. Well, in the past, the market would reward “dispatchable” sources of power like coal and especially gas at night. When the sun went down and the panels stopped generating, the fossil-fuel producers would swoop in and fill the gap. That dynamic helped to keep the coal and gas plants in business despite those sunny daytime hours, when solar provided much cheaper power and gas plants had trouble competing on price.

But things are changing. During the heat of last year’s summer (especially August 20), ERCOT set an evening record for net load, which is the difference between the available solar and wind generation capacity and people’s demand. Net load can be thought of as the gap in electricity supply that will need to be covered by more expensive power sources, typically coal and gas. On top of higher costs, historically, the gas plants that meet this need have often had trouble stepping up generation in a hurry, so Texas (and other states) have sometimes resorted to rolling brownouts, blackouts, and to paying big consumers extra to limit their consumption (down-regulation). Gas plants can struggle like this in the winter too, and this will be very familiar to Texans, who remember the 2021 crisis that caused blackouts all over the state. But because of the huge additional battery capacity last summer, the ERCOT grid didn’t get pushed to the edge, didn’t have giant price spikes, and didn’t need to tell customers to stop consuming. Instead, battery storage stepped up to fill the need on that August 20 night, and others, and in fact set a record of its own for storage discharged to the grid. Contrary to concerns about reliability, in this case, clean power performed ideally. The best day we can hope for, for grid operators and the environment, is that a base load is powered by hydroelectric, geothermal, or nuclear plants, that a normal spike in demand is met with a mix of wind and solar, and that all excess electricity demand is filled by batteries, which are recharged again the next day with cheap wind and solar. The U.S. still needs to work on its base load mix, but adding wind, solar, and batteries in such large quantities is moving in the right direction.

The point isn’t to overanalyze a few hot summer days. The point is that prices for solar panels have decreased by 89 percent in the last decade, while both on and offshore wind have decreased by more than 48 percent. Battery storage, especially lithium-ion batteries, has undergone similar dramatic decreases in prices. The ERCOT grid had become a model for how a competitive and open market might work, and how renewables are winning the day without market distortions, simply because they’re cheaper. But instead of embracing this technology, conservative lawmakers have spent the last couple of years trying to stick their fingers in the eyes of clean energy producers and their own consumers. In 2023, some legislators and lobbyist groups fought hard for a provision that would pay much more to gas plants to stay available during critical demand spikes, and though it didn’t pass ultimately, they’re at it again with SB 388 in Texas, which would force new gas plant capacity at significantly higher costs than the much more competitive solar and battery projects. This one may pass yet.

The picture is clear: conservatives’ opposition to green energy isn’t because they want free markets, and it isn’t because they’re concerned about grid reliability. Those are smoke screens. What they want is to keep coal and gas plants alive. At higher prices, if need be. When they seek to repeal the clean energy incentives from the IRA, they just want to boost the fossil fuel industry. There are fair and legitimate concerns about the variability of solar and wind. And grid balancing and stability are critical and require attention and investment, but they are not reasons to pivot back to gas and coal. They’re reasons to invest more in the grid, to pursue interconnection and diversity in energy generation technology, and to engage much more seriously in efficiency and management on the demand side as well.

Fair-minded people might still be left with a question: if clean energy is so competitive, why do we need subsidies at all? The answer is simple. Yes, clean energy, especially solar, offshore wind, and increasingly, batteries, is cheaper than legacy sources. Over time, the market would absolutely take care of the transition. But we don’t have that kind of time! We should keep in mind that it wasn’t that long ago that we transitioned from coal to oil as the world’s largest source of energy. Energy systems are gargantuan and infrastructure for legacy sources; capital expenditure for gas plants, for example, can cost in the tens of billions of dollars. Without clean energy subsidies, the timeline for an energy transition is decades or even centuries. But the scientists tell us unequivocally that we can’t wait that long, that at this moment, the actual energy emergency is the need to rapidly decarbonize.

The oil and gas companies have raked in record profits in recent years. For 2022, Fatih Birol of the International Energy Agency put the figure of net income in the oil and gas industry at around $4 trillion. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, just four companies (Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP) combined for $100 billion in profits in 2023, which was considered a dip after the record-setting 2022. They don’t need subsidies anymore. And none of this takes away from the fact that legacy energy sources have enabled astounding levels of innovation and progress. We just have better options now, and the point of the incentives is to speed along the transition to clean energy that we know will happen anyway, but that would happen over a longer period. It’s inevitable, and even conservatives will admit this. But if we’re to have any chance at all of avoiding the worst effects of climate change, it’s simply not optional to speed it along.

Historically, the US government was happy to provide billions in both direct and indirect subsidies to oil and gas. The idea was to support the young sector and to provide industry with cheap and critical inputs. These are those years for clean energy, and unlike that era, it’s not just cheaper energy for consumers and industrial growth that’s at stake. Now, it’s the planet that’s at stake. This is a no-brainer. And despite the rhetoric on one side, clean energy is highly predictable in terms of cost and very reliable when the grid is well planned and maintained. Other countries have already figured this out: for instance, Germany’s electricity mix is increasingly dominated by renewable and indeed variable sources of power. Last year, wind and solar made up 43 percent of the total electricity power mix. And in the time from 2006-2019, they reduced the average annual duration of power outages per consumer from 20 minutes to just 12 minutes. For comparison, the U.S. has electric generation from wind and solar sitting at around 17 percent and the average outages per year per customer are at around 5.5 hours. So, Germany’s grid is getting better and more reliable as they go green. The keys are diversity, interconnection, grid investment, and planning. The Germans are not doubling down on gas and coal and disincentivizing renewables.

But there’s hope yet. The “Big Beautiful Bill” hasn’t passed the Senate yet, and the Republicans’ wavering and changing the House text already indicates anxiety with trying to sell the public on the repeal of funding and programming that has helped plenty of Republican voters too.

“There is no justification for keeping the Eddystone plant online, but the air will be dirtier in Pennsylvania, and costs for consumers will go up.
And it means kids and families will be forced to breathe in dangerous pollution this summer,” said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. Clean Energy, Environmental Defense Fund.
“The Administration’s order to prolong the lifespan of the aging and expensive Eddystone power plant is illegal and irresponsible to the customers in Constellation’s service region,” said Sierra Club Senior Counsel Greg Wannier.","HARRISBURG, PA – Public interest groups, led by NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), today legally challenged the Department of Energy’s mandate to keep the Eddystone Generating Station open past its planned closing. The Department of Energy (DOE) issued an order on May 30 forcing the uneconomic oil and gas power plant to remain operational past its planned May 31, 2025 retirement date.

The DOE used section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to issue its order, which was designed to give the federal government the power to direct power plants to operate in response to one-off emergency events such as hurricanes, but the Eddystone retirement has been planned for nearly two years and the region has more-than-adequate generation resources–there is simply no emergency. The DOE’s order falsely invokes emergency powers to upend the usual legal and regulatory decision-making process.

The owner of Eddystone Generating Station, Constellation Energy, submitted a deactivation notice in December 2023, aiming to close the plant because it was uneconomic. The regional electric grid operator, PJM, determined that closing the aging plant would not hurt grid reliability, and that the PJM region has sufficient generation capacity available to make Eddystone’s operation unnecessary.

DOE’s order does not include any federal funding to keep the expensive Eddystone plant operational, and the additional costs associated with this extension will be passed onto consumers in Pennsylvania and the region.

NRDC filed the request for rehearing with the DOE today. The groups signing the request include Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future (PennFuture) represented by Clean Air Task Force, Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club, and Public Citizen. DOE has 30 days to respond to today’s motion, after which the organizations can challenge the order in court.

The following are quotes from the organizations who have signed the motion:

“There is no energy ‘emergency’ that calls for rash, last-minute action by the federal government to require this inefficient, uneconomic plant to stay open. Pennsylvania families will now have to cover the costs of this unlawful, unnecessary, and harmful order. Forcing Eddystone to refuel its supplies of oil and gas and undergo emergency maintenance on a whim will not support grid reliability, but it will hurt consumers,” said Robert Routh, Pennsylvania policy director at NRDC. “Pennsylvanians deserve a clean, reliable, affordable electric grid. DOE’s order undermines each of these goals.”

""The real harm will be to residents of Southeastern Pennsylvania, who will be paying for more expensive power at a high pollution output,” said Jessica O’Neill, managing attorney for Litigation at PennFuture. “This is a manufactured emergency on behalf of the fossil fuel industry to circumvent the market forces prioritizing cleaner, less costly renewable sources of power.""

“Extending the aging and uneconomic Eddystone plant beyond its planned retirement is bad for public health and the environment – and is an unlawful action under the guise of an energy emergency,” said Frank Sturges, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “There is no justification for keeping the Eddystone plant online, but the air will be dirtier in Pennsylvania, and costs for consumers will go up. We stand ready to fight this action in court if necessary.”

“This reckless decision will run up Pennsylvanians' electricity bills right as they’re seeking relief from the heat. And it means kids and families will be forced to breathe in dangerous pollution this summer,” said Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. Clean Energy, Environmental Defense Fund. “Pennsylvania has a better path forward – harnessing its abundant clean energy resources to cut energy bills, create good jobs and improve people’s health.”

“President Trump’s energy emergency is phonier than a three-dollar bill, but the impact his lawless action to force ratepayers to pay to keep Eddystone open will result in real energy bill increases for working families,” said Tyson Slocum, energy program director for Public Citizen.

“The Administration’s order to prolong the lifespan of the aging and expensive Eddystone power plant is illegal and irresponsible to the customers in Constellation’s service region,” said Sierra Club Senior Counsel Greg Wannier. “There are ample cleaner and less expensive sources that already ensure reliability in the region. This order does not benefit Pennsylvanians or the PJM Region in any meaningful way, and risks increasing customers’ financial burdens in the event they are forced to foot the bill for this unplanned and unneeded extension.”

Bottom Line: Pivot to Defensives Amid July 4 Deadline Pressure The GOP's legislative scramble creates a high-risk, high-reward environment.","The Senate GOP's “One Big, Beautiful Bill” has collided head-on with the Byrd Rule, creating a fiscal policy crossroads with profound implications for investors. Parliamentarian rulings have stripped the legislation of $587 billion in projected savings—primarily from Medicaid provider taxes and anti-immigrant healthcare restrictions—forcing Republicans to pivot funding mechanisms or face legislative collapse by the July 4 deadline. This creates a volatile environment for sectors tied to healthcare, public infrastructure, and state budgets. Investors should pivot to defensive plays while steering clear of exposure to Medicaid-dependent entities and politically charged assets.

Healthcare Sector Risks: Medicaid-Dependent Hospitals Face Funding Uncertainty

The parliamentarian's rejection of GOP efforts to freeze provider taxes and reduce state Medicaid funding has unraveled a key revenue source for their tax cuts. Without these savings, Republicans may target other healthcare cost centers, such as Medicare Advantage reimbursements or hospital funding. This threatens the financial stability of Medicaid-heavy hospitals, which rely on state reimbursements that could face cuts under revised austerity measures.

Analysis: Medicaid hospitals have underperformed REITs by 15% year-to-date, reflecting investor skepticism about their revenue resilience.

Investment Advice: Avoid stocks like Community Health Systems (CYH) and HCA Healthcare (HCA), which are disproportionately exposed to Medicaid reimbursement risks.

Opportunities in Rural Healthcare REITs

Rural healthcare real estate investment trusts (REITs) offer a defensive play. These entities own facilities in regions less reliant on Medicaid provider taxes, such as non-expansion states like Texas and Florida. Their cash flows are more insulated from GOP cuts and could benefit from bipartisan infrastructure spending.

Investment Opportunity: Consider Welltower (HCN) or HCP (HCP), which have stable occupancy rates and diversified revenue streams.

Electric Vehicle Manufacturers Gain Traction

While not directly tied to Medicaid provisions, the GOP's stricken environmental rollbacks—such as repealing green energy tax credits—create an indirect tailwind for EV manufacturers. The removal of provisions that would have weakened incentives for clean energy adoption preserves demand for electric vehicles, particularly as the U.S. Postal Service's $1.65 billion plan to electrify its fleet proceeds.

Analysis: EV stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% in 2025, reflecting resilience amid macroeconomic volatility.

Investment Opportunity: EV leaders like Tesla and Rivian remain attractive, though investors should monitor the bill's progress for further policy clarity.

State-Specific Opportunities: Look to Low Provider Tax Reliance States

States that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA—such as Texas, Florida, and Tennessee—have minimal exposure to provider tax cuts and are better positioned to avoid fiscal austerity. Investors should favor infrastructure projects and municipal bonds in these states, where budgets are less tied to federal Medicaid funding.

Analysis: Non-expansion states outperformed expansion states in GDP growth (3.2% vs. 2.1%) in 2024, suggesting stronger fiscal stability.

Investment Opportunity: Explore municipal bonds issued by Texas or Florida, or infrastructure REITs with exposure to these regions.

Caution on Public Land Holdings

Provisions to sell federal lands or weaken environmental regulations were struck down, preserving regulatory hurdles for industries like timber and mining. Investors in public land-dependent sectors—such as timber companies—face prolonged uncertainty.

Analysis: Weyerhaeuser has underperformed the S&P 500 by 12%, reflecting regulatory and legislative risks.

Investment Caution: Avoid companies like Weyerhaeuser, which rely on public land access for operations.

Bottom Line: Pivot to Defensives Amid July 4 Deadline Pressure

The GOP's legislative scramble creates a high-risk, high-reward environment. Investors should prioritize sectors insulated from Medicaid cuts (e.g., rural healthcare REITs) and benefit from green energy stability (e.g., EV manufacturers), while avoiding politically vulnerable assets. With just weeks until the July 4 deadline, expect volatility as Republicans scramble to salvage their bill. Monitor progress closely—and be prepared to act swiftly if the GOP pivots to desperate measures, such as overriding the parliamentarian's rulings.

Final Note: The debt ceiling deadline in August looms, adding urgency. If the GOP's bill fails, Congress may need Democratic support to raise the debt limit—a scenario that could further destabilize politically exposed sectors. Stay nimble.",,N,,2025-06-27 19:08:13.733349

New regulations address noise pollution, limiting decibels near residential areas, and visual pollution, requiring farms to be obscured from view.

On May 1, the St. Clair County Board of Commissioners passed a new set of regulations setting standards for companies seeking to develop a solar farm.

The new rules came after months of residents expressing concern about the effects a solar plant could have on their health and property values.

St. Clair County Board of Commissioners Chairman Steven Simasko said Health Department Medical Director Remington Nevin had more than 30 references to back up his recommendations and that he felt it balanced accountability for the solar companies without being too restrictive.

""It's balanced. It's not prohibitive. It is focused on public health, and I think that the health department did everything they could to reassure the citizens that feel abandoned by the state, by the governor's office, by the legislature, and then by the Fort Gratiot board that allowed this to be where it's at,"" Simasko said.

So what health concerns are there regarding solar farms?

The Times Herald interviewed Annick Anctil, a Michigan State University professor of civil and environmental engineering, about what concerns around solar energy are myths and which ones communities need to take seriously.

Anctil has spent her career researching how new technologies affect the local community and environment. She is the assistant director of the Department of Energy - Michigan State University Industrial Assessment Center.

Are materials used to construct the solar panels a public health risk?

""I see a lot of attention about what goes into a solar panel. So for example, some solar panels might contain some lead, but the amount of lead is very small,"" Anctil said.

The panels themselves posing a risk is one of the most common misconceptions Anctil said she encounters regarding solar energy production farms.

""It's a lot less than you would find, for the amount of material, than in a cell phone or a battery,"" Anctil said.

Do solar panels produce noise, and can that noise be a health risk to those living near the solar facility?

On their own, solar panels do not produce any noise, but the inverters can be loud.

Inverters are used to convert the solar energy solar panels soak up into electricity.

Under Section 9 of the new regulation passed by St. Clair County's Board of Commissioners, the noise from a solar facility cannot be more than 45 decibels from the property line of any parcel with a residential dwelling.

For comparison, a chart provided by Yale University's Environmental Health and Safety states a house refrigerator produces about 55 decibels of noise. A regular conversation can produce 60-70 decibels. When a person is continually exposed to noise above 80 decibels, it becomes a risk to their health and hearing.

Katherine Albrecht, a resident of China Township, said during an April 16 St. Clair County Health Department meeting she had gone to solar plants and measured the noise at 95 decibels. At the same meeting Jodi Middleton, who lives on a property next to a solar farm in Shiawassee County, said noise from the farm had given her and her children headaches.

Anctil said noise has been a greater concern in Michigan than other states because previous facilities did not take steps to minimize the sound. The solution, she said, can be as simple as setting up the inverters away from others property and putting up a wall to block the noise.

Is 'visual pollution' a concern with solar farms?

The county's new regulation requires solar facilities to be obscure from view from any nearby roadways or properties. The regulation cites a 2024 study that found visual pollution in rural areas that previously had a natural view caused distress for the residents.

Anctil said she could not account for people's personal tastes, saying any change could be upsetting, but added that solar farms have an easier time obscuring themselves than wind farms, which must build tall wind turbines that are nearly impossible to hide.

What happens to solar farms when they're no longer in use?

St. Clair County's new regulation requires solar farms to have a decommissioning plan in place before the county approves the facility. The plan must ensure the land used is returned to its natural state before the farm was added.

Anctil said it's actually rare for a company to leave any materials behind because of their value, particularly copper wiring in the solar panels.","https://www.thetimesherald.com/gcdn/presto/2022/12/01/PPOH/baebdc27-3112-4647-8bfb-e61de5d5ea91-_DSC5891.JPG?crop=6015,3384,x0,y308&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-27 21:03:23.985944

By Jon Caldara

Colorado’s Secretary of State Jena Griswold is responsible for running the state’s TRACER system. This is the public database where campaigns must file their contribution and expenditure disclosures. If you wanna see who’s funding a candidate, that’s where you go.

But if you went there last week, you would have seen it was “down for maintenance.”

That was a lie. There was no “maintenance.”

You can’t handle the truth

Griswold took it down to have the home addresses of elected officials redacted from the site. In the wake of the shootings of state legislators in Minnesota, many of Colorado’s elected officials asked her to do it.

So why not just tell us that? We would have more than understood the truth.

This database is required by law. Scrubbing it might or might not be a good policy. She might or might not have the authority to do it. But to fib and say it was “down for maintenance” just adds to the reasons trust in government is at an all-time low. They can’t even tell us the truth on this reasonable feat.

In fact, we might not have known any of this falsehood had it not been for a scoop by Axios Denver’s John Frank. Only when confronted did the Jena’s office cop to shutting it down to redact information. Yes, a tiny lie. But that’s the gateway drug to big lies.

A couple of years back, the Colorado Department of Transportation didn’t want folks driving on a high mountain pass during a snowstorm, so they lied and said it was closed. A fabrication, it was open and fine.

There is a pretension and arrogance with those it’s-for-your-own-good lies. And it conditions citizens to let government play parent to them.

It takes a certain amount of arrogance to use the machinery of government to promote inaccuracies and lies (insert Trump joke here). Government should be the record holder and storehouse of truth.

The secretary of state, county clerks, law enforcement, auditors and researchers must be wholly committed to recording only the full truth, no matter what.

Where does my property line end and yours begin? Who owns that car? When was someone born? When did he die? We must trust government records or pretty much everything — everything — falls apart.

But now records can be redacted and altered.

Changing one’s gender on a Colorado birth certificate is as easy as changing your mailing address. Was a person born a boy on a certain date? Who knows? Those records can now be legally falsified.

If changing birth certificates is legal, I need to change the birth date on mine. I identify as 67 despite the government record saying I’m 60. I want my Social Security checks now.

A double-standard for donors

We’re told redacting TRACER records was a matter of safety for those in politics. But lots of us are in politics. Why only protect the elected?

These records still show the home addresses of everyone of us who donated to a campaign. Aren’t we worth the same level of safety and protection?

If an elected official is targeted for an act of violence, wouldn’t those who paid for him to get into office also be possible targets? Why does Griswold protect the privacy of her elected colleagues but not their supporters?

There’s a reason why people want to give their money anonymously — to save their lives and livelihoods.

During the bloody civil rights battles, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, had to go to court to protect their donor’s privacy. Why? If doxed, those who financed their mission would have been lynched.

A few years back, there was a mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs. Fortunately, Planned Parenthood also keeps their donors private. If that shooter could look up their funders’ addresses, they might have been targeted, too.

Every year the legislature tries to pass bills to end donor privacy, labeling such donations as “soft money.” “Soft money” is the pejorative term for “political speech I want to support, but don’t want to be killed over.”

How fun it will be to watch those very legislators who pressured Jena Griswold to redact their home addresses to turn around and demand others involved in politics be treated differently and stay easy targets.

Since then, TVA teams have been safely removing structures and preparing for future opportunities for TVA power generation and economic development, TVA noted in a June 26 post on its website.","Intelligent power management company Eaton is working with Tennessee Valley Authority to repurpose its retired Bull Run Fossil Plant in Clinton, Tennessee into a critical asset supporting reliable and clean energy.

As more electricity comes from variable sources and electricity demand increases, maintaining grid stability becomes more challenging as coal plants reach the end of their operating lifecycles. Synchronous condensers help balance grid inertia by replacing decommissioned power generation equipment, increasing power reliability and redundancy, Eaton said.

Eaton said it is providing the electrical and mechanical solutions needed to convert one machine comprised of two generators into two 605 mega-volt amperes reactive (MVAR) synchronous condensers. This will enable the Bull Run plant to add increased stability to the power grid.

“Synchronous condenser conversions are complex technical projects that require a high degree of specialized knowledge and project management capabilities,” explained Igor Stamenkovic, senior vice president and general manager for Eaton’s Electrical Engineering Services and Systems Division. “Through our approach and proven success helping other utilities across North America to support reliable and affordable power, we are confident this transformation will help enhance reliability and grid stability in the region.”

“America’s energy future is being built right here in the Tennessee Valley region. The synchronous condenser project will help strength the local grid as we build more American Energy to power our region's future,” said Scott Fiedler, a spokesperson for TVA, told Public Power Current.

He noted that the TVA region is growing faster than the national average in terms of population, GDP and load. To address the region’s load growth due to growing population, industrial electrification and onshoring of manufacturing, TVA is making some of the largest capital investments in the agency’s history -- 6,200+ MW of new generation planned, with 3,570 MW currently under construction.

TVA retired the single-generator coal-fired power plant, located near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in December 2023 as the plant reached the end of its life cycle in providing affordable, reliable power to the region.

While the decommissioning proceeds, including the demolition of the two tall stacks and other structures, TVA has placed some plans in motion to leverage the site to help build America’s energy future, it noted.

Along with the synchronous condenser, TVA is exploring fusion technology with high potential to become a commercial energy source over the next decade.

TVA said it is considering an array of future options at the site, such as pursuing economic development opportunities, further exploration of innovation, adding new generation and establishing a portion of the area for a green space for community use.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-27 20:07:08.307321

The REINS Act would require state lawmakers to vote on any proposed regulation that might have as little as a $20 million cost spread over five years for businesses in the state's multi-trillion-dollar economy. And even less costly rules could still have to receive unanimous approval from various other state commissions, even if they wouldn't also require legislative approval.

""This bill would make it harder for the state to keep people’s drinking water clean from PFAS and other dangerous chemicals, their air free from toxic pollutants, and their health care facilities providing high quality care,"" Stein wrote in his veto message. ""It would impose red tape, including an unworkable unanimity requirement, that would hamstring the decision-making of agencies, boards, and commissions, making them less effective at protecting people’s health, safety, and welfare.”

Supporters say the REINS Act, House Bill 402, would cut costs for businesses that could then be passed down to every North Carolinians. State lawmakers can't do much about inflation, when it comes to helping people's pocketbooks, but they can take other steps including regulatory changes.

“Regulation is the largest cost-driver to the citizens of the state, next to inflation,” bill sponsor Rep. Allen Chesser, R-Nash, said in this year's House debate over the bill.

Stein wouldn’t be the only official affected by the bill — the state’s executive branch is run by 10 elected leaders called the Council of State, currently made up of five Republicans and five Democrats — but the governor’s office is in charge of agencies with a notable regulatory footprint over the environment, transportation and more.

The bill is part of a national effort by pro-business political groups to pass versions of the REINS Act, named for its intent to rein in government oversight. Similar bills have been filed in many individual states as well as in the U.S. Congress. It has already become law in Utah, Florida and a few other states.

One of the main forces behind the bill is Americans for Prosperity, a pro-business group tied to libertarian billionaire Charles Koch. Representatives of the group say state agencies would still be allowed to propose rules and regulations even if the REINS Act becomes law in North Carolina. They’ll just have to be able to defend those proposals well enough to win support for them at the legislature.

Allen (GA-12) and Congressman Earl L. ""Buddy"" Carter (GA-01) introduced two bills to update the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program.

The Clean Air and Building Infrastructure Improvement Act, introduced by Congressman Allen, is a necessary solution in response to the Biden-Harris Administration's harmful final rule for Fine Particulate Matter, otherwise known as PM 2.5 standards. This legislation would repeal the overly burdensome, economically devastating Biden-Harris PM 2.5 rule and modernize the standard and program for preconstruction permits.

The Clean Air and Economic Advancement Reform Act (CLEAR Act), introduced by Congressman Carter, would make several changes to the process for establishing and implementing NAAQS, ensuring states have the needed time to comply with realistic standards and are not penalized by the EPA for wildfire mitigation tactics such as prescribed burns.

""Simply put, the Biden-Harris Administration's unworkable rule to revise PM 2.5 standards tied the hands of job creators and manufacturers. The Golden Age of America is upon us, and House Republicans are committed to eliminating unnecessary compliance and implementation burdens that harm our states, business communities, and economic development. Both of these bills deliver just that and protect the nearly 27,000 manufacturing workers who call Georgia's 12th District home,"" said Congressman Rick Allen.

""The CLEAR Act offers a common sense solution for states to improve air quality standards without overly burdensome, unrealistic rules that threaten economic growth without meaningfully contributing to Americans' wellbeing. By updating our approach to NAAQS, we will take an America First step toward strengthening our manufacturing base and unleashing energy dominance,"" said Congressman Buddy Carter.

""The NAM supports the Clean Air and Economic Advancement Reform Act and the Clean Air and Building Infrastructure Improvement Act—two important bills that will modernize the outdated and broken NAAQS process, which has too often slowed manufacturing growth without improving environmental outcomes. Advancing this legislation will pave the way for greater manufacturing investment and expansion in the United States, stimulating job creation across the country. Manufacturers commend Representatives Allen and Carter for introducing these bills and for helping restore balance to the regulatory process—supporting manufacturing investment, job creation and infrastructure development while maintaining strong environmental protections. These proposals reflect the kind of smart, practical policymaking manufacturers across the country need to succeed,"" said Charles Crain, Managing Vice President of Policy, National Association of Manufacturers.

“It’s our conclusion that, whether in Japan or the United States, emissions from blast furnaces cannot be significantly mitigated,” said Roger Smith, Asia lead at SteelWatch. “The company should transition to a renewable energy-based approach that would achieve its net-zero target and fulfill its obligations as a leading global steelmaker.”

Speakers at a press conference organized by the Sierra Club highlighted their concerns with blast furnaces, which Nippon Steel has previously said is a technology it plans to invest in through the deal.

A more environmentally friendly alternative is a direct reduction furnace to create iron ore and then an electric arc furnace to create steel, Smith said.

“This is already in commercial use in the United States, the Middle East and beyond,” Smith said. “Switching from fossil fuel to green hydrogen and powering the electric arc furnace with renewable energy can nearly eliminate emissions from this production method.”

U.S. Steel released a statement in response to the Tuesday event, saying environmental stewardship is a core value, and they’re committed to protecting its workers.

“The finalization of the partnership is just the first step in an integration process that will take time to complete,” said a U.S. Steel spokesperson in an email. “There are still many things to be determined about how the companies will come together. We will share relevant information as this process continues.”

Other participants expressed their concerns with the steel deal, including Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Project, a Pittsburgh-based coalition that fights for better air quality.

Mehalik wants Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel to make it their highest priority to end severe health impacts in Pennsylvania’s Mon Valley.

“Real progress will only come when public health and community revitalization are treated as non-negotiable priorities for this new deal,” Mehalik said. “There have been too many years of promise breaking and too much emphasis on short-term investments that continue to perpetuate community health harms and workforce anxiety.”

Northwest Indiana activists asked for the same priority to be given in the region.

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% of U.S. residents most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy. In 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates, according to the American Lung Association.

A 2016 JAMA Network report also found Gary as one of the top five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

Dorreen Carey, president of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, participated in Tuesday’s conference, saying she believes now is the time to initiate newer steelmaking technologies.

“If investments are not made now in newer technologies, the long-term survival of Gary Works and the jobs it provides are in jeopardy,” Carey said. “(GARD) and the people who live in Gary want a clean environment, the good jobs a steel mill can provide and sustainable economic development. Investing in direct reduction ironmaking will provide a cleaner, greener future for the city of Gary, and we urge Nippon to commit to these investments.”

Susan Thomas, director of policy and press for Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said Tuesday night that the region is “an epicenter of toxic air pollution.”

“Globally, this tragedy is preventable,” Thomas said. “We say to Nippon Steel, you have an opportunity and a responsibility to become a global leader in clean steelmaking technology here and now. It is urgent that you do so, for if you prolong the lives of coal-burning blast furnaces, you will be diminishing ours.”

Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel announced June 18 that they have finalized the “historic partnership,” according to the Associated Press, making the combined company the world’s fourth-largest steelmaker.

On May 23, President Donald Trump announced that he would approve an investment from the Japanese company to U.S. Steel, according to Post-Tribune archives. Through the partnership, the U.S. government receives “a golden share,” which allows de facto rights on company decisions and appointments.

The “golden share” seemingly fixes national security concerns previously outlined by former President Joe Biden and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

Before leaving office, Biden denied the deal. Both Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris said during campaigns that they planned to block the steel deal.

Through the partnership, the Northwest Indiana Gary Works facility should receive about $1 billion. Gary Mayor Eddie Melton has been vocal about his support since August 2024, when it was first announced that Gary Works would receive $300 million from the deal.

In a previous statement, Melton said he will continue to meet with both steel companies about the projected job increases to Gary, improving environmental protections and future economic development.

“I am pleased thus far on how the current agreement has been structured that allows U.S. Steel to remain an American-owned and operated corporation under this new partnership,” Melton said. “I’m equally pleased the pledges made during this negotiation will be honored, and I’m optimistic that this was the best decision for steel workers and the communities like Gary across the country.”

Since it was announced that Nippon Steel would invest $300 million in Gary Works, Northwest Indiana environmental activists have been concerned. In October, GARD and Just Transition Northwest Indiana announced they supported a letter opposing the deal from the Sierra Club to U.S. Congress members.

“Nippon Steel’s revealed plans to extend the life of the most polluting parts of a steel mill currently operated by U.S. Steel leaves no doubt that the company is not acting on climate or accounting for public health,” the letter said.

Carey, on Tuesday, also mentioned concerns with U.S. applying for two-year presidential air exemptions from hazardous air pollutant rules for integrated iron and steel, coke and taconite iron ore process.

A previous statement from U.S. Steel said the company challenged the three rules because they were not supported by science or law and would impose significant costs while setting technically unachievable standards.

“The presidential exemptions provide an additional path to achieving reasonable, effective environmental standards, which we support as part of our commitment to environmental standards, which we support as part of our commitment to environmental excellence and to being a good neighbor in the communities where we live and work,” the statement said. “These requests do not change our continued commitment to environmental performance and safety.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CTC-L-US-Steel-Gary-18a-02.jpg?w=1024&h=767,N,,2025-06-27 17:11:47.660679

On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Tax-related proposals contained in the OBBBA would extend or make permanent select corporate, international and individual tax provisions originally enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) that either have expired or are scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA also contains several other provisions, including:

Retaliatory measures against foreign countries that have enacted certain “unfair foreign taxes.”

An increase of the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions of individual taxpayers to $40,000 and new restrictions on SALT deductions for certain partnerships.

Significant modifications to green energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The Senate is expected to take up the OBBBA in June 2025, with a target date of July 4, 2025, set for the bill’s enactment. Below, we summarize key aspects of the OBBBA and provide our preliminary analysis.

Corporations

Deduction for Domestic Research Expenditures

The OBBBA suspends required capitalization of domestic research and experimental expenditures for amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030. Under the OBBBA, at the taxpayer’s election, such expenditures can be:

deducted as paid or incurred under new Section 174A(a),

capitalized and recovered over no less than 60 months under new Section 174A(c) (not applicable if chargeable to depreciable or depletable property), or

capitalized and recovered over 10 years under amended Section 59(e).

By contrast, taxpayers must continue to capitalize and amortize foreign research or experimental expenditures over 15 years.

Taxpayers may not recover foreign capitalized research or experimental expenditures, either as a deduction or a reduction to the amount realized, for any property disposed of, retired or abandoned after May 12, 2025. This provision addresses, at least prospectively, an arguable lack of clarity concerning the application of current Section 174(d).

Transitions to or from current deduction of domestic research expenditures are treated as automatic changes in accounting method on a cutoff basis, i.e., no Section 481(a) adjustments are required or allowed to potentially spread the impact over several years.

Presumably, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) will issue procedural guidance implementing the statute. While the other conforming amendments, which are permanent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, address some issues that had not yet been adequately resolved in administrative guidance (e.g., the existence of basis, the proper approach to dispositions of research cost objectives, etc.), some issues remain for further regulatory guidance, including the definition of software expenditures and the treatment of contract research arrangements.

Interest Deduction Limitation

Under Section 163(j), the deduction for business interest expense is generally limited to the sum of (1) business interest income, (2) 30% of adjusted taxable income (but not less than zero) and (3) floor plan financing interest. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030, the OBBBA provides that adjusted taxable income be computed by reference to earnings before income taxes without regard to deductions for depreciation, amortization or depletion (EBITDA). This change provides potentially significant increases in the ability to benefit from business interest deductions for many taxpayers.

Bonus Depreciation and Other Cost Recovery Incentives

Several accelerated cost recovery incentives are included in the OBBBA.

First, so-called “bonus depreciation” is extended at 100% of basis for eligible property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2030 (January 1, 2031, for longer production period property and certain aircraft). As with prior iterations of bonus depreciation, determining and documenting the placed-in-service date for a particular asset is critical.

Second, in an attempt to incentivize manufacturing in the U.S., the OBBBA provides for an elective 100% depreciation allowance for “qualified production property.” Qualified production property is the portion of any U.S. nonresidential real property that is originally used by the taxpayer as an integral part of a “qualified production activity” and placed in service after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2033 (if construction begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029).

Qualified production activity is the manufacturing, production or refining of tangible personal property, if there has been a substantial transformation of the property comprising the product. This provision suggests a number of qualification issues similar to what arose under former Section 199 (relating to the domestic production activities deduction).

Third, the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense under Section 179 is increased to $2.5 million (and the phaseout threshold amount is increased to $4 million) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 (with inflation indexing for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025).

Corporate Charitable Contributions

The OBBBA reduces the deduction for charitable contributions of a corporation by allowing a deduction only to the extent that these contributions exceed 1% of a corporation’s taxable income. This 1% “floor” on corporate charitable deductions operates in addition to the 10% “ceiling” under current law.

Contributions in excess of the 10% ceiling may continue to be carried forward for five years, but contributions disallowed under the 1% floor may be carried forward only in years in which the taxpayer’s charitable contributions exceed the 10% ceiling.

International

Minor Changes to GILTI, FDII and BEAT

The OBBBA slightly reduces the Section 250 deduction currently allowed to domestic corporations for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) (from 50% to 49.2%) and foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) (from 37.5% to 36.5%). These minor reductions replace the significantly more drastic changes otherwise scheduled to take effect in 2026, which would have reduced the Section 250 deduction for GILTI and FDII to 37.5% and 21.875%, respectively.

The OBBBA also slightly increases the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) rate from 10% to 10.1%, while repealing all changes to BEAT currently scheduled to take effect in 2026. These scheduled changes include an increase in the BEAT rate from 10% to 12.5%, as well as the effective denial of the use of credits to offset BEAT liability.

Beyond these minor rate changes, the OBBBA does not make any broader changes to the currently applicable GILTI, FDII and BEAT regimes, and, apart from Section 899, to the U.S. international tax regime more generally.

Notably, the OBBBA does not include several of the taxpayer-favorable international tax provisions included in Sen. Thom Tillis’ “International Competition for American Jobs Act” (S. 1605), such as the permanent extension of Section 954(c)(6), the restoration of Section 958(b)(4)’s limitation on downward attribution, the elimination of the qualified business asset investment (QBAI) in calculating the FDII deduction, further modifications to the BEAT regime and significant changes to the foreign tax credit regime.

Retaliatory Measures Against ‘Unfair Foreign Taxes’ (Section 899)

The OBBBA includes new Section 899, which incorporates certain parts of the “Defending American Jobs and Investment Act” (H.R. 591) and the “Unfair Tax Prevention Act” (H.R. 2423) proposed earlier this year, with several modifications. Broadly, Section 899 imposes increasingly harsh retaliatory taxes against countries (and individuals and entities resident in, or owned by residents of, such countries (applicable persons)) that have enacted any “unfair foreign tax” (such countries referred to as “discriminatory foreign countries” or “DFCs”).

Section 899 generally increases the current U.S. tax rates imposed on applicable persons by 5% in the first year following enactment, increased by an additional 5% for each subsequent year, with the increases capped at 20% above the statutory rate. Withholding rates are increased roughly in tandem with these increased income tax rates.

Section 899 also imposes severe BEAT consequences against any corporation (domestic or foreign) if more than 50% of such corporation is owned by applicable persons. Finally, Section 899 turns off the application of Section 892(a) to foreign governments of DFCs, thus subjecting income received by such foreign governments from certain U.S. investments to U.S. tax, including withholding tax.

Note: While the fate of Section 899 in the Senate remains unclear, these provisions have the potential to result in significant disruptions and economic costs in a variety of common business transactions and investment structures. The provisions and our initial key takeaways are summarized below in greater detail.

Unfair foreign taxes. Section 899(c) defines “unfair foreign tax” to include any undertaxed profits rule (UTPR), digital services tax (DST) or diverted profits tax, as well as any other tax that Treasury designates as an “extraterritorial tax” or “discriminatory tax” (with such terms further defined in the statute). Thus, UTPRs, DSTs and diverted profits taxes are treated as per se unfair foreign taxes, while Treasury is given some discretion with respect to taxes that are not so labeled. There is also a general exception for any tax that does not apply to any U.S. person (including a trade or business of a U.S. person) or to any controlled foreign corporation (CFC) more than 50% owned by U.S. persons. This exception is generally consistent with recent statements by the administration that Pillar Two can exist “side by side” with the U.S. tax regime, but only if the UTPR does not apply to U.S. persons and their foreign operations.

While prior proposals (e.g., H.R. 591) and analogous provisions of current law (e.g., Section 891) have typically given Treasury or the president discretion to declare taxes discriminatory, Section 899 departs from this mold by rendering certain categories of taxes as per se unfair foreign taxes. This may be driven in part by revenue-scoring conventions, which ordinarily prevent discretionary provisions from being taken into account as revenue-generating.

Further, the inclusion of DSTs and diverted profits taxes as per se unfair foreign taxes is potentially problematic for a couple of reasons.

Even if there is a broader Pillar Two agreement that resolves the administration’s stated concerns around UTPRs, this still leaves the many countries that have enacted DSTs (including Canada, France, Austria and the United Kingdom, among many others) as per se DFCs.

Because the terms “digital services tax” and “diverted profits tax” are not further defined in the OBBBA, it is unclear exactly which taxes are included. As drafted, the OBBBA will put significant pressure on countries that have enacted UTPRs, DSTs and/or diverted profits taxes to eliminate or modify those taxes, and certain foreign countries are already considering such measures. (See our May 20, 2025, client alert “UK Consults on Draft Legislation on Transfer Pricing, Permanent Establishments and Diverted Profits Tax.”)

Applicable persons. Section 899(b) defines “applicable person” broadly to include:

Foreign governments of a DFC.

Certain individuals who are tax residents of a DFC.

Certain foreign corporations that are (i) tax residents of a DFC or (ii) more than 50% owned by other applicable persons.

Certain foreign private foundations and trusts.

Certain foreign partnerships, branches and other entities.

Notably, certain foreign corporations with significant ultimate ownership by U.S. persons are not treated as applicable persons under the OBBBA. The OBBBA also creates significant uncertainty with respect to its application to foreign partnerships and other pass-through entities. Finally, by including foreign governments of DFCs as applicable persons, in addition to eliminating the benefits of Section 892(a) for foreign governments of DFCs, Section 892 investors of DFCs may be impacted much more severely than other applicable persons.

“Super” BEAT. As noted above, the OBBBA can significantly increase the BEAT burden on U.S. subsidiaries (as well as foreign subsidiaries with U.S. operations) within foreign-parented groups. Specifically:

Those corporations will be subject to BEAT without regard to the gross receipts and base erosion percentage tests.

The BEAT rate will be increased from 10% to 12.5%.

BEAT liability cannot be offset by any credits.

Base erosion payments will not be reduced for amounts on which U.S. tax is imposed or withheld, or for payments that would otherwise qualify for the services cost method exception in Section 59A(d)(5).

Certain capitalized amounts will be treated as if those amounts had been deducted, rather than capitalized, for BEAT purposes.

Importantly, the Super BEAT can apply even where the ultimate parent of a foreign group is not itself an applicable person (e.g., the ultimate parent is not an applicable person, but intermediate entities within the group are). Moreover, because both the gross receipts and base erosion percentage thresholds are removed, many foreign-parented groups will be swept into the BEAT regime for the first time.

Note: Foreign-parented groups with any U.S. operations and foreign institutional investors should carefully monitor Section 899 and examine their structures to assess the potential impacts.

Applicability dates. As drafted, Section 899 will become applicable with respect to any DFC during the calendar year beginning on or after the latest of (i) 90 days after enactment, (ii) 180 days after the enactment of the unfair foreign tax that causes such country to be treated as a DFC, or (iii) the first date that an unfair foreign tax of such country begins to apply (the “applicable date”). This delayed applicability is intended to give foreign countries with unfair foreign taxes an opportunity to either eliminate or otherwise modify such taxes so that they do not apply to U.S. persons or to the foreign operations of U.S. persons.

Assuming that the OBBBA is enacted on or before October 3, 2025, Section 899 will take effect on January 1, 2026, for countries that already apply a UTPR, DST or diverted profits tax, unless those taxes are eliminated or sufficiently modified. As of that date, payments to applicable persons with respect to such DFCs will generally be subject to a 5% increase on withholding rates, and applicable persons with respect to such DFCs who are on a calendar U.S. taxable year will become subject to the increased rates and to the Super BEAT.

Notably, while certain payments to applicable persons may become subject to increased withholding as of January 1, 2026, the increased tax rates and the Super BEAT apply to an applicable person only during such person’s first taxable year that begins on or after such date. Applicable persons with a fiscal year other than the calendar year may thus become subject to these rules on a different date, generally using a blended tax rate. This creates potential mismatches between amounts withheld and a taxpayer’s ultimate U.S. tax liability.

Note: Fiscal year taxpayers should carefully monitor any changes in the statutory language regarding applicability dates as well as the ultimate date of enactment, and should assess the impact of any changes in light of their specific circumstances.

Interaction with treaties and other reduced rates. One significant departure from the prior version of Section 899 contained in H.R. 591 is the interaction of the increased tax rates with treaties. While H.R. 591 would have expressly overridden U.S. treaties (e.g., increasing a 5% treaty rate to 35% in the first year of application), Section 899 instead applies the 5% increase to the reduced treaty rate itself. The 20% cap on rate increases, however, is based on the statutory rate, rather than the reduced treaty rate.

For example, assuming that the U.S. withholding rate on U.S.-source interest payments to residents of Country X — a DFC — is reduced to 5% under a treaty, this rate will be increased to 10% in Year 1, 15% in Year 2, and ultimately to 50% (30% statutory rate plus 20%) in Year 9.

Section 899 accomplishes this by applying the rate increase to each “specified rate of tax (or any rate of tax applicable in lieu of such statutory rate).” The House Budget Committee report seeks to clarify this language by stating that it is intended to include both reduced and zero treaty rates, but is not intended to apply to income that is specifically excluded from the application of a specified tax, such as portfolio interest excluded from tax pursuant to Section 871(h).

While this is a helpful clarification with respect to portfolio interest and certain treaty rates, uncertainty remains as to the treatment of other amounts exempt from tax under treaties and other Code sections.

Partnerships

Section 707(a)(2) Revision

In a last-minute (and unexpected) amendment added shortly before the House passed the OBBBA, Section 707(a)(2) was revised so that its substantive terms apply “Except as provided by the Secretary,” as compared to the “Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary” currently included in the statutory language.

Section 707(a)(2) provides rules for “disguised sales” of property or “disguised payments” for services between a partner and a partnership, and rules for disguised sales of property between partners in a partnership. This amendment appears to be intended to ensure Section 707(a)(2) is self-executing and thus eliminates the argument that Section 707(a)(2) is operative only to the extent that Treasury has promulgated final regulations amplifying the provision.

In particular, final regulations currently address partner-to-partnership disguised sales, but no final regulations have been issued on disguised payments or so-called “disguised sales” of partnership interests. Proposed regulations addressing disguised sales were issued in 2004 and withdrawn in 2009. Thus, under this argument, Section 707(a)(2) as currently drafted would have no application to those latter categories of transactions. We understand the IRS’s position is that Section 707(a)(2) is self-executing even as currently drafted.

In terms of practical implications, taxpayer positions related to fee waivers and carried interest should be impacted only to the extent they are premised on the statute not being self-executing. The statutory substance of the disguised sale and payment rules remains unchanged.

Individuals

SALT Cap

The bill increases the individual deduction cap for specified taxes including state and local sales, income and property taxes from $10,000 ($5,000 for married individuals filing separately) to $40,000 in 2025 (50% of that amount for married individuals filing separately) and $40,400 in 2026 (50% of that amount for married individuals filing separately), with additional 1% annual increases through 2033, after which the deduction cap becomes permanent at the 2033 amounts.

The deduction is subject to income limitations: the deduction is reduced, but not below $10,000 ($5,000 for married individuals filing separately), by 30% of the excess of modified adjusted gross income (AGI) over $500,000 in 2025 (50% of that amount for married individuals filing separately) and $505,000 in 2026 (50% of that amount for married individuals filing separately), with additional 1% increases in the income limitations through 2033, after which the income limitations from 2033 become permanent. The cap also applies to “substitute payments,” which are payments made to a tax authority that provide the payor with a tax benefit.

The bill disallows a deduction for specified taxes including state and local sales, income and property taxes made by a partnership in certain industries (generally, businesses that are ineligible for the Section 199A deduction). The bill requires that these tax payments be separately stated items, and in so doing, abrogates Notice 2020-75, which effectively authorized the pass-through entity tax (PTET) provisions enacted by various states.

Section 199A Deduction

The Section 199A deduction for certain “qualified business income” earned by noncorporate taxpayers is made permanent with an increase in the deduction to 23% (for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025), from 20% currently. The application of the Section 199A deduction is also expanded to certain interest dividends from qualified business development companies (a change apparently intended to cover regulated investment companies that engage in loan origination), in addition to its current application to:

Qualified business income.

Qualified publicly traded partnership income.

Qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends.

Income of, or received from, certain agricultural and horticultural cooperatives.

The OBBBA further replaces the existing phase-in of W-2 wages, capital investment and specified services trades or businesses for taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts and indexes such threshold amounts for inflation for taxable years after 2025.

Note: The OBBBA does not include any change to the tax treatment of carried interests.

Gift and Estate Tax Exemption

Based on the OBBBA, the estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer tax exemption amounts will be $15 million per person beginning in the 2026 tax year (an increase from the $13.99 million exemption amount in effect for 2025). The exemption amounts will continue to be indexed for inflation. The increased exemption amounts will be permanent.

Energy

In respect of the renewable energy credits that were previously introduced, extended or expanded under the IRA, the OBBBA introduces substantial cuts through:

Acceleration of the phase-out schedules.

Restrictions on foreign-parented entities claiming credits.

Elimination of transferability for certain credits.

The deepest cuts were made to the technology-neutral credits in Section 45Y and Section 48E through a manager’s amendment to the OBBBA released on May 21, 2025, which provides that the credits will not be available for facilities that begin construction 60 days after the enactment of the bill. While nuclear facilities were spared from that tight phase-out, it will severely impact the development of new wind and solar projects.

The OBBBA also sets forth several novel rules, including that certain prohibited foreign entities are not able to claim Section 45X advanced manufacturing credits, Section 45Y production tax credits, Section 48E investment tax credits, Section 45Q carbon capture credits or Section 45U nuclear credits, and that, starting in 2026, Section 45Y production tax credits and Section 48E investment tax credits will not be able to be claimed in respect of residential rooftop solar systems that are leased to homeowners.

Note: Senators have indicated the possibility that changes may be in store for one or more of these cuts to the credits but, given the uncertain outcome, developers would be prudent to plan beginning construction, within the meaning of IRS guidance, as soon as possible on new projects.

Other Proposals

Endowment Tax

Under current law, certain private college and university endowments are subject to a 1.4% excise tax on their net investment income. The OBBBA introduces a tiered rate structure, with rate brackets from 1.4% to 21%, based on the size of an endowment on a per student basis. In determining the number of students, only U.S. citizens and permanent residents are counted. Under current law, international students also are counted in determining the size of an endowment on a per student basis.

Additional changes to the current endowment tax include:

An exemption for religious institutions.

An expansion of the definition of net investment income to include student loan interest income and certain royalty income.

The imposition of certain reporting requirements with respect to the number of the institution’s students.

The OBBBA also grants Treasury broad authority to prescribe regulations or other guidance to prevent avoidance of the tax.

These modifications to the endowment tax will apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Net Investment Income Tax on Certain Private Foundations

Under current law, private foundations are subject to a 1.39% excise tax on their net investment income. The OBBBA introduces a tiered rate structure, with rate brackets from 1.39% to 10%, depending on the value of a foundation’s assets. For purposes of determining the value of a private foundation’s assets, related foundations are aggregated. The new net investment income tax rates are effective for taxable years beginning after the OBBBA is enacted.

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA renews and expands the Opportunity Zone provisions under Sections 1400Z-1 and 1400Z-2. In addition to modifications to the definition of low-income communities and to Opportunity Zone investment incentives, the OBBBA provides a new round of Qualified Opportunity Zone designations effective for 2027-33.

In general, the certification will follow a process similar to the prior iteration, with nominations from states and certification by the secretary of the Treasury. There will be more emphasis on rural areas.

The OBBBA provides a new category of Qualified Rural Opportunity Funds, which will have a 30% basis increase for investments held for at least five years (compared to 10% for a regular Qualified Opportunity Fund).

Note: While there is some time until the new Opportunity Zone regime goes into effect, potential investors should consider how the enhancements may fit into their overall tax strategy.

Finally, the OBBBA imposes enhanced reporting obligations on qualified funds and qualified businesses within those funds for taxable years beginning after the enactment date.

This year’s most important highlight demonstrates a pivotal milestone: We reduced our data center energy emissions by 12%.

Delivering record clean energy while investing in future energy breakthroughs

Despite a 27% increase in electricity demand to power our data centers, we successfully decoupled our operational energy growth from its associated carbon emissions. This was largely due to more than 25 clean energy projects we’d contracted over the past several years — some as far back as 2019 — coming online in 2024. Together, they added 2.5 gigawatts of new clean energy to the grids that served our operations last year. That’s roughly equivalent to more than 4 million solar panels. This record investment pushed our carbon-free energy use from 64% to 66% on an hourly basis, proving that with focused effort, it’s possible to power AI and all our products and operations with cleaner energy as we scale.

We continue to build on these gains. In 2024, we made our largest-ever procurement of clean energy, adding 8 gigawatts to our portfolio, more than we’ve ever done in a single year. But you can’t run the future on yesterday's infrastructure and grid. Powering the next wave of innovation — especially AI — requires us to solve some of the most significant challenges of our time: not only generating vast amounts of clean, reliable energy, but also using it efficiently.

So we’re focused on building and operating the world’s most energy-efficient data center infrastructure, optimizing our models and hardware to use less electricity, and pushing the frontiers of advanced energy development.

In 2024, Google data centers used 84% less overhead energy than the industry average. And we’re leading the industry in making AI models better, faster and more efficient, for example through techniques like quantization which have sped up large-language model training efficiency by 39%. Ironwood is our seventh-generation and most powerful, capable, and energy efficient Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) — using nearly 30 times less energy than our first Cloud TPU from 2018.

We’re also actively investing in the creation of next-generation solutions like advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal. These powerful energy sources ensure we can continue to promote economic growth and, most importantly, build and deliver the benefits of AI to people all over the world.

Progressing toward our climate moonshots required broader change

We’ve always set bold ambitions for ourselves — what we call “moonshots.” But as we head toward 2030, it's clear that the challenges are increasingly complex and it’s important to be up front about the hurdles we’re facing.

The reality is, while our data center energy emissions are down, total emissions — encompassing the activities of third parties in our supply chain that we rely on — have increased by 11% year-on-year.

This is largely driven by the emissions from our supply chain as we continue to grow, as well as the fact that we operate globally, and the world isn’t decarbonizing fast enough or at a uniform pace. In some key regions, like parts of Asia Pacific, the grid is still in the early days of its clean energy transition. For both Google and our suppliers, we can’t outpace the infrastructure that isn’t available on the ground, which is why we’re partnering with others to accelerate solutions.

When it comes to the next-generation clean technologies we need — the solutions that go beyond wind and solar like enhanced geothermal, advanced nuclear, nuclear fusion, and more — they’re still in their early stages. They’re not yet deployed at the scale required and can remain expensive to get online.",https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/EnvironmentalReview_Hero.width-1300.png,N,,2025-06-27 20:07:15.609245

""We’re behind - and it's all hands on deck. We need to be doing everything in our power to win this race, because this is the race that really matters.""

Interest in building new nuclear plants has spiked after President Donald Trump issued executive orders last month that aim to fast track applications for new reactors and overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Nuclear critics and some proponents have criticized the overhaul as potentially detrimental to the industry and putting politics ahead of safety and public health. Trump this month also fired Democratic NRC commissioner Chris Hanson.

Fermi said the Amarillo campus has the potential to deliver up to 11 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear, gas and solar power, about enough for more than 8.2 million homes, with 1 GW expected online by late 2026. It did not say how much the project would cost or how it is being financed.

Fermi said the project will be the largest U.S. nuclear power complex, but did not say when it would be completed. U.S. nuclear power has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with the last reactor coming online last year in Georgia.

The last two reactors completed in Vogtle, Georgia, cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration

The NRC said it is reviewing applications from Fermi which should be public soon. The Washington Post said the project has applied for four 1-GW nuclear reactors. Fermi did not immediately confirm that.

The nearly 5,800-acre (2,347-hectare) campus will also have capacity for large artificial intelligence data centers.

What You’ll Learn in This Episode:

How Texas slashed outage risk by 95% thanks to solar and battery storage

Why gas is not the fastest way to add power even though some people continue to falsely insist it is

How fossil fuel companies are using renewables to cut costs

The simple math of supply, demand, and rising prices without a credible backup plan

📺 Watch on YouTube:

Why It Matters:

Demand is up 25% since 2021: rapid growth not seen since the ’60s

Without tax credits, supply tightens, prices go up, and grid reliability suffers

Gas turbines aren’t coming fast enough, nuclear is years away

Seriously, over the next 4-5 years, where is the power going to come from if not from wind, solar, and storage? It’s not a rhetorical question and they can’t answer it.

They’ve said LNG power plants, but those don’t exist. They’ve said nuclear but that’s 2030’s at best. They’ve said gas plants, but good luck getting a turbine.

Final Thought

If policymakers want to kill clean energy incentives, they need a plan to replace the power. Because without one, consumers will pay more, grid reliability will suffer, and elected officials will face a backlash.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iPEy!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F166995917%2F88556f90-b9aa-488a-a1aa-d62ce272afda%2Ftranscoded-1751053527.png",N,,2025-06-27 17:10:07.315437

“A recent quote I saw, without group solar [cost savings], was $30,000.” How it works Jeff Schneider, solar program coordinator with MREA, said group buy solar assists with the initial cost of installing panels.
The majority of homeowners cannot afford to pay for solar panels in cash and instead choose to finance them.
“After that time … you’re achieving the same savings every year but you’re not paying off your solar panels any longer so those savings will often be in the thousands per year.” Federal incentives are another attractive piece of considering whether to install solar panels.","Ecology Action Center [EAC] in Normal is bringing back a program to McLean County that offers residents solar panel installation below market cost.

EAC Energy Coordinator Michael Bay said they did partner with the state in recent years for the Illinois Shines program, but they were not able to partner with any other organization during that time.

“But our partnership with Illinois Shines ended, I believe, at the end of last year, which gave us the opportunities to partner with MREA again and restart the program,” Bay said. “And we want to do it with them because it’s been a successful program … so we wanted to get started again.”

At the core of a group buy program for solar panels is long-term cost savings. The partnership between EAC and MREA comes as summer heat is in full swing and energy prices are rising sharply in the Bloomington-Normal area. They are expected to continue rising after an April notice from the Twin Cities informed residents Constellation Energy was raising rates by 40%.

Even with the cost savings that producing a home’s own energy can provide, the initial installation of panels can still carry a hefty price tag.

Bay said several factors influence how much it can cost.

“There’s no standard cost, it just depends on how much space is on the roof, how many panels you can fit on there and then take into account issues like the orientation of the roof, shading, etc.,” he said. “A recent quote I saw, without group solar [cost savings], was $30,000.”

How it works

Jeff Schneider, solar program coordinator with MREA, said group buy solar assists with the initial cost of installing panels.

“A solar group buy is a process in which a group of consumers come together to purchase solar at a cost that is below what they would be able to receive on the open market when going solar by themselves,” he said. “In addition to that lower base price, the group buy involves volume-based rebates that are reached as more participants go solar in the program.”

Schneider said representatives from the community choose an installer themselves which agrees to offer them parts and construction at the below-market cost. This initiative will buy from StraightUp Solar.

Schneider said a homeowner’s bill will change as soon as the next bill after installation.

“Immediately, you’ll see a reduction in your bills as soon as your next monthly bill, because you’ve generated the significant amount of energy yourself, especially during these sunny summer months,” he said.

Schneider said the benefit to a homeowner’s pocketbook is really felt years after the installation. The majority of homeowners cannot afford to pay for solar panels in cash and instead choose to finance them. Once they finish doing so, he said they save more.

“While they’re paying less for their electricity costs, they’re also paying off their solar array, but in the Illinois market you often see a return on investment of around seven years,” Schneider said. “After that time … you’re achieving the same savings every year but you’re not paying off your solar panels any longer so those savings will often be in the thousands per year.”

Federal incentives are another attractive piece of considering whether to install solar panels. One of the largest is a credit passed under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. It covers up to 30% of the cost of homeowner’s installing a renewable energy source, including solar.

Schneider said if President Donald Trump’s reconciliation bill passed in its current form, it would claw back that credit. It is only guaranteed through the end of the year, and that will affect new applicants to the program.

“We’re going to make sure that we do not accept anyone into the program if it will be too late for them to get installed in time for the end of the year to take advantage of the 30% tax credit,” he said.

Trump’s bill, also known as the One Big, Beautiful Bill, passed in the House and is under consideration in the Senate. Trump has said he wants his signature on the bill no later than July 4.

In order to ensure that no members of the program go without the tax credit, Schneider said MREA is depending on the chosen installer, StraightUp Solar.

“They have a very good idea of how many projects they can handle and will stop taking on new leads for the Grow Solar program if they think that they are getting more than they can handle before the end of the year,” he said. “So the plan is no one who will who goes solar through our program should be without the tax credit. They will be able to take advantage of that 30%.”

How to learn more

To educate the community on the tax credits, cost and benefits of going solar, MREA and ECA host Solar Power Hours.

“An important part of how the programs are successful is the MREA can be a trusted third-party delivering education and not trying to give a sales pitch, and instead just saying, ‘We want to give you the education and if you’re looking to go forward, here’s a highly vetted, local installer that’s endorsed by the community,’” Schneider said.

Schneider said the last event drew in 500 guests. He said while not all will choose to go solar soon, they might choose to later.

“Maybe they need a new roof, maybe the finances aren’t there now but they will be in the future,” he said. “Those people who attended, they’re potential solar buyers in the future and they might participate in the future program.”

The educational sessions are on Zoom and in person through July and August.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd448a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/622x327+0+21/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2F96%2F3e4ee08b4186806ffaced8614bf8%2Fscreenshot-2025-06-27-130454.png,N,,2025-06-27 18:14:21.172045

Read More: It’s time to start recommending some Tesla Powerwall alternatives","Hurricanes, wildfires, and triple-digit heat domes are stressing America’s energy grid like never before, with millions experiencing rolling blackouts and brownouts as they struggle to keep their collective cool. As rooftop solar and home batteries show up in more and more places, however, we’re building something bigger than a backup: a virtual power plant that can keep things running when the grid can’t.

Imagine a network of hundreds, or even thousands of interconnected batteries, all networked together and coordinated with advanced distribution software to operate like a single store of energy, able to move energy from one battery to another, instantly, as soon as it’s needed, in a way that’s hardly noticeable to the people involved.

Got that in your head? Good. That distributed energy resource (DER) you’re imagining now is called a “virtual power plant,” or VPP.

Virtual power plants are a win-win solution that flips our traditional energy model on its head—instead of utilities spending billions on new infrastructure and passing those costs to ratepayers, VPPs allow homeowners to step in to help the grid keep electricity prices stable and prevent grid blackouts. It essentially turns neighborhoods into their own power plants, so we’re not forced to purchase expensive power from facilities miles away. This keeps money in our pockets and our grid more stable, which feels like common sense in a world where our electricity demand and prices keep climbing.

And, as more Americans bring solar power and home battery backup systems online, they’re building a new kind of fast, distributed, grid support — one that’s already sitting in people’s garages and basements.

“We’ve been piloting the way in which we should do this for 30 years,” explains Jigar Shah, former Director of the Loan Programs Office in the US Department of Energy said on the Plugged In podcast earlier this week. “The utility says, ‘We need to be able to upgrade the distribution grid so that you can do whatever you want. You can turn every single thing on in your house at the same time, and we have to be able to serve you.’ That bargain is getting way too expensive. We can’t keep upgrading the distribution grid … What (the utilities) need to do is to figure out how to help work with customers to say, ‘Hey, we need you to opt into load flexibility, in a way that isn’t noticeable to you, and that requires cultural change.”

The good news is that that “cultural change” is already happening.

We’ve got the juice

At last year’s Solar & Energy Storage Summit in San Francisco, Wood McKenzie delivered an in-depth assessment of the current state of the US distributed solar-plus-storage market and showed that the attachment rate (the number of people adding a battery to their home solar system) had quadrupled since Q1 2020, growing from 6% in Q1 2020 to 25% in Q1 2024. That number has continued to climb, driven in large part by the Tesla Powerwall, which is being produced at the staggering rate of nearly 700,000 units per year. That same report forecasts 10 GW of residential storage capacity will be installed between by 2028, with the residential segment constituting about 80% of all DERs.

Those Powerwall installations are paying off, too — and not just for the utilities who are able the leverage the distributed energy resource/VPP aspect, but for their owners, too. And I mean “pay off” in the most literal sense, with Tesla having paid out $9.9 million to Powerwall customers in 2024 alone.

Following the pilot program, Tesla and PG&E, the electric utility covering Northern California, launched the first official virtual power plant through the Tesla app.

This new version of the Tesla Virtual Power Plant actually compensates Powerwall owners $2 per kWh that they contribute to the grid during emergency load reduction events. Homeowners are expected to get between $10 and $60 per event.

Later, we reported that Tesla’s California VPP expanded to Southern California Edison (SCE) to now cover most of the state.

Last year, Tesla’s California VPPs reached over 100 MW in capacity, and the company also started building significant VPPs in Texas.

The growth of battery backup power isn’t just about emergency prepping or lowering your own energy costs, in other words. It’s about avoiding the multi-billion-dollar cost of constantly expanding and reinforcing the existing grid by optimizing the system we already have.

And, by shifting demand loads away from peak demand periods and creating a store of clean solar and wind energy that would otherwise be curtailed (read: wasted), VPPs also help utilities decarbonize by reducing the need for “peaker plants” that run on fossil fuels.

With smart policies, the right incentives, and willing utility partners, each new home battery can eventually become a tiny piece of a decentralized, more affordable, and more reliable grid — one that can flex, adapt, and support itself in real time.

Too bad we (probably) won’t have those for much longer.

In particular, Secretary Duffy’s U.S. Department of Transportation, aligned with Executive Orders from President Trump, has signaled a shift away from climate and equity provisions and towards a focus on families, economic impact, and efficient project delivery. (The unusual thing about the current Administration is not a new set of grant priorities, but a willingness to reach back and judge some of the prior Administration’s grant selectees on the new criteria.)

While applicants for federal discretionary grants can adapt language in their applications and formula funds have been released for FY25, the new Administration has also brought uncertainty for some competitive grant awardees and applicants. USDOT is currently a third of the way through its review of previously awarded but unobligated funds from the Biden Administration, leaving two-thirds of previously awarded projects awaiting approval for obligation. Pauses in the obligation of funds for review of programs and threats to potentially freeze funds for certain applicants have resulted in legal action against the Administration by some states and cities. This article provides an overview of actions taken by the Administration impacting discretionary funding, examples of changes to new notice of funding opportunities, and how cities and states have responded to these changes.

Timeline of actions taken by the agency from the start of the administration till now

January

At the start of the Administration, Secretary Duffy published a memo, “Implementation of Executive Orders Addressing Energy, Climate Change, Diversity, and Gender,” outlining how USDOT planned to implement early Executive Orders (EOs) impacting the agency including, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions (EO 14148), Ending Racial and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing (EO 14151), Unleashing American Energy (EO 14154), and Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government (EO 14168). The memo revoked DOT Orders on the Department of Transportation Equity Council, the Climate Change Adaption and Resilience Policy for DOT Operational Assets, and the USDOT Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations. The memo also called for a cut to funding for any programs or rules related to “climate change, environmental justice, greenhouse gas emissions, racial equity, gender identity, the Justice 40 initiative, and DEI.”

Secretary Duffy also issued the memo, “Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department of Transportation Policies, Programs, and Activities,” setting out new administrative priorities in the competitive grant process, including encouraging projects with user-payer models and projects maximizing economic opportunity and quality of life for families. The memo also outlined prioritization of projects in local economic opportunity zones and in communities with higher marriage and birth rates. USDOT is also prioritizing projects from applicants who comply with immigration enforcement, do not have vaccine or mask mandates, and avoid local political objectives unaligned with federal interests. The “Ensuring Reliance Upon Sound Economic Analysis in Department of Transportation Policies, Programs, and Activities,” memo also outlines that applicants must utilize rigorous economic analysis and cost benefit analysis. On the other hand, the memo emphasizes a shift away from social cost of carbon calculations and other calculations focused on equity and climate.

February

In February, FHWA sent states a letter saying previously approved plans for deployment of National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) projects needed re-approval. The letter stated that no new obligations would occur until new program guidance is released and new plans are submitted and approved.

In February, the agency removed FHWA’s approval for NYC’s congestion pricing program and announced a review of California’s high speed rail development to assess the potential removal of $4 billion in obligated federal dollars for the project.

A DOT directive ordered all new State and Metropolitan Improvement Plan amendments to be reviewed by USDOT headquarters in addition to existing review by FHWA division and FTA regional offices. However, this additional review stage was removed within a couple of weeks.

March

In March, Secretary Duffy sent an memo to all USDOT offices calling for review and potential rescission of awarded but not yet obligated projects from the previous Administration to ensure alignment with the Administration’s priorities and executive orders. The email specifically called out projects focused on bicycle infrastructure, green infrastructure, and electric vehicle charging.

Secretary Duffy rescinded Biden-era memos focused on social and environmental justice which he described said pushed state agencies to incorporate social and environmental agendas into infrastructure project decisions.

Secretary Duffy sent letters to New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) urging them to reduce crime and fare evasion or risk reductions in federal funding.

April

On April 24th, Secretary Duffy released a letter alerting “All Recipients of U.S. Department of Transportation Funding,” that USDOT funds are contingent upon recipients’ compliance with federal law, in particular with federal immigration enforcement. The letter also said projects and contractors must utilize “merit-based” hiring practices, must utilize only legally permitted workers, and said funds cannot be distributed based upon DEI categorizations. The letter also warned that USDOT may complete audits and potentially take back funding if unauthorized activities are discovered. A federal court in Rhode Island issued a nationwide injunction against enforcement of Duffy’s memo on June 19, but today’s Supreme Court ruling banning nationwide injunctions may affect the Rhode Island injunction soon.

May

My early May, 329 of the unobligated grants were approved. On May 15th, USDOT announced the approval of an additional 76 infrastructure grants, bringing the total number of approval of paused funds to nearly $5 billion. This is 13% of the announced but not advanced projects from the previous Administration. In late May, USDOT also allocated over $1.5 billion from the Federal Highway Administration’s Emergency Relief program for infrastructure repairs across states and territories impacted by natural disasters.

June

On June 10, USDOT announced the clearance of 529 additional infrastructure grants previously approved by the Biden-Administration, totaling over $2.9 billion. This brought the new Administration to a total of clearing 1,065 of the 3,200 projects in the unobligated backlog. Obligated projects covered a variety of programs including but not limited to the Airport Improvement Supplemental, the Bridge Investment Program, the National Scenic Byways Program, Consolidated Infrastructure and Safety Improvements, Federal-State Partnership, Ferry Service for Rural Communities, and the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Grant.

New Notices of Funding Opportunities (NOFOs)

Under the new Administration, the Notices of Funding Opportunities have started to be released for FY 2025 including for Safe Streets for All (SS4A), BUILD (formerly RAISE), FTA Low or No Emission Grant Program and the Grants for Buses and Bus Facilities Competitive Program, the Bridge Investment Program, the Competitive Highway Bridge Program, Strengthening Mobility and Revolutionizing Transportation (SMART), Regional Infrastructure Accelerators Program (RIA), High Priority-Commercial Motor Vehicle (HP-CMV), and the Buses and Bus Facility Competitive Grant Program.

SS4A (Safe Streets and Roads for All)

In March, the NOFO for the FY25 round of Safe Streets and Roads for All was released. USDOT updated its frequently asked questions to include those related to changes in award considerations. The FAQs also reassured previous grantees that they did not need to reapply and “The USDOT is working diligently to execute previous year grant agreements.” The FAQs also clarified that applicants that while new award considerations will be utilized to prioritize highly rated applications, applicants will not be disadvantaged for Action Plans containing elements that are no longer required.

RAISE/BUILD

In January, the Trump Administration renamed Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) to Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) and reduced available funding for the first FY25 round from $1.5 billion to $150 million. Applicants were given the opportunity to revise their materials ahead of the January 30, 2025 deadline to align with changes made to the program including requirements for grants and contracts to be in compliance with the new Executive Orders. The NOFO specifically highlights alignment with terms in compliance with Section 3(C)(iv) of EO Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity and defining Historically Disadvantaged Communities as Areas of Persistent Poverty. Applicants were given till January 30th to update their applications.

FY25 Bus and Low-No Bus Funding

In May, USDOT announced $1.5 billion in available funds for the FY25 Buses and Bus Facilities and Low or No Emission bus competitive grant programs. The updated NOFO removed language related to sustainability, environmental justice, and equity and requires applicants to explain how their projects will contribute to more accessible jobs, healthcare, and retail, particularly for families with young children. However, the maximum federal share for the grants still increases based upon compliance with the Clean Air Act and for accessibility measures for those with disabilities. For the Low Emission/No Emission Bus Grant Program, there will be a greater prioritization of low-emission projects over zero-emissions projects.

FHWA’s Bridge Investment Program and Competitive Highway Bridge Program

In late May, USDOT announced the funding opportunity for the FHWA’s Bridge Investment Program and Competitive Highway Bridge Program to deliver upgrades to approximately 42,000 bridges. In the funding announcement, Secretary Duffy said the removal of requirements around DEI and climate will help to expedite the project delivery process. Applicants were provided with redlined versions of the NOFOs with the changes from previous funding rounds for both programs.

State and City Responses

As typical for administration changes, states and cities must adapt to changing language and prioritizations in discretionary grant programs. For example, the Transportation Policy Board for the Thurston Regional Planning Council voted to change their transportation plan to better align with new administrative priorities. A board member stated, “It really is crazy times right now, but being in compliance, I think, is what is best for our constituents, because these are important projects that are needed in our community.”

In addition to the removal of climate and equity-based priorities in applications, states have also had to adapt to meeting new priorities such as a focus on increasing transportation access for families. While the removal of language around diversity and sustainability language was not a surprise, the novel preferences around high marriage and birth rates brought confusion for some states. States have also needed to prioritize economic analysis in applications and shifted to using the statutory definition of Areas of Persistent Poverty instead of the U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Income Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) used under the Biden-Administration.

In response to the amended BUILD NOFO, The City of Milwaukee was able to work over a weekend to update their application to meet the new priorities, but representatives raised concerns about the competitiveness of the more limited funding pool.

States and cities waiting for approval of unobligated funds have been placed in a holding pattern such as Knoxville’s pedestrian bridge. Some states and cities have expressed concern over delays and uncertainty in receiving previously announced funds. At a National League of Cities meeting in March, Athens, Ohio Mayor Steven Patterson said, “We were under contract. Now we have to explain to people that we’re in a holding pattern until this [funding] frees up and we are able to deploy something that is vitally needed to anyone who has an EV.” In the City of Portland’s webpage on federal policy impacts stated, “The City will continue to monitor decisions at the federal level and respond to the changing grants landscape. While any long-term impacts remain unclear, potential outcomes could be delays in reimbursements and project work, modifications in grant terms, or attempts at contract cancellations.”

On the other hand, In Utah, a trio of multimillion dollar grants were under review in April, but UDOT officials were not concerned about project delays or changes. UDOT spokesperson John Cleason said, “It’s common for any administration to review and evaluate how those federal funds are being spent.”

Some states and cities have begun to explore ways initiatives being deprioritized can continue without federal funding. A group of states including California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, and Pennsylvania joined together to promote transit, bicycle, and recreational infrastructure in the face of potential federal funding cuts under the Clean Rides Network. King County Metro in Seattle is still working towards its goal of a 2035 transition to fully electric buses but is completing analysis on how administrative changes will “support or hinder that transition.”

Some cities and states have responded to the pauses in funding through coordinated political or legal action. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Official’s sent a letter in early March along with certain state DOTs asking for reimbursement requests to be paid right away to avoid cash flow challenges for state DOTs.

A group of cities including Nashville, Columbus, and San Diego and nonprofits sued the Administration over the March memo pausing projects with a focus on climate and equity as a violation of the Impoundment Control Act.

In May a coalition of 20 Democratic attorney generals filed two federal lawsuits in response to Secretary Duffy and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s threats to withhold federal funds with states that do not comply with federal immigration enforcement. On June 19, a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction preventing USDOT from utilizing cooperation with federal immigration law as a condition of federal grants.

Sixteen states along with the District of Columbia and a number of environmental organizations sued the Trump Administration over the freezing the funds in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Infrastructure Formula Program. U.S. District Judge Tana Lin issued a preliminary injunction, likely to be appealed, restoring $5 billion in funding to 14 states.

New York City successfully sued the removal of approval for its Congestion Pricing Program, allowing for the continuation of the program. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman ruled that USDOT could not immediately stop congestion pricing and that it could not withhold funding due to its dislike of congestion pricing program.

Connecticut and Texas have developed partnerships with USDOT in alignment with the Administration’s goal to expedite project delivery. The Connecticut Department of Transportation and Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office entered an agreement with the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration, giving the state authority to accelerate review of transportation projects impacting historic properties under Section 106 of the National Preservation Act. Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said, “By streamlining environmental reviews and cutting government red tape, we can more efficiently advance projects and ultimately reduce costs.”

The Texas Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration announced an agreement in June enabling Texas to take greater ownership of environmental permitting requirements for bridge and highway projects. The agreement also included the removal of several reporting requirements, references to rescinded Council on Environmental Quality regulations, removing FHWA as a party to programmatic agreements, and removing Biden Era project delivery requirements.

Most U.S. mandates have been repealed by the new EPA.
EVs sales continue their decline.
In April, with new car sales up 10%, EV sales were down 5%.
New and used car prices have risen thousands of dollars because of these government EV mandates.","As with the early 1900s, electric vehicles as a competitor to conventional gasoline and diesel-powered (internal combustion engine) cars are just about done. EVs are not ready for prime time.

As I have related in prior columns, in 1900 and for a few years thereafter, EVs dominated the “car” market with a 38% market share compared to ICE car sales holding just 22% of the market. But in a purely competitive market with no government interference, by 1905 EVs had just 7% of the market while improved ICE cars dominated — and that’s with crank starters. By 1911, when Charles Kettering invented the electric starter for Cadillac, EVs were sold in liveries and department stores next to the buggy whips.

Since about 2012, when Tesla introduced the Model S, governments have been mandating EVs. Many European countries with dictating governments have mandated the EV as the only form of automobile while banishing ICE vehicles. And in the United States, this was attempted under the Biden administration with mandates banishing ICE vehicles by 2035. Congress has recently repealed (a resolution signed by the president) the California mandate to banish ICE cars by 2035.

Going back to the Tesla, it was and is a terrific looking and performing car but it came with huge baggage, range and refueling anxiety. More than 12 years since the Model S, there is still no significant recharging infrastructure in the U.S., even after the promise by the Biden Admin to build 50,000 new charging stations for about $8 billion. Biden is gone (has been for about four years) and his legacy will be seven working charging stations — about a $1 billion apiece.

Most U.S. mandates have been repealed by the new EPA. The Big, Beautiful Bill will cut the $300 billion to $1 trillion in $7,500-$10,000 government buyer tax credits. Think of it as a scheme to transfer money from lower and middle class taxpayers to wealthy taxpayers, as EVs are more expensive than their ICE counterparts.

EVs sales continue their decline. In April, with new car sales up 10%, EV sales were down 5%. In 2024 EVs had just 7% of new car sales and that’s with huge incentives paid by the manufacturers and, of course, the government. Without them, dealers can’t give them away. Rivian sales were down by 50% in April with the average Rivian stickering for $88,000. And Rivians are also great driving cars, but range and refueling issues detract markedly from their utility.

The government shouldn’t be making choices for us. It is an extreme loss of freedom. What if the government offered $7,500 tax credits if you buy a new Ford Explorer. What do you think would happen to the sales of its competitors? They would crater. Even sales of other Ford products, like Broncos, would suffer. One other market maneuver might happen as did some 50 years ago with Harley Davidson when our government put an import tax on foreign motorcycles. Because Honda, Yamaha and other motorcycles saw 25% price increases, Harley could also raise its prices, and did so by about $1,000 a bike. In the case of the Explorer, a $7,500 incentive could raise Explorer prices by a like amount, effectively giving the Ford the incentive money.

So, with the repeal of government mandates and government interference incentives, where is the car/truck market going?

Toyota had it right — the mild hybrid (not plug-in hybrids), as in the original Prius. Mild hybrids with a small electric motor and battery to supplement the ICE engine improve fuel economy by 20-25%, especially in urban driving. In highway driving not so much, but there still is an improvement (5-10%). Mild hybrids have a small weight penalty (about 150 pounds), improved performance, very smooth operation and essentially no drawbacks, such as range and refueling anxiety and interior storage. Most interestingly, the first hybrid car using a gas engine to charge the batteries was designed and built in 1901 by Ferdinand Porsche.

As such, Toyota has only recently introduced an EV, the BZ4X, which has remained its slowest selling vehicle. It will more than likely be the last pure EV produced by Toyota.

EVs will remain a niche market. Their performance, quiet, smoothness and handling are remarkable. They are expensive and their range and refueling will, for the foreseeable future, be a huge impediment to capture more than 7-10% of new car sales. Most buyers of EVs have a conventional ICE vehicle as well, as do all my neighbors with Teslas.

The sad news is that you, the consumer, are paying for this government interference in your life. New and used car prices have risen thousands of dollars because of these government EV mandates. Ford, GM and others have spent (wasted) tens of billions of dollars as a result. One of the first lessons of economics: the marketplace is where winners and losers are chosen, not the government.

""As our energy dependency on fossil fuels goes down, our energy security goes up.","While a precarious ceasefire is currently holding between Iran and Isreal, the escalating conflict between the two nations over recent weeks has brought global energy security back into the spotlight.

In response to US attacks on its nuclear facilities, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping passage for global energy supplies.

Such a move has the potential to disrupt access to fossil fuels for countries around the world and send energy prices soaring. Roughly 20% of the world’s liquefied natural gas and almost 27% of its crude oil passes through the narrow waterway connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman.

Many argue that transitioning away from fossil fuels is crucial not only for the climate but for energy security, with homegrown renewables offering stable power amid geopolitical tensions.

What is energy security and why is it important?

Energy security refers to uninterrupted access to power at an affordable price, according to the autonomous intergovernmental International Energy Agency.

The lifeblood of modern economies, energy is vital for everything from manufacturing, transport and communication, to education and agriculture.

As such, disruptions to supply can bring industries grinding to a halt, hinder essential services like healthcare, and even compromise national security by hampering military operations.

In the 1970s, disruptions to oil exports led to sharp rises in prices, long lines at gas stations, and shook the global economy. More recently, the energy crisis following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, revealed Europe’s energy vulnerability due to its reliance on imported Russian gas.

Are renewables more stable than fossil fuels?

The latest Iran-Israel conflict further underlines the global dependence on oil imports, according to experts at the UK-based energy think tank Ember.

According to their analysis of IEA data, 79% of the world’s population lives in oil-importing countries, with 62 sourcing all of their oil from other countries. 90 nations — including Spain, South Korea, Germany, Turkey and India — rely on imports for more than 80% of their needs.

In climates of unstable global trade and mounting geopolitical tensions, such reliance on imports can lead to energy security risks, says Ember. And upset in fossil fuel markets causes price volatility for all countries reliant on oil and gas.

Renewables, experts say, can offer a stable and secure alternative. They can generate power within a country’s borders or nearby neighboring countries, thereby shielding against price volatility or geopolitical risks. Diversifying power supply options is seen as a key part of a resilient energy system.

No place like home — even for energy

Research from the International Monetary Fund also indicates that over the past decades, most fossil-fuel producing countries have become more politically risky and exhibit less democratic freedom.

""The more we have home grown energy sources the better,"" says Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, emphasizing the need to secure energy ""not from one single country, not from one single trade route, and not from one single company.""

Birol highlights how energy security is an increasingly important driver for the transition to clean power.

""As our energy dependency on fossil fuels goes down, our energy security goes up. That is the lesson we have learnt in Europe,"" said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, at a summit on the future of energy security in April this year.

Von der Leyen said that in response to the energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe had accelerated the ""roll-out of home-grown renewable energy"", which now accounts for 47% of the electricity mix.

Does the clean energy transition bring its own new risks?

The path to greater energy security includes both shifting to more localized renewables and expanding electrification, according to Ember, an approach they highlight China as following.

Their estimates suggest fossil fuel imports could be reduced 70% globally by increasing electric vehicles, heat pumps and renewable energy. Boosting EVs could help replace 33% of imported oil and ramping up wind and solar for power generation could save a further 23%.

They add that 92% of the world’s population can meet more than ten times their energy needs with renewables.

There are, however, also risks associated with the green transition.

In April a large blackout across Spain and parts of Portugal raised questions about the stability of renewables like solar and wind that rely on specific weather conditions. Shortly before the event, renewables accounted for around 70% of Spain's electricity production.

However, the government has since stated that a combination of planning issues and technical faults caused the outage and said there was no evidence an excess of renewables played a role.

And when it comes to the potential intermittency of renewables, according to the IMF, there are already very advanced solutions to make the electricity system more robust and flexible, including investing in grid infrastructure and energy storage.

There are concerns that the shift to clean energy could also bring a new import dependency for metals and minerals needed to build renewable infrastructure and storage.

However, experts say a shortage of transition materials wouldn't create an energy crisis like it would in the case of fossil fuels, as they are only needed for expanded capacity rather than ongoing power generation.

Investigations have revealed cases of serious environmental pollution among communities located beside mines for metals such as nickel, which is used widely for electric vehicle batteries.

Stricter regulations on waste management, improved monitoring and introducing cleaner technologies for extraction are seen as ways of lowering the impact of such mining.

Tokyo Gas Co. is in discussions with multiple US liquefied natural gas suppliers to secure a long-term purchase agreement, as rising energy demand leaves Japan increasingly dependent on the fuel source.

Japan’s largest gas distributor is in talks with at least four companies over supply from projects dotting the US Gulf Coast, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The exporters include Energy Transfer LP and Commonwealth, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private.

Tokyo Gas is considering various projects, including US facilities, the company said, without commenting on specific projects. Energy Transfer didn’t respond to Bloomberg queries, while Commonwealth declined to comment.

The move comes as Japan prepares for a boom in power demand, thanks to data centers to support artificial intelligence and factories making semiconductor chips. The nation’s government sees LNG as vital to energy security, and Japanese importers have been in talks to purchase supply even past 2050.

LNG from the US tends to be more flexible than supply from other countries, as it allows the buyer to easily divert shipments should domestic demand falter or prices become more attractive elsewhere.

Tokyo Gas is also expanding into upstream US gas production. The company bought shale driller Rockcliff Energy in late 2023 and has reshuffled other US interests, with the recent acquisition of Chevron Corp. assets in East Texas and the sale of an Eagle Ford stake to Shizuoka Gas Co.

GM recently said “no decisions have been made on the product, and nothing has really changed from there,” Lansing Mayor Andy Schor told Bridge Michigan.

“People want to know,” Schor added, particularly after recent GM factory announcements that boost non-EV production in the US. “I think as the year moves on, there will be more questions.”

The 2023 national contract with the United Auto Workers calls for a $1.25 billion investment into Lansing Grand River, said Benjamin Frantz, president of Local 652. The amalgamated local represents about 600 workers at the 3.4-million-square-foot Lansing factory as well as several area suppliers.

GM’s commitment stands, Frantz told Bridge. But what that will look like remains unclear, 18 months after the Camaro ceased production and ended the plant’s second shift.

“I was hoping that we would already understand it,” Frantz said.

A complicated time

The business climate for auto companies is unusually complex this year, with enormous corporate engines facing new regulatory and cost changes in an already competitive market.

Trump’s administration is rolling back EV-related regulations and funding. The US Senate may start voting on the “big, beautiful bill” spending plan next week, a package that would eliminate consumer EV credits.

Among other funding in question are the retooling grants, which are being reevaluated by the Department of Energy among federal moves to slow or halt spending on EV subsidies.

The DOE “is conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration’s priorities,” a spokesperson told Bridge, declining to answer follow-up questions.

Kevin Kelly, a spokesperson for GM, told Bridge in March that the DOE grant was finalized, but he offered no details then or in a more recent request from Bridge.

EV sales were about 7.5% of all US auto sales in the first quarter of 2025, according to CarEdge, and up 11% year-over-year. However, they’re not meeting the robust projections of a few years ago. Experts say EV sales could slow under a rollback until automakers close the price gap between EVs and gas-only vehicles.

A host of new and changing auto tariffs on vehicles and parts manufactured outside of the U.S. also caused automakers to take stock of the domestic capacity and make changes.

“I don't think it's overstated to say that we've never seen anything quite like this, with these many converging dynamics at one time,” said Glenn Stevens, executive director of MichAuto, a statewide auto industry advocacy group.

So far this year, GM has:

Sold its nearly completed Ultium battery factory west of Lansing to partner LG Energy Solution.

Moved planned EV truck production from Orion Assembly in Oakland County to Factory Zero in Detroit-Hamtramck.

Announced its largest single investment for an engine plant, $888 million, in Tonawanda, New York.

Added Chevrolet Equinox SUV production in Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, where once just the Chevy Bolt was planned.

Added Chevrolet Blazer production in Spring Hill, Tennessee, alongside Cadillac EVs.

The automaker’s EVs are selling, data shows, and reports indicate that GM is second to Tesla in US sales of electrified cars.

But the uncertainty of policy changes on the market — and the still-low sales volume compared to gas-only vehicles — appears to be driving GM’s recent decision making.

“GM’s … electric vehicles are selling well, but their (internal combustion vehicles) are selling better,” Alan Haig, president of dealership merger-and-acquisitions firm Haig Partners, recently told the Detroit Free Press.

Looking ahead

Lansing Grand River runs a single shift, building GM’s performance sedans, the Cadillac CT4 and CT5, as well as stamping metal for other models. GM remains one of Lansing’s largest employers, with 4,000 workers in the city and nearby Delta Township.

Sales in 2024 of all versions of the CT4 in the US declined 32%, falling to 6,208 vehicles from 9,144, according to the GM Authority website that tracks the automaker. For the first quarter of 2025, sales dipped another 30% to 405 vehicles each of the first three months of the year.

Sales in the US of the CT5 jumped 32% in the first quarter of this year, totaling 3,981 sold, compared to 3,022 a year earlier.

The sales of both vehicles have been strong enough to extend production, UAW president Frantz said.

“People are buying … enough to where they continually extend the build date,” he said. “Initially we were supposed to go down next year sometime. Now we're already building all the way through next year.”",https://www.bridgemi.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-06/Lansing%20Grand%20River%20GM.jpg?itok=ckDb_2cY,N,,2025-06-28 00:00:32.929089

Repeated Asks for Reform: This is not the first time people have demanded COP reform.","From Pacific Island students to executives at global organizations like Greenpeace, a wide swath of people are losing patience with the slow and often uneven international process for reining in climate change.

This week, more than 200 civil society and Indigenous peoples’ groups released a joint statement calling for major reforms, from how decisions are made to changes involving corporate involvement.

The letter came as countries were meeting in Germany to prepare for the 30th annual Conference of the Parties (COP), the decision-making body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC for short.

The talks in Germany were the first without an official U.S delegation, as my colleague Bob Berwyn reported last week.

The joint statement is the result of years of frustration with the COP format and its inability to address climate justice concerns.

“We have seen the COP process deteriorating over the years,” said Lien Vandamme, senior campaigner for human rights and climate change at the Center for International Environmental Law, a group that signed and helped coordinate the statement. “We see an ever-growing COP that is not all leading to more inclusivity or action.”

That frustration was echoed at the climate talks in Germany that wrapped up Thursday. Representatives of countries most threatened by climate catastrophes warned that nations aren’t moving fast enough to address the compounding crises from an overheating planet.

“Every fraction of a degree matters,” said Evans Njewa, chair of the United Nations group of Least Developed Countries.

Finance Frustration: Advocates see COP29, held in Azerbaijan last year, as a case in point for their reform push.

Dubbed “the finance COP,” the summit was supposed to galvanize wealthy countries most responsible for climate change to increase the money they provide developing countries to reduce emissions and adapt to climate impacts.

That would update developed countries’ 2009 pledge to provide or mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020, an amount that might sound enormous but that falls far short of the climate costs developing nations are grappling with. Meanwhile, developed countries didn’t hit that target until 2022 and fell short of promises in other ways, the Center for Global Development found in an analysis last year.

Enter COP29. Developing countries requested $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 to help transition to clean energy and make adaptations to get ahead of the rapidly warming planet’s mounting consequences. In the final hours of negotiation, that was cut to $300 billion, with $1.3 trillion mentioned in summit documents as an aspirational goal for later.

“The UNFCCC has reached a critical breaking point,” this week’s letter reads. “Climate negotiations have systematically failed to deliver climate justice and undermined international law.”

The call for reform focuses on five changes:

Switching to majority-based decision-making. The current consensus-based process requiring full agreement allows the largest polluters to water down outcomes, the letter’s signers say. “The climate process must no longer be held hostage by the narrow interests of a few,” the coalition writes.The group also wants COPs led only by host countries demonstrating “tangible progress” on climate action. Recent summits in petrostates, like the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan, drew intense criticism for their conflicts of interests.

Stopping “corporate capture.” Fossil fuel companies and other major contributors to climate change increasingly dominate COPs. The coalition wants “strong accountability framework to protect against corporate interest and those with vested interests,” and no more commercial partnerships. (Ninety percent of COP29’s sponsors had fossil-fuel ties, one analysis found.)

Upping accountability. Since the ratification of the Paris Agreement, developing nations have become increasingly frustrated with the lack of enforceability of international obligations. The coalition believes compliance can be improved through incentives for action and penalties for failure. The group also wants to bring climate negotiations out from behind closed doors.

Protecting human rights. In the lead up to COP29, Azerbaijan arrested more than 30 journalists, activists and human rights defenders. During the conference, organizers created strict protest zones to control activist mobility and speech. The coalition says the UNFCCC must “ensure that COP hosts uphold international human rights standards, particularly freedom of expression and peaceful protest.”

Strengthening international action. The UNFCCC itself has said the world faces intersecting crises: climate change, air pollution, biodiversity loss. The coalition urged the UNFCCC to broaden and deepen climate action by aligning with other global efforts, such as the ongoing negotiations on a plastics pollution treaty and the proposed Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Repeated Asks for Reform: This is not the first time people have demanded COP reform.

Inside Climate News’ Berwyn, who reports on the COPs, has documented the mounting frustrations of activists and civil society groups for years. During COP29 in November, he wrote about a high-profile letter signed by people including former UNFCCC leader Christiana Figueres, former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland. Previous calls for reform have met with little success, however.

“Most of the things that are in this statement have been raised at some point over the past 30 years but have gone away over time,” the Center for International Environmental Law’s Vandamme told me, referring to this week’s letter. “This is the first time all the different elements and demands have come together in one place, and under a united front.”

Most changes to the process would have to come through that process itself. This means UNFCCC member states must all agree on any proposed changes—which makes sweeping reform difficult or impossible.

I reached out to the UNFCCC for comments about the coalition’s demands and any plans the institution may have to change the climate talks, but I didn’t get a reply.

COP30 will be held in Brazil this November. Vandamme hopes organizers will consult with the coalition as they plan the talks and create a conflict of interest policy.

With extreme heat, hurricanes, wildfires, drought and other climate consequences worsening, there’s no time to waste, the coalition believes.

“Global climate governance is increasingly perceived as out of touch, driven by vested interests, and running out of relevance and trust,” they write. “The time is now for the UNFCCC to become the climate regime it should have been for the past decades: one centered around international law and obligations to prevent dangerous climate change.”

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has directed the New York Power Authority to develop a new nuclear power plant, according to The Wall Street Journal. This would be the first major nuclear power project started in the U.S. in 15 years and the first in the state since Unit 2 of Nine Mile Point became operational in 1988. If approved, the plant would add 1 gigawatt of energy production to the state. The project is “a big test of President Trump’s promise to expedite permitting for such projects,” Ryan Dezember and Jennifer Hiller write for the Journal. The Guardian reports that the governor’s decision drew harsh criticism from renewable energy groups.

A new study about the surveys, published in Nature, showed that Japan had the highest level of acceptance, with 94 percent of respondents supporting a carbon tax. About half of Americans surveyed would back a carbon tax, with about 75 percent of Biden voters and 26 percent of Trump voters in support.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin just announced the proposed repeal of a Biden EPA rule that pushed the premature closure of reliable electricity producers. This rule, the Clean Power Plan 2.0, would regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, pushing most coal out of the generation mix and effectively precluding the construction of new natural gas generation. Repealing this rule will be a positive step toward meeting rising power demand.

Power demand in the United States has been largely stagnant since the early 2000s, fluctuating only slightly between years. Last year, that trend changed. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence, and the concomitant energy demand from data centers, come large power demand increases accompanied by the impetus to build new power plants.

Technology companies that own or utilize data centers are looking for ways to power them reliably. Sometimes this comes through regular connection to the power grid, and other times it involves co-location with new or existing power plants where the data center is connected to the power plant “behind the meter,” before the plant’s connection to the broader power grid.

Nuclear power and natural gas have been favorites of the technology companies looking to strike power provision deals, largely because of their reliability.

Just as important to meeting demand is keeping existing reliable power plants online as long as possible. The Clean Power Plan 2.0 was a direct threat to that.

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s 2024 reliability assessment, generators of nearly 79 GW of thermal units (coal, gas, and nuclear power plants) are scheduled to retire by 2034, and another 43 GW of coal- and natural gas–fired generators have announced plans to retire but have not yet scheduled these retirements with planning authorities.

The power plant rule was almost certainly a driver of coal power plant closures, and it very well could have affected closures of natural gas power plants. These standards apply to all new or substantially modified gas power plants, meaning that if a plant requires serious updates it may make sense to close it rather than comply with the new standards. The initial rule proposed by the EPA would have resulted in far broader closures than the final rule eventually did. Taking plants off the grid as demand is increasing without replacing them with new thermal units is a recipe for disaster.

In a paper that came out earlier this year, James Broughel and I argued that one of the most important steps to meet rising demand would be to repeal this rule:

Another component of being ready to meet rising demand is the stewardship of existing thermal capacity. This means reassessing the Environmental Protection Agency’s power plant rule that would result in coal and natural gas plants being pushed offline. At a time of growing demand, these plants will play an essential role in the power grid.

Now that the repeal of this rule has been proposed and will likely be finalized, our energy policy is one step closer to being ready to meet the coming demand.

In recent months, as the future of US gas plants looked far more promising (and the repeal of this rule was looking more likely), the demand for new gas plants shot up. The rule likely had a cooling effect on the construction of new natural gas power plants and the manufacturing of new components for those plants. There are now significant delays for many gas plant components including turbines, which have wait times between one and seven years right now.

Read his full op-ed in the Washington Examiner here or below.

The intense heat wave battering the United States pushes America’s electric grid to the brink and threatens potential power outages. But House Republicans offer a policy change that bolsters our grid and helps protect Americans from blackout threats.

Communities across much of the country face scorching temperatures, prompting power companies to take notice and act accordingly.

In my part of Virginia, local power companies affiliated with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) are encouraging their customers to reduce electricity use. This request appears to be based on an announcement from the TVA.

Alerts of potential breaking points in America’s electric grid are not unique to the TVA and are unfortunately becoming more and more frequent.

The Friday before Memorial Day, Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order directing the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), the Midwest grid operator, to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan in operation. These emergency actions are authorized for up to 90 days at a time under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

Wright issued the order to minimize the risk of blackouts ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.

MISO runs North to South from Manitoba and Michigan down to Louisiana and a portion of East Texas.

Notwithstanding keeping the plant in Michigan open, the New Orleans metro area suffered a large and unexpected power outage during Memorial Day weekend. At the blackout’s peak, more than 100,000 customers lost electricity.

According to news website Axios, utilities knew high demand was likely that weekend. However, they had no extra power capacity. When one plant went down, their customers were plunged into darkness.

Reports confirmed that two of the region’s nuclear power plants lost connection to the grid. One was due to expected maintenance, while the other was unexpected. Constrained by a lack of energy supply, grid operators cut power to customers in New Orleans.

Entergy, an electric utility company in the region, said that the forced outages directed by MISO were done to prevent a larger scale and more prolonged power outage from impacting the electric grid.

This blackout was not the only major power outage in recent memory.

On April 28, Portugal and Spain witnessed the worst blackout in their history, affecting 55 million people, per British newspaper The Guardian.

Airports shut down, cars drove on streets without traffic lights, hospitals resorted to backup generators and some people were stuck in elevators!

The Iberian Peninsula blackout continues to be investigated. Lots of finger-pointing is going on between Spain’s grid operator, the government and plant operators. But it is interesting to note that on April 16, Spain reported its first weekday where its national power grid was 100% reliant on renewable power.

A coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.

Coincidentally, in a recent Virginia Tech press release, professor and Power and Energy Center director Dr. Ali Mehrizi-Sani highlighted how the systems that control these clean energy sources are more susceptible to blackouts.

As parts of the world transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the lack of seamless grid adaptation to the use of these sources, as illustrated by the blackout in Spain and Portugal and by experts like Dr. Mehrizi-Sani, threatens destabilization of electric grids and more blackouts.

Leftist policies that attempted to gut our grid’s reliance on fossil fuels and convert to renewables have pushed America’s electric grid to the brink.

Federal policies, like the Obama-era “War on Coal” and the Biden Administration’s so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), shunning reliable baseload forms of energy like coal and natural gas have made our electric grid more vulnerable to failure.

But House Republicans offer a potential policy change that levels the playing field and openly welcomes baseload power.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtails some IRA tax credits which disincentivize coal and natural gas power plants. We maintain the incentives for nuclear because of its significant potential for baseload power.

Republicans also create an energy project insurance pool to help protect energy investors from permits being revoked for coal, oil, critical minerals, natural gas or nuclear installations.

This de-risking compensation fund will make it harder for federal policies to discourage and phase out these reliable energy sources.

As extreme summer heat continues to threaten potential power outages, we must secure and equip our electric grid with reliable energy solutions.

We do not need to follow in Spain’s footsteps and make Iberian Peninsula-style blackouts the norm.

Letter Text and Full Dataset (PDF)

Washington (June 27, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committees, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, today wrote to President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (LA-04), about the risk to K-12 funding from the Republican budget reconciliation proposal to eliminate federal tax credits that fund solar infrastructure projects in schools.

Projects supported by tax credits have saved communities tens of thousands of dollars annually—including Wayne County Schools in West Virginia, which is projected to save the equivalent of three full-time teacher salaries over the course of their careers. Any cuts could delay or disrupt ongoing solar projects, prevent schools and school districts from accessing a tool to save on energy costs, and waste state and school district investments.

In the letter, the lawmakers write, “By cutting federal clean energy incentives, the Republican budget reconciliation bill would interfere with K-12 school funding across the United States. Clean energy projects can reduce monthly energy costs, allowing schools to spend more on supporting students, faculty, and staff. With its draconian cuts to solar energy incentives, the Republican reconciliation bill promises to stall ongoing state and school district solar projects, disrupt their investments, and eliminate an essential cost-saving tool. We urge you to reconsider cuts to clean energy incentives that provide cost saving benefits to schools.”

The lawmakers continue, “More school districts are planning solar projects that will help lower energy costs and prevent state budget cuts from impacting students, educators, and staff. But the proposed cuts in the Republican reconciliation bill threaten the delay, disruption, or cancellation of solar deployments. There are at least 251 school solar projects in 26 states in various stages of planning and construction. Projects that are not able to commence construction before proposed repeals take effect risk delay, wasted local and state investments in project development, higher energy costs, and increased burden on taxpayers. Among the identified projects are 74 school solar installations in Pennsylvania, 53 in Arizona, 15 in Texas, 12 in Kentucky, 5 in Utah, 4 in Iowa and Wisconsin, 2 in Indiana, and 1 in Idaho, Florida, Kansas, North Carolina and West Virginia.”

Several stakeholders joined the lawmakers in voicing their opposition to the proposed cuts.

“Over the last decade, schools across the country have turned to solar to reduce the cost of operating their facilities. In rural communities like Lawrence, Kansas and Greene County, Iowa, solar is how communities are able to maintain services for students in the face of rising costs and small or shrinking tax bases. Repealing these credits is one of a multitude of attacks on our public schools and the young people they serve in the disastrous budget reconciliation bill,” said Jonathan Klein, Chief Executive Officer of UndauntedK12.

“Across the country, school districts have been saving taxpayers money by taking advantage of clean energy tax credits through direct pay. These projects have created jobs, reduced energy costs, and opened up opportunities for school building improvements out of reach for too long. Rolling back the clean energy tax credits would stop that progress in its tracks and increase costs to local communities. It is critical that these important initiatives remain available to our schools,” said Jason Walsh, Executive Director of BlueGreen Alliance.

“School districts across the country have been using clean energy tax credits to lower their energy costs and upgrade their facilities. Investments in things like cleaner running buses and new HVAC systems are reducing both indoor and outdoor air pollution, all while creating good paying jobs. We urge Republican leaders to abandon their efforts to end these tax credits,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers.

“School districts across the country are attempting to move forward on sorely needed repairs and update their school buildings, and solar energy contributes important cost stability and resilience,” said Ally Talcott, Executive Director of the BASIC Coalition. “Our school leaders do not need whiplash amid the important work to finance improvements to our schools; they need support and stability. The cuts to solar energy incentives pull one more resource away from school districts trying to provide safe, modern, and healthy school buildings for their communities.”

“Clean energy incentives help schools provide safer and healthier learning environments, lower energy costs, save taxpayer dollars, and redirect resources from paying expensive utility bills to supporting student success. We urge lawmakers to preserve these federal programs for local communities,” said James Rowan, CAE, SFO, Chief Executive Director of the Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO).

Constellation Energy Corporation's Three Mile Island nuclear plant is expected to restart a year sooner than originally planned.

The Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor may restart in 2027, a year earlier than the initial 2028 timeline Constellation provided in September when it announced a power purchase agreement with Microsoft that the energy company said at the time would ""pave the way"" for it coming back online.

Two massive cooling towers being rehabilitated for nuclear power generation under Microsoft at Crane Clean Energy Center, previously known as Three Mile Island, can be seen from across the Susquehanna River on Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024 in Middletown,

The reactor, a separate facility from the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor that suffered a partial meltdown in the late 1970s, has not operated since 2019, when it was taken offline for economic reasons. It is now being called the Crane Clean Energy Center.

MICROSOFT DEAL WOULD REOPEN PENNSYLVANIA NUCLEAR PLANT, SITE OF 1979 PARTIAL MELTDOWN, TO POWER AI

The power purchase agreement with Microsoft that is facilitating the Three Mile Island restart spans 20 years. The electricity that Microsoft is set to buy from the nuclear plant will help meet the power demands of its data centers, Constellation has said.

Microsoft and other tech companies have been looking to nuclear energy – from traditional reactors or future smaller advanced reactors – for electricity as they continue to ramp up their artificial intelligence efforts.

NUCLEAR ENERGY UNDERGOING REVIVAL IN UNITED STATES

Both AI and the data centers they rely on require large amounts of electricity. The International Energy Administration forecasted earlier this year that U.S. electricity consumption from AI and data centers will soar 130% from 2024 to 2030.

Constellation, which bought TMI Unit 1 in 1999, has said the Crane Clean Energy Center will bring roughly 835 megawatts of electricity to the grid once back online.

The reactor’s restart is projected to lead to 3,400 direct and indirect jobs and give Pennsylvania’s gross domestic product a $16 billion boost, the energy company has said, citing an independent economic impact study.

FOX Business' Madison Alworth reported Wednesday that the reason for the quicker timeline at Crane Clean Energy Center was that Constellation was ""able to fast-track the approval to connect the power that will be created here to the electrical grid.""

Earlier this month, Constellation announced a separate agreement with Meta Platforms through which the tech giant will buy nuclear power from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. That power purchase agreement will start in 2027.

It will keep the Clinton nuclear reactor from shutting down after its Zero Emission Credit ends in mid-2027 and allow it to continue providing electricity on the local grid, Constellation said at the time.

AMERICA'S POWER GRID FACES UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES AS AI AND CRYPTO DRIVE DEMAND SKYWARD

The nuclear power plant will add 30 megawatts of increased output from nuclear uprates through the deal with Meta, according to the company.

The energy company also said it was looking into ways to extend Clinton Energy Center's existing early site permit or ""seek a new construction permit"" from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular nuclear reactor at the facility now that the plant will be open for 20 more years.

“We’re laser-focused on advancing our AI ambitions—and to do that, we need clean, reliable energy,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta.

The latest agreement brings Invenergy and Meta’s total partnership to about 1.8 gigawatts (GW). Agreements between Meta and Chicago-based Invenergy surpassed the 1-GW mark in December 2024 when the two announced a deal for 760 MW of energy from Invenergy solar centers in Arkansas, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas.

Technology companies like Meta have increasingly turned to renewables as they aim to lower greenhouse gas emissions while consuming more electricity to power data centers that support services such as cloud computing and AI. The agreement with Invenergy is one of several deals the tech company has made with renewable energy providers. Others have included a nuclear power deal with Constellation Energy and geothermal with Sage Geosystems.

“Winning the AI race requires reliable, cleaner, affordable energy and energy infrastructure—today and in the future,” said Ted Romaine, executive vice president of origination for Invenergy. “We’re grateful for our continued relationship with Meta and look forward to future partnerships as we work to strengthen American energy independence and economic prosperity.”

Germany’s LEAG Suspends H2UB Green Hydrogen Plan

Plans to build one of Europe’s largest green energy hubs on the site of disused coal-fired power plant units in eastern Germany have been postponed indefinitely, energy firm LEAG said on June 27.

The announcement comes a week after ArcelorMittal dropped plans to convert two German steel plants to carbon-neutral production, citing high energy costs.

LEAG said H2UB Boxberg was being postponed as political and economic conditions for the plant had not developed as expected. It said the previous coalition government had indefinitely delayed implementation of the federal Power Plant Safety Act, a key regulatory pre-condition.

“We are currently postponing plans for hydrogen production in Boxberg and initially shifting our focus to other technologies for the generation, storage and flexible provision of electricity,” a LEAG spokesperson said.

LEAG announced the project in April 2024. It called for the construction of a center for hydrogen production and energy use, along with large-scale green electricity storage, on the grounds of lignite-fired power station units that were decommissioned in the 1990s.

In 2023, the company announced its ambition to bring 7 GW of solar and wind capacity online by 2030 and invest 1 billion euros annually.

Bill Gates-Backed Airloom Starts Building Utility-Scale Wind Turbine

Airloom Energy, an energy generation technology startup, has broken ground on its pilot site where it plans to build out its first utility-scale turbine, the company said June 26.

Located near Rock River, Wyoming, the pilot site will focus on advancing a next-generation wind turbine that is smaller and modular with a rectangular—instead of circular—sweep area. The company, which has Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures among its backers, said the technology costs less and can be deployed faster than traditional turbines.

""With growing electricity needs, we need more flexible systems that can be built quickly, and deployed anywhere at large scale. That’s the only way we’re going to achieve and maintain energy security and independence,” said Airloom Energy CEO Neal Rickner. “Airloom’s proprietary, U.S.-manufactured turbines do just that—replacing bulky, costly models with low-cost compact designs that generate more energy in less space. This groundbreaking marks a key milestone in validating our power curve and achieving essential cost efficiencies for wind energy.”

Unlike horizontal-axis wind turbines, Airloom’s turbine design uses 10-m blades along a track held by 30-m towers. The design enables use at low-wind sites, sites with height restrictions, remote locations and visually sensitive areas, the company explained on its website.

At the pilot site, Airloom said it will install and test the design to validate its power curve, ensure efficiency of production, refine cost of deployment and expand maintenance documentation. It will also evaluate future use cases such as defense, disaster relief and offshore wind energy generation.

Airloom aims to complete its pilot site buildout before commercial demos begin in 2027.

Japan’s Industry Ministry, Siemens Gamesa Agree to Cooperate on Wind Power

Japan announced a cooperation framework with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy for the offshore wind sector, the industry ministry said June 24, the latest public-private deal to build a resilient domestic renewable energy supply chain.

With no wind turbine manufacturers in Japan, the aim is to work with global players to develop a domestic supply chain, an official overseeing wind power at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told Reuters earlier.

Offshore wind is a pillar of Japan’s renewable energy strategy, but the country remains heavily reliant on imported wind turbines and components, posing a challenge to domestic production.

As part of the initiatives, Siemens Gamesa, the wind turbine division of Siemens Energy, also signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese electronic parts maker TDK under which TDK will supply magnets to Siemens Gamesa’s wind turbines, the ministry said.

“We are bringing the newest technology to new markets, hence we are in Japan,” Marc Becker, CEO of Siemens Gamesa’s offshore business, said at the signing ceremony.

“We are also continuously expanding our supply chain, and hence we’re coming to Japan to work together with TDK on producing magnets in Japan, which will allow us further growth,” he said.

METI launched a similar framework earlier this month with GE Vernova, a major U.S. energy equipment company, to promote public-private cooperation in wind power, hydrogen and ammonia among other areas.

Japan aims to achieve 45 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040, which is crucial for reducing its reliance on imported coal and gas for power generation. But its plans have stalled following three major rounds of auctions due to soaring costs and delays.

The once-rapid investment in battery materials in the US is stalling. Some companies are downsizing, delaying, or canceling projects that don’t fit with the Donald J. Trump administration’s priorities. For other firms, tariffs, technological hurdles, and a lack of demand are preventing projects from moving forward. The result is an industry in partial retreat.

Fueled by a flood of government support in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), companies announced 19 US battery component or mineral extraction projects, representing $6.7 billion in planned investment, during the first 6 months of 2023, according to data compiled by the Big Green Machine, a Wellesley College initiative tracking clean technology investments. Since Trump took office, companies have announced only 3 new US projects.

The Trump administration’s campaign to cut government spending on clean technology is signaling to companies that they should slow investment, says Jay Turner, an environmental historian who leads the Big Green Machine. “As soon as Trump was elected, it was clear that the policy environment was going to become very unfavorable,” he says. “Even before he took office, companies were starting to retrench.”

In May, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it would conduct reviews of 179 projects that received DOE awards, with a particular focus on those funded in the final days of the Joe Biden administration.

One is a plant in Connecticut planned by Nanoramic Laboratories to produce a new type of battery binder. Nanoramic won a grant through the DOE’s Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC) in December 2024. All MESC grants are now under review, says Matthew Fenselau, the firm’s general counsel, and Nanoramic is working with the DOE to advance through the process.

There are a lot of players that are trying to weather this uncertainty.

Jay Turner, environmental historian, Wellesley College

Two others are a plant that Orbia is building in Louisiana to make the battery electrolyte salt lithium hexafluorophosphate and a facility the company is planning in Georgia as part of a joint venture with Syensqo that will make the battery binder polyvinylidene fluoride. On a conference call earlier this year, Orbia CEO Sameer Bharadwaj warned investors that it was waiting to see what would happen to the MESC grants supporting the projects.

Both had already been delayed last year because of drivers’ slow adoption of electric vehicles. Bharadwaj said on the recent conference call that he still believed the projects were good long-term bets.

“The electrification of transportation has begun,” he said. “Regardless of what we see in terms of policies from the Trump administration, energy storage markets remain robust.”

Loans issued for battery projects through the DOE's Loan Programs Office (LPO) are also at risk. The zinc-based long-duration battery firm Eos Energy closed a $306 million LPO loan in December; it began drawing on those funds but says the department is now reviewing the loan. “We’re in regular contact with DOE. We’re working through the process with them,” CEO Joe Mastrangelo told investors on a May conference call.

Aspen Aerogels canceled plans in February for a Georgia facility that would have manufactured aerogel thermal barriers for batteries. It had been conditionally approved for a $670 million loan through the LPO. On a conference call, Aspen executives told investors that the company would instead invest in smaller projects in Rhode Island, Mexico, and China.

The silicon anode firm Group14 Technologies hoped to start production at its plant in Moses Lake, Washington, in 2024, but the company is waiting for more clarity about Chinese tariffs on US goods, as most of the company's potential customers are in China.

The trade war between the US and China has cooled since the peak of tensions in April, and CEO Rick Luebbe says Group14 aims to start production in 2026. “We still see uncertainty,” he says. “We're prepared to re-accelerate the buildout if conditions stabilize.”

In March, fellow silicon anode producer Amprius Technologies announced that it would monitor changes in battery demand, costs, and tariffs before starting construction on a plant in Colorado and that it may scrap the effort altogether.

The situation is murkier for companies further up the supply chain that are developing projects to mine battery metals or refine them into battery chemicals. Some mining firms argue that the Trump administration’s emphasis on minerals could help mines reach production faster. In March, Trump issued an executive order containing several measures intended to increase mineral production, and the administration has since added lithium projects from Controlled Thermal Resources, Standard Lithium, and Albemarle to a program that could speed up the permitting process.

But Milo McBride, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who researches the geopolitics of critical minerals, says Trump’s mining initiatives are only part of the picture.

Even when government incentives were flowing during the Biden administration, companies were reluctant to invest in the expensive facilities that turn mined material into battery chemicals. Piedmont Lithium canceled plans for a DOE-supported lithium chemical facility in Tennessee last year because of low prices, and Albemarle delayed a major lithium project for the same reason. Backing mining projects without simultaneously supporting processing into chemicals could leave the US with a half-completed supply chain, McBride says.

“Mineral processing, which is definitely the strategic choke point for the US right now, has really not seen the level of policy attention that it deserves,” he says.

Turner says the slowdown in US battery materials investment is not just a reaction to the Trump administration’s new policies. The IRA prompted a massive number of new battery facility announcements, he says, and there simply wasn’t enough demand to support them all.

In February, Ascend Elements announced that it was scaling back its plans for a battery materials campus in Kentucky. The company originally planned to use two MESC grants to build a facility that would produce cathode materials and their precursors. The company is returning the DOE grant for the cathode portion because of low demand.

In addition to declining government support and weak demand, new entrants into the battery industry are competing against experienced Asian firms. The windfall of grants and tax credits was supposed to help them catch up, but some firms have struggled to get their technology running smoothly.

ICL announced plans to build a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode materials plant in Missouri in 2022 but hasn’t made much progress. In a February conference call with investors, Raviv Zoller, who was then CEO, said the plant would be set back at least 14 months. The delay is partly due to the challenge of using LFP manufacturing technology from Taiwan-based Aleees rather than a Chinese partner. For a project in Spain, ICL is partnering with Shenzhen Dynanonic, a major Chinese LFP producer, and expects the technology to be ready faster.

Evan Hartley, a battery supply chain analyst at the research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, says it’s often difficult for new entrants like ICL and Ascend to match the quality provided by established battery materials manufacturers in Asia.

“Producing cathode material at a commercial scale proved to be a little more challenging than first anticipated,” Hartley says. “The finished product, from a technical perspective, faced a fair bit of competition that it couldn’t match.”

But Chinese companies with sophisticated technology face their own issues. In 2022, a subsidiary of Gotion High-Tech announced plans for an LFP cathode plant in Wayne County, Michigan. But some members of the surrounding community raised questions about the plant's potential environmental impact and the firm’s connection to China. Earlier this year, opponents of the plant won control of the local government and are trying to nix it. The plant is on pause until the issue is resolved, according to the Pioneer, a local newspaper.

Turner says that despite the rising number of delays and cancellations, it’s not all doom and gloom for the US battery industry—especially in the long term. LG Energy Solution recently opened an LFP battery plant in Michigan, and Toyota is set to open a large battery cell plant in North Carolina. Both plants should generate demand for more battery components in the US.

“We're going to see more projects moving forward despite the headwinds,” Turner says. “There are a lot of players that are trying to weather this uncertainty and plan for a transition in the industry, and that’s going to take longer than expected.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/US-battery-pipeline-shrinks---108889-1?$responsive$&wid=700&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2",N,,2025-06-27 16:12:19.007672

Nonprofits, tribes and local governments filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the Trump administration over its termination of federal environmental justice and climate justice grants.

Lead counsel Southern Environmental Law Center, along with Earthjustice, Lawyers for Good Government and other groups, filed the class-action lawsuit in federal court on behalf of grant recipients from at least a dozen states, including Alaska, Colorado, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas and Vermont.

The complaint against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency argues the grant terminations were unlawful because Congress approved them. Earlier this year, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin canceled more than 400 environmental justice grants totaling $1.7 billion.

Tom Cormons, executive director of plaintiff Appalachian Voices, wrote in a statement that the lawsuit is “not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole.”

“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”

In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.

“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”

Environmental justice measures aim to ensure that all people, regardless of race or income, have access to healthy environments. Many of the terminated grants were aimed at reducing environmental health harms, such as high asthma rates and poor air quality, in minority or low-income communities,

The Biden administration awarded the grants through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The industrial sector is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, employing over 12 million workers across nearly 300,000 facilities. It is also a major contributor to air pollution, accounting for roughly 23% of the total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and 34% of global emissions.

CATF, in collaboration with Synapse Energy Economics, has developed a new report that highlights technologies and state-level policies to modernize four key industries – cement, iron and steel, chemicals, and petroleum refining. Advancing clean industry enables pollution reductions while strengthening American manufacturing, boosting competitiveness, and creating high-quality local jobs. This webinar will summarize opportunities in these industries and present state-level policy pathways from the report.

Given ongoing uncertainty around federal investment, state leadership in the industrial sector is more important than ever. This report provides states with a toolkit to tailor technologies and policies to their unique economic contexts and industrial bases. States can utilize policy tools, such as financial incentives, market-based mechanisms, and regulatory approaches, that can effectively drive clean industry across political environments.

Setting the Record Straight on Gas Prices There have been many disingenuous and false claims about the impact to gas prices from LCFS.
Here are the facts: CLAIM: California gas prices will go up by 65 cents or higher on July 1.
Studies also show that LCFS credit prices have no correlation with gasoline prices.
CLAIM: Gas prices could top $8 a gallon by next year.","What you need to know:The California Air Resources Board (CARB) today announced that theupdated Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) regulation will take effectbeginning in July. The LCFS benefits public health, increases funding for electric vehicle (EV) charging, and saves Californians billions of dollars.

SACRAMENTO – CARB today announced that the implementation of California’s amended LCFS will begin on July 1, 2025, following approval by the Office of Administrative Law. The amended regulation focuses public and private sector investment towards increasing cleaner fuel and transportation options for Californians, accelerating the deployment of zero-emission infrastructure, and helping the state achieve legally mandated air quality and climate targets.

“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph. “But often lost in the noise around this program are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, oureconomy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.

“And despite predictions of sky-high increases in fuel prices, gasoline prices in May wereabout 40 cents cheaper than the same time last year and over a dollar per gallon cheaper thanjust a few years ago. Our efforts to deploy more zero-emission vehicles and reduce fossil fuel use is working to cut demand and create more competition in the fuels market, and the LCFS is a big part of that effort.”

The LCFS reduces air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by setting a declining target for the carbon in transportation fuels used in California; producers that don’t meet established benchmarks buy credits from those that do. This system has generated $4 billion in annual private sector investment toward a cleaner transportation sector. These investments provide multiple economic and other benefits to California consumers, including:

Increasing consumer choices, which drives transportation fuel price competition

Growing new industries and attracting investments that support jobs and strengthen communities.

California businesses will see $68 billion in revenue from LCFS credit generation and sales.

Reducing dependence on petroleum and the oil industry, thereby protecting consumers from its associated supply and cost volatility: The LCFS has displaced more than 30 billion gallons of petroleum fuel.

Making electric vehicles more affordable by providing hundreds of millions of dollars in beneficial credits and incentives for EV charging infrastructure and vehicle rebates.

Expanding access to electric vehicle charging and hydrogen refueling infrastructure: As of October 10, 2024, there were a total of 71 hydrogen stations and 749 fast EV charger sites and there are now at least 178,000 public chargers, overall.

Reducing health care costs associated with pollution from dirty fuels: CARB estimates $12 billion in savings from avoided health outcomes between 2024 and 2046 from reduced impacts of air pollution as a result of this program. CARB also anticipates over $60 billion in savings from reduced climate change impacts.

Strengthening communities: The amount of LCFS proceeds invested in disadvantaged communities for clean fuel and transportation projects is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion in the next decade.

Significantly reducing emissions: The amendments will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 558 million metric tons, NOx by more than 25,500 tons and PM 2.5 by more than 4,200 tons between 2025 and 2045.

The LCFS has been very effective to date, reducing the carbon in California’s fuel mix by almost 13% and displacing 75% of the diesel used in the state with cleaner alternatives. This has displaced 320 million metric tons of CO2 since 2011. The updates set targets to reduce the carbon in California’s transportation fuel pool by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045.

The LCFS is designed to provide the most cost-effective path to support clean fuels and infrastructure. Affordability remains a key consideration for the Board, and it has directed staff to monitor any impacts and assess potential mitigation from today’s adopted amendments on retail gasoline prices every six months. CARB will also submit an annual report beginning one year from the effective date of these amendments, and collaborate with the California Energy Commission in that effort.

It’s important to note that independent experts projected LCFS pass-through costs could range from as low as 5 cents per gallon to as high as 8 cents per gallon, much lower than widely reported price spike projections that are as high as a dollar or more and promoted by the industry and industry aligned voices. According to a 2024 report, thanks to major improvements in fuel efficiency through programs like the LCFS, California drivers rank 45th in the nation for gasoline consumption and 21st in spending on gasoline per capita. A fact check of recent claims regarding gas prices is available.

The LCFS updates adopted by the Board were developed after a rigorous, years-long public rulemaking process that incorporated feedback received from interested parties.

Real and Increasing Costs of Climate Change Impacts for Californians

The science behind climate change is irrefutable. With the increasing severity and frequency of drought, wildfire, extreme heat, and other impacts, Californians just have to look out their windows to know that climate change is real and rapidly getting worse. The impacts once thought decades away are happening now. Recent reports detail some of the impacts to the state:

A 2024 national report ranked California the worst state for natural disasters fueled by a changing climate, with expected annual losses totaling more than $16 billion statewide.

Home insurance is harder and more expensive to get. Seven of California’s largest property insurers, State Farm, Allstate, Farmers, USAA, Travelers, Nationwide and Chubb recently limited new homeowners policies in the Golden State — raising questions about the stability of the California home insurance market.

During an 11-year period, exposure to wildfire smoke caused more than 50,000 deaths in California and more than $400 billion in economic impacts.

During seven extreme heat events over the past decade, California experienced $7.7 billion in losses.

Setting the Record Straight on Gas Prices

There have been many disingenuous and false claims about the impact to gas prices from LCFS. Here are the facts:

CLAIM: California gas prices will go up by 65 cents or higher on July 1.

FALSE. There are two separate changes to fuel prices expected on or around July 1 – a legislatively mandated and voter-approved gas tax increase of 1.6 cents and updated fuel standards that could, according to experts, translate to 5 to 8 cents.

Gas tax: California’s gasoline tax will increase by 1.6 cents per gallon, starting July 1, as required by law. This annual inflation increase was enacted by the Legislature in 2017 to help pay for road repairs – and overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2018 when they rejected a repeal attempt.

Fuel standard: Additionally, changes to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) – which is not a tax – will go into effect on July 1. Experts at UC Davis estimate this program, first established by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, could add between 5 and 8 cents per gallon – well below one extreme projection that showed 65 cents. In the long term, LCFS is estimated to reduce fuel costs for Californians per mile by 42% – translating to savings of over $20 billion in gasoline costs every year by 2045. Studies also show that LCFS credit prices have no correlation with gasoline prices.

CLAIM: Gas prices could top $8 a gallon by next year.

FALSE. That number – widely reported in the media – comes from an unscientific analysis whose author has close ties with the oil industry and has been on the payroll of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The author fails to provide evidence to support his main claim and only relies on vague references to models with no details on what those models are based on. Other experts, such as these Stanford economists, say gas price increases based on recent refinery announcements are likely to be negligible.",https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-27 17:10:26.818161

New Projects to Support Data Centre Expansion

The four Invenergy projects include Yellow Wood Solar Energy Center (300 MW) in Ohio, Pleasant Prairie Solar Energy Center (140 MW) in Ohio, Decoy Solar Energy Center (155 MW) in Arkansas, and Seaway Wind Energy Center (196 MW) in Texas.

All three solar facilities are slated to begin operations in 2027, while the wind facility in Texas is expected to go online in 2028.

Meta’s power-hungry AI data centres are driving the company’s aggressive clean energy push. “Winning the AI race requires reliable, cleaner, affordable energy and energy infrastructure – today and in the future,” said Ted Romaine, Executive VP of Origination at Invenergy.

Meta’s Broader Clean Energy Strategy

Meta’s sustainability strategy goes beyond solar. The company has recently signed agreements for another 650 MW of solar power in Kansas and Texas with AES and is now also exploring nuclear energy options. Alongside Amazon, Google and Dow, Meta has signed a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

Meta’s renewable energy portfolio has now crossed gigawatts of clean energy, solidifying its position as a major corporate buyer of clean power in the US.

Texas has become a focal point in Meta’s solar strategy, with the company announcing four separate solar deals in the state this year alone – including projects rated at 595 MW, 505 MW, and two more at 200 MW each. Texas led the nation in new solar capacity additions in both 2023 and 2024, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

As the US data centre industry continues to expand rapidly – driven by the hyperscale operations of companies like Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft – investments in reliable and clean power are becoming central to supporting the country’s digital and AI infrastructure.",https://img.saurenergy.com/2025/06/meta-invenergy-expand-partnership-with-791-mw-clean-energy-deal.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 17:11:08.965642

However, the cost savings of cutting solar tax credits far outweighs the benefits, found analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Brattle Group, and the University of Louisiana.

SEIA estimated solar tax credits cost about $25 billion per year. But the benefits to U.S. ratepayers far outweighs this cost, it found. NERA Economic consulting found that cutting energy tax credits would raise average utility bills by 7% for residential customers and 10% for small businesses. Analysis from the Brattle Group found that solar tax credits lower electricity costs for U.S. ratepayers by a combined $51 billion per year, more than double the cost of the credits.

What’s more, analysis from SEIA and the University of Louisiana found that the solar industry generates $12 billion in federal tax revenues and $3.7 billion in state and local tax revenues each year.

All told, SEIA estimated that U.S. ratepayers in total save $2.67 per $1 in solar tax credit spending.

In 2023 alone, solar added over $75.5 billion to America’s gross domestic product, said SEIA. This includes $3.4 billion added to the Texas economy, $1.3 billion in Utah, $1.2 billion in North Carolina and $1.1 billion in Georgia, all states that have Republican representatives in Congress that are actively considering gutting the tax credits that helped launch this economic boom.

SEIA estimates that nationwide, over 300 announced factories would close or never open, $286 billion in investment halt, and 330,000 American jobs would be lost if solar tax credits are repealed.

“Energy tax credits are a worthwhile investment in American competitiveness, American energy security, and American communities. Each dollar spent repays itself multiple times over,” said SEIA.

Among the most important of these UHV technologies is the 765 kV AC transmission system.
To explain why 765 kV AC transmission is strategic for powering distant industries, we need to consider industrial electrification.
This requires not only cleaner ways to generate electricity but also efficient transmission of large amounts of power.
The introduction of 765 kV transformers marks a step forward in combining high performance with environmental responsibility.","The 21st century has triggered the era of electrification driven by the target to reduce carbon emissions, rapid urban growth, the rise of data centers, electrical mobility, and industrial plants transitioning away from fossil fuels.

The electricity grid is at the heart of this change, with the energy sector trying to balance three tough demands: keeping power affordable, ensuring it's always available (security), and making it clean and sustainable.

To meet growing demand and integrate cleaner energy sources, we need strong, efficient, and resilient transmission infrastructure – and high-voltage (HV) transmission is the optimal way to move large amounts of electricity efficiently over long distances.

HVDC (High-Voltage Direct Current) systems fit long-distance, point-to-point transmission from far-off sites or offshore, while HVAC (High-Voltage Alternating Current) systems support interconnected power grids, like those in North America and other regions. As electrification grows, the 765 kV ultra-high-voltage (UHV) AC transmission system becomes crucial for delivering reliable and efficient power.

Among the most important of these UHV technologies is the 765 kV AC transmission system. It's proving to be essential for reliably delivering large-scale power where industries need it most. This technology isn't just about moving power; it's a strategic piece of the puzzle for enabling energy-intensive industries to electrify at scale and build the reliable and efficient grid of the future.

Hitachi Energy has been a pioneer in HVDC and HVAC transmission, with an extensive installed base and vast experience, and continues to lead this transition, supporting our customers, partners, and the industry. We continue to drive transformation through our people’s knowledge, innovation, and systems expertise, helping industrial sectors achieve large-scale electrification and shape a scalable, reliable, and efficient grid of the future.

To explain why 765 kV AC transmission is strategic for powering distant industries, we need to consider industrial electrification. This means factories and plants previously powered by fossil fuels on-site are now plugging into the electricity grid.

This requires not only cleaner ways to generate electricity but also efficient transmission of large amounts of power. The 765 kV ultrahigh-voltage AC transmission system is specifically designed for this task. It offers greater efficiency and reduced land use, making it especially effective for connecting remote generation to energy-intensive industries like oil and gas, manufacturing, chemicals, and data centers.

These industries need a stable, high-capacity power supply without interruptions. As industry electrification scales up across North America, this level of transmission capability becomes essential to ensure grid resilience, reduce bottlenecks, and unlock new opportunities for industrial innovation and decarbonization.

As energy producers seek to decarbonize operations and improve efficiency, electrification of field equipment, processing facilities, and transport systems is becoming a strategic priority - not only for reducing emissions, but also for improving energy efficiency, system resilience, and long-term cost competitiveness.

Electrifying these energy-intensive operations places huge new demands on the local power grid. To handle this growing demand and to support the continued expansion of the region, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) has proposed over 300 miles of new extra-high-voltage lines, including a 765 kV transmission corridor, to relieve grid congestion and power the next phase of Permian growth.

This proposal clearly signals that building 765 kV lines is a necessary strategic investment to effectively and successfully handle the scale of industrial growth and electrification.

Demand for ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) transmission is increasing, so is the need for power transformers built to deliver extreme performance. Typically installed at key grid nodes, these transformers are essential for system efficiency, stability, and resilience.

Autotransformers are the preferred choice for connecting high-voltage levels—such as 765 kV to 345 kV, offering a compact, cost-effective alternative to traditional two-winding transformers. Their efficient design lowers initial investment and total cost of ownership while easing installation and transport.

With robust voltage regulation, autotransformers ensure stable, long-distance power delivery. Their advantages—cost savings, space efficiency, and operational performance—make them ideal for high-voltage applications.

Supporting this critical infrastructure requires deep expertise across electrical and mechanical engineering, materials science, and manufacturing. These transformers must endure extreme electrical stress, heat, and harsh environments—demanding advanced insulation and cooling technologies to ensure safe, reliable, and sustainable operation.

With the first units developed in the 1960s, and now more than 500 units delivered globally, Hitachi Energy 765 kV transformer solutions are rooted in decades of internal R&D and reflect decades of focused research, field learning, and applied engineering. This history has allowed us to contribute meaningfully to the evolution of ultrahigh-voltage systems, supporting project teams from early specification through to deployment.

Our distributed manufacturing capabilities are designed to respond to real-world challenges, enabling project continuity even in dynamic or remote environments. Guided by our global design platform TrafoStar, we maintain a consistent standard of quality while adapting to regional needs.

Thanks to our multi-location manufacturing strategy, we offer customers superior delivery agility, even in constrained markets. This flexibility is vital when building in remote or logistically challenging environments like the Texas basin.

The introduction of 765 kV transformers marks a step forward in combining high performance with environmental responsibility. Originally developed in China and now deployed globally, this new solution empowers users with the possibility of opting for transformers filled with natural ester instead of common mineral oils, leveraging the benefits of a biodegradable, fire-resistant insulating fluid, with a flash point twice as high and self-extinguishing properties.

Hitachi Energy transformers are designed to ensure maximum reliability and availability. The tests verify the mechanical and electrical stability to withstand high forces. Hitachi Energy conducted the short-circuit test at KEMA, an independent laboratory in the Netherlands, according to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards. Until now, Hitachi Energy has short circuit tested over 170 power transformers of various ratings and demonstrated best in class short circuit performance, with a failure rate that is less than half of the market average.

The trend of industries moving toward electrification is gathering speed across North America. Electrifying operations in places like Texas leads to lower emissions, more efficient processes, and better control.

Using single-phase UHV transformer solutions is a practical approach for these demanding applications because they are easier to transport and install, especially in challenging locations. However, successfully implementing these large-scale projects, dealing with things like getting equipment to the site or placing components correctly, requires partnering with experts who truly understand this complex technology.

Hitachi Energy is optimally positioned to advance this transformation and provide the essential solutions needed to build the strong, reliable grid required for North America's electrified industrial future, one phase at a time.

Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.

Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.

""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Reams' group has called for lawmakers to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""

Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.

""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""

With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.

""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese.""

???????????? ???????? : The global connected truck market size was valued at $22.20 billion in 2021, and is projected to reach $97.38 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 16.1% from 2022 to 2031.

North America is expected to dominate the global connected truck industry in 2021. The connected truck market in North America is anticipated to experience significant growth due to the incorporation of new telematics platform for safe and cost-effective fleet management and investment partnership between telematics and automobile insurance companies. In addition, incorporation of advanced telematics solutions by leading market players also fuels the growth of the connected truck market in North America.

The connected truck market will be affected by the recent trend of development of self-driving trucks. Top OEM’s such as Tesla, Volvo, Vera, and Daimler among others, have been developing self-driving trucks for the market. Startups such as Waymo, Einride, TuSimple, and others, have also started developing self-driving trucks. For instance, Tesla announced a plan to launch its self-driving electric truck by the end of 2022.

For instance, Waymo has started testing its self-driving trucks since January 2020. Similarly, TuSimple plans to operate autonomous trucking routes between Pheonix and Tucson in Arizona and some areas in Texas. Further, in May 2019, Einride started its testing for driver-less trucks. In January 2019, Daimler announced an investment of $570 million for self-driving trucks (Level 4). Thus, self-driving technology is expected to increase demand the for connected trucks and electric vehicles in the long run due to the various advantages such as reduced accident risk, easy use, and presence of value-added features among others.

The growth of the connected truck market is witnessing growth, due to increase in use of telematics in automotive sector, and ease of vehicle diagnosis. However, threat of cyber-attacks, and lack of uninterrupted & seamless internet connectivity are the factors hampering the growth of the market. Furthermore, development of self-driving trucks is the factor expected to offer growth opportunities during the forecast period.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in supply-chain disruptions causing decline in the sales of automobiles, shortage of semiconductor components, and temporary shutdown of many production sites across the globe, which in turn impacted the demand for connected trucks. For instance, in 2020, global automobiles production recorded a drop of 16% in vehicle production.

In addition, several automobile manufacturers faced shortage of components such as semiconductor chips, and others, which further resulted in delay in production of connected trucks. Heavy-duty truck manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with demand as shortages of semiconductors and other parts curb production.

COVID-19 also impacted the production of trucks across the globe. It forced automobile manufacturers to temporarily shut down their production plants, owing to lack of workforce. For instance, in May 2020, Ford temporarily shut down its two separate production plants as the employees tested positive for COVID-19. One plant in Chicago that manufactures Ford Explorer, the Lincoln Aviator, and Ford Interceptor; and the second plant in Dearborn Michigan that manufactures F-150 pickup truck, were temporarily shut down.

However, with the easing of lockdown restrictions, several truck manufacturing companies has observed growth in the sales of truck and buses, which fuels the growth of the connected truck market during the forecast period. For instance, in 2021, Daimler Truck has reported 20% year-on-year growth in sales of truck and buses with 455,400 units sold across the globe.

By communication type, the vehicle-to-infrastructure segment is anticipated to exhibit significant growth in the near future.

By range, the dedicated short range segment is anticipated to exhibit significant growth in the near future.

By vehicle type, the heavy commercial vehicles segment is anticipated to exhibit significant growth in the near future.

By application, the driver assistance segment is anticipated to exhibit significant growth in the near future.

By region, Asia-Pacific is anticipated to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

Key players operating in the global connected truck market include AB Volvo, Borgwarner Inc. (Delphi Technologies Plc), Continental AG, Denso Corporation, Geotab Inc., HARMAN International, Magna International Inc., Mix Telematics, Robert Bosch GmbH, Sierra Wireless, TomTom International BV, Trimble Inc., Verizon Communications, and ZF Friedrichshafen AG.

This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.
Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.
That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.","South Carolina has quietly become a solar success story.

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.

But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.

At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.

For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.

But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.

This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.

That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.

And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.

South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.

The broader economic impact is no less troubling.

A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.

By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.

And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.

In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.

Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.

Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.

This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.

Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.

Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.

Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).

The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.

Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.

This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.

Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.

Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.

Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.

They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-at-home-1024x7711751049446.jpeg?h=d1f0e8ce&itok=O7MdrZ5b,N,,2025-06-27 16:12:32.914436

According to a notice published in the Federal Register in January, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has until Monday to issue new rules aimed at improving the levels of dissolved oxygen in that section of the waterway.

Read our complete coverage of this fight here.

It has been a contentious battle that has pitted environmentalists (who have argued for water quality improvements to protect fish, especially the endangered Atlantic sturgeon), against the Delaware River Basin Commission (which engaged in painstaking and what critics have said was too-slow scientific research) and industrial and municipal users of the river (who complain any improvements to meet the new rules will require upgrades that will cost them, and public ratepayers, millions of dollars).

With so much at stake and with Monday’s deadline looming, what will the EPA do?

Will it issue more stringent regulations?

Will it delay the rule-making?

Or, under a presidential administration that is spearheading rollbacks of environmental rules and cutting EPA staff, will it do nothing at all, or possibly issue rules that environmentalists will jeer and industrial users will cheer?

No one seems to know.

Totally new political climate

Maya van Rossum, the Delaware Riverkeeper who led the fight for the improved water quality rules, said that her organization, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, had not seen any proposed standards yet.

“We are anticipating a proposal, like you, by end of month or some other agreed-upon timeline,” she wrote in an email. “Our goal remains protective standards as soon as possible.”

In March, she had said: “At this point we are awaiting confirmation that the consent decree is approved by the judge. If it is, then all should be on track in terms of timing. If it is not, then I’m not sure. But the substance is not at all assured.”

The EPA, for its part, would not offer an update, citing a policy against commenting on pending or current litigation. And a review of the federal court docket offered no updates or clues that the rules were coming.

In April, the EPA did say it would finalize revised water quality standards for the section of the river that has suffered from a so-called oxygen sag, or a depletion of dissolved oxygen, which is vital for the propagation of fish, particularly the Atlantic sturgeon.

“EPA’s forthcoming final rule will prioritize clean water to support aquatic life and benefit those living, working and recreating in Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania,” the agency said at the time. But the EPA also said that it “intends to comply with all applicable and relevant Executive Orders when issuing this rule.”

How we got here

The problem is complicated: The dissolved oxygen in the contested part of the river is diminished by discharges from wastewater treatment plants, like those in Philadelphia, Camden, Trenton and Wilmington, among others.

Those plants follow all the rules but their wastewater (and those rules) don’t address nitrogen in that water. Nitrogen can be processed by “good bugs” in the river, except if there’s too much nitrogen, they can’t. That excess nitrogen absorbs oxygen, hence the dissolved oxygen “sag” in some parts of the river.

In April 2022, the Delaware Riverkeeper and a group of nonprofits were frustrated with the slow pace of the DRBC’s work. The groups filed a petition with the EPA, seeking to bypass the DRBC and to compel the EPA to issue revised water-quality standards.

A month later, the DRBC completed its scientific and engineering work and in December 2022, the EPA agreed with the Riverkeeper, and took over the process.

In September 2023, the DRBC formally ceded action to the EPA. In December 2023, the EPA publicized its proposed rules for public comment. And in October 2024, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network sued the EPA, accusing it of foot-dragging in finalizing its regulations.

The capstone of this protracted battle came when the Delaware Riverkeeper Network and the EPA reached an agreement requiring the EPA to implement the new rules by Monday.

Accelerated effort could backfire

One of the strange twists in what has already been a twisty fight is that, had the Riverkeeper allowed the DRBC to stick to its original timeline, the commission was expected to have issued its new rules by March 2025.

Instead, by forcing the DRBC’s hand and petitioning the EPA to take action and then suing the EPA, the Riverkeeper Network not only delayed the rules by three months but more significantly, unwittingly introduced a major wrinkle: a hugely changed presidential administration that is likely to be hostile to its goals.",https://delawarecurrents.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EPA-seal.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 17:10:33.565997

We reached out to both Palantir and The Nuclear Company with questions, but haven't heard back.","Palantir has become the latest tech company to jump on the nuclear power bandwagon - not by making a datacenter deal like Microsoft or Amazon, mind you, but by providing its data analytics software to a startup aiming to help build nuclear plants faster and cheaper.

The data analytics software provider announced a deal with The Nuclear Company (TNC) to build a so-called Nuclear Operating System (NOS) designed to provide data-driven visibility into power-plant construction.

Most El Reg readers are likely familiar with Palantir, which has gained a lot of attention for its gung ho pro-America rhetoric and for its recent spate of US government contract wins under the second Trump administration.

TNC is a bit more obscure.

The biz was founded in 2023 with the goal of serving as a project management company for new nuclear power projects. Rather than building and managing its own fleet of nuclear power plants, which has generally been the domain of local energy providers, TNC hopes to get investments from partner companies looking to build their own ""fleet-scale"" nuclear power plants. Unlike other startups focused on new designs, like small modular reactors, TNC aims to use existing designs and focus on sites that already have permits or licenses to operate.

The idea behind that strategy, TNC said, is to speed up the nuclear power development process, reduce costs, and make projects more predictable. This century, nuclear buildouts in the US dropped to a crawl and have been plagued by long delays and cost overruns, but there's been a new burst of interest as hyperscalers race to build power-hungry datacenters for their AI buildouts. With that mini boomlet on the horizon, the startup has raised $70 million from a variety of backers, including a $53 million round earlier this year led by defense-focused venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures, as per Pitchbook.

Palantir's role is to help develop NOS to ""transform the construction of nuclear reactors into a data-driven, predictable process"" that will allow TNC ""to build plants faster and safer for less."" Palantir engineers will be embedded within TNC to work on the project.

According to the companies' statement, NOS will be able to monitor multiple aspects of a nuclear power project, from supply chains and calendars to regulatory assurance and on-site issues, all in real time.

No timeline for the deployment of such software was mentioned in the press release. Additionally, it's unclear whether TNC has even managed to begin a single nuclear power project - its website doesn't indicate that anything but solicitations have been sent out to gauge contractor interest. The company said it wants to deploy 6 GW of nuclear power in its first round of projects, but nothing suggests those projects have gone beyond the twinkle-in-eye stage.

While this may be a different sort of nuclear investment than the kind made by Amazon, Microsoft, and the like of late, Palantir's deal is still a case of a big partnership with an atomic energy firm that has yet to prove it's more than just hype.

Kentucky’s Constitution states that new laws take effect 90 days following the adjournment of the Kentucky General Assembly. These new laws include several priorities of the business community.

House Bill 1, which further reduces the individual income tax rate to 3.5%, will take effect January 1, 2026.

Bills that take effect on June 27:

Occupational Safety and Health

House Bill 398 implements key reforms to Kentucky’s occupational safety and health regulations to streamline compliance for businesses while continuing to ensure safe workplaces. This legislation will improve Kentucky’s overall business competitiveness. New de minimis violations and potential reductions in training expenses will also lead to direct savings for employers, as employers will now have to comply with one set of rules instead of a combination of state and federal rules.

Planning and Zoning

House Bill 321 requires planning commissioners and board of adjustment members to have specific training on the impact of planning and zoning on housing supply and accessibility. This bill also provides that only individuals or entities that own real property within the same zone of a final action may claim to be injured or aggrieved by said final action of a board of adjustments. This will prevent unnecessary delays to needed development projects in local communities.

Advanced Educational Opportunities

House Bill 190 requires Kentucky school boards to develop plans for advanced coursework and accelerated learning for students in grades 4-12, including automatic enrollment.

Military Health Care Personnel

House Bill 303 directs the Kentucky Community and Technical College System to create academic pathways and bridge programs that help military health care personnel transition to civilian health care careers.

Film Industry

Senate Bill 1 establishes the Kentucky Film Office within the Cabinet for Economic Development to promote and support the state’s film industry and creates the Kentucky Film Leadership Council.

Air Quality Monitoring

House Bill 137 ensures that only the most current air quality data collection methods approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are used to enforce air quality standards in Kentucky.

Bills that are already in effect through an emergency clause:

Air Permit Fees

House Bill 346 updates Kentucky’s air quality regulations by defining “emergency stationary internal combustion engine,” setting standards for emissions fee assessments.

Driver Licensing

House Bill 15 allows 15-year-olds to apply for a motor vehicle instruction permit, giving them more time to gain driving experience before obtaining an intermediate license at 16.

Critical Infrastructure Protection

Senate Bill 64 expands protections against tampering with or damaging critical infrastructure in Kentucky, such as cable, telephone, broadband, and electrical highway infrastructure.

Highway Work Zones

House Bill 664 establishes a pilot program for automated speed enforcement in highway work zones, issuing civil citations to drivers exceeding the speed limit by over 10 miles per hour when workers are present.

This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.
That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.","South Carolina has quietly become a solar success story.

With more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of installed solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, our state is harnessing the power of the sun to lower energy bills, create jobs, and strengthen our grid.

But that progress — and the local jobs and savings it brings — is now under serious threat.

At the heart of this issue is the federal residential solar investment tax credit, known as the 25D credit.

For decades, this incentive has helped thousands of South Carolinians afford rooftop solar systems. It’s been a win-win: Homeowners cut their energy bills, and solar companies expand operations, hiring local workers to meet the growing demand.

But the so-called “One Big Beautiful” budget bill — which the president wants on his desk by July 4 — aims to eliminate the 25D credit within months.

This would be a catastrophic blow to South Carolina’s rooftop solar industry — and to our ability to meet future energy demands affordably and reliably.

The timing couldn’t be worse. Rooftop solar is an important energy generation source that can be scaled up quickly.

That speed is critical as our state grapples with rising electricity demand, aging grid infrastructure, and the growing costs of fossil fuels.

And the potential doesn’t stop at homes.

South Carolina is rich in industrial and commercial rooftop space — warehouses, factories, and retail stores with untapped solar potential. Ending the 25D credit would slam the brakes on this opportunity just as momentum is building.

The broader economic impact is no less troubling.

A new analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that gutting these tax credits could cause an immediate drop in solar and storage investments across the U.S.

By 2030, as much as $220 billion in investment could be lost. This doesn’t just impact solar panel installers, but also manufacturers, electricians, engineers, and logistics providers who all contribute to this growing clean energy economy.

And as Republicans in the Senate thrash out the details, the policy uncertainty is already having repercussions. More than $9 billion in investments have already been cancelled or stalled in 2025, according to E2. Republican districts have been hit the hardest.

In South Carolina, we’ve already seen what federal clean energy incentives can do.

Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, our state has secured over $15 billion in clean energy investment — second only to North Carolina. Projects from companies like Scout Motors and Redwood Materials are bringing thousands of new jobs to the Palmetto State.

Unfortunately, many of the same South Carolina lawmakers whose districts are benefiting from this boom have succumbed to partisan pressure to phase out the very credits spurring the investment. That includes the 25D credit, along with key incentives for solar leases and solar manufacturing.

This isn’t just bad politics — it’s an economic misfire.

Removing the 25D credit means fewer homeowners can afford solar, fewer installers stay in business, and fewer South Carolinians get hired. It also makes our grid more vulnerable and our energy prices more volatile.

Meanwhile, state-level actions like the so-called South Carolina Energy Security Act, which was signed into law in May, are poised to make things worse by allowing utilities to raise rates annually.

Repealing existing federal clean energy tax credits and funding programs would increase average annual household energy costs in South Carolina (including electricity and fuel expenses) by nearly $50 per year in 2030 and nearly $270 per year in 2035 (Energy Innovation Policy & Technology).

The good news? The bill is not yet signed, sealed or delivered to the Oval Office.

Preserving the 25D credit and other clean energy incentives could add $32 billion to South Carolina’s economy over the next decade and support nearly 220,000 full-time jobs, according to a study commissioned by American Clean Power.

This isn’t a red state or blue state issue — it’s a commonsense economic one.

Clean energy tax credits are delivering real results in South Carolina.

Undoing them now would undercut years of progress, threaten jobs, and raise costs for families and businesses.

Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and their colleagues in the House have long championed South Carolina’s economic growth.

They can now help protect one of the state’s fastest-growing industries, rooftop solar, and the jobs of hardworking South Carolinians who are building our clean energy future — one rooftop at a time.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-at-home-2048x1542.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 15:11:00.638212

EPA, clarifying when stakeholders have standing to challenge an agency action based on market effects rather than direct government regulation. In an opinion heavy on economic theory, the Supreme Court held that courts may make ""predictable, commonsense inferences"" about regulated entities' behavior when assessing whether unregulated parties have Article III standing.

The merits of the case, which were not before the Supreme Court, concerned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2022 reinstatement of the Clean Air Act (CAA) waiver granted to California for the state's Advanced Clean Cars (ACC) Program. The CAA mostly preempts states from adopting or enforcing their own vehicle emission rules – except for California, which may request waivers from federal preemption under CAA Section 209(b) to establish its own, more stringent vehicle emissions standards. (For more on this process and recent congressional action on other California waivers, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Up in the Air: Congress Nullifies Clean Air Act Waivers for California,"" May 23, 2025.)

The waiver in Diamond Alternative Energy has a ping-ponging history: In 2013, the EPA under the Obama Administration granted California a waiver for its ACC Program, which included greenhouse gas standards. The EPA under the first Trump Administration partially withdrew this waiver in 2019, and the EPA under the Biden Administration reinstated it in 2022. Fuel producers and several states challenged the 2022 reinstatement, giving rise to the instant case. Meanwhile, the second Trump Administration has said it is now reassessing the basis for the 2022 waiver.

In 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the fuel producers' challenge for lack of standing. The fuel producers claimed economic injuries that would result from sale of less liquid fuels due to the change in vehicle sales brought about by the ACC rule. In the D.C. Circuit's view, however, vacating the waiver (and thereby invalidating the rule) would not necessarily redress the fuel producers' economic injuries: Automakers might stay the course and make and sell fewer liquid-fueled vehicles even if the California standards disappeared, and the fuel producers also had not provided any affidavits or other evidence on likely automaker behavior.

Supreme Court's Opinion

In a 7-2 opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit, holding that petitioners had ""readily established standing"" by reference to ""commonsense economic principles."" Specifically, the California rules ""force"" automakers to produce ""a fleet of vehicles that, as a whole, uses significantly less gasoline and other liquid fuels."" Accordingly, the rule will cause ""predictable"" injuries on fuel producers and, ""by the same token,"" it can fairly be expected that eliminating the rule would redress those injuries.

The Supreme Court also pointed to several pieces of record evidence to substantiate its analysis, including declarations that prior California rules had substantially harmed fuel producers, statements from EPA and California that the rule would likely decrease fuel use, and affidavits by automakers who intervened in support of the rule on the grounds that it ensured a level playing field (presumably because otherwise competitors would produce fewer electric vehicles). The Supreme Court also emphasized that the fuel producers did not have to produce expert economic evidence on market behavior if (as here) they can ""simply show a predictable chain of events"" between judicial relief and redress of their injuries.

Implications and Next Steps

The Supreme Court's decision will make it easier for parties to challenge regulations based on predictable market effects. By allowing ""predictable, commonsense inferences"" about market behavior – even in the absence of affidavits or direct evidence – the ruling creates a more accessible pathway for businesses to challenge regulations indirectly affecting them. This will be particularly important for businesses operating in closely intertwined markets where regulations on one industry predictably affect others, including possibly for competitors disadvantaged by regulatory schemes.

For the California waiver program, the decision also has several important implications. Most importantly, the ruling paves the way (at least in theory) for the D.C. Circuit to consider substantive arguments against EPA's 2022 waiver reinstatement. This is potentially important because multiple rounds of litigation regarding long-standing questions on the scope of CAA Section 209(b) have been put off as EPA's waiver decisions ping-pong back and forth between administrations.

However, the second Trump Administration has indicated that it will reassess the waiver through a new regulatory process, creating the prospect of yet another reversal of a waiver granted in 2013, withdrawn in 2019, reinstated in 2022 and potentially withdrawn again.

In the background of the regulatory back-and-forth, there are a number of unresolved questions about California waivers, including whether EPA has authority to withdraw (or reinstate) waivers once they are granted, the extent to which California waivers can relate to greenhouse gas standards at all, or how administrative law developments since the 2022 reinstatement such as West Virginia v. EPA and Loper Bright, might affect the waiver process.

Additional uncertainty arises because of congressional action in May 2025 to nullify a separate set of California CAA waivers using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). That development is relevant to other California waivers because the CRA has a provision prohibiting agencies from issuing future ""rules"" that are ""substantially the same"" as the disapproved ones. California and other states have filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of CRA efforts.

ORIGINAL STORY

A Northern Nevada-based battery materials company is getting extra mileage from used EV batteries by using them to help power a massive data center.

Redwood Materials unveiled a new venture on Thursday called Redwood Energy, which aims to repurpose end-of-life EV batteries into low-cost energy storage systems for large-scale facilities.

The battery technology is currently being used to power a microgrid with a capacity of 12 megawatts and 63 megawatt hours for a modular data center for AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

The Redwood Energy microgrid at the data center is currently the largest second-life battery deployment in the world, according to the company. It is also the largest microgrid in North America, according to Redwood.

The Crusoe data center microgrid is just the first of several projects by Redwood Energy that will use old EV batteries to deliver power, the company said. Delivering energy at a lower cost than the traditional grid will become especially crucial as AI usage accelerates in the future, Redwood added.

“We have over a gigawatt-hour of reusable batteries in our deployment pipeline, and that’s expanding by an additional 5 GWh in the coming year,” Redwood posted on its official blog. “We’re already designing 100+ MW projects — 10X the size of this deployment.”

How does Redwood Energy’s EV battery microgrid work?

Redwood Energy’s EV battery microgrid model relies on parent company Redwood Materials’ national logistic network for used batteries.

The network recovers about 70% of battery packs across North America, which Redwood stores and tests to determine if it can be reused or should be recycled. In the course of recycling EV batteries, the company has discovered that many retain more than 50% of their usable capacity.

If an EV battery pack is determined to be suitable for reuse, it is integrated by Redwood into a modular storage system. Any battery pack can be incorporated into the system regardless of its manufacturer or chemistry.

The use of multiple battery packs allows for the creation of a modular energy storage system that can be easily adjusted depending on users’ energy needs. The system can also operate independently on its own or be connected to the grid. The battery system is especially helpful in supplementing intermittent energy sources such as solar and wind because it can run at any time.

Once a battery reaches the end of its useful life, it is removed from the system and placed back into Redwood Materials’ recycling queue.

With more than 100,000 electric vehicles coming off U.S. roads during 2025 alone, EV batteries present a growing, scalable energy resource, according to Redwood Materials.

“This is not a niche opportunity, it’s a growing, scalable energy resource,” Redwood said. “Today, over 5 million EVs are active on U.S. roads, representing an estimated 350 GWh of energy that will reach end-of-life in the coming years.”

“And with another 150 GWh entering the operational fleet annually, that total is increasing fast and could supply 50% or more of the entire energy storage market,” Redwood added.

What is Redwood Materials?

Founded in 2017 by former Tesla executive JB Straubel, Redwood Materials recycles used batteries by extracting various minerals and components from them.

The company is headquartered in Carson City and also operates a large recycling and manufacturing facility at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center just east of Reno-Sparks.

Redwood Materials is considered a key player in Nevada’s “lithium loop” — which is based on the concept of a virtuous cycle where lithium is produced, manufactured and recycled in the state. An example includes mining lithium in Nevada, which is then used in batteries manufactured in-state at a facility such as the Tesla Gigafactory, then recycled by Redwood Materials and re-introduced into the supply chain once more.

The Nevada lithium loop was one of 31 regional programs that were designated as tech hubs in 2024 by the Biden administration.

Redwood Materials has also significantly expanded operations since its founding. The company handles 20 GWh of batteries each year —the equivalent of 250,000 EVs. This represents about 90% of all lithium-ion batteries and battery materials recycled in North America, according to Redwood.

In addition to receiving $105.6 million in incentives from the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2022, Redwood Materials also was approved for a $2 billion Department of Energy loan in 2023.

Redwood Materials have also inked deals with Ford Motor Company in 2021 and General Motors and BMW in 2024 to recycle their battery scrap.

One of the big goals for Redwood Materials is to reshore a good chunk of the lithium supply chain in the United States, which is typically based in other countries such as China.

Shrinking the supply chain not only helps with logistics and potential global disruptions as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic but is also better for the environment, according to Straubel.

“It can be 20,000 or more miles in the case of lithium, cobalt or nickel before (a mineral) even reaches the car,” Straubel told the Reno Gazette Journal in 2021. “It’s already gone on a journey around the world.”","https://www.rgj.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/27/PREN/84387811007-redwood-energy-overview.jpg?crop=5279,2970,x0,y791&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-27 21:03:18.517250

Pre-existing health conditions, dehydration and exertion can make heat stress worse— but for many workers, taking it easy during a heat wave isn’t an option.

Neither the U.S. nor either of the Carolinas has an official heat standard or mandates for worker protection in the heat. This makes ensuring heat relief for workers more difficult for federal inspectors, according to Natural Resources Defense Council’s Juanita Constible.

“It requires a much stricter level of evidence than a more specific heat standard would,” Constible said.

In the short term, high heat and exertion without regular breaks and proper hydration can lead to cramps, difficulty thinking or moving and — in severe cases — death. Atrium family doctor Richard Van Meter said cramps are a sign that your body is struggling in the heat, even if you’re still sweating and your fever remains normal.

“If you’re a landscaper and you start to feel that, you need to get out of the sun, get something to drink [and] take a break,” Van Meter said.

He said most of the patients he sees in Gaston County suffering from heat-related illness come from work. Around 100 people visit the emergency department every year in the county due to high temperatures, about double what the other surrounding, rural counties experience. Heat contributed to the death of three people in Gaston County since 2016, according to data from the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Heart disease, high blood pressure and other chronic illnesses can add to heat stress, but if dehydration and heat-related illness occur frequently for workers, this can cause chronic conditions, such as kidney disease. Farm workers can ultimately lose their jobs if they go on dialysis, according to ECU’s Elizabeth Mizelle. She studies the effects of chronic dehydration on farm workers.

“I’ve never met an outdoor worker that is on dialysis,” Mizelle said. “They pretty much have to choose a different career at that point.”

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, is holding public hearings on a proposed federal heat standard for indoor and outdoor workers.

Low consumer demand was already taking a toll on some North Carolina companies, even before the new administration. Charlotte-based Albemarle announced plans last fall to lay off 6% to 7% of its global workforce.

Wesley Davis of Charlotte-based MLS Electric warns that companies up and down the supply chain would suffer if the tax credits are compromised.

Pre-existing health conditions, dehydration and exertion can make heat stress worse— but for many workers, taking it easy during a heat wave isn’t an option.

Neither the U.S. nor either of the Carolinas has an official heat standard or mandates for worker protection in the heat. This makes ensuring heat relief for workers more difficult for federal inspectors, according to Natural Resources Defense Council’s Juanita Constible.

“It requires a much stricter level of evidence than a more specific heat standard would,” Constible said.

In the short term, high heat and exertion without regular breaks and proper hydration can lead to cramps, difficulty thinking or moving and — in severe cases — death. Atrium family doctor Richard Van Meter said cramps are a sign that your body is struggling in the heat, even if you’re still sweating and your fever remains normal.

“If you’re a landscaper and you start to feel that, you need to get out of the sun, get something to drink [and] take a break,” Van Meter said.

He said most of the patients he sees in Gaston County suffering from heat-related illness come from work. Around 100 people visit the emergency department every year in the county due to high temperatures, about double what the other surrounding, rural counties experience. Heat contributed to the death of three people in Gaston County since 2016, according to data from the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services.

Heart disease, high blood pressure and other chronic illnesses can add to heat stress, but if dehydration and heat-related illness occur frequently for workers, this can cause chronic conditions, such as kidney disease. Farm workers can ultimately lose their jobs if they go on dialysis, according to ECU’s Elizabeth Mizelle. She studies the effects of chronic dehydration on farm workers.

“I’ve never met an outdoor worker that is on dialysis,” Mizelle said. “They pretty much have to choose a different career at that point.”

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, is holding public hearings on a proposed federal heat standard for indoor and outdoor workers.

Editor’s note: IBJ Media’s Nuclear Energy Forum was planned in cooperation with the Indiana Office of Energy Development and is not a newsroom event.","Indiana is uniquely positioned to be the national leader in nuclear energy, and my administration is committed to making that goal a reality.

I’d like to tell you a bit about why I think nuclear energy is so important to Indiana’s future, and the efficiency and safety advances that have been made in nuclear technology.

My administration supports an “all of the above” energy strategy, which means embracing our state’s abundant natural resources like coal as well as investing in innovative and renewable energy sources.

I believe the most important investment we can make to meet Indiana’s growing electricity demands long term is embracing nuclear energy production. Nuclear is a clean, carbon-free, always-on workhorse for energy generation, which already supplies one-fifth of America’s energy supply.

Recent innovations in nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors, have made nuclear more cost-effective and, most important, one of the safest forms of energy generation available—second only in safety to intermittent renewables like solar.

Small modular reactors represent the next wave in energy innovation. They boast much shorter construction times and are designed with complete safety in mind. SMRs have passive safety systems that cool themselves without the need for human intervention, and their smaller cores and lower operating pressure mean they can cool themselves indefinitely, eliminating the risk of meltdowns. The U.S. Navy has been using small modular reactor technology for 75 years with a sterling safety record.

The demand for nuclear is already here. While new AI technology and data centers will certainly require a lot of electricity to operate, Indiana’s advanced manufacturing already has higher electricity demands than we can provide. To continue to grow our economy, we simply need more power.

Nuclear is the answer, and Indiana is already leading the way. Our commitment to developing nuclear energy starts with community engagement and education. That’s why we’re hosting the National Governors’ Association’s nuclear energy retreat to map out a community engagement program. This community engagement will kick off with IBJ Media’s Nuclear Energy Forum on July 22, where local leaders from across the state are invited to learn about modern nuclear energy and what it can do for our growing economy. In November, I will co-host a Global Nuclear Energy & Economic Summit with Purdue University President Mung Chiang to invite global developers and manufacturers to explore Indiana’s place in the nuclear ecosystem.

My administration is taking action to accelerate that progress by taking advantage of our unique advantages for nuclear production.

One big advantage is our legislative environment. The Indiana General Assembly has been laying the framework to lead on nuclear over the past three years, and during this year’s legislative session, we passed three landmark bills to encourage small modular reactor development and investment.

One important note for Hoosiers concerned about the price of meeting our growing electricity demand: Under House Bill 1007, any new large load user of electricity that comes to Indiana will pay 80% of the additional cost of meeting their utility needs.

Through executive order, I created a coalition to drive innovation and remove bureaucratic roadblocks to nuclear investment here in Indiana, drive collaboration between industry and government in this mission, and identify areas where we can streamline project development and reduce the cost through federal incentives.

Led by Secretary Suzie Jaworowski, who previously served as senior adviser in the Office of Nuclear Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, my Office of Energy and Natural Resources has already made historic progress to bring small modular reactor power to Indiana in a safe and stable way. For example, we’re supporting the Rockport Power Plant’s transition to nuclear generation, which will protect jobs and pave the way for more transition projects in the years to come.

The reason advanced nuclear facilities take seven to 10 years to get online often has more to do with bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles than with the construction itself. Indiana has been pursuing an “agreement state” certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, meaning we will be certified as having the foundation to handle nuclear and related materials.

Indiana already has world-class experience and infrastructure for radiological safety. For example, our Indiana Department of Homeland Security already has 15 employees who track any and all radiological materials that come into the state. Their tools are so accurate and sensitive they can detect if a person has recently received chemotherapy treatment out of a crowd of thousands. As Indiana leads in nuclear energy development, we will also lead in safety. Our agreement-state certification with the NRC is projected to be confirmed in the first quarter of next year.

Another advantage is our specialized workforce pipeline. Indiana’s universities are producing graduates with advanced degrees in the fields the nuclear industry needs most. Purdue University is one of the few universities in the country with an operational nuclear reactor on campus. In November, Purdue will host our Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit, further solidifying Indiana’s place as the nation’s leading state in nuclear power.

Indiana doesn’t just want to be the leader in nuclear energy generation; we want to be the home for every part of the production supply chain. Nuclear involves a lot of advanced manufacturing for components and reactors, and Indiana is already the premier location for advanced manufacturing. We have the infrastructure, utilities, pro-business legislative and regulatory ecosystem, and shovel-ready sites to support these facilities and the great jobs they’ll create. As President Trump and his Department of Energy incentivize nuclear production, Indiana has a running start to take advantage of those incentives and build a new energy framework that can meet our needs for decades.

As demand for electricity continues to accelerate in the modern economy, the country will soon be divided into states that can meet this unprecedented new level of electricity demand and those that can’t. This is a unique moment in our state’s history, and I see it as a golden opportunity to expand our energy portfolio in an innovative way that will benefit Hoosiers for generations to come.•

“Many of us in eastern North Carolina are not happy with what appears to be the NC House’s and Senate’s abandonment of both environmental protections and compassion for working people. We – especially my generation – worked very hard to put those protections in place for ourselves and for future generations.”

Re solar and wind energy development in eastern NC:

“North Carolina has long been a leader in development of renewable energy, which provides steady employment and economic success to countless North Carolinians. Cypress Group volunteers have often spoken up to support development of solar energy in our region. We’re also proud to host two onshore wind farms – one of which was the very first onshore wind development in the Southeast. Those wind farms have been a financial boon to the counties that host them.”

“[S266] contradicts and even reverses past policies that have helped generate a strong economy and good jobs while also preserving a clean and healthy environment, and protecting working ratepayers. The people in eastern North Carolina know better. They know such legislation is possible. North Carolina has the track record to prove it.”

“North Carolina can have a clean environment and affordable, clean electricity without personally underwriting the financial risks of Duke’s construction projects. Don’t tell us we can’t. We don’t believe you. We’ve seen proof that we can do it.”

Beverly Bard, resident of N.C. House District 60 in High Point

“I have been a lifelong proponent of renewable energy sources, and like many climate-conscious North Carolinians, have faced challenges in getting solar panels installed on my property. Our hopes have always been in our state government ensuring that our public utilities pursue responsible, renewable energy goals to reduce carbon emissions in our state.”

“My husband and I are both retirees, living on a fixed income. Adding extra costs is something that many North Carolina residents like ourselves cannot easily adjust for, especially for people who are obliged to get their electricity from a monopoly utility. … I don’t think it’s fair for a multi-billion-dollar monopoly to saddle ordinary ratepayers with additional costs up front, with no guarantee of delivering any functioning power plants, no guarantee that those power sources will be renewable, and no way for us to get our money back if they fail to uphold their end of the deal.”

“It isn’t right for our legislators to favor a company like Duke Energy at the expense of ordinary citizens. … We need our elected leaders to stand up for us.”

Dubbed the “Hypergrid” project, it will be developed in partnership with Texas Tech University and formally launched on July 4.

Massive Scale and Clean Power Ambition

The proposed site where the Largest U.S. Energy and Data Complex is to be built is located near Amarillo and adjacent to the Department of Energy’s Pantex nuclear weapons plant, spans nearly 5,800 acres. Fermi says the Hypergrid campus could eventually deliver up to 11 gigawatts (GW) of energy—enough to power more than 8.2 million homes. The first 1 GW is expected online by late 2026. It will also house large-scale AI data centers, strategically located near major gas pipelines and atop a large natural gas field that will join teh list of the largest data centers being built around the world.

Nuclear Power in the Spotlight

Fermi’s announcement comes amid renewed national focus on nuclear energy. Former Secretary Perry emphasized urgency: “We’re behind—and it’s all hands on deck.” He noted that while China is currently building 22 reactors, the U.S. has none under construction. Fermi has applied for four 1-GW nuclear reactors, though the company has not confirmed specifics or revealed financing details.

Political Momentum and Regulatory Scrutiny

The Largest U.S. Energy and Data Complex project aligns with recent executive orders from former President Trump to fast-track nuclear reactor applications and restructure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). While these moves aim to revive the sector, they’ve drawn criticism over concerns of weakening oversight.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA assignment program, states are allowed to take full responsibility for environmental reviews; a program TxDOT has participated in since 2014.

In December 2023, TxDOT submitted its second renewal package and, after reviewing that package and TxDOT’s overall performance in the program, FHWA and TxDOT worked out several substantial changes in a new memorandum of understanding or MOU. Key changes include:

Providing TxDOT with the ability to take on NEPA responsibilities for 10 years instead of five years;

Removing references to rescinded regulations from the White House Council on Environmental Quality;

Accelerating decision-making processes by utilizing TxDOT’s existing internal system to document the NEPA approval process that serves as FHWA notification of Texas’ NEPA decisions;

Excluding FHWA from being a party to programmatic agreements; and,

Removing reporting requirements related to performance measures, an annual self-assessment, and monthly reporting.

Sean Duffy, secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, noted in a statement that TxDOT has met all requirements for renewal of its participation in the program and proposed in the Federal Register notice to renew TxDOT’s participation for a new 10-year term.

“This agreement is just another example of how our department is committed to America building again,” Duffy said. “If enacted, Texas’ new agreement will allow the state to tackle critical infrastructure bigger, better and faster.”

“Texas taking responsibility for the federal environmental approval process has served to expedite transportation projects and reduce costs,” added TxDOT Executive Director Marc Williams. “This new agreement is a significant step forward by the Trump Administration to solidify a strong federal-state partnership and empower Texas to efficiently move projects forward.”

Giving more NEPA authority back to TxDOT is the latest in a series of actions by the USDOT to help states accelerate project delivery nationwide.

For example, the USDOT recently finalized a first-of-its-kind programmatic agreement with the Connecticut Department of Transportation in May at the Spring Meeting of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that accelerated the review of individual transportation projects that may affect historic properties under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

USDOT said it believes this new type of streamlined agreement could cut six weeks or more off from the schedules of at least 90 infrastructure projects in Connecticut per year.",https://aashtojournal.transportation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062725-TxDOT.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 15:11:59.884364

“Rebranding Midwest Solar Expo to IESNA Midwest concludes the integration of our teams, platforms, and expertise,” said Wes Doane, vice president of IESNA. “More than a new name, it symbolizes a shared commitment to deliver the connections, resources, and insights that clean energy professionals need to navigate this transformative time in the energy transition.”

“By growing IESNA Midwest in alignment with our audience’s business needs, we reinforce Midwest Solar Expo’s mission of illuminating renewable energy innovation in the heart of the Midwest,” Doane said.

Along with the official name change, the rebrand includes an integrated web presence, means of contact and social channels, Candace Letizia, marketing director for IESNA, told pv magazine USA. “With IESNA’s bench of resources, we’ll be able to further [Midwest Solar Expo’s] founding mission of illuminating renewable energy innovation in the Midwest,” she said, adding, “The event isn’t going anywhere, it’s just getting stronger.”

Beyond their shared geography, regional events often enable experts and professionals to hone in on the areas that are most important or unique to the region.

For this past event, which was under IESNA’s ownership but not the brand, Beckie Kier, IESNA event director, told pv magazine USA their goal was to support the regional market. “As that evolves,” she said, “we will evolve the conference program and then in supporting the strong exhibit hall to provide the solutions that the attendees need.”

At June’s event, Candace Letizia, marketing director for IESNA, told pv magazine USA she learned two things that make the Midwestern show different from her experience in other IESNA’s other markets.

“The first,” she noted, “is that this ‘Midwestern hospitality’ is so true. What a great spirit this show has had,” Letizia said. “The atmosphere here has just been very collaborative and very approachable, which I find very refreshing as a northeasterner.”

Letizia said the other notable difference with the Midwest Expo is the demographic and range of professionals among its participants. The involvement from labor and union groups, she noted, is something she hasn’t seen as much of at other Intersolar shows.

This year’s event brought in over 800 attendees, which was close to the 900 attendees that were initially expected.

Palantir Technologies on June 26 said it will work with The Nuclear Company, a nuclear power startup, to jointly create a nuclear operating system (NOS) to simplify reactor builds. The companies on Thursday said the software system would allow for faster construction of new reactors, and provide lower costs.

The deal comes as the U.S. government has said it will support nuclear power and other baseload power generation technologies to provide more electricity for energy-intensive data centers and AI initiatives. Palantir said Lexington, Kentucky-based The Nuclear Company will pay $100 million over a five-year period for development of the NOS.

Palantir, with headquarters in Denver, Colorado, and two dozen offices worldwide, in a news release said “NOS will transform the construction of nuclear reactors into a data-driven, predictable process, enabling The Nuclear Company to build plants faster and safer for less.” The company said “nuclear projects are almost always over budget and behind schedule.”

The NOS will be built on Palantir’s Foundry software platform.

“The future of energy security and sovereignty will be shaped by our ability to deploy advanced technologies at scale,” said Mike Gallagher, Head of Defense at Palantir Technologies. “This partnership marks the first time Palantir’s software will be used to help power the next generation of nuclear energy infrastructure. By integrating our operating system with The Nuclear Company’s ambitious vision, we are laying the foundation for a new era of resilient, intelligent and secure energy systems in the United States and beyond.”

The project is the latest project in Palantir’s Warp Speed initiative, a manufacturing operating system designed to support industry. The companies on Thursday said the NOS “will be delivered by a dedicated engineering team embedded with The Nuclear Company’s construction and engineering staff, all working to unify previously siloed nuclear data across construction, supply chain, workforce, engineering, and safety systems.”

Palantir said the NOS will provide:

Schedule Certainty: With NOS, construction teams will receive instantaneous, context-aware guidance—from the availability of certain parts and materials to the weather—that adapts to real-time constraints, so teams can work rather than wait.

Cost Savings: A supply chain will track and verify all parts, as well as prevent shipment errors, material shortages and lost documentation. And when delays appear imminent, NOS will initiate backup options or prioritize other work in its place.

Problem Prevention: Sensors placed across construction sites can feed data in real-time to a digital twin model of the site, allowing leaders to track progress with precision and compare what’s actually happening to the original plans. By using predictive analytics, teams can spot potential problems early, catching issues before they become expensive mistakes.

Regulatory Confidence: AI will turn a traditionally labor- and time-intensive task to a process that becomes nearly instantaneous. Large language models can rapidly review tens of thousands of documents, while AI agents trained on regulatory requirements will help validate the data recorded automatically at construction sites.

“Our mission is to build nuclear power the way America once built its greatest infrastructure projects—fast, safe and at scale,” said The Nuclear Company Founder & CEO Jonathan Webb. “With Palantir, we have a technology partner who shares our sense of urgency and understands that nuclear isn’t just an energy issue—it’s a national security imperative. NOS is how we finally break the cycle of delays, deliver a new energy future, and protect America’s nuclear leadership from China, so we don’t lose it like we did manufacturing decades ago.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/nuclearplantart-sp-power-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 18:13:24.463561

Better Used EVs, And More Of Them

What’s behind this gangbusters growth? In part, we can chalk it up to time and simple math. The modern American EV market is still fairly young; around 250,000 electric cars were sold in 2020, and the market only crossed the million-unit mark in 2023. This means that more electric cars are now trickling into the used market than ever.

The federal EV tax credit’s so-called “leasing loophole,” a provision that relaxes various restrictions for cars that are leased rather than bought outright, has fueled an explosion in EV leasing since 2022. Those lightly used vehicles are starting to hit car lots in force.

“With more electric vehicles coming off lease, the supply of high quality, affordable, pre-owned EVs is growing rapidly,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights, said during a presentation of the firm’s quarterly estimates on Wednesday.

Crucially, experts say, secondhand options are also newer and better than before, offering more range and features. A few years ago, used EV shoppers on a budget would’ve been largely limited to low-range Nissan Leaf hatchbacks and Chevrolet Bolts. Now they can snag a few-year-old Tesla Model 3—still one of the best all-around EVs on the market—for well under $25,000. The Model Y, the automaker’s most popular model, is also a hit on the used market.

Earlier this year, there were numerous reports of people dumping their Teslas to protest Elon Musk’s role in slashing the federal government. But those cars aren’t just collecting dust on dealer lots, Najman points out. Far from it. In May, Cox found that there was just a 28-day supply of unsold used Teslas, the lowest of any brand on the secondhand EV market. That was also far lower than the 44 days of supply for used internal-combustion cars.

“All that says to me is there are people out there who need reliable cars, and they don't have more than like $22,000 to spend, and Teslas are filling that void,” she said.

Used EVs: Way Cheaper Than New Ones

Indeed, another reason used EVs are heating up comes down to affordability, analysts say. A new EV will run you close to $58,000 on average, or around $10,000 more than a gas vehicle. That has priced out most consumers and remains one of the biggest limiters to EV adoption—even with $7,500 federal tax credits on offer.

The used market is far more forgiving. The average 1-to-5-year-old EV was listed for around $36,000 in May, only $2,000 more than the typical non-EV, according to Cox. Some cost far less than that: The Model 3 was America’s most popular used EV that month, with an average price of $23,160, the firm said. A $4,000 tax credit for people who fall under income caps and purchase cars that cost less than $25,000 can sweeten the pot, too.

""When you remove the barrier of upfront cost, used EVs become an even more compelling option, offering lower maintenance costs and in most cases, cheaper charging compared to gasoline,"" Valdez Streaty said.

What's Next For The EV Market?

While the used EV market is on a tear, the electric car industry as whole is hitting some speed bumps. New EV sales are set to fall 6% year-on-year this quarter, Cox says, driven primarily by a 20% drop in Tesla sales. Last year, growth in the EV market slowed considerably as the industry leader stumbled and as automakers ran up against an unexpectedly hesitant buyer base.

The looming end of pro-EV federal policies threatens to bog down EV progress in 2025 and beyond. EV tax credits for both new and used vehicles are on the chopping block, along with fuel economy regulations and incentives for battery manufacturers.

But there’s also a big reason to expect the used EV market to keep growing: that “leasing loophole” is the gift that keeps on giving. Some 1 million EVs have been leased since 2022, Cox says, and those will start flooding the used market in 2026 and 2027. So while the EV world looks murky right now, the used EV bonanza may just be getting started.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9mew4l/s1/used-teslas-are-getting-more-popular..jpg,N,,2025-06-27 14:11:43.027080

India is on track to meet its 2030 climate target of having low carbon technologies account for 50% of power generation capacity this year, five years ahead of schedule. The country’s clean energy and electric mobility sectors continue to grow, and at least 10 major clean-tech companies went public in 2024 alone.

Yet, this momentum coincides with growing challenges. India’s power demand is predicted to reach a peak of 370 gigawatts in 2025, an 8% increase from last year, driven by urbanization, electrification, expanding data centers, and increasingly erratic weather patterns. These dynamics are pushing the country to pursue more stable and predictable power alternatives, including those that run on fossil fuels.

At the BNEF Summit in New Delhi, we will convene policy makers, corporate leaders, and technology innovators to reflect on this moment of inflection. Sessions will unpack the global context, including trade and tariff policies, and explore how Indian companies are navigating these pressures while seizing domestic and international opportunities.

Discussions will focus on three core themes:

India’s electric vehicle (EV) market is booming from two- and three-wheelers to passenger cars, commercial vehicles and buses. In 2024, electric two-wheeler sales surged by 34% to 1.2 million units. Profitability remains a challenge, however, especially in the two-wheeler segment, where intense competition and low-cost models have squeezed margins. Meanwhile, infrastructure gaps and high upfront costs continue to slow broader adoption.

Despite these hurdles, momentum remains strong. This is a critical moment to examine how India can accelerate its EV transition by scaling domestic manufacturing, closing infrastructure gaps, and adopting innovative business models. Discussions will assess the role of policy, financing, and innovation to support sustainable mobility at scale.

India’s clean energy buildout requires more capital than ever, especially to deliver on the 59 gigawatts of renewable capacity auctioned in 2024. In total, $25 billion was raised for clean energy last year with a sharp uptick in the second half driven by private equity, venture capital, green bonds and project refinancing. Independent power producers raised nearly $2 billion in combined refinancing and equity funding to meet growing corporate demand for clean power.

Public markets remained active despite broader volatility, with 10 major clean energy and e-mobility firms going public in 2024 and more in the pipeline. As complex projects such as solar-wind-storage hybrids proliferate, financing mechanisms are becoming more sophisticated to manage new risks. Throughout the Summit, we will spotlight where capital is flowing, which models are proving to be resilient, and where the next investment opportunities lie in India’s evolving clean power landscape.",https://assets.bbhub.io/image/v1/convert?type=auto&url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bbhub.io%2Fprofessional%2Fsites%2F44%2Findia-solar6.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 17:10:13.521618

Gas tax replacement? Michigan studying potential road usage charge

""This is a viable option, a substitute of the gas tax,"" said Nate Bryer, road usage charging business lead, who is speaking in Lansing this week to try to give the plan some momentum.

“I think Michigan and any other state that’s interested in making sure there’s long-term sustainability of the funding model that goes into paying for roads and bridges and maintenance would be interested in it,"" Bryer told us.

The plan has already been adopted in other states. Bryer says if Michigan begins using it, it could eventually replace the gas tax as a way to help fund our roads as electric vehicles become more popular.

EV owner Nader Faraj believes we should still be incentivizing people to go electric rather than steering them away from the idea with a proposed road usage charge.

“I think it’s too soon, honestly. I think when we can get the majority of people to get into these EVs, and I think the technology has gotten so good and it’s only getting better every single year, then at that point I would be all for the tax,"" said Faraj.

With about 50,000 registered electric vehicles in Michigan, as of 2023, according to the US Department of Energy, finding a long-term, sustainable road funding system has been deemed a 2025 priority of Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

She’s included $7.8 million in her budget to “explore road funding options.”

""People are wondering how the miles are going to be counted, is there going to be a tracker put on the car, how does that work?” I asked.

""There’s going to be options and in the studies and pilots I’ve been involved in, states have tried four or five different methods from something very low tech which is just collecting your odometer through a manual means, and then on the very other end, you have the high-tech solution that’s very involved and generally it’s either a built in device meaning the vehicle manufacturer built it in or an after market device that tracks the vehicle,"" said Bryer.

For years now, the state has been discussing a road usage charge.

Bryer says running a pilot program is the first step to making this happen.

""If the money in the budget is approved and the money for the pilot is set aside for it, still some ifs there, but if that is the case, it is a good idea that they probably would want to start the first of the year in 2026,"" he said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/287f7fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F21%2F74%2F112604ee41f18a6302bc5e745931%2Fphoto-collage-png-2025-06-27t125309-263.png,N,,2025-06-27 14:12:55.837084

As we attract and absorb folks from frontline communities, Atlanta is being transformed by newcomers who take climate change seriously.
While this doesn’t magically make us a climate haven, we do have the opportunity to become a large-scale resilience hub for the region.
■ ■ ■ It may be too late to be a climate haven.
When I think of Atlanta as a climate haven, I am telling myself a story.","If you lived in Atlanta in the months after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, you probably remember the sudden ubiquity of Louisiana license plates across the city. As many as 100,000 people evacuated to metro Atlanta to escape the storm and its aftermath; many settled here for good.

As a lifelong Atlantan, our city’s role in welcoming evacuees made me feel proud, maybe even a little smug. I figured what had happened in New Orleans—both the natural disaster and the cascade of man-made disasters that followed—could never happen here. Maybe this was when I started to fancy my hometown as a “climate haven.”

Atlanta has always imagined itself as geographically blessed: comfortably situated on high ground, with a mild climate and abundant natural resources. An 1871 pamphlet promoting the city as an ideal summer retreat claimed our “health-crowned hills” were “too high up for malarious diseases, such as fevers of various kinds, and too low down for mountainous diseases, such as consumptions, rheumatisms, etc.”

This pseudoscientific branding seems silly today. But the city’s postwar rebuild did result in substantial investment in a modern sanitary sewer system and waterworks, which translated into a healthier city. Marketing Atlanta as a health retreat was a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.

In the 20 years since Katrina, I have heard dozens of climate stories from folks who’ve relocated here from cities such as Tampa, Los Angeles, and New Orleans—people who bought into our reputation as a climate haven while simultaneously creating it.

It’s true that Atlanta does not face the brunt of hurricanes and sea level rise—the kind of catastrophes we’ve come to associate with climate change—the way our coastal neighbors do. Never mind that, in 2008, I sheltered in the Ponce de Leon Avenue Publix as a tornado ripped across downtown. Or that, a year later, the busted windows of the Westin Peachtree Plaza were still boarded up when a storm swamped the city with catastrophic rainfall.

Despite the apocalyptic scenes of the Six Flags amusement park underwater, I continued to think of these events as freak storms, not climate change. How quickly I forgot each event, because I was lucky to dodge the worst outcomes. The city’s famed ability to recover and rebrand lends itself to a useful kind of amnesia. Resurgens is our motto, after all.

But climate change is immune to such self-mythology. The past decade has battered my belief that Atlanta is a safe haven from the disastrous effects of a warming planet. Each summer we seem to shatter the previous year’s record-high temperatures. Tornado season now overlaps with hurricane season, with so many named storms I can’t keep them straight. After last year’s devastating Hurricane Helene, which missed metro Atlanta by mere chance, it became clear that in an era of evermore disruptive natural disasters, there’s no longer such a thing as a climate haven.

As we attract and absorb folks from frontline communities, Atlanta is being transformed by newcomers who take climate change seriously. While this doesn’t magically make us a climate haven, we do have the opportunity to become a large-scale resilience hub for the region. By investing in nature-based solutions, green infrastructure, and community adaptation strategies, we have an opportunity to remake our city for real.

■ ■ ■

In 2017, geographer Mathew Hauer projected that, over the next century, sea level rise alone would cause up to 320,000 climate refugees from coastal cities to flee to Atlanta. Heather Bird Harris was one of them.

When Hurricane Ida struck New Orleans in 2021, Harris’s family spent weeks waiting to return home. But there was no electricity or trash pickup in her neighborhood, and schools were closed. And those were just the short-term disruptions. In the long run, Harris worried about the psychological impact of this stress on her young children, not to mention how they would endure the same “cone of uncertainty”—a term for the projected path of a hurricane or tropical storm—bracing for tempests year after year.

After 14 years in New Orleans, Harris and her partner reluctantly started their search for a new home. “At the time, I was also reading about birds,” she tells me through tears. “These birds that live in the wetlands, their survival strategy with the increasing tidal fluctuations and sea level change, they’re just moving their nests further inland. And it really felt like that’s what we needed to do.”

Harris made a “crazy, data-centric spreadsheet,” in part informed by a mind-boggling online quiz from the New York Times called “Where Should You Live?” She scoured cities from western Washington to northern Vermont. A week before the 2022 hurricane season arrived, her family relocated to Decatur, choosing to remain in the South for its diversity and affordability. She often shares her spreadsheet with friends and family in coastal areas who are considering whether it may be time to leave for good.

After three years in Georgia—during which the state has been battered by climate disruptions, from drought to tropical storms, with school-shuttering water-main breaks in between—I ask Harris if she still thinks of Atlanta as “a stable nest” for her family.

“Relative to New Orleans, it is cooler, and the infrastructure is better,” she says. “By light years, it is much more livable.” But, she adds, “I’m not deluded that we are safe now. I don’t think that there’s anywhere in the world that is.”

For Harris, Atlanta’s appeal isn’t perfect weather. It’s that when intense storms or heat waves hit, she can get her life back on track within a week, instead of a month. This ability to bounce back is a pretty good definition of resilience. And that’s something Atlanta has always been good at.

Thinking about this adaptability from a regional perspective is Jon Philipsborn, climate and resilience manager at the Atlanta Regional Commission.

“Climate change isn’t just a singular punch in the gut,” he tells me. “It affects us in a multitude of ways, directly and indirectly. It creates new challenges and exacerbates existing conditions.”

Resilience means being clear-eyed about the threats, accepting that extreme weather events are going to happen, and trying to reduce impact. When such disasters inevitably arrive, Philipsborn adds, resilience requires a focus on bouncing back better.

“Is the recovery time shorter than it was before?” he explains. “Is there a lower level of impact than the previous event? Are you recovering to a better place?”

■ ■ ■

Doomscrolling images of Asheville in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, I recognized the superstitious form of storytelling I indulged in during Katrina. A major American city, underwater and suffering. This could never happen in Atlanta, right?

But in reality we just got lucky. Helene was forecast to blaze straight through metro Atlanta, but it veered east; communities between Valdosta and Augusta were devastated before the storm unleashed its full force in Western North Carolina. The further from the coast, the more incomprehensible was the death and damage: Helene obliterated the collective story we have been telling ourselves about safety.

“There is no safe haven,” says Dr. Tish Yager, director of the Georgia Climate Project. “You can’t say it’s just the coast or it’s just people that live on the beach anymore. All of us are in this.”

We can’t tell ourselves stories to escape this crisis. But we can be better prepared. Last December, Kim Greene, the CEO of Georgia Power, wrote in the Augusta Chronicle about the effort to rebuild Georgia’s power grid after Helene. The hurricane was the most destructive event in the company’s history, she wrote, “exceeding the damage caused by hurricanes Michael, Matthew, and Irma combined.” And it didn’t even hit the most populated part of the state.

Hearing this scared the hell out of me. But Georgia Power’s reconstruction of whole swaths of the power grid within a month—that’s hundreds of transmission structures—was astonishing and reassuring. This is the kind of rapid statewide coordinated response we’ll need in the future.

■ ■ ■

It may be too late to be a climate haven. But what if we could position Atlanta as a climate resilience hub?

“I think cities and chambers of commerce could really start to get behind this idea that there’s a competitive advantage to championing their location as a more resilient place,” said Philipsborn of the Atlanta Regional Commission, “and therefore you should come live here, build here, and invest in this place.”

This will take more than marketing. If we really want to be a climate resiliency haven, we have to keep investing in what protects our city from the ravages of natural disasters, like our urban tree canopy and our stormwater infrastructure. We must find ways to mitigate the changes that are already here: “[In] the same way Californians are having to think about landscaping their yard for fire,” says Yager of the Georgia Climate Project, “Atlantans are going to need to think about landscaping for coolness.”

Perhaps most importantly, we must invest in ourselves—in strengthening connections in our own communities. “Study after study shows that a more socially connected neighborhood or community is a more resilient community,” says Philipsborn.

Yager tells her students that “the most important climate change adaptation is to help your neighbor.” She advises them to work not only on their own carbon footprint but also on creating shared resources for their neighborhood. This could mean cultivating a community garden, raising money for a neighbor’s higher-efficiency heating, or installing a solar microgrid for emergencies, all core components of a local resilience hub.

When I think of Atlanta as a climate haven, I am telling myself a story. But if boosting our climate resiliency makes us more welcoming to neighbors, businesses, and visitors, then maybe it’s more than a story. It’s a reputation that attracts families like Harris’s: people with roots in New Orleans or coastal capitals who find themselves here as a plan B.

At a time when climate action is on the chopping block at the federal level, local climate resiliency efforts might boost what we can do to protect our interconnected communities. These efforts won’t save us from the weather, but they may help us bounce back from storms faster, with infrastructures and systems that are greener and more just than what we had before.",https://cdn2.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/0625_ClimateSafeHavenFB_GettyImages_oneuseonly.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 17:11:39.388856

That is By Design.” by Dr. Dave Reichmuth, senior scientist with the Clean Transportation Program • “The Future of US Battery Manufacturing is At Stake” by Dr. Jess Dunn, scientist with the Clean Transportation Program","Below is a statement by Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

“At a time when people across the country are looking to lawmakers for real solutions to real crises, this bill would instead steal from families struggling at the margins, costing jobs, billions of dollars in clean energy and transportation investments, and maybe even lives, while stuffing the pockets of the wealthy. The Senate must reject this legislation.

“Among the cruelest aspects of this bill is a plan to cut billions of dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Millions of Americans depend on the SNAP program to help feed themselves and their families, and it is unconscionable that Congress would take food assistance away from struggling families to fund tax breaks for billionaires.

“Meanwhile, the bill would sink tens of billions of dollars into the ‘Golden Dome,’ a hugely expensive, unrealistic, and counterproductive anti-missile system. UCS analysis has shown that such systems are technically challenging to build and readily defeated, as well as globally destabilizing and likely to lead to less security, not more.

“The irrationality doesn’t end there. Lawmakers are taking a hack saw to the country’s clean energy and clean transportation industries simply to score political points. The tax credits and incentives Congress is now cutting have been enormously successful, not only putting a dent in heat-trapping emissions but increasing domestic manufacturing and supply chains, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to states across the country, and hundreds of billions of dollars in investments. Eliminating these policies is nonsensical, especially when doing so will increase transportation and electricity costs and strain the electric grid.

“Make no mistake – this bill will grow the deficit, not shrink it and be a millstone around the necks of hardworking people across the country. Senators will have one last opportunity to alter the bill in a process known as vote-a-rama. With so much at stake, it will be telling to see who votes to protect the health and safety of everyday people. Those who do not must be held accountable.

“Left unchanged, the bill should be defeated.”

“Companies rely on long-term business certainty in the tax code to plan projects and allocate capital,” said BCSE President Lisa Jacobson. “BCSE recognizes the Utah Congressional delegation’s leadership role in energy policy and thanks Senator Curtis for highlighting the importance of a durable tax code. Utah needs more energy now to keep the lights on for homes and businesses – and these tax incentives are unleashing homegrown energy across the state.”

Clear, predictable, and long-term tax policy is essential for market confidence that will get projects deployed quickly and urgently. The changes proposed in the House-passed budget reconciliation bill are expected to result in the loss of 9,400 jobs in Utah by 2030 and nearly 2,900 jobs by 2035, due to a decline in new investments in domestic energy and manufacturing. Additionally, annual GDP in Utah would shrink by $1.4 billion in 2030 and another $55 million in 2035.

The letter contends that phasing the incentives out over several years, “would also provide the opportunity for Americans to continue adopting cleaner vehicles more affordably.
They conclude noting, “The undersigned respectfully urge Congress to avoid business-killing abrupt changes to EV credits and to ensure that EV and hybrid penalty fees remain out of any reconciliation package.”","A group of auto retailers — including CarMax, Carvana, as well as multiple franchise and independent dealers — along with various electric vehicle-related industry stakeholders sent an open letter to the U.S. Senate on Thursday urging lawmakers to slow the speed at which EV tax incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are being overhauled.

The group contends that “abruptly” ending EV-related incentives from the IRA is a “serious threat to our business continuity and the industry’s long-term investments,” and that it would “introduce significant uncertainty and deter investment.”

More than two dozen auto retailers and industry constituents are included in the letter to the Senate. It was coordinated by Recurrent, the Electric Vehicle Association and Plug.

As of Friday afternoon, the letter has been signed by:

“We urge the Senate to consider moderation on the pace of overhauling the critical tax credits that our customers are counting on for new and used electric vehicles and to deploy electric vehicle chargers,” the letter reads.

“Used EV rebates in particular have provided a valuable bridge for working- and middle-class Americans. For car dealerships, these time-of-sale rebates have enabled us to better serve our customers and expand our businesses,” it adds.

“Many of us have built substantial used EV businesses in markets with a lower cost of living, selling to customers who can then reduce their monthly household costs. For many of our working-class customers, the used EV rebate becomes the down payment that enables a vehicle purchase at all.”

The group is calling on the following incentives to continue, “for at least the next several years”:

25E – Credit for Previously-Owned Clean Vehicles;

30C – Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit;

30D – Clean Vehicle Credit;

45W – Credit for Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles;

45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit

The letter contends that slowly phasing out the EV incentives, instead of cutting them immediately, is necessary for the well-being of car buyers, dealers and the overall auto industry, while promoting a stable market.

The group cites a forecast from the International Council on Clean Transportation projecting that 130,000 auto manufacturing-related jobs and 310,000 “indirectly related” jobs in the U.S. would be put at risk within the next five years due to repealing IRA provision.

The letter contends that phasing the incentives out over several years, “would also provide the opportunity for Americans to continue adopting cleaner vehicles more affordably. Finally, many independent and family-owned dealerships are depending on the current incentive structure to remain competitive. An immediate repeal could disproportionately affect these businesses, reducing jobs and opportunities in communities nationwide.”

California’s wildfire tech companies are seizing their moment in Washington as Congress and President Donald Trump eye sweeping fire reforms.

Representatives from Truckee, California-based forest mapping company Vibrant Planet and Earth Fire Alliance, a nonprofit coalition working on wildfire-tracking satellites that includes Google and Muon Space, backed the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act in a House Natural Resources subcommittee hearing in Washington on Thursday focused on wildfire policy and technology.

They had a receptive audience, with both Rep. Bruce Westerman, the Republican chair of the committee, and Rep. Jared Huffman, the Democratic ranking member, enthusiastically encouraging everything from drones to artificial intelligence to mapping software.

“There is no downside to scaling new technologies across the federal government, especially innovative technologies that improve wildfire suppression and response and facilitate more proactive land management,” said Westerman.

To be sure, there are still cracks. Though the bill passed the House, it's cooling its heels in the Senate, where California Sen. Alex Padilla is co-sponsoring it, amid broader budget talks.

And on Thursday, while Westerman praised Trump’s executive order seeking to consolidate federal wildfire agencies and encourage the use of privately developed technology, Huffman lambasted the Trump administration’s jobs cuts that are hampering those same wildfire agencies (“This is where I feel like sometimes we must be living on different planets,” Huffman told his Republican counterparts.)

But the growing bipartisan embrace of fire technology gives California's climate exports an easy and rare win in the age of Trump — and the companies that stand to benefit are leaning in.

They engaged “from the very start” to shape provisions of the bill, including a fire intelligence center and a pilot tech-testing program, said Matt Weiner, the CEO of nonprofit Megafire Action, which has allied with tech companies.

“This is an industry that was largely grown in California, and that’s expanding nationwide now,” said Weiner. “What you're seeing is policymakers nationwide seeing the potential and the need here … it’s an exciting time.”

They might actually be having more success in Washington than at home.

The Los Angeles fires triggered a wave of state legislative proposals focused primarily on immediate financial relief for victims and boosting Cal Fire staffing, but tech input has been sparse (the exception being Vibrant Planet’s support for state Sen. Josh Becker’s SB 326, which bolsters wildfire planning and coordination among state agencies and utilities.)

And last month, a bill by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris to set up an autonomous firefighting helicopter pilot stalled in the appropriations committee amid the broader budget deficit.

Part of the Washington-Sacramento split-screen is because California’s been taking small bites out of wildfire policy as wildfires began shattering records over the past seven years, spending billions of dollars to boost its firefighting force — including over $4 billion in this year’s budget for Cal Fire — and tweaking laws to improve prescribed burning and forest management. And partly it’s because no one in Sacramento has attempted the type of sweeping reform gaining traction in Washington.

Dan Munsey, the San Bernardino County fire chief, testified at Thursday's hearing that he liked the spending on Cal Fire. But he also said that local agencies like his are ahead of the rest of government in embracing technology like firefighting drones. And he said tech can only go so far.

“The answer to this isn't the technology that is broadly available. The answer is leadership,” Munsey said. “We lack interagency department collaboration. It's very bifurcated. I fully support President Trump's creation of the U.S. wildfire agency. We have to break down the barriers. We're slowly innovating. We are burdened by the regulatory process.”

To get more power on the grid more quickly, Governor Josh Shapiro has proposed a statewide board to streamline the siting of large-scale electricity generation projects. The state legislature and environmental groups are debating the idea.

LISTEN to the story

https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/media.alleghenyfront.org/AF062725_JG_EnergyBoard.mp3

In early June, Shapiro announced what he called “the largest private sector investment in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Amazon will be investing $20 billion in multiple new data centers across the state, “that will power our global economy and the future of artificial intelligence,” Shapiro said.

Projects like this are increasing the need for electricity. PJM Interconnections, which operates the electric grid for Pennsylvania, 12 other states and the District of Columbia, predicts that the region’s power needs will grow by nearly 20% in a decade, even as some coal-fired power plants are closing.

Coal was on its way out. But surging electricity demand is keeping it alive

In Western Pennsylvania, an old coal town gets a gas-fired data center

“PJM is telling us that demand is rising and that we have to do something, or we are going to be in a full-blown crisis in Pennsylvania,” said state representative Mandy Steele of Allegheny County at a June 9 hearing of the House Energy Committee.

“My constituents cannot afford to pay the kind of electricity bills that they are going to be hit with if we don’t do something,” she said. “What are we going to do?”

Steele sponsored a bill that is part of Shapiro’s energy plan, which he calls the Lightning Plan, to get more power on the grid by creating a seven-member board, called the RESET board, to approve the siting of large-scale energy generation projects.

Adam Walters, energy advisor in the Department of Community and Economic Development, told the Committee that Pennsylvania is “one of only 12 states in the nation that does not have statewide authority over siting for any key energy projects. Instead, it’s a patchwork of local authorities.”

Walters said developers of large-scale electricity generation projects, whether they’re building a coal- or gas-fired power plant, a solar field or wind farm, could fast-track their projects by getting approval from the RESET board.

“The new, optional process will help projects avoid delays and help projects get built in a reasonable amount of time,” he said.

Projects that get board approval would still need all the required permits.

Opposition from local governments and some environmental groups

Concerned local government groups testified that the new board could usurp their zoning authority over energy projects in their communities.

“We want local government to be making these decisions,” said Martin Causer, Republican Chair of the House Energy Committee, of north central Pennsylvania, at the June 9 hearing. “They know the area, they know the issues, and I think that local control and local input is vitally important – more than just having a public hearing.”

That also concerns Megan McDonough, state director of Food and Water Watch Pennsylvania, who wrote a letter condemning the new board, signed by 25 environmental groups. She has worked with many local communities to create zoning codes that restrict fracking and the gas-fired power plants it supplies from being sited too close to neighborhoods.

“I came to this work doing exactly what this bill would strip away,” she said, referring to what she sees as the centralized authority of the state board.

McDonough also fears that the board will expedite new fossil fuel projects, such as plants that burn natural gas from fracked wells in the region, and doesn’t think the risks are worth it.

“You’re going to obliterate the remaining parts of southwest Pennsylvania [with fracking], is what you’re going to do,” McDonough said. “Just to have data centers for this fabricated demand.”

Help for solar projects

Some Republican lawmakers said the electricity siting board would be a giveaway to the solar industry. At another Energy Committee hearing, on June 11, Representative Causer questioned whether the “state knows best” when it comes to siting energy projects, and asked renewable energy industry leaders, “Do you really believe that the local government officials are the holdup in this process, are they really stopping energy projects across this Commonwealth?”

Nick Cohen, president of Philadelphia-based Doral Renewables LLC, which is currently building solar projects in Ohio and Indiana, both in the PJM transmission system, and employing nearly 2,000 people, testified that local input is important in shaping a project. “There’s a lot of good leadership out there,” he said. “But, there are many instances where just one local official is enough to shut it down. You can convince 99% of the people, and 1% is all it takes to end the project.”

Solar projects have been canceled or held up in Luzerne, Jefferson, Washington and Westmoreland counties, and elsewhere. For example, a farmer and his neighbors near Gettysburg in Adams County opposed a massive solar project proposed for their rural community. The Commonwealth Court sided with the residents, ruling that the project plans did not meet local zoning standards.

Communities sometimes express concerns about issues such as property values and tourism impacts. There is also misinformation online.

David Masur, executive director of the non-profit PennEnvironment, supports the new RESET board because it would give solar developers some recourse when a few individuals drum up opposition to their projects.

“If we’re going to solve climate change, we have to get off of fossil fuels, and the way you get off fossil fuels is you need clean, renewable energy sources,” he said. “One of the big problems we see right now in Pennsylvania is big projects that could power thousands and thousands of homes with clean energy; those clean projects are getting crushed.”

The House Energy Committee is currently working on amendments to include more local input when the state board is considering a project, and may consider the bill again this fall.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Image-2.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 18:13:34.809836

Record-breaking heat swept across the eastern U.S. this week — and with millions of air conditioners whirring, power demand came close to breaking records too.

The ISO New England grid region, which covers most of New England, saw its second-highest power demand ever on Tuesday. In Maine, experts with the Governor’s Energy Office told the Portland Press Herald that New England would’ve beaten the record if it wasn’t for behind-the-meter solar power, like panels on rooftops and over parking lots that aren’t controlled by grid operators. But the region still had to activate fossil fuel-fired peaker plants — which worsen climate change and air quality — to meet demand in the evening.

The grid operated by PJM Interconnection, which includes New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and other mid-Atlantic states, also came close to breaking demand records both Monday and Tuesday. Power outages affecting thousands of homes were reported throughout the region, with utilities blaming many of them on the high temperatures.

One growing technology could’ve helped the grid manage the heat even better: battery storage. Take New England. Instead of switching on fossil-fuel peaker plants, batteries could’ve stored excess power generated during the day and discharged it when demand peaked — something numerous studies have suggested as a solution for the region. It’s a method that the grid operators for Texas and California rely on every day, as power generated when the sun is shining is stored for use when it sets.

But not every region is embracing the technology. PJM, in particular, has failed to take advantage of batteries in spite of its demand challenges, partly because it has one of the longest waits in the country to connect to the grid.

Battery storage is also threatened by the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” currently making its way through Congress. While the Senate did extend a lifeline to the energy-storage industry in its version of the bill, a Wood Mackenzie/​American Clean Power Association analysis out this week found that grid-battery installations could still dip as much as 29% next year if tax credit and tariff uncertainty continues.

New York envisions a nuclear future

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) launched an ambitious quest this week, directing the state’s Power Authority to build a large nuclear reactor. The reason? Rising power demand.

“If we don’t increase our capacity over the next decade, we will see rolling blackouts,” Hochul warned at a press conference. ​“This is the best technology to meet this demand.”

New York is already home to three nuclear power plants, and until just a few years ago, it had four. The Indian Point power plant shut down in 2021 over environmental contamination concerns. But since then, New York has had trouble making up Indian Point’s lost generation capacity, leading the state to rely on more gas power — which has in turn raised greenhouse gas emissions.

In Texas, a company led by Rick Perry, former Republican governor and Trump administration energy secretary, is proposing a nuclear project of its own. Fermi America aims to build four 1-gigawatt nuclear reactors to power a massive data-center campus.

It’ll be years before either one of these proposed plants would come online. But at the very least, it’s yet more evidence of nuclear power’s rebounding popularity on both sides of the aisle.

Senate parliamentarian rescues some energy measures from the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill”

Some of the Senate’s efforts to roll back Biden-era energy and environmental measures were knocked down a peg this week, courtesy of the body’s parliamentarian. The nonpartisan adviser to the Senate ruled that many ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” provisions can’t be passed via the 50-vote budget reconciliation process, and instead will need 60 votes to pass. Senate Republicans have only 53 seats.

The parliamentarian’s critique includes a measure that would force the U.S. Postal Service to sell all 7,200 of its newly purchased EVs and scrap its charging infrastructure — a move the USPS said would cost it $1.5 billion. The parliamentarian also ruled against provisions to speed fossil-fuel project approvals, repeal the EPA’s tailpipe-emissions rules, and sell off public lands.

In response, Senate Republicans unveiled new language on Wednesday that omits the tailpipe-emissions rollback and makes other energy-related edits.

Also this week, several groups — including car dealers, energy investors, and even Georgia Republican state legislators — wrote to the Senate urging it to protect clean energy tax credits.

Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions while in operation, so could be a powerful tool in decoupling data centre growth from increased environmental impact.
About the Crane Clean Energy Center What is now known as the Crane Clean Energy Center was once Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station.
It was shut down in 2019 due to financial issues, but the reactor remains in “excellent shape” according to Constellation.
Ahead of schedule When Microsoft signed the power purchase agreement in 2020, the Crane Clean Energy Center was expected to be online in 2028.","In September 2024, Constellation Energy announced the signing of a 20 year power purchase agreement with Microsoft that set up the launch of the restart of Three Mile Island Unit 1, to be known as the Crane Clean Energy Center.

Three Mile Island Unit 2 was the site of what the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission describes as the “most serious accident” in US nuclear power plant history in 1979, and the reopening of Unit 1 faces some opposition.

Constellation now says that the nuclear power plant is on track to restart ahead of schedule and will add US$16bn to Pennsylvania’s GDP.

“As Microsoft continues its path to become a carbon negative company, this agreement brings a significant supply of new, reliable, carbon-free electricity back to the PJM power grid,” says Bobby Hollis, VP of Energy at Microsoft.

“This will help address the grids’ capacity and reliability needs in the regions we operate.”

Why Microsoft wants nuclear energy

By 2033, UN Trade and Development projects that the AI market will hit US$4.8tn.

Nearly 80% of organisations surveyed by McKinsey already use AI in at least one business function, and generative AI has seen use grow from 33% in 2023 to 71% in 2024.

The growth of AI and cloud computing, both of which require data centres, need a significant amount of power.

This has caused Microsoft’s emissions to rise despite its 2020 goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030.

In the 2024 fiscal year, its total emissions rose by 23.4%.

The company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Melanie Nakagawa, implied this may be the case in February 2025, as Microsoft announced it was readjusting its focus on sustainability.

""In 2020, Microsoft leaders referred to our sustainability goals as a 'moonshot', and nearly five years later, we have had to acknowledge that the moon has gotten further away,"" she wrote in a blog post at the time.

Nuclear power plants produce no greenhouse gas emissions while in operation, so could be a powerful tool in decoupling data centre growth from increased environmental impact.

The company is also investing in renewable energy sources, but solar and wind do not produce reliable enough power for 24/7 operations as data centres require.

About the Crane Clean Energy Center

What is now known as the Crane Clean Energy Center was once Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station.

A partial meltdown occurred in Unit 2 after a cooling malfunction led to overheating and damage to the fuel.

Some radioactive gas was released a few days after the accident, but the World Nuclear Association says it was “not enough to cause any dose above background levels to local residents” and that there were no injuries or adverse health effects.

The accident was rated Level 5 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES), indicating an incident with “wider consequences”, and Unit 2 is in the process of being decommissioned.

Unit 1 went offline for refuelling in 1979 around a month before the accident in Unit 2 and was brought back online in 1985.

It was shut down in 2019 due to financial issues, but the reactor remains in “excellent shape” according to Constellation.

Ahead of schedule

When Microsoft signed the power purchase agreement in 2020, the Crane Clean Energy Center was expected to be online in 2028.

Constellation now says the facility could restart as early as 2027 with the approval of an early interconnection request by grid operator PJM.

“My Administration has worked closely with Constellation and PJM on the Crane Clean Energy Center since 2023 in order to get this new generation online as quickly as possible, ensure the reliability of our grid, and cement the Commonwealth’s energy future,” explains Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/41c9a2375311489546bccd6af7a82d25:6918da2ec0c9e18efd6c5757f5b162e7/crane-clean-energy-center-2024-exerior-aerial-10.jpeg.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:14:53.371912

One way to do that was to impose financial penalties if certain minimum fuel economy targets were not met.
Under the CAFE program, manufacturers whose average fuel economy exceeds the current standard can sell credits to those who don’t.
The Obama administration said it would do what it could but it wanted something in return — tighter fuel economy standards.
Instead, the focus should be on educating consumers so they demand more fuel efficient vehicles.","CAFE — corporate average fuel economy — is a term that has been an integral part of the US auto industry since the OPEC oil embargoes of the 1970s. When gasoline was in short supply, it made sense for the government to encourage automakers to design more fuel efficient cars. One way to do that was to impose financial penalties if certain minimum fuel economy targets were not met.

Initially, those targets were quite modest, but over time they have ratcheted up considerably, to the point where the latest rules, which were written as the Biden administration, raise the standard for passenger cars sold in the US to 65 miles per gallon — up from 48 miles per gallon today.

Under the current CAFE rules, a manufacturer is fined $16 for every tenth of a gallon below the standard its cars and trucks achieve. That number is then multiplied by the total number of vehicles that company produced. That can be a big number. According to Brad Plumer and Jake Ewing of the New York Times, General Motors has paid more than $128 million in penalties since 2022, while Stellantis — parent company of Jeep, RAM, and Chrysler — has paid almost $583 million in penalties since 2018, according to government data.

And where does that money go? Most of it has gone to Tesla. Under the CAFE program, manufacturers whose average fuel economy exceeds the current standard can sell credits to those who don’t. Companies that manufacture only electric vehicles — like Tesla and Rivian — are the primary beneficiaries. In fact, some cynics suggest that Tesla was designed from the start as a way to harvest the income from selling those CAFE credits.

In fact, for several quarters, that income is the only thing that has put the company in the black. That has been a significant factor in keeping Tesla’s stock price high, which in turn has made its major shareholder the wealthiest person in human history. Some will be indignant at the insinuation that Musk deliberately hatched a plan to grab the lion’s share of CAFE credit income and others will slam him for being such an opportunist. But the truth of the matter is the system was in place long before Musk or Tesla arrived on the scene. Taking advantage of opportunities is part and parcel of being successful in business.

But the gravy train is about to come to a screeching halt if Republicans in Congress have their way. Revoking, repealing, or redefining the CAFE program would take a prodigious amount of work. Under the Administrative Procedures Act, such revisions require carefully planned steps that included opportunities for public comment and reams upon reams of data. Even then, somebody is sure to challenge the outcome in court. It could be years before the Red Team is able to push its dastardly plan across the finish line.

Keep CAFE, Ditch The Fines

Or you can do an end run and neuter the whole CAFE process in one fell swoop. How? Congress can simply vote to reduce the penalty for noncompliance to zero. That is precisely the plan being circulated in the halls of Congress, according to Plumer and Ewing.

Naturally, there would be winners and losers if the plan actually becomes law. Companies that have worked the hardest to meet the spirit of the CAFE rules would suffer. Toyota is often criticized on these pages for dragging its feet on EVs, but its hybrids are more fuel efficient than most cars from the Detroit automakers. Honda and Hyundai have also been pulling their weight when it comes to bringing efficient cars to market.

GM — which doesn’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows — recently cancelled plans to expand the production of electric motors at a facility near Buffalo, NY. Instead, it now says it will invest $888 million into building V-8 gasoline engines for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. “This new generation of engines is expected to deliver stronger performance than today’s engines while benefiting fuel economy and reducing emissions,” GM claims.

Crosstown rival Stellantis — which is the perennial winner of the “Least Fuel Efficient Vehicles In America” prize — issued a statement saying it “supports improving fuel efficiency as evidenced by the range of powertrain options in our lineup, but the current standards are out of sync with the market and the Senate proposal is necessary to preserve affordability and freedom of choice.”

This is a favorite trick of the auto industry to blame regulations for every penny of higher sticker costs. It’s never about inflation, or making cars and trucks safer, or adding touchscreens and computers. It’s always the fault of those damned regulations! And there is a sinister undertone to the “freedom of choice” argument. In a perfect world, shouldn’t consumers be “free” to use DDT on their gardens or Freon in their air conditioners? Why can’t we vape on an airplane if we want to or drive on the left side of the road?

What is omitted entirely from the conversation is any thought about not making the Earth so hot that humans will no longer be able to thrive in many places. What about the freedom to exist at all?

But I digress. What you will not hear anywhere else is how the automakers gamed the system. After the Great Economic Meltdown in 2007, GM and FiatChrysler (now Stellantis) went shuffling up the back stairs of the White House looking for help to stave off bankruptcy. The Obama administration said it would do what it could but it wanted something in return — tighter fuel economy standards. The companies readily agreed. In fact, GM promised it would use the money it got from Uncle Sugar primarily to bring more economical cars to market. All it wanted was a little wiggle room on the CAFE standards for larger vehicles.

That made perfect sense to the Obamans, and so the “footprint rule” was brought into play. It allowed larger, heavier vehicles to meet lower fuel economy standards. Almost as soon as the ink dried on the paperwork, GM, Ford, and Stellantis began killing off their passenger cars and putting their money into developing SUVS and pickup trucks. Voila! After watching hundreds of millions of dollars worth of auto industry ads, Americans decided they didn’t want no stinking sedans. They wanted trucks and SUVs — the larger the better.

The Chevrolet Malibu, Cruze, and Impala? Gone. Chevy S-10? Gone. Ford Focus, Fusion, and Ranger? Gone. Chrysler 300 and Dodge Dart? Gone. The Chevy Volt made a brief appearance, but soon sank beneath the waves.

And here’s the other thing. There is no direct connection between CAFE numbers and EPA fuel economy numbers. People hear that cars are supposed to get 65 mpg in 2031 and go crazy. But here’s the thing. THERE ARE NO CARS MADE BY AMERICAN AUTOMAKERS THAT HAVE TO MEET THAT STANDARD ANYMORE! Ford, GM, and Stellantis stopped making them so they wouldn’t have to comply and nobody noticed or cared. And yet, Republicans continue to beat their breasts and play the “Ain’t it awful how the deep state engages in such blatant government overreach” game.

The truth is that the 48 mpg CAFE standard in effect right now has almost no effect on the vehicles for sale at your local Ford, GM, or Stellantis dealer. CAFE numbers are calculated based on complex formulas that are unrelated to real world driving, Because of the enormous slippage between CAFE and EPA, the best cars for sale today get about 32 mpg. Is that so awful?

Tesla Will Take It On The Chin

After we cut through all the political posturing, the company that will be hurt the most by this is Tesla. After spending almost $300 million of his own money, Elon’s reward is that the cars Tesla makes will no longer be eligible for the $7500 federal tax credit because the Big Beautiful Bill is going to eliminate it. And Tesla will no longer be raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in CAFE credits because, if there are no fines, there will be no money to distribute to those who have credits for sale.

There year ago, Musk argued for stricter CAFE penalties. Way to go, Elon. You sure played your cards right this time! You must be so proud of yourself. Now you know what happens when amateurs try to play with professionals.

As a final thought, it will surprise some of you to hear that I am actually glad to see the CAFE scheme get blown out of the water. It was so convoluted and complex that ordinary people had no idea how it worked; it was riddled with exceptions and exclusions; and it made it far too easy for people to play the “government overreach” card.

Instead, the focus should be on educating consumers so they demand more fuel efficient vehicles. Let’s honor the consumers’ right to freedom of choice by allowing them to vote with their wallets for a world that is not melting in part because of the cars and trucks we drive. One of the bedrock principles of a successful business was articulated years ago by Sy Syms, who maintained that, “An educated consumer is our best customer.” As is always the case, if the people will lead, their leaders will follow!

Democrats were too clever by half when they constructed a plethora of rules-based strictures they thought were safe from attack by the opposition. In reality, those rules gave their opponents a club they could use to beat Democrats over the head with and they were only too happy to use it. It’s time to stop doing that and to craft smarter ways to address a warming planet that work toward progressive goals instead of against them. Blowing up the CAFE rules may be the perfect opportunity for progressives to begin creating a new playbook.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2015-Tesla-Model-S-Charging-Station-Orlen-Gas-Station-Wroclaw-Poland-Zach-Shahan-CleanTechnica-11.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:15:37.499093

Automakers increasingly are launching EVs equipped with the ability to support bidirectional charging. The technology can allow energy from the vehicle’s battery to be directed to power a plugged-in device, to restore power to a home or to return power to the electrical grid. In addition to being a benefit of EV ownership, it could be a revenue generator for customers and help support a robust electrical grid, particularly at times of peak energy demand and as data centers and artificial intelligence increase electrical needs.

Leveraging the capabilities of these virtual power plants, however, could set up a battle with the U.S. energy sector. A recent report from solar company Wolf River Electric studying the Event-correlated Outage Dataset in America found Michigan had the most major power outages of U.S. states during the summer months from 2019 to 2023.

Tim Addison, 41, of Northville Township, Michigan, is evaluating EV options with bidirectional charging after recently losing his power. It’d been nearly a year since he lost power, but before that, he’d experienced multiple stretches of a couple days without electricity. It’s especially a problem because Addison’s mother-in-law who lives with his family relies on an oxygen machine. When the house loses power, the family has to go to his mother’s house or a hotel.

He evaluated a $15,000 to $20,000 home generator as well as energy storage systems, but bidirectional charging looks like the best option for him: “It seems like it makes more sense than having a battery or a Generac you use 10 days out of a year.”

He’s disappointed in how few EV models are capable of bidirectional charging now, but he also feels some pressure potentially to make a decision on a vehicle soon with the “One Big Beautiful” reconciliation budget bill in Washington expected to remove a tax credit of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.

“The moment I know the tax legislation is going through, that’s when I have to pull the trigger,” the tax attorney said. “It just becomes a little bit more expensive.”

He knows his family also will have to figure out transportation needs if the EV is powering his home.

Ryan O’Gorman, 51, of Beverly Hills, Michigan, who owns a 2025 F-150 Lightning, says he’ll typically use another one of his family’s vehicles if he needs to leave while using the bidirectional charging capability of his truck.

“Typically the concern is the refrigerator or freezer, and that it’ll thaw,” said the energy services manager at Ford. “But that takes hours. So long as you’re not going out of town, you’re probably fine.”

About a year ago, O’Gorman used his truck for a three-day power outage at his 1845-built, 3,700-square-foot home, where he loses power a few times a year. It was cool enough where the house didn’t need air conditioning, he said, but still, there was power left over in the vehicle.

“It took a minute to turn on, but after a couple of hours, you forget it’s running off the truck,” he said. “The kids were on their phones. We were cooking and doing everything we normally do.”

Vehicle-to-home

Ford Motor Co. in 2022 announced a partnership with solar company Sunrun and claimed to be the first to allow Americans to power their home with their truck. The extended-range model of the F-150 Lightning is capable of powering the average house for three days and up to 10 days with rationing or solar power. The pickups start at $63,345.

By 2026, all of General Motors Co.’s EVs will be able to send energy to a residential home (called vehicle-to-home, or V2H) when paired with a GM Energy Home System.

“Our commitment to an all-electric future,” GM spokesperson Sanaz Marbley said in an email, “is focused not only on delivering a world-class portfolio of electric vehicles, but investing in the EV ecosystem that will enable mass adoption.”

Chrysler parent Stellantis NV’s delayed electric trucks — the Ram 1500 REV and Ramcharger — also have bidirectional charging capability. And the Ramcharger has a 130 kilowatt generator on board, which the company says is close to the power of 10 home generators.

Supporting the ability to power a home requires an integration system that converts energy from the truck into power that can be used by the home and connects into the main electrical panel where the grid feeds electricity to the house. The integration system Ford developed with Sunrun costs $3,895 at retail, and installation can be at least another $1,000 more, said Dave McCreadie, a Ford leader in EV-to-grid integration strategy and business development.

Programs like Ford’s Power Promise that covers the cost of the standard installation of a Level 2 home charger for buyers of a new EV doesn’t include the integration system. McCreadie said Ford’s system is built to be competitive with Generacs, but unlike a natural gas-powered generator, the EV solution is silent.

Generac spokesperson Jonathan Stern in a statement said bidirectional charging remains in its infancy, and some homeowners will prefer a traditional generator to keep their EV charged and ready to get to safety, if needed.

“We firmly believe that homeowners won’t trade mobility for resiliency,” he said. “If they are experiencing a power outage due to a severe weather event such as a hurricane, storm or wildfire, depleting your vehicle’s battery to power your home could potentially put evacuation plans at severe risk.”

Customers of bidirectional chargers can also consider full interconnection. This technology feeds energy back into the grid (vehicle-to-grid, or V2G). McCreadie said it would require a software update and an interconnection agreement with a customer’s utility. Not all vehicles with V2H capabilities also support V2G.

“These batteries (in EVs) are so large, and the typical driver is only using a fraction of it every day,” McCreadie said. “That leaves a lot left over to potentially put to good use for grid needs.”

That includes days when the power from the grid is flowing, but an EV owner could opt to power their home from their charged-up EV from overnight. They might do this to lower their bill, since electricity prices often are cheaper at night than during the day when there is more energy demand. Ford did a demonstration of this last year in Maryland.

“A customer,” McCreadie said, “can end up saving tens or dozens of dollars, even maybe as much as $100 per month in an extreme case on their electricity bill.”

V2G

Interconnection also could allow electricity from plugged-in EVs to be sent back to the grid, similar to when residential solar panels produce more energy than is required by a homeowner. In return, a utility might offer an incentive or pay a rate to the EV owner for the electricity that could show up on their bill.

Few utilities, however, currently offer these kinds of programs. The state of California is incentivizing bidirectional export compensation, and PG&E Corp., one of the country’s largest electrical companies, is offering programs to support that.

Detroit-based DTE Energy Co. says it’s working with major automakers on bidirectional charging and is testing V2G technology with electric school buses since they typically are available when utilities need energy the most: during peak summer afternoons when demand is greatest.

“This is an exciting, emerging technology that is still quite early in the development stage,” spokesperson Ryan Lowry said in a statement. “As V2G technology matures, DTE will continue testing applications on the grid while expanding integration efforts, including evaluating export compensation, rate design, and tariffs to support customer participation and grid reliability.”

Michigan’s largest electrical utility, CMS Corp.’s Consumers Energy, says since bidirectional charging technology isn’t yet affordable or widely available for most customers, it doesn’t offer any customer incentives.

Noble has 28 days to respond, with the possibility of negotiations, before the case is adjudicated by the full commission.
Deranleau said that in his 15 years with the commission he could recall just one incident of a well blowout, which was not as serious as the Chevron Bishop well incident.
“Since the incident occurred, Chevron has maintained robust air monitoring.
“Remediation for the Bishop incident is a multistep, multifaceted process,” according to the ECMC.","State oil and gas regulators have started an enforcement action against Chevron Corp. for the massive, five-day Bishop well blowout in rural Weld County that spewed 25,000 barrels of water, fluids, sand and oil into the air in April.

The Colorado Energy and Carbon Management Commission staff on Thursday issued a notice of alleged violation to Chevron’s subsidiary Noble Energy for violating six of the state’s oil and gas rules.

“Our job is to hold operators accountable for noncompliance with our rules, and our team’s thorough investigation determined that the incident violated our rules,” ECMC director Julie Murphy said in a statement.

Noble has 28 days to respond, with the possibility of negotiations, before the case is adjudicated by the full commission.

Chevron said in a statement that it is reviewing the notice of alleged violation.

Greg Deranleau, ECMC deputy director of operations, told the commission at a hearing Thursday that in addition to the enforcement action his staff is closely monitoring Chevron’s remediation efforts.

“How likely is it that this could happen again?” ECMC Chairman Jeff Robbins asked.

Deranleau said that in his 15 years with the commission he could recall just one incident of a well blowout, which was not as serious as the Chevron Bishop well incident. “There have been 10,000 wells since that last well blowout … so it’s extremely rare.”

The Bishop well blowout near Galeton started on the evening of April 6 and wasn’t contained until the afternoon of April 10.

During those five days the well unleashed a soaring geyser composed of 20,000 barrels of produced water, sand and salts and 5,000 barrels of oil and condensates, according to Chevron.

Error before production began blamed for the blowout

In the accident report the oil company filed with the ECMC, it said the problem was an improperly installed production tree — an assembly of valves that sits atop the well to control the flow of oil and gas — as well as a poorly installed barrier suspended from the production tree that is designed to prevent the flow of liquids.

When a well is being completed it is capped with a blowout prevention device known as a BOP stack. When the well, which is under pressure, is ready for production the BOP stack is replaced with a production tree.

A barrier — a tube hanger — to control the pressure is put into place as the BOP stack is replaced. In the case of the Bishop well as the production tree was being put in place it released the tube hanger.

Fourteen households were evacuated and the Galeton Elementary School was temporarily closed. Area residents said there was a fine mist or droplets in the air.

Researchers at Colorado State University measured air emissions during the incident and found dangerous levels of toxic chemicals as far as 2 miles away.

Chevron has at the direction of local, state and federal authorities collected about 3,000 air quality measures and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment mobile air laboratory — a van with air monitoring equipment — also did tests in the area.

“Since the incident occurred, Chevron has maintained robust air monitoring. At no point in time did we observe levels of air pollutants that pose a threat to human health based on EPA standards,” the company said in a statement.

Soil and water samples, both surface water and groundwater, from the area have been collected and air monitoring will continue in the area.

The cleanup plan covers an area with a 1.5-mile radius from the well site, which is equal to a 7-square mile area, making it a major remediation project, Kyle Waggoner, the ECMC eastern environmental supervisor told the commission.

“How do you eat an elephant?” Waggoner asked. “One bit at a time.” The area has been divided into 300 individual parcels each with its own plan.

Homes have been steam-cleaned, barns repainted and so far 25,272 cubic yards of solids have been removed from the well site. Many of the parcels will be completed by the end of the year, Waggoner said.

“Remediation for the Bishop incident is a multistep, multifaceted process,” according to the ECMC. “The operator, Chevron, is responsible for all clean up activities.”

The ECMC said the cleanup work will be “regulated and enforced” by the agency, with the complete remediation by the spring of 2030.

In its notice of alleged violation, the ECMC staff said Chevron has violated rules governing well control, general safety requirements, oil and gas facilities, pollution and venting and flaring.

“We understand that rebuilding trust takes time and sustained effort,” Chevron said in a statement. “We remain committed to open, ongoing dialogue and to supporting the residents of Galeton as we move forward.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photos-20250408-201616.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 14:12:51.786915

), growth will stall if there isn’t adequate reliable and affordable electric power.","The 89th Session of the Texas Legislature adjourned on June 2 after 140 days.

As with every biennium, there were both good and not-so-good elements of the outcome. Considerable progress was made in dealing with a number of challenges facing the state, including, among others, public school finance and teacher pay (though much remains to be done), water supplies, rural health care, wildfire preparation, and the current topic of electric power supplies and the stability of the grid.

Amongst the usual sound and fury, there were clear steps in the right direction.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is the grid operator charged with ensuring reliable electric service for 90% of the state and is overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Texas Legislature.

More than 27 million customers are served by ERCOT, with only a few geographic areas being excluded.

Ensuring the adequacy of the state’s grid and power supply is a major challenge. Texas has been growing rapidly, both in terms of population and the economy, and there is reason to believe that pattern will continue. We are also adding firms and facilities in a variety of power-intensive industries.

Key legislation was passed which encourages more efficient use of power. An additional $5 billion went into the Texas Energy Fund to be used for low-interest loans to incentivize the development of additional dispatchable (natural gas fired) capacity and improve backup power at facilities essential to health and safety. A better process for accommodating new large load consumers will help in allocating transmission costs and assist with reliability. There is also funding for the development of nuclear energy.

Nuclear reactors can be an important generation source in the future power complex, particularly given that it is not only clean burning, but also not subject to wind or sun or the availability of rare earth minerals. The technology has advanced considerably, with numerous safety enhancements and scaled-down, factory-assembled reactors which allow deployment specifically where power is needed. Although there are certainly risks which must be safeguarded against, appropriate mechanisms are available.

I have said for decades that meeting future energy needs will require an “all of the above” approach. We need additional generation capacity that isn’t intermittent, and new laws support its development. Texas is also adding renewables at a strong pace, and they will be another vital part of the answer. There were initiatives to curtail such development proposed, but they did not survive the process.

No matter what the state has going for it (and we have a lot!), growth will stall if there isn’t adequate reliable and affordable electric power. New legislation will help keep the momentum alive. That’s progress. Stay safe!

Similar increases in consumer spending on electricity were projected by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, which found households would see electric bills rise by $275 in 2029.
In Texas, the elimination of renewable tax credits will likely be greeted warmly by the state’s Republican lawmakers.
Renewable energy “depends on the federal government subsidizing a lot of this activity,” Cornyn told The Morning News.","As lawmakers in Washington debate the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, several studies have found that its repeal of tax credits for renewable energy and large batteries will cost jobs and increase consumer costs for electricity.

The U.S. Senate could begin voting on the sweeping budget reconciliation bill as soon as Friday. The legislation is stuffed with Republican priorities, including cuts to Medicaid and extending 2017 tax cuts.

It also includes a rollback of renewable energy tax incentives that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which many credit the climate change-centric bill for jumpstarting a solar and battery storage boom in Texas.

That rise might not end, but the sudden removal of renewable tax credits makes them more expensive. The Senate’s version of the bill calls for phasing out those credits over the next year, though some experts say it would more likely be a sudden drop because of provisions regarding how solar, wind and batteries source their components from foreign nations.

“The issue is that they will cost more, and so you’re going to see power prices go up for consumers like you and me, and you’ll also see them go up for commercial businesses and for industry,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at the Washington-based, non-partisan think tank Energy Innovation Policy & Technology.

Energy Innovation Policy & Technology – or EI – recently studied the effects of ending the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for renewable energy. It found the average Texas household would pay $320 more for electricity in 2030 and $780 more in 2035.

Similar increases in consumer spending on electricity were projected by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, which found households would see electric bills rise by $275 in 2029.

Both studies also predicted job losses and a hit to the state’s overall economic health.

“You kind of get a double whammy of higher prices here and also fewer jobs,” O’Brien said. “So people who are struggling with energy prices are losing their jobs at the same time, it could be a rough hit.”

The Senate’s version of the budget reconciliation act preserves tax credits for other energy sources, including nuclear power and geothermal power. However, those sources of clean energy remain years away from producing the amount of energy needed to meet projections of steep power demand increases fueled by the growing number of data centers in Texas and the nation.

“We’re just not building that much of those [other energy sources]over the next five years,” said Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association.

In Texas, the elimination of renewable tax credits will likely be greeted warmly by the state’s Republican lawmakers. Since their inception, lawmakers have sought to offset their impact by creating incentives for natural gas-fueled power plants, including a $10 billion energy fund to give low-interest loans and grants to the builders of those power plants.

However, that program has faced setbacks, which led state lawmakers to pass legislation relaxing its deadlines amid a worldwide shortage of critical components needed to complete those plants, including years-long backlogs of natural gas turbines.

That means the development of renewable energy and batteries will continue, but just not at the breakneck pace that saw batteries’ capacity in Texas jump 400% in two years and solar power’s generating capacity double.

The Big Beautiful Bill also phases out manufacturing tax credits that will create setbacks in the domestic supply of battery and solar power components, O’Brien said. That could also affect power transmission equipment as well, including transformers, cables and other equipment.

“It’s going to lead to a lot of cancellations of projects,” he said.

Amid uncertainty over the tax credits, the business group E2 estimates that $15.5 billion in nationwide investment was cancelled since January, leading to a loss of 12,000 jobs.

The Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates that Texas would see a negative impact of $5.6 billion on the states economy, while EI projected an $8.5 billion hit to the states gross domestic product in 2030.

About 82% of IRA investments occurred in Republican-held Congressional districts. Likewise, 72% of IRA jobs were created in Republican districts, according to E2.

While some Republicans are fighting to keep the renewable tax credits alive, few, if any are in Texas.

Sen. John Cornyn, who sits on the Senate’s finance committee, called the IRA tax incentives a “financial boondoggle,” but said repealing the tax credits should not be extended to projects that have already begun construction.

Renewable energy “depends on the federal government subsidizing a lot of this activity,” Cornyn told The Morning News. “At some point, we have to pay attention to the fact that we’ve got approaching a $37 trillion debt, which is an existential threat to our country.”

Arlo Nichols, a Corpus Christi technician who services wind turbines, said the clean energy industry has provided him a well-paying career – one he didn’t expect to achieve as a high school dropout.

“It really angers me when I see Congress voting on a bill that they didn’t even read that could drastically reduce our career choices in the future and slow down the growth of this industry, Nichols said during a news conference on the repeal of IRA credits. “Honestly, it makes me really angry.”",https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/web1_US-NEWS-CONGRESS-SPENDING-ENERGY-DA.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 15:11:55.452202

For investors, this episode underscores the dual-edged sword Tesla faces: its technological leadership in EVs is unmatched, but its valuation is increasingly vulnerable to regulatory headwinds and partisan biases. Here's how political polarization and safety controversies could reshape Tesla's trajectory—and what it means for shareholders.

The Charlotte Decision: A Microcosm of Broader Political Fault Lines

On June 23, 2025, the Charlotte City Council voted 6–3 to remove Tesla from its list of approved EV vendors for municipal fleets. Councilwoman LaWana Mayfield, a Democrat, cited “multiple safety lawsuits” and concerns over Tesla's alignment with “instability” as primary reasons. Yet, critics like Republican Councilman Ed Driggs argued the move was politically motivated, noting Tesla's existing fleet performance (statistically safer than competitors like Ford, which had 81 recalls in 2025) and Musk's polarizing public persona.

This split decision reflects a national trend where EV procurement is becoming a proxy for ideological battles. Tesla's association with Elon Musk—a CEO whose Twitter rants, stock-price-linked tweets, and alignment with controversial political figures—has made the company a lightning rod for scrutiny. While Charlotte's council denied political motivations, the vote's partisan divide (6 Democrats vs. 3 Republicans/Democratic dissenters) suggests otherwise.

Regulatory Risks: Safety Litigation and Municipal Trust

The safety concerns cited by Charlotte are not unfounded. Tesla faces lawsuits over its Autopilot system's role in fatal accidents, including a 2024 New Jersey case where a Model S veered off the road, killing three. Plaintiffs allege Tesla's marketing of Autopilot as “probably better than humans” was misleading. Meanwhile, NHTSA investigations into Autopilot's crash rates (Tesla vehicles accounted for 70% of ADAS-related collisions in 2024) and recalls (e.g., airbag tears, delayed emergency braking) amplify doubts.

Yet, Tesla's data paints a different picture: its vehicles are half as likely to be involved in accidents as conventional cars, and Autopilot reduces crash risk by 40%. The disconnect between litigation and real-world safety metrics raises questions about whether regulators are overcorrecting or targeting Tesla due to its high profile.

Competitive Landscape: Ford and Chevrolet Benefit from Safer Bets

Charlotte's decision to retain Chevrolet, Ford, and Hyundai highlights a strategic shift toward “safer” EV vendors. While Tesla leads in innovation, competitors are capitalizing on perceived stability. Ford's F-150 Lightning, for example, has won municipal contracts in cities like Chicago due to its established brand reputation and dealer partnerships.

For investors, this signals a risk: Tesla's market dominance may erode if political and regulatory barriers favor “less controversial” alternatives. Ford's 2025 EV sales growth of 30% in municipal fleets versus Tesla's stalled municipal deals post-Charlotte underscores this shift.

Valuation at a Crossroads: Regulatory Headwinds vs. Long-Term EV Demand

Tesla's valuation hinges on two competing narratives:

1. The Bear Case: Regulatory pushback, lawsuits, and political polarization could shrink its municipal and B2B contracts. If cities increasingly opt for Ford/Chevrolet to avoid Musk-related risks, Tesla's revenue growth could stall.

2. The Bull Case: Long-term EV demand remains unstoppable. Even with municipal setbacks, Tesla's 70% global EV market share in 2024 and its $0.05/km cost advantage over internal combustion engines (per BloombergNEF) ensure it will dominate consumer and industrial markets.

Current valuations reflect skepticism. Tesla's P/E ratio of 25x trails Ford's 12x, despite Tesla's superior margins. This gap suggests the market already prices in regulatory risks—but may overreact to isolated incidents like Charlotte.

Investment Thesis: Navigate the Political Minefield, But Bet on Tesla's Tech

Short-Term Caution: Monitor lawsuits (e.g., the New Jersey case) and municipal procurement trends. If more cities follow Charlotte's lead, Tesla's stock could drop further.

Long-Term Buy: Tesla's software edge (Autopilot, FSD) and scale make it an EV kingmaker. Even with regulatory hurdles, its $100 billion in EV supply chain partnerships (e.g., lithium mines, battery factories) ensure it will dominate as global adoption surges.

Conclusion: Tesla's Future Is Political and Technical

The Charlotte decision is a wake-up call: Tesla's valuation is no longer just about batteries and software. Political polarization and regulatory scrutiny now loom as significant risks. However, the company's technological lead and the inexorable shift to EVs mean it remains a critical holding. Investors should:

1. Hold Tesla, but hedge with Ford or NIO (which faces fewer political risks).

2. Watch for bipartisan EV policies: A federal framework to standardize safety and reduce partisan procurement could stabilize Tesla's trajectory.

3. Focus on Tesla's software monetization: Its FSD beta rollout and data partnerships (e.g., with insurance companies) could offset municipal losses.

In a significant step forward, Michigan has introduced a state-level incentive program aimed at jumpstarting local SAF production. The new legislation—supported by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle—offers targeted tax credits for producers and blenders that can meet stringent emissions and sustainability criteria.

The program is part of a broader shift toward state-led climate and energy action, as federal direction under the Trump administration remains uncertain. While the Michigan initiative establishes a modest tax credit cap of $4.5 million in its first year, it lays the groundwork for regional market development—an essential piece of a national SAF strategy still waiting for clearer federal support.

SAF: A Scalable, Drop-in Solution

SAF is derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks—such as agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. It’s also compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, enabling airlines to cut emissions without significant capital investment.

But production volumes remain limited. While U.S. airlines have committed to bold SAF procurement targets, the supply chain is still in early stages of scale-up. This is where state action becomes critical.

Industry Expands Despite Federal Policy Ambiguity

Across the U.S., SAF producers continue to ramp up operations:

World Energy is expanding its Paramount, CA facility to become one of the largest SAF hubs in North America, aiming for 250 million gallons per year.

Gevo Inc. is building its Net-Zero 1 facility in South Dakota, expected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually with the help of carbon capture and renewable energy.

LanzaJet, headquartered in Illinois, is completing its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Georgia with support from Microsoft and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Neste has expanded its U.S. footprint with SAF supply agreements at San Francisco and Los Angeles airports and a new Houston terminal.

Honeywell UOP and Chevron continue to scale up SAF production through co-processing infrastructure.

Trump Administration: Mixed Signals on SAF

Federal support, however, has become less consistent under the current administration. In February 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) approved a $1.44 billion loan guarantee for Montana Renewables to expand its SAF facility in Great Falls—signaling at least some support for the sector. But that move contrasts with broader federal inaction:

On his first day in office, President Trump froze funding for numerous climate and energy programs, including clean energy tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This freeze has placed the future of SAF-related federal tax credits in limbo, creating deep uncertainty for developers and investors.

The administration has also rebranded SAF as ""synthetic aviation fuel"" in public documents—a rhetorical shift some interpret as a pivot toward domestic fossil-based alternatives.

While Trump has praised SAF as an economic boon for rural America and farmers, especially those producing corn and soy feedstocks, critics note the absence of any cohesive SAF strategy or commitment to lifecycle GHG accounting standards.

This has created what many in the industry describe as a “policy vacuum” at the federal level—one that is now being filled by states like Michigan, California, and Illinois.

What’s Next for SAF in the U.S.?

As SAF production technologies mature and airline demand continues to rise, the question is not whether the U.S. will expand its SAF market—but how quickly and under what regulatory structure. States that proactively support SAF may gain a competitive edge in attracting clean energy investment and positioning their airports as hubs for low-emissions travel.

With uncertainty clouding the future of federal tax credits and lifecycle emissions standards, industry players are increasingly turning to state programs, private capital, and long-term offtake agreements to derisk investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250625-172807-49c-A%20modern%20aircraft%20flying%20over%20green%20fields%20with%20a%20biofuel%20facility%20in%20the%20foreground%2C%20symbolizing%20sustainable%20aviation..jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:16:27.620436

Chèri Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Tribal Energy, told me that Tribes face longer development timelines than the average private developer.
“We have multiple stages of approval that are unique to tribal energy development,” she told me, including lengthy internal consultation processes.
Many of the projects on the list are also doubly threatened by grant cancellations and the repeal of the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.
“If my public power utility wants to develop a project and they need a Canadian turbine, they can’t get any credit.","A little-noticed provision in the Senate tax bill will sabotage the efforts of tribes, rural electric cooperatives, and public power authorities to develop local affordable energy projects by striking a section of the Inflation Reduction Act that enabled tax-exempt groups to claim the clean energy tax credits as direct cash payments from the Treasury.

The IRA included strict domestic sourcing requirements beginning in 2026 for groups utilizing this “direct pay” option. But the law also created exceptions for cases where domestic components were not available in sufficient quantity or quality, or would increase costs by more than 25%. The Senate bill would get rid of these exceptions.

“It just makes it unlikely for those projects to go forward — or more likely for those projects to go forward with a private developer, instead of with a public utility or a tribe or a rural co-op,” Grace Henley, a tax attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “And so they don’t really do anything to increase the amount of domestic material that would be used, they just hurt the projects that are seeking to invest in clean energy infrastructure for these communities to lower costs.”

Public power and tribal energy advocates warn that without the exceptions, energy development will become impossible for their constituents.

Wind and solar projects being developed by these groups are already threatened by the bill’s rapid phase-out of wind and solar tax credits and its complex rules related to using materials from China. Chèri Smith, the executive director of the Alliance for Tribal Energy, told me that Tribes face longer development timelines than the average private developer. “We have multiple stages of approval that are unique to tribal energy development,” she told me, including lengthy internal consultation processes. The changes to direct pay will put these projects further out of reach, she said.

The Alliance provides free energy development consulting services to more than 100 Tribes. Smith sent me a list of projects in Alaska Native villages, Arizona, California, and Oregon that could be killed by the tax credit changes. “Alaska Native villages face some of the highest energy costs in the country,” she said, largely due to their reliance on diesel generators. Just over a third of the Hopi Tribe in Arizona lacks access to electricity, but now multiple microgrid projects meant to close the gap are at risk. Many of the projects on the list are also doubly threatened by grant cancellations and the repeal of the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.

“The bill is particularly harmful to Tribal Nations, pulling the rug out from under projects that would strengthen their energy sovereignty and power local communities,” Democratic Senators Martin Heinrich, Ron Wyden, and Brian Schatz wrote in a joint statement on Thursday. “Together, the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program and our Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits have cleared pathways and removed significant barriers for Tribes to finance and build their own resilient energy infrastructure.”

The American Public Power Association is also sounding the alarm. John Godfrey, the group’s senior government relations director, told me that in addition to wind and solar, municipal utilities and rural electric co-ops are also considering nuclear and hydropower projects. For example, Energy Northwest, a consortium of 29 public utilities in Washington State, has plans to retrofit the Columbia Generating Station nuclear plant to increase its power output. It’s also in early stages to deploy four small, modular nuclear reactors. As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin wrote a few days ago, the governor of New York has also tasked the New York Power Authority with developing a new nuclear plant in the state.

Nuclear and hydropower “are technologies where often there is not a U.S. source, but there is a good trading partner source — Canada, Germany, Japan,” Godfrey said. By tightening the domestic sourcing requirements for direct pay, the bill would “hinder the very technologies that there’s generally a bipartisan consensus we need to be developing.”

Public utilities and electric co-ops, which serve close to 30% of electric customers in the U.S., are also unfairly singled out by the provision, he said. “If my public power utility wants to develop a project and they need a Canadian turbine, they can’t get any credit. But if a taxable corporation down the street develops exactly the same project, they can.”

“If the purpose is to encourage hydropower, that’s not a good use of resources,” he said.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTExMTA4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5OTM0NjQ0NX0.ODTrBIwF3No3YUULSpePtGGjppXW4a2Fe_D42SGK9Lg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-27 13:14:43.893581

""We’re in a triage situation,"" United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain, representing the largest auto worker union in the country, told ABC earlier this year. ""Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years.""

So Fain, who strongly opposed President Donald Trump during his campaign, has enthusiastically supported Trump's economic agenda since he took office.

Frequent Fain nemesis General Motors CEO Mary Barra has also come around on Trump after clashing with him throughout his first term in office.

Once again, the change of heart was spurred by the 25% tariffs the U.S. Treasury has been collecting on auto imports since April.

“For decades now, it has not been a level playing field for us automakers globally, with either tariffs or non-tariff trade barriers. So I think tariffs is one tool that the administration can use to level the playing field.“

Now, international conglomerate Stellantis is embracing its American roots with a recent move.

Stellantis' new Detroit auto parts 'Megahub' is part of $388 million commitment to North America

If U.S. auto fans thought American icon Chrysler lost some of its luster when it merged with Italian stalwart Fiat, then the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler with French automaker Peugeot threatened to kill the brand altogether.

Former CEO Carlos Tavares left the company in late 2024, and on Monday, June 23, new CEO Antonio Filosa started his tenure.

Stellantis' choosing Filosa was an early signal that the U.S. market was one of the company's priorities, as he cut his teeth as head of the North American market.

Under former CEO Carlos Tavares' leadership, Stellantis laid off American factory workers, shuffled its C-suite, and forced its U.S. brands to push products that American customers didn't like.

Meanwhile, Filosa announced he will keep his director of North America title as he moves the CEO's office to Detroit, Michigan.

Stellantis revealed in May that it will build a $388 million ""Megahub"" in Van Buren Township, just outside Detroit.

When the facility is completed in 2027, it ""will feature cutting-edge technology"" and will probably look more like an Amazon fulfillment warehouse than a typical auto parts distribution center.

""Our customers count on us to deliver the right part, at the right time, every time,” said Mopar North America Senior VP Darren Bradshaw.

“With the Metro Detroit Megahub, we’re building a faster, smarter and more reliable parts distribution network that puts their needs first. This investment reflects our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence, while also creating a modern, high-tech workplace for our employees.”

This investment isn't free.

Of course, there is the nearly $400 million facility price tag, but Stellantis has sold multiple sites in the Detroit area in recent years. This investment attempts to consolidate the company's footprint into a new, state-of-the-art facility, according to a Supply Chain Drive report.

Stellantis has to work to make up lost North American ground

Stellantis has a lot of work to do to win back American consumers.

The company reported a 14% year-over-year decline in revenue. Consolidated shipments fell 9% to 1.2 million, which the company blamed on lower North American production.

Despite being a partially U.S.-located brand, Stellantis imported 564,000 vehicles last year, well ahead of Ford's 420,000 imports but below GM's total.

Stellantis reported that total first-quarter U.S. sales decreased 12% year-over-year, despite a 16% increase in Ram brand sales and a 1% increase in Chrysler brand sales. Jeep brand sales saw a 2% increase.

On June 11, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, proposed repealing two key Biden–Harris-era rules targeting greenhouse gas and air toxic emissions from fossil fuel–fired power plants. The first component would revoke the greenhouse gas standards issued under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, which included both the 2015 Clean Power Plan and its 2024 replacement. According to the EPA, these rules impose substantial compliance burdens, contribute to rising electricity costs, and create risks to grid reliability. The agency framed the repeal as a course correction aligned with the US Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which limited the agency’s authority to mandate generation-shifting emissions strategies without clear congressional authorization.

The second component of the proposal targets recent amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which had tightened restrictions on hazardous air pollutants emitted by coal-fired plants. The proposed rollback would restore the 2012 standards, which the agency claims are more cost-effective and less disruptive to plant operations. The EPA estimates that repealing both sets of regulations could save the power sector approximately $19 billion through 2046—roughly $1.2 billion annually—by reducing compliance and infrastructure costs.

Citing legal uncertainty, stakeholder input, and a broader policy shift favoring energy affordability and reliability, the EPA emphasized that the proposed changes reflect a recalibrated approach to environmental regulation. The agency also reaffirmed its intent to gather public comment on additional provisions, including efficiency standards for new gas-fired plants and carbon capture requirements for modified coal units.

Although concerns have been raised regarding the EPA’s proposals, EPA must take public comments under its rulemaking process. A virtual public hearing will occur on July 8, 2025, from 11:00 a.m.–7 p.m. ET on the proposed repeal of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units, and public comments must be received on or before August 7, 2025. As to MATS, a remote hearing is set for July 10, 2025, from 11:00 a.m.–7 p.m. ET, with public comments due on or before August 11, 2025.

The site, near the Department of Energy’s Pantex nuclear weapons plant, “underscores Fermi’s strategic position to build clean, safe, new nuclear power for America’s next-generation AI,” Fermi said.
The site is also situated near some of the largest U.S. gas pipelines and atop a large natural gas field.","Fermi plans to partner on the “Hypergrid” project with Texas Tech University and said it will be launched on July 4.

“We’re behind – and it’s all hands on deck. We need to be doing everything in our power to win this race, because this is the race that really matters.”

Interest in building new nuclear plants has spiked after President Donald Trump issued executive orders last month that aim to fast track applications for new reactors and overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Nuclear critics and some proponents have criticized the overhaul as potentially detrimental to the industry and putting politics ahead of safety and public health. Trump this month also fired Democratic NRC commissioner Chris Hanson.

Fermi said the Amarillo campus has the potential to deliver up to 11 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear, gas and solar power, about enough for more than 8.2 million homes, with 1 GW expected online by late 2026. It did not say how much the project would cost or how it is being financed.

Fermi said the project will be the largest U.S. nuclear power complex, but did not say when it would be completed. U.S. nuclear power has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, with the last reactor coming online last year in Georgia.

The last two reactors completed in Vogtle, Georgia, cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration

The NRC said it is reviewing applications from Fermi which should be public soon. The Washington Post said the project has applied for four 1-GW nuclear reactors. Fermi did not immediately confirm that.

The nearly 5,800-acre (2,347-hectare) campus will also have capacity for large artificial intelligence data centers.

The site, near the Department of Energy’s Pantex nuclear weapons plant, “underscores Fermi’s strategic position to build clean, safe, new nuclear power for America’s next-generation AI,” Fermi said.

The site is also situated near some of the largest U.S. gas pipelines and atop a large natural gas field.

By Edward Chancellor

LONDON, June 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) – To paraphrase Mark Twain, speculative bubbles don’t repeat themselves, but they often rhyme. The green technology boom that has imploded over the past three years is remarkably similar to the alternative energy bubble that inflated prior to the global financial crisis of 2008. Both frenzies were driven by investors’ unrealistic expectations about how quickly new energy technologies would be taken up.

What is now known as the Cleantech 1.0 boom took off in 2005 after the U.S. Congress enacted tax credits for renewable energy. Former Vice President Al Gore’s 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” raised public awareness of climate change. In early 2007 the venture capital investor John Doerr gave a much-publicised TED talk in which he asserted that “green technologies – going green – is bigger than the internet. It could be the biggest opportunity of the twenty-first century.” Doerr’s firm, Kleiner Perkins, later launched a fund to “help speed mass market adoption of solutions to the climate crisis.” Many other venture capitalists jumped on the bandwagon.

The WilderHill Clean Energy Index, launched in 2004, more than doubled between May 2005 and December 2007. Dozens of startups were launched to invest in batteries, solar, biomass and wind energy. An electric vehicle company, Better Place, established in Silicon Valley in 2007, raised nearly $1 billion to build a network of charging stations. Solyndra, an innovative solar panel manufacturer, attracted a host of big-name investors and later received more than $500 million in loan guarantees from the administration of President Barack Obama.

No single factor was responsible for pricking the bubble. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 dampened animal spirits; advances in hydraulic fracturing technology led to cheaper U.S. natural gas; Spain and Germany reduced their subsidies for renewable energy; and American solar companies proved unable to compete with subsidised Chinese competitors. Nearly all the 150 renewable energy startups founded in Silicon Valley during the boom subsequently failed, including Solyndra and Better Place. Cleantech venture capital funds launched during the bubble produced negative returns. By the end of 2012 the WilderHill index had fallen 85% from its peak to around 40. By coincidence, that is where the benchmark currently trades.

The recent green tech bubble was more extreme. The WilderHill index climbed from 47 in March 2020 to 281 less than a year later. Whereas U.S. venture capitalists spent an estimated $25 billion funding clean energy startups between 2006 and 2011, Silicon Valley splurged more than twice that sum in 2021 alone, according to Silicon Valley Bank. Market valuations were quite absurd. By late 2020, the battery company QuantumScape, which came to the market by merging with a blank-check firm, was valued at more than General Motors, despite having no sales.

The market frenzy is long past. QuantumScape stock is down more than 95% from its peak, while the WilderHill index has fallen 85%. Several listed electric vehicle companies, including truck maker Nikola, have filed for protection from creditors. President Donald Trump’s administration is reducing subsidies for renewables and electric vehicles. Oil giants BP and Shell are cutting back their alternative energy investments, just as they did after the Cleantech 1.0 boom. The outcome for green venture capital remains unclear but anecdotal evidence suggests that many funds are now changing hands at steep discounts to their appraised valuations.

The common error investors made during both booms was to become entranced by extravagant growth forecasts. In his book, “More and More and More: An All-Consuming History of Energy”, Jean-Baptiste Fressoz criticises the application of the sigmoid function – also known as the S-curve – to predict the course of the energy transition.

This model describes the adoption of a new technology as starting out slowly, rapidly gathering pace before eventually levelling off when the market becomes saturated. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has used the S-curve in its projections for renewable energy demand and the accompanying decline of fossil fuels.

The S-curve was originally discovered a hundred years ago to describe how the population of drosophila flies changes under laboratory conditions. It was later applied, with varying degrees of success, to project human population growth. The American energy scientist M. King Hubbert was the first to use the S-curve to forecast energy production. In the 1950s, advocates for nuclear energy used the model to predict what they believed was the inevitable transition from fossil fuels towards an atomic-powered future. Hubbert also used the S-curve for his famous forecast that U.S. oil production would peak in 1970.

Vaclav Smil, a leading energy historian, points out that energy transitions are slow, inherently unpredictable and require extraordinary amounts of investment. Fressoz goes further, claiming that – when energy consumption is viewed in absolute rather than relative terms – there has historically never been a transition. It’s true that coal took over from wood as the world’s prime energy source in the 19th century, and that later oil and natural gas became dominant. Yet the consumption of all these energy sources continued increasing. The world has never burned more wood than it does today. In absolute terms, coal usage continues to grow.

The S-curve has also been used to predict the uptake of various green technologies. As Rob West of Thunder Said Energy, a research firm, observed in a report published last September, both the speed of adoption and the ultimate penetration rate for new inventions are variable. For instance, the demand for refrigerators and television by U.S. households grew very rapidly from the outset, with both reaching penetration rates of nearly 100% in just a few decades. Yet it took more than half a century for gas heating to reach 60% of U.S. households, at which point its market share flatlined.

“It is important not to fall into the trap of assuming that the ‘top of the S’ is an endpoint of 100% adoption,” writes West. Not long ago, electric vehicles were set to rapidly replace the internal combustion engine, but sales forecasts are now being cut back in developed markets. West anticipates that the eventual market share for battery-powered cars will not surpass 30%. That’s a guess. The actual outcome will depend on the state of future technology, which is unknowable. That leaves plenty of scope for green investors to get it wrong again. Follow @Breakingviews on X

Small hydropower market grows with rural electrification, government support, and eco-friendly energy demand, especially in Asia-Pacific and developing regions.

Small hydropower offers a sustainable, cost-effective solution for clean energy generation, especially in remote and rural regions with untapped water resources.”

— Allied Market Research

WILMINGTON, DE, UNITED STATES, June 27, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- According to a new report published by Allied Market Research, titled, “Small Hydropower Market,"" The small hydropower market was valued at $2.7 billion in 2023, and is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 2.5% from 2024 to 2033.

The small hydropower (SHP) market plays a critical role in meeting growing global energy demands while promoting sustainability. Small hydropower plants, typically defined as those with an installed capacity of up to 10 MW, utilize flowing water to generate electricity and are widely recognized for their low environmental impact, operational flexibility, and ability to support rural electrification. Unlike large hydro projects, SHP systems require minimal reservoir storage, reducing the risk of ecological disruption and displacement, making them an ideal solution for decentralized power generation, especially in remote or underdeveloped regions.

The global market for small hydropower is witnessing steady growth driven by the increasing demand for renewable energy, supportive government policies, and advancements in turbine technology. Many countries, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, are actively investing in SHP infrastructure to diversify their energy mix and reduce carbon emissions. Additionally, the relatively low investment and maintenance costs associated with SHP systems, combined with their potential to contribute to grid stability, position them as an attractive option for nations seeking to expand their renewable energy portfolio.

Market Dynamics

The small hydropower market is primarily driven by the increasing global demand for clean and renewable energy sources. As countries strive to meet their carbon reduction targets under international agreements such as the Paris Accord, small hydropower offers a viable solution due to its low greenhouse gas emissions, minimal environmental impact, and capacity to support local energy needs. Moreover, governments across the globe are providing favorable policies, including feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and subsidies, which are encouraging investments in SHP projects and accelerating market growth.

Another significant factor contributing to market expansion is the rising need for rural electrification, especially in developing regions. Small hydropower plants are particularly suitable for off-grid and isolated areas, where the extension of the main grid is technically difficult or economically unfeasible. Countries in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America are increasingly deploying SHP systems to power rural communities, schools, health centers, and agricultural operations, thus improving socio-economic conditions while promoting energy access.

Technological advancements have also played a key role in boosting the market. Innovations in turbine design, automation, and digital monitoring systems have enhanced the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of SHP installations. Modern small hydropower systems are now capable of operating efficiently at low flow rates and heads, making them more adaptable to a wider range of geographical settings. This technical evolution is lowering barriers to entry for new developers and enabling the modernization of older, less efficient plants.

However, the market faces challenges such as environmental concerns, regulatory hurdles, and seasonal variability in water availability. While SHP is more environmentally friendly than large-scale hydro, it still requires thorough ecological assessments and careful site selection to minimize impact on local habitats. Additionally, inconsistent regulatory frameworks in some countries and lengthy permitting processes can delay project implementation and discourage private investment.

Despite these challenges, the future of the small hydropower market remains promising. Increasing public awareness about sustainable energy, along with international funding and development assistance programs, is expected to further boost SHP adoption. As the energy transition accelerates, small hydropower will continue to play an integral role in achieving a decentralized, resilient, and low-carbon energy infrastructure worldwide.

Segment Overview

The small hydropower market analysis is segmented based on capacity, component, and application. By capacity, it is categorized into up to 1 MW and 1–10 MW, with the 1–10 MW segment holding a significant share due to its widespread adoption in rural electrification and grid support projects. Based on components, the market includes electromechanical equipment, civil structures, and electric infrastructure, where electromechanical equipment—comprising turbines and generators—dominates due to its critical role in power generation. By application, the market is divided into off-grid and on-grid, with the on-grid segment leading due to increasing integration of small hydropower into national grids to support clean energy targets.

Regional Analysis

Asia-Pacific dominates the small hydropower market and is expected to maintain its lead during the forecast period, driven by strong government support, abundant water resources, and a focus on rural electrification. Countries like China and India are at the forefront, investing heavily in renewable energy infrastructure to meet growing electricity demands and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In particular, China accounts for the largest share of installed small hydropower capacity globally, owing to its favorable policies and robust technical expertise. Southeast Asian nations, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, are also increasingly investing in SHP projects to power remote and mountainous areas.

Europe is another significant region in the small hydropower market, particularly due to stringent environmental regulations and the EU’s commitment to carbon neutrality. Countries like Norway, Switzerland, and Austria have well-established small hydro infrastructures, with modernization and repowering of aging plants providing ongoing growth opportunities. In contrast, North America is witnessing steady progress with small hydropower projects, especially in Canada and certain U.S. states, where focus is placed on reviving non-operational sites and integrating SHP into rural development initiatives. Emerging regions such as Africa and Latin America are also showing strong potential due to increasing investments in decentralized renewable energy systems aimed at expanding electricity access.

Both the House Bill and Senate Finance version modify the BEAT regime, but in significantly different ways.","Following our prior alert on the House Ways & Means Committee version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”), the House passed its version of the OBBBA (“House Bill”) on May 22, 2025, and on June 17, 2025 the Senate Finance Committee (“Senate Finance”) released its own proposed version of the legislation. While both versions share the same overarching goals, the Senate Finance version introduces several significant changes that could materially affect individuals, businesses, and tax planning strategies.

The following is a high-level summary of certain key differences between the House Bill and the Senate Finance version.

I. Provisions Affecting Individual Business Owners / Investors

Individual Tax Rate Structure. No material differences; both versions permanently extend the 37% top marginal rate.

State and Local Taxes (SALT). While the House Bill would increase the SALT deduction to $40,000, subject to phaseout (down to $10,000) for single taxpayers earning over $250,000 and married taxpayers earning over $500,000, the Senate Finance version would permanently extend the existing $10,000 SALT deduction cap. In addition, while the House Bill would completely deny pass-through entity tax (PTET) deductions for individuals in various fields of service (e.g., law, accounting, consulting, investment management, etc.), the Senate Finance version would permit individual owners to deduct the unused portion of their SALT cap plus the greater of (i) $40,000 of their PTET allocation or (ii) 50% of their PTET allocation. These changes could significantly affect planning strategies for pass-through entity owners.

We anticipate that this provision will continue to be heavily negotiated among the House and Senate members, as Republicans from high-tax states in both chambers are pushing to increase the SALT deduction cap for their constituents.

Estate and Gift Taxes. No material differences in the Senate Finance version, as both versions would increase the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million ($30 million for married couples).

Carried Interests. As with the House Bill, the Senate Finance version does not propose any change to the current carried interest rules.

Excise Tax. While both the House Bill and Senate Finance version would impose a 3.5% excise tax on remittance transfers collected by non-US transfer providers who are secondarily liable if unpaid, the Senate Finance version exempts transfers funded through certain US financial institutions or US-issued debit / credit cards.

Unfair Foreign Taxes. Both the House Bill and Senate Finance version add a new Section 899 that will (i) increase US federal income and withholding tax rates for foreign persons that are sufficiently connected to any foreign country with “unfair foreign taxes” (e.g., extraterritorial or discriminatory taxes) and (ii) modify the application of the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) to non-publicly held US corporations that are more than 50% owned by such foreign persons (the so-called Super BEAT).[1] Although both versions would also explicitly override the tax exemption provided in Section 892(a)(1) for foreign governments (including sovereign wealth funds) of such foreign countries, the Senate Finance version differs from the House Bill with respect to the types of unfair foreign taxes that may cause an increase in tax rates. The Senate Finance version also clarifies that the new Section 899 would not override existing exceptions for “portfolio interest” and bank deposit interest among certain other items.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion. Current law allows eligible taxpayers to exclude 100% of their gain on QSBS held for over five years up to the greater of $10 million or 10 times such taxpayer’s basis in their QSBS. In order to be eligible, the corporate issuer must not have a gross asset value exceeding $50 million at any time prior to, or immediately after, such issuance. Although the House Bill did not make any modifications to the QSBS rules, the Senate Finance version made significant revisions to these rules, as follows:

For more information on the Senate Finance Committee’s proposed changes to the QSBS tax benefits, please see QSBS Benefits Expanded Under Senate Finance Proposal.

II. Provisions Affecting Domestic and Foreign Business and Organizations

Qualified Business Income Deduction (Section 199A). While both the House Bill and Senate Finance version would make permanent the deduction for certain qualified business income from pass-through entities, the Senate Finance version maintains the rate at 20%, whereas the House Bill increases it to 23%.

Business Interest Expense Deductions (Section 163(j)). Both the House Bill and Senate Finance version would increase the cap on the deductibility of business interest expense for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 by determining such cap based on 30% of EBITDA (which is more taxpayer-favorable than EBIT under current law), but the Senate Finance version includes a new provision that would treat certain capitalized interest expense as subject to the Section 163(j) limitation.

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k)). While both the House Bill and Senate Finance version would restore 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, the Senate Finance version would make the provision permanent.

Research and Experimental Expenditures (Section 174). Both the House Bill and Senate Finance versions allow immediate expensing of domestic research or experimental (R&D) expenditures starting in 2025, while continuing 15-year amortization for foreign R&D. However, the Senate Finance version would make the provision permanent and would (i) permit small businesses (under $31 million in gross receipts) to retroactively apply this provision for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021 and (ii) allow all taxpayers to elect to accelerate any remaining deductions for domestic expenditures made between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2024 over a one- or two-year period.

Global Intangible Low-Taxes Income (GILTI) and Foreign-Derived Intangibles Income (FDII). Both the House Bill and Senate Finance version adjust the Section 250 deduction but take different approaches. The House Bill fully restores the higher deduction rates—50% for GILTI and 37.5% for FDII—on a permanent basis starting in 2026. In contrast, the Senate Finance version sets the rates at 40% for GILTI and 33.34% for FDII while containing modifications for the calculations of GILTI and FDII different from the House Bill.

Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). Both the House Bill and Senate Finance version modify the BEAT regime, but in significantly different ways. The House Bill simplifies the approach by permanently reducing the BEAT rate from the scheduled 2026 rate of 12.5% to 10.1% and preserving the current treatment of tax credits beyond 2025. The Senate Finance version takes a broader approach, raising the rate to 14%, lowering the base erosion percentage threshold from 3% to 2%, limiting credit modifications, and exempting certain high-taxed foreign payments, while also expanding what counts as a base erosion payment.

Limitation Against Downward Attribution. The Senate Finance version reintroduces Section 958(b)(4), which was removed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Section 958(b)(4) limits the circumstances in which a US corporation could be treated as constructively owning stock of a foreign corporation held by such US corporation’s foreign shareholders (i.e., downward attribution). The elimination of Section 958(b)(4) significantly expanded the number of foreign corporations treated as “controlled foreign corporations” (CFCs) and, as a result, the number of US shareholders of such CFCs that were currently taxed on the earnings of such CFCs. The Senate Finance version’s reintroduction of Section 958(b)(4) would provide welcome relief to many US persons who became subject to the CFC rules, not as a result of direct or indirect ownership of such foreign corporation, but as a result of the TCJA’s requiring downward attribution of foreign corporation stock from foreign persons to US corporations held by such foreign persons.

III. Provisions Affecting Renewable Energy Businesses

Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y) and Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E). The Senate Finance version would phase out these credits for wind and solar projects beginning construction after 2025, fully eliminating the credits for such projects that begin construction after 2027. For other technologies (e.g., nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower), the Senate Finance version would phase out the credits for projects that begin construction after 2033, with the credit being completely phased out for projects beginning construction after 2035. The House Bill adopts a more aggressive phaseout, allowing these credits only for facilities that (i) begin construction no more than 60 days after enactment of the OBBBA and (ii) are placed in service prior to January 1, 2029.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U). Although the original draft from the Ways & Means Committee would have subjected this credit to a phaseout beginning in 2029, both the House Bill and Senate Finance version eliminate the phaseout and follow current law. The Senate Version would, however, add a fuel-origin restriction disallowing credits if nuclear fuel is produced by covered nations or entities, effective for taxable years after 2027.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X). The House Bill accelerates the phaseout of the advanced manufacturing tax credit, eliminating wind components sold after 2027 and all other components sold after 2031. The Senate Finance version follows the House Bill with respect to wind components by eliminating the credit for such components sold after 2027, but adds a phaseout for the creditability of sales of critical minerals (under current law, critical minerals are not subject to the Section 45X phaseout).

Transfer of Tax Credits (Section 6418). Unlike the House Bill, which repeals the tax credit transferability provision with respect to certain types of tax credits either two years after enactment of the OBBBA or in 2028 (depending on the type of credit), the Senate Finance version does not repeal tax credit transferability.

IV. Final Thoughts

While the House Bill and Senate Finance version of the OBBBA reflect shared policy goals, and we can see the tax package that will ultimately be delivered to President Trump for signature starting to come together, they diverge on key provisions that could materially affect taxpayers across various sectors and create some obstacles that the House and Senate will need to overcome for this tax package to be enacted.

The House and Senate will begin to negotiate in an effort to pass a comprehensive bill by the July 4 deadline set by Republican leadership (although we anticipate that deadline to slip further into the summer), with the SALT deduction cap and energy tax credits certain to be a few of the many subjects of those negotiations. The tax team at Mintz is closely monitoring the development of the proposals and will provide further updates as the OBBBA advances.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16279_1240.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:17:29.964912

Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers for being the first in the nation to codify into law a guarantee of Affordable, Reliable, and Clean energy for homes and businesses statewide. Gov. Landry’s signature on Tuesday positions the state as a powerhouse of economic growth and innovation for decades to come.

Why it matters: The bill, HB 692, represents landmark legislation that removes uncertainty from Louisiana’s energy future and guarantees cost-effective and dependable energy for generations to come. Gov. Landry said it, and a handful of other measures, collectively will “unleash Louisiana’s coastal energy production.”

TEA has long been an advocate of such legislation at the state level. Other states should follow their lead and pass similar legislation. Ohio and Tennessee passed laws previously, and neighboring Mississippi introduced a bill earlier this year, but it never got to a vote.

What it does: First, it strengthens Louisiana’s economic momentum and global competitiveness by attracting continued investment from leading corporations. In addition:

Prioritizes domestically produced fuel sources to reduce dependence on foreign nations.

Equips ratepayers with honest, transparent information about the real costs of energy, ensuring affordability.

Promotes a Louisiana renaissance built on the contributions of more than 300,000 men and women working in the oil and gas sector.

Prevents the use of infrastructure components sourced from exploitative labor practices often found in overseas manufacturing.

It will also ensure that all energy sources are reliable and contribute to the resiliency of the power grid. Furthermore, Louisiana is setting the example for all states to follow in ensuring that the energy needed to heat and cool our homes, provide for the bulk of our electricity, and power our emerging data centers is Affordable, Reliable, and Clean.

It also represents approximately $98 billion in announced or in-progress investments for data centers, LNG projects, and other energy-related initiatives in Louisiana.

We commend Gov. Landry and state lawmakers for putting their constituents first and for ensuring a bright future for the people and businesses of Louisiana. Kudos to Rep. Jacob Landry and Senate President Cameron Henry for recognizing the benefits of the bill and working diligently to steer it through both chambers to final passage.

Bottom line: With the passage of HB 692, Louisiana sets an example for the nation of how to pursue energy security by prioritizing energy sources that are affordable, reliable, AND clean. Not just one of the three.

ENERGY SECURITY MORE VITAL THAN EVER: Don’t believe the media hype and extremist rhetoric stemming from the US taking out three key Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.

Oil prices are not spiking. The Strait of Hormuz will not be closed. And gas prices will not top $5.

That’s because our domestic energy supply, particularly thanks to the shale industry, keeps America’s energy secure. This benefits every American regardless of age, income level, or political affiliation.

Why it matters: An independent analysis by top gas price expert, Patrick De Haan, shows an overview of oil producers and consumers impacted by the Strait of Hormuz.

See who’s missing under Key Recipients? The good ol’ USA.

That’s the benefit of American energy dominance.

We have a century’s worth of natural gas beneath our feet. We have an additional 7 million acres of land in Alaska for oil and gas development.

Thus, we do not need to rely on natural gas and oil from the Middle East and its terrorist supporting dictators.

Consider:

The U.S. hydraulic fracturing boom provides an economic buffer, allowing it to respond to Middle East tensions.

U.S. oil production can quickly increase, potentially offsetting some conflict impact, but not always immediately.

Not surprisingly, there has been renewed investor interest in U.S.-based oil-and-gas exploration stocks.

Though some of these hydraulic fracturing methods had existed for years, they were successfully applied to dense rock formations only around 2003 as technologies improved, allowing companies to unlock vast amounts of oil and gas.

Today, due to this technology, the U.S. has net exports of approximately 2.5 barrels per capita and is also the world’s largest seller of liquefied natural gas. The technology isn’t new, but improvements in the past 15 years have been transformational.

The shale boom, meanwhile, has supported a surge in overseas crude sales, allowing the country to become a net exporter of oil and refined products such as gasoline for the first time in decades.

Bottom line: American natural gas delivers Affordable, Reliable, and Clean energy that protects our environment, strengthens our security, and supports independence in peace and conflict.

The United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) issued to Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC (“Duke”) an Emergency Order (“EO”) to what is described as potential grid shortfall issues in the southeast United States. See Department of Energy Order No. 202-25-5.

The EO provides that Duke can utilize specified electric generating units located within its area to operate at their maximum generation output levels due to:

Ongoing extreme weather conditions.

Need to preserve the reliability of bulk electric power.

Shortage of electric energy.

Shortage of facilities for the generation of electric energy.

That the EO is issued pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, citing U.S.C. § 824a(c).

Duke’s service territory is stated to be impacted by a ridge of high pressure that will stall over the eastern United States resulting in elevated ambient temperatures combined with high humidity for many eastern power pools. As a result, the combination of heat and humidity is expected to result in a significant increase in demand for electricity on the Duke Energy system. The conditions are stated to be expected to begin on June 23, 2025, and extend through June 25, 2025.

Duke has indicated that:

Approximately 1,500 MW of generating units are currently in outage or derated.

Other units may be limited in their availability by conditions and limitations in their environmental permits.

These issues are cited as potentially resulting in the utility not having sufficient generation available to what is described as unusually high demand. Therefore, the EO states that the utility may have to curtail load in order to maintain security and reliability of the grid.

The EO includes a description of mitigation measures that Duke has undertaken to reduce load, which are stated to include:

Public conservation appeals encouraging customers to reduce usage.

Curtailing all recallable energy sales.

Implementation of load management program.

Notification of wholesale customers to implement in-kind load management programs.

Exhausted its ability to obtain more power through other means.

The EO directs Duke to dispatch:

…dispatch such unit or units and to order their operation only as needed to maintain the necessary generation.

Such units are identified in the Order 202-25-5 Resource List.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 16:11:03.923675

There’s a reason why Florida is named “Sunshine State.” Our abundant sunlight is one of our most powerful natural resources — and now, we’re harnessing it to fuel a clean energy revolution.

In 2024, Florida installed the second-highest solar capacity in the United States. Currently, Florida produces enough solar energy to power more than 2 million homes and the industry’s growth has created thousands of jobs.

This boom in solar power has been driven in recent years by the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which expanded clean energy tax credits.

Federal incentives have helped scale commercial and utility-scale solar projects and have made solar energy more affordable for ordinary families thanks to a tax credit for up to 30% of the cost of solar panel installation.

Prior to the credits, solar energy often came with steep upfront costs that made it unfeasible for many. But now, families all over Florida can reduce installation costs by thousands of dollars and then save even more on their energy bills for decades to come — all while cutting pollution.

Unfortunately, these benefits are now on the chopping block as a major tax package currently advancing through Congress aims to roll back these critical clean energy credits.

The tax package, informally known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” has already passed the House and proposes ending residential credits by 2025 and dramatically restricting commercial incentives. The Senate is now working on a revised version, with negotiations intensifying ahead of a July 4 deadline.

While bill text released by the Senate Finance Committee proposes a more moderate approach, key incentives for clean energy have been weakened — and that does not bode well. Policy uncertainty already led to $1.4 billion in U.S. clean energy projects being cancelled in May and solar stocks are taking a serious hit.

Unless the final bill text protects clean energy credits, Florida risks losing momentum fast.

We feel this acutely in South Florida. Our sweltering year-round heat and imminent hurricane threats demand resilient, affordable energy. Solar power can help us to keep our lights on during outages and shields families from unpredictable electricity prices.

So it’s especially concerning that solar energy — our most promising and accessible clean power source — is positioned to take the hardest hit.

If Congress guts clean energy tax incentives, homeowners, schools, churches and small businesses across Florida will be priced out of clean energy that could cut pollution and stabilize the state’s power grid.

Rolling back these tax credits now would slow installations, threaten thousands of local jobs and stall the progress we’ve made so far. For a state with as much solar potential as Florida, that would be a missed opportunity we cannot afford. The decisions being made in Congress today will determine Florida’s clean energy future.

Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody must stand up for Florida families by protecting the clean energy tax credits that have made all our solar progress possible. Our economy, environment and future depend on keeping these incentives intact.

Lexus will become the second foreign automotive brand after Tesla to establish a wholly-owned car factory in China.

Lexus has begun construction on its factory in Shanghai, as the premium brand of Japanese automotive giant Toyota aims to carve out a share of China's highly competitive electric vehicle (EV) market.

The EV factory project, located in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai, officially broke ground today, according to an announcement released by the district government.

The project is expected to be completed in August 2026 and begin production in 2027, with an annual production capacity of up to 100,000 vehicles, according to a report by local media outlet The Paper today.

Toyota aims to leverage the project to accelerate its transition toward electrification and smart cars, launching EVs tailored for both the Chinese domestic and international markets, the report said.

Toyota announced on February 5 that it would build a wholly-owned EV factory in Shanghai to produce Lexus models.

The first Lexus-branded battery electric vehicle (BEV) model was scheduled to begin production in 2027, according to the February statement.

The factory's initial production capacity is about 100,000 units per year, with an estimated 1,000 new jobs created during the initial production phase.

This means Lexus will become the second foreign automaker after Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to establish a wholly-owned automotive factory in China.

China relaxed restrictions in the pure electric vehicle sector in 2018, allowing foreign companies to operate wholly-owned entities. Starting in 2022, the country further lifted foreign equity ratio restrictions in the passenger vehicle manufacturing sector, permitting foreign automakers to establish wholly-owned factories.

In early April, Lexus acquired an industrial land plot spanning about 1.13 million square meters in Jinshan district for RMB 1.353 billion ($189 million), according to an announcement from the Shanghai Public Resources Trading Center.

The land plot is approved for use in NEV manufacturing, lithium-ion battery manufacturing, and other battery manufacturing.

On April 22, Toyota signed a cooperation agreement with Shanghai authorities to pave the way for the project's launch.

Toyota is the world's largest automaker by sales volume, and China is its third-largest market, trailing only the US and Japan.

And New York plans to publish a statewide “master plan” for nuclear deployment by the end of next year, Hochul said in January.
In September, the U.S. Department of Energy said two of New York’s three operating nuclear plants had capacity for a theoretical 600-MW modular reactor.
Former coal power plant sites also tend to be well-characterized and may have spare interconnection capacity, as the two New York plants do, Ibarra said.
“So everybody’s raising their hand right now.” A successful outcome for this first project could blunt historical skepticism of nuclear power in downstate New York, where the grid remains congested and fossil-dependent, Carlson said.","Dive Brief:

New York could take a page from Ontario’s playbook and deploy multiple reactors to reach and possibly exceed the 1-GW target Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Monday, analysts with Clean Air Task Force said in an interview.

Whether the New York Power Authority ultimately selects a large light-water reactor like the Westinghouse AP1000 or multiple units of a small modular design like the GE Hitachi BWRX-300, lessons learned on recent and ongoing nuclear builds could translate to lower final costs, said John Carlson, CATF’s senior Northeast regional policy manager.

That could enable a “fleet-style approach” to deployment similar to Ontario Power Generation’s plan to build four 300-MW BWRX-300 reactors in sequence, lowering the final cost per unit, said Victor Ibarra, senior manager for CATF’s advanced nuclear energy program. On Monday, Hochul said the plan would “allow for future collaboration with other states and Ontario.”

Dive Insight:

Gov. Hochul on Monday directed NYPA and the New York Department of Public Service “to develop at least one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity, either alone or in partnership with private entities,” in upstate New York.

As governor, Hochul has considerable influence over NYPA, the state-owned electric utility. In February, for example, she “demand[ed]” NYPA suspend a proposed rate hike.

Hochul’s announcement made no mention of specific reactor types or designs, but the suggestion that multiple plants could be in the offing suggests NYPA could consider small modular designs alongside a large light-water reactor, Ibarra said.

“It’s good that they’re taking a minute to explore both options,” Carlson said. “I don’t think they know which one is most beneficial yet.”

Hochul said NYPA would immediately begin evaluating “technologies, business models and locations” for the first plant. The preconstruction process will include detailed technology feasibility assessments, evaluation of financing options and site suitability assessments “based on public safety, strength of community support, compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as skilled labor and land availability,” she said.

But Hochul gave no timeline for construction to begin. New York has a statutory mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and an interim goal of 70% carbon-free power by 2030, which it risks missing as its offshore wind industry sputters.

History suggests a roughly decade-long timeline from technology selection to plant commissioning, or about 2035 “if they chose a design tomorrow,” Ibarra said.

Nevertheless, New York’s nuclear ambitions are serious, he said. The state is one of five state co-chairs of the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, a resource- and technology-sharing consortium that aims to build a substantial nuclear orderbook behind one or two standardized reactor designs. It’s jointly pursuing U.S. Department of Energy funding alongside Constellation Energy to support a possible SMR deployment at Constellation’s Nine Mile Point plant. And New York plans to publish a statewide “master plan” for nuclear deployment by the end of next year, Hochul said in January.

New York’s three existing nuclear plants — the roughly 2-GW Nine Mile Point, 854-MW James A. FitzPatrick plant and 580-MW Robert Emmett Ginna plant — are well-characterized and have existing grid interconnections and other key infrastructure, making them suitable on paper for new reactors, Carlson and Ibarra said.

In September, the U.S. Department of Energy said two of New York’s three operating nuclear plants had capacity for a theoretical 600-MW modular reactor. It did not name the plants, however.

But all three sites are owned by Constellation Energy, so a “competitive” site selection process would need to look beyond them to a mix of brownfield and possibly greenfield sites as well, Carlson said.

New York has two recently retired coal-fired power plants with a combined 1,282 MW of capacity, making each suitable for a 600-MWe reactor, according to DOE.

Former coal power plant sites also tend to be well-characterized and may have spare interconnection capacity, as the two New York plants do, Ibarra said. But while the idea of repowering them with new nuclear is generally enticing from an economic development perspective, former coal communities “show varying levels of interest” when approached, he added.

“We need a lot of stakeholder engagement [on this],” Ibarra said.

In her remarks on Monday, Hochul suggested local resistance will not be a dealbreaker for NYPA and its potential development partners.

“Only receptive, welcoming communities will be considered, and there’s a lot of them,” she said. “So everybody’s raising their hand right now.”

A successful outcome for this first project could blunt historical skepticism of nuclear power in downstate New York, where the grid remains congested and fossil-dependent, Carlson said.

“America’s support for homegrown, local solutions to serious problems is crucially important,” he wrote. “We are happy to be going to bat.”

In Kentucky, Brooke Perry Pardue, president and CEO of Parks Alliance of Louisville, another plaintiff, said the loss of funds has forced the group to cut staff.

“We’ve been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city’s most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect,” Pardue said in a statement. “And we’re having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.”

A company called GeoFrame Energy announced that it would partner with Houston’s Halliburton to extract and refine lithium on about 8,000 acres in northeast Texas. But what does lithium mining entail, exactly?

For details, Texas Standard spoke to Michael McKibben, research professor in the department of earth and planetary sciences at the University of California, Riverside. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: I think of where lithium is abundant. Chile, Argentina, Bolivia… East Texas? Really?

Michael McKibben: Well, it overlies the Smackover Formation, which is this large formation of rock that extends from East Texas through Arkansas and into parts of Louisiana, and there’s a lot of interest in the brine contained within those rocks and the lithium in those brines.

How much of this is about not just getting to the lithium but actually the extraction process itself that makes it possible to reach that lithium?

Well, so a lot of companies are going after what’s called direct lithium extraction, which means you have an absorbent that selectively pulls lithium out of the brine. So all you have to do is if you’re not already pumping the brines out onto the surface to process it, you have drill wells and do that.

But the advantage of direct lithium is you don’t have to dig open pit mines like they do in Australia and blast rock and soak it in sulfuric acid. And you don’t have to dump brine out onto the surface as evaporation ponds like they do in Chile, in Argentina, and soon in Bolivia, which is extremely wasteful of water and is disturbing the ecology of some of their tourist attractions.

So DLE is a very effective and resource-conservative way of producing lithium compared to how it’s produced around the world.

Would this be disruptive to have on your property or live nearby? I mean, because of the way that this is sort of mopped out of the water, if I understand your description, how much damage could this do?

Well it shouldn’t do any damage at all because you’re gonna pump the brine out from the subsurface, run it through some extraction plumbing on the surface, and then re-inject the brine back into the formation. So pretty much a closed system.

Well, given your experience then, from a safety standpoint, we’ve discussed on our program stories about the challenges of putting out fires from lithium-ion batteries and that kind of thing.

Is this sort of lithium extraction especially dangerous or more dangerous than other kinds of mining? I just wonder about fighting a blaze at a facility in an area where there aren’t many firefighting resources, for example.

No, because they’re not going to be producing batteries directly, as far as I understand.

They’re just going to produce the resource of lithium, and usually that’s produced as a lithium chloride solution, which is not dangerous. And then they will convert that lithium chloride into solid materials called lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide monohydrate, and that’s what the battery manufacturers use to make their batteries.

So the only danger you run into with lithium is on the battery end of it, not on resource end of it.

The companies involved in this project say that there’s enough lithium concentrated in this formation that you were describing in East Texas to meet domestic demand in the U.S. Does that sound feasible or plausible to you?

Well, to prove that, they’d have to provide some more information than I’ve seen in articles online.

So, you need to know the brine flow rate out of the wells. You need to know the concentration of the lithium in those brines. And then you need know the recovery efficiency of the DLE method.

If they provide that information, then one could assess how significant the resources are. But I haven’t seen that provided yet.

What about economic opportunities that might be adjacent for the broader community? Are there such opportunities?

Well, sure, you’ve got staff to run the plant and produce the product and then it depends on what they add on in terms of manufacturing to the production of the resource.

So if they do decide they want to make batteries near that site, or even if they decide they want to recycle batteries in the future on that site, then you’ve sort of got these cascading effects on the job production.

So it really depends on how involved they’re going to be in the entire supply chain – from the raw resource itself to the end product, which is the battery.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lithium_Element_-_3_2-1024x557.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 13:17:57.024016

As governments and markets push for decarbonization, companies like NIPSCO (a subsidiary of NiSource, Inc.) are proving that green transformation isn't just about compliance—it's a pathway to long-term growth, cost efficiency, and investor resilience. With its ambitious solar investments and strategic alignment with regulatory frameworks, NIPSCO offers a compelling case for why utility stocks, far from being “stodgy,” are emerging as growth-oriented assets in a volatile economy.

Regulatory Tailwinds Fueling Renewable Expansion

NIPSCO's transition is not happening in a vacuum. The utility's recent solar projects—including the Indiana Crossroads Solar Farm (200 MW) and the Dunns Bridge Solar I & II (combined 700 MW capacity with battery storage)—are underpinned by robust regulatory support. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) has approved phased rate increases to fund these projects, ensuring that NIPSCO can recover costs while maintaining affordability. For instance, the 2025 rate case proposal includes a 22% average residential bill increase by March 2026, but this is paired with a new income-qualified bill assistance program and a 9% discount for multifamily housing customers. Such measures demonstrate regulators' willingness to balance investor returns with public interest—a critical factor for utilities seeking to scale renewables.

Long-Term Cost Savings: Coal's Sunset, Renewables' Dawn

The financial logic of NIPSCO's shift is undeniable. By retiring all coal-fired units by 2028, the company expects to eliminate $126 million in annual coal-related costs, including fuel, maintenance, and compliance expenses. Meanwhile, its solar and wind projects—such as the Cavalry Solar Farm (200 MW paired with 45 MW of battery storage)—are generating $80 million in annual savings through renewable energy credit (REC) sales and excess power generation. These savings are returned directly to customers, softening the impact of rate hikes and reinforcing NIPSCO's value proposition.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies this advantage. Tax equity investments and production tax credits have enabled NIPSCO to secure lower-cost financing for projects like Dunns Bridge II, which combines solar and battery storage to enhance grid reliability. Such federal support positions utilities as beneficiaries of both policy and market trends, making their renewable investments a win-win for shareholders and consumers.

Dividend Stability in a Volatile Market

Utilities like NIPSCO thrive in environments where steady income matters most. The company's regulated business model ensures predictable cash flows, even as it transitions to renewables. By expanding its rate base—the value of infrastructure eligible for regulated returns—NIPSCO can secure returns on solar and storage projects without diluting dividends. For instance, its $2 billion commitment to renewables through 2025 is funded in part by incremental rate increases, which are carefully phased to avoid overburdening customers.

This stability is evident in NiSource's (NI) stock performance. While broader utility indices have fluctuated, NiSource's shares have shown resilience, reflecting investor confidence in its regulated growth strategy.

Investment Opportunity: Growth Without Sacrificing Safety

NIPSCO's solar portfolio isn't just about compliance—it's a growth engine. Projects like the Fairbanks Solar Farm (250 MW, operational by 2025) and the Dunns Bridge II Battery Storage System (75 MW) are diversifying its energy mix and reducing reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets. With Indiana's Integrated Resource Plan mandating 90% carbon reduction by 2030, NIPSCO's investments are aligned with state and federal policy, minimizing regulatory risk.

For investors, this means a portfolio of assets that are both defensive and accretive. Rate-base growth, tax incentives, and cost savings from coal retirements create a “triple bottom line” of value: stable dividends, capital appreciation from regulated returns, and long-term earnings growth as renewables scale.

Risks and Considerations

No investment is without risk. Delays in project timelines—such as those for Dunns Bridge II—could strain cash flows, while further regulatory scrutiny over rate hikes might cap returns. However, NIPSCO's track record of completing projects on time (e.g., Indiana Crossroads Solar's 2023 operational start) and its proactive engagement with regulators mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: Utilities as the New “New Economy”

NIPSCO's transition underscores a paradigm shift: utilities are no longer just distributors of power but architects of the clean energy future. By leveraging regulatory support, tax incentives, and long-term cost savings, companies like NIPSCO are turning environmental obligations into financial opportunities. For investors seeking stability in a volatile market, these utilities offer a rare combination of dividend resilience, growth potential, and alignment with global decarbonization trends.

As the sun sets on coal and rises on renewables, NIPSCO's solar farms are more than power generators—they're beacons for a new era of utility investing.

Power to the People Through Renewable Energy Projects While brownouts are a nuisance, they could encourage communities to control their power sources.","There’s nothing quite like the sense of helplessness that comes with a sudden brownout. It disrupts your routine, causes appliances to malfunction and leaves you fumbling for candles in the drawer. This scenario is becoming increasingly common in regions worldwide that experience frequent power shortages, primarily due to rising energy demand and grids that can’t keep up.

Fortunately, solutions are emerging without waiting for governments or corporations to act. Communities are taking the initiative by adopting decentralized, renewable energy projects, from solar to wind, to power their microgrids.

What Is a Brownout?

Brownouts are partial power outages or voltage drops. You may have electricity in your home, but your incandescent bulbs are dim, while LED lights flicker if they even turn on. Unlike complete blackouts, brownouts are typically shorter, lasting only minutes or hours. Despite their brevity, they can wreak havoc on your devices. They’re especially common during peak demand, such as when everyone blasts the AC during a heat wave or turns up electric heaters in winter.

Consistent brownouts may signal a more severe grid issue. In the U.S., the frequency and duration of power outages have increased, rising from an average of 3.5 hours in 2013 to more than seven hours in 2021. Several factors, including aging infrastructure and energy inequality, may contribute to their occurrence.

Busting Brownouts for Everyone

You know solar panels can decrease a single household’s energy bills, but have you heard of an entire neighborhood coming together to invest in renewables? Shared solar farms and local wind projects can power a whole community. If done successfully, that strategy could reduce the load on long-overstressed national grids and dramatically cut the chances of brownouts.

Solar power generation is the leading source of green electricity in the U.S. Over 5 million American households have installed solar panels, which the Solar Energy Industries Association projects will double by 2030. In addition to individual homes, 44 states have at least one community solar project currently.

Meanwhile, over 73,000 wind turbines exist nationwide, with the windiest states, like Texas, leading the wind power generation movement. Communal versions of these wind projects power neighborhoods while providing economic opportunities to the community.

Increasingly unreliable power, the desire for independence from commercial energy providers and a motivation to positively impact communities drives this shift toward greener energy.

Community-Based Renewable Energy Projects

Here are practical ways residents can help prevent brownouts while turning up the sustainability dial through renewable energy projects.

1. Create Local Microgrids

Think of a microgrid as your neighborhood’s power system. It operates autonomously and continues functioning even when the national grid fails.

Community solar microgrids powered by photovoltaic panels, battery storage and intelligent energy systems have been popping up in urban and rural settings. These microgrids run critical infrastructure like schools, health centers and emergency services when storms hit or the main grid buckles under pressure.

2. Participate in Community Solar Farms

People in urban areas may not have suitable roofing or the budget for their panels. Community solar farms allow such households to access the benefits of solar power despite these hurdles, democratizing access. Solar power can eliminate the need for conventional energy sources, while lowering utility costs at the same time.

Those whose homes meet the standards for solar installation can contribute to the grid through solar roofing. The panels must be at an angle to maximize the benefits.

3. Educate and Incentivize

Many people oppose the transition to green energy due to uncertainty and misinformation. Rumors and stories about wind turbine noise causing congenital disorders in horses, the health effects of low-frequency infrasound if erected near households and other fears — such as wind turbines breaking and falling in surrounding areas — have derailed renewable projects nationwide.

These misconceptions highlight the need for targeted education about the environmental benefits of reliable green energy. Information dissemination should also debunk public health myths. For one, solar energy doesn’t produce poisonous gases, so people can safely install panels atop their homes.

Meanwhile, turbines generate power without combustion or burning fossil fuels and have an excellent safety record. Despite thousands of turbines in operation, there are fewer than 40 recorded incidents.

Pair that with stable incentives like rebates, low-interest loans and tax credits, and communities will be more likely to jump in. Successful urban initiatives often lead to improved infrastructure that can adapt to benefit rural use, creating a feedback loop of resilience.

Why Community-Based Renewables Support Sustainability

Reducing brownouts through communal green power is a community empowerment story. When locals design, invest in and benefit from independent energy systems, the result is more than reliable electricity. It’s social cohesion, economic resilience and environmental justice.

Community ownership ensures that profits stay local rather than flow to faceless utilities. That means more reinvestment in local services, jobs and public trust.

Power to the People Through Renewable Energy Projects

While brownouts are a nuisance, they could encourage communities to control their power sources. Today, it’s no longer enough for one home to power itself. Communities must support one another in benefiting from green initiatives. A solar or wind co-op may be your neighborhood’s secret to sustainable electricity and lasting impact. Brownouts might be inevitable in the old system, but they don’t stand a chance in a community-powered future.",https://greenerideal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gi-fb2-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 17:11:18.398025

Besides solar, multiple other South Carolinian industries have benefited from the state’s clean energy transition.
“These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy,” the Charleston County resident further explained.
However, in late May, the U.S. House narrowly pushed through a reconciliation bill that took a sledgehammer to these same tax credits, compromising American leadership in those industries.
“Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources,” Sullivan concluded.","Due to clean energy tax credits, “businesses have announced plans to create over 20,000 new clean energy jobs and invest over $32 billion into South Carolina’s economy over the next decade,” Sean Sullivan, founding and managing partner at EMPWR Solar, wrote in a commentary piece published in the South Carolina Daily Gazette.

As he discussed on his LinkedIn page, “Seeing the potential in the solar Industry, I decided to enter the space in 2015 and open my own company in South Carolina. After a year of heavy involvement building out systems for sales and operations, I decided to add installation and bring on my first crew.” Since then, he helped launch EMPWR Solar, which now actively serves 16 states, with 10 more on the way. He wrote from his firsthand experience, “These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.”

As of the first quarter, according to the Solar Energies Industry Association, over 2,600 MW of solar had been installed in South Carolina, enough to provide energy to over 325,000 homes. Additionally, after investing $210 million last year, the state’s solar market was valued at $3.4 billion, powered by 80 companies providing jobs for more than 3,000 South Carolinians. “Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies, which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities,” Sullivan observed.

Besides solar, multiple other South Carolinian industries have benefited from the state’s clean energy transition. “These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy,” the Charleston County resident further explained. However, in late May, the U.S. House narrowly pushed through a reconciliation bill that took a sledgehammer to these same tax credits, compromising American leadership in those industries.

Sullivan elaborated that these investments are more essential than ever in the face of skyrocketing energy demand, “South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure. Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade.” Clean energy can be a component of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that ensures the state can meet its energy needs and avoid the worst consequences of an energy deficit. “Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses,” he commented.

The solar executive added that although the state’s electricity rates are below the national average, they have risen about 6% year-over-year. “Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources,” Sullivan concluded.

Different energy sources ensure that local communities are not left powerless if one of them goes down. Therefore, Sullivan wrote that diversifying energy sources makes good business sense, “Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats.”

Sullivan also made the case that diversification brings energy independence. This bolsters energy security by reducing reliance on other states and countries: “If we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.”

Sillivan also pointed to the uncertainty caused by the change in administration earlier this year, causing AESC to pause construction of its manufacturing facility in Florence, which would create 1,600 jobs in Pee Dee. Likewise, shifting gears on the tax credits after three years of full implementation would be bad for South Carolinians, he argued, “Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restriction.”

He also pointed out, “Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value.” He posited that they can be just as beneficial for the clean energy industry, which will, in turn, provide jobs and invest in local communities.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/1715888777509-1-e1750863389864.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 12:23:31.907605

The only problem is, it’s near impossible to be sure right now who may actually benefit from this giveaway — and the mystery is driving me up the wall. I feel like Charlie Day in that episode of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, stringing documents together and ranting like a lunatic.

The Senate bill would phase out the tech-neutral production tax credit starting next year and completely eliminate it by the start of 2028. For the past week and a half, I have been trying to solve the riddle of an exemption tucked into the language that would allow a wind or solar facility that is “part of a single project” to continue to take advantage of the tech-neutral production tax credit as it exists today, which means it would not begin to phase out until 2034.

To qualify for the exemption a project must, according to the Senate text, meet two conditions: It must produce more than 1 gigawatt of electricity, and be sited on federal lands where a “right-of-way grant or lease” had been given by the Bureau of Land Management before June 16, which is the date the text was released.

Only a handful of projects in the U.S. could possibly fit that criteria. But every time I think I’ve identified one that will actually qualify, I learn a new fact that, to me, takes it out of the running.

Here’s why my head hurts so much: A renewables facility that would benefit from this language needs to be sited at least partially on federal lands. But because Trump isn’t issuing new right-of-way approvals or leases to most renewables projects right now, it likely had to get its right-of-way or its lease before he entered office. (The June 16 language feels like a bit of a red herring. Nothing that fits the other definitions has received these documents since the start of Trump 2.0.)

Then there’s another factor: The only projects that would benefit from this language are ones that haven't started construction yet. Even if a project doesn’t have all of its permits for federal land use, its developer can build stuff like roads on any connected private lands and technically meet the deadline to start construction laid out in the new legislation. The construction start date is what counts — it doesn’t matter whether a project is placed in service and provides power to the grid years later, as long as it began construction before that deadline.

Taken together, all this means that a project that would benefit from this language probably has to be sited on federal lands and hold permits already … but for some reason can’t start construction to qualify for the program.

When I first started hunting for an answer, many people — including renewables advocates, anti-wind activists, and even some Senate staff in conversations with me — speculated that the language was a giveaway to two wind projects under construction in Wyoming, Chokecherry and Sierra Madre, which together make up what would likely be the largest wind farm in the U.S. if completed. These two projects are largely sited on federal lands and received all their approvals before Trump entered office.

I understand why people are pointing at Chokecherry and Sierra Madre. They are not expected to be online before 2029, and the House version of the bill would have locked them out of the production tax credit because it added a requirement that projects be “placed in service” — i.e. actively providing power to the grid — by around that same period. Any slippage in construction might have really hurt their finances. They’re also backed by a powerful billionaire, GOP donor and live entertainment power-broker Phil Anschutz, a man who made his initial fortune partially from fossil fuels.

Except … my colleagues and I are still not convinced. That’s because it is not clear that these two projects are at any actual risk of losing the production tax credit. They have been actively under construction for a long time, and the Senate bill killed the House’s “placed in service” requirement.

Another project floated is the Lava Ridge wind farm in Idaho, which was fully permitted under Biden, is largely sited on federal lands, and would produce more power than necessary to qualify for the exception. Hypothetically, this project would be a great candidate for being a beneficiary of the bill because Trump banned work on the project via executive order amid opposition from Idaho politicians, making a carveout to get more time a worthwhile endeavor.

Except … Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo, the lead author of the pertinent section of the Senate reconciliation bill, was one of those Idaho politicians who pushed Trump to kill Lava Ridge. Why would he give a tax break to a project he wanted dead?

Then there was my personal best guess for the beneficiary: Esmeralda 7, an expansive set of proposed solar farms in the Nevada desert that, as proposed, would produce more than 5 gigawatts of power and is largely sited on federal land. Construction can’t begin until Esmeralda 7 gets its federal approvals, and the Trump administration was expected to complete that work by mid-summer.

Except … I reported last week that the permitting process for Esmeralda 7 is now indefinitely stalled. The project is at best still months away from getting its right-of-way approvals from the Trump administration, which recently pushed back timelines for finishing reviews of other large Nevada solar projects, too.

Ultimately, it will be difficult to glean who the lobbyist giveaway here is for unless the legislators who wrote it disclose their intentions. I reached out to the communications director for Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee to try and find out, but so far I’ve gotten crickets.

It may be that this language is revised and that future changes lay out the true beneficiary. Sometimes lawmakers will put the wrong date or word into a bill and they’ll edit it on the floor before a vote, chalking it up to a drafting error.

If senators decide to add back the “placed in service” requirement to capitulate to the House, this would easily be the Chokecherry-Sierra Madre giveaway. If Republicans were to shift forward the deadline for getting a right-of-way, Esmeralda 7 would qualify. Or maybe they could change some secret third thing and a different project I hadn’t considered will be revealed as the mastermind in the shadows.

Until then, I’ll be in my basement poring over more maps and going slowly insane.

Based on this progress and understanding, I have asked the Senate and House to remove the Section 899 protective measures from consideration. … This understanding with our G7 partners provides greater certainty and stability for the global economy and will enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond.

Under the deal, G7 allies will exclude U.S. companies from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Pillar 2 taxes imposed by other countries in consideration for removing the Section 899 so-called ""revenge tax"" from the OBBB.

Proposed Section 899 – as passed by the House and contained in H.R. 1, the OBBB, and a refined version, contained in the Senate Finance Committee's bill of the OBBB – would have imposed severe U.S. tax retaliatory measures against any foreign government and its residents and entities, called ""applicable persons,"" imposing ""unfair taxes.""

The retaliatory measures would have included an Internal Revenue Code statutory tax rate increase and an enhanced Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) on applicable persons of foreign countries imposing ""unfair taxes.""

Great concern had been expressed by Wall Street and affected stakeholders about the enactment of Section 899 and its impact on foreign investment in the United States, particularly in view of its complexity, potential scope of application and compliance obligations. Those concerns have been alleviated for now, and time will tell regarding the next steps to be taken with the G7 and the OECD-G20 Inclusive Framework.

Introduced in 2022, the CAMT requires that companies making more than $1 billion pay 15% of the profits they report to shareholders.
According to OpenSecrets, Lankford received more than $546,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry—his top source of industry donations—between 2019 and 2024.
Americans will pay the oil and gas industry ""an additional $339 billion for gasoline and $75 billion for electricity by 2035,"" the May report says.
""Congress should not raise energy prices for working families to deliver handouts to Big Oil,"" the senators said.","Four Democratic U.S. senators are demanding an explanation from Big Oil after a $1.1 billion tax loophole was added to the Senate version of the GOP's budget reconciliation megabill.

Letters sent Thursday by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called out the CEOs of two oil giants, ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv, which they say ""lobbied furiously"" for the handout.

The companies, the senators said, ""[stand] to benefit tremendously from this provision and ha[ve] spent big to support it—while preserving the many government subsidies for the oil and gas industry already in the tax code.""

They asked for the companies to disclose how much they have spent lobbying Republicans for the tax break and how much of a windfall they expect in return.

The provision in question, approved by the Senate Finance Committee last week, would shield many large oil companies from the Inflation Reduction Act's corporate alternative minimum tax, or CAMT. Introduced in 2022, the CAMT requires that companies making more than $1 billion pay 15% of the profits they report to shareholders.

""The rationale for CAMT was simple,"" the senators said. ""For far too long, massive corporations had taken advantage of loopholes in the tax code to avoid paying their fair share, sometimes paying zero federal taxes despite earning billions in profits.""

The GOP bill modifies how oil companies are required to report earnings, allowing them to exempt ""intangible drilling and development costs,"" which in turn allows more companies to fall below the $1 billion earnings threshold.

The senators highlighted a 2023 earnings call by Marathon Oil, recently acquired by ConocoPhillips, in which executives said the CAMT was the only income tax they were required to pay.

""If enacted,"" the senators said, ""this provision would reduce or even eliminate tax liabilities for oil and gas companies under CAMT, allowing some to pay no federal income taxes whatsoever.""

The letter highlighted lobbying filings by ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv in which they ""explicitly prioritize"" securing this handout.

Referenced throughout is the aggressive effort to court Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who wrote the loophole into the Senate bill. According to OpenSecrets, Lankford received more than $546,000 in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry—his top source of industry donations—between 2019 and 2024.

The senators described the industry's lobbying as ""especially insulting"" because ""Senate Republicans are trying to pay for this handout with cuts to other programs that would end up raising energy prices for everyday Americans.""

The GOP bill would eliminate tax breaks for clean energy that incentivize consumers to purchase electric vehicles and make their homes more energy-efficient, including the home energy-efficiency and residential clean energy credits.

Citing data from Rewiring America, the senators estimated that ditching the two credits would cost the average household up to $2,200 per year in savings on utility bills.

The Center for American Progress projects that eliminating electric vehicle credits would increase demand for gasoline, raising prices by 27 to 35 cents per gallon by 2035. Americans will pay the oil and gas industry ""an additional $339 billion for gasoline and $75 billion for electricity by 2035,"" the May report says.

While many dealers have leaned into the EV revolution, many more have resisted installing chargers, dissuaded customers from going electric and haven't rushed into the education needed to sell these cars properly.

Even so, losing the EV tax credits could hurt their bottom lines, too. So now, more than a dozen car dealers are now pushing back, urging lawmakers in Washington D.C. to consider how the Senate’s proposed spending bill could hurt EV affordability and stall progress.

Welcome to the Friday edition of Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping up the world of clean transportation and technology. Also on our radar today: A high-ranking Tesla executive has left the company amidst falling sales and brand turmoil. Plus, Rivian has laid off more than 100 employees from its manufacturing teams ahead of the R2 launch.

30%: Carmax, Carvana Urge Senate To Preserve EV Tax Credits

The Trump administration is attempting to kneecap this EV transition by taking away the very tools that were facilitating this adoption and making EVs more affordable for a growing number of car buyers who actually really want them. The federal consumer credits (for new and used EVs) are under the axe in the Senate’s proposed spending bill and so are the manufacturing credits for EVs and batteries.

As Automotive News reported this week, as many as 18 major car dealer networks in the U.S., including Carmax and Carvana, have written an open letter to the Senate to preserve the Biden-era EV framework and the tax credits.

And if you’re a car dealer who already has invested in chargers, staff training and revamped marketing to sell electric vehicles alongside gas cars, those years of planning and investment are now at risk.

The letter has also been signed by eight other EV stakeholders such as battery health and data start-up Recurrent and the Electric Vehicle Association, among others. They want the Senate to preserve the following provisions:

25E: Credit for Previously-Owned Clean Vehicles.

30C: Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit.

30D: Clean Vehicle Credit.

45W: Credit for Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles.

45X: Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit.

Here’s an excerpt from the letter:

For years, dealerships like ours have invested billions of dollars as small businesses to serve our communities, to improve EV education, and offer exceptional service.

We need a stable and consistent market for our dealerships to plan, invest, and grow. Recent attempts to abruptly roll back key EV-related Inflation Reduction Act tax credits pose a serious threat to our business continuity and the industry’s long-term investments based on previous market signals and American leadership. Collectively, changes on such a rapid timeline would introduce significant uncertainty and deter investment.

We urge the Senate to consider moderation on the pace of overhauling the critical tax credits that our customers are counting on for new and used electric vehicles and to deploy electric vehicle chargers.

The dealers supported one small aspect of the latest version of the Senate bill, which did not include the annual $250 registration fee for EVs and $100 for hybrids. They said that was the correct thing to do as the flat fee would have been “punitive” and “unfair.”

Here’s more from the letter:

A gradual sunset of the EV-related rebates, rather than an abrupt repeal, is essential to serve the interests of American consumers as well as car dealerships and the broader auto industry. A slow phase-out would ensure market stability. Sudden elimination will disrupt the used car market, a backbone of the American economy.

A multi-year transitional period would also provide the opportunity for Americans to continue adopting cleaner vehicles more affordably. Finally, many independent and family-owned dealerships are depending on the current incentive structure to remain competitive. An immediate repeal could disproportionately affect these businesses, reducing jobs and opportunities in communities nationwide.

The language here really underscores just how critical tax credits have been in offsetting the capital-intensive shift to EVs. But more importantly, it reveals that dealers are beginning to recognize what’s actually happening on the ground: The credits—especially for used EVs—are helping working- and middle-income American households get behind the wheel of an EV and reap the myriad benefits of that.

That fact cuts directly against the Republican narrative that EVs are shiny objects for wealthy people. Here’s proof that the reality is far more grounded than the rhetoric.

60%: Musk’s ‘Fixer’ Leaves Tesla

Omead Afshar, Tesla’s vice president of manufacturing and operations and reportedly Elon Musk’s “fixer” is no longer with the company. Due to conflicting news reports, it’s unclear if he quit or was fired by Musk.

But regardless, he was one of Tesla’s most senior—and one of the few remaining—high-profile executives. Afshar played a key role in getting Gigafactory Texas off the ground, and as The Wall Street Journal reported, served as Musk’s behind-the-scenes problem solver while the CEO was busy firing American government employees or dealing with his several other companies.

Afshar even slept on the factory floor and did “firefighting” when problems arose. He seems to have done plenty of heavy-lifting for Tesla, including approving every single invoice over $25,000 and even taking frequent trips to Shanghai when Tesla’s gigafactory in China was being readied.

The talent exodus at Tesla is worrying and seems to be getting only worse. High-profile departures are nothing new in the tech world, but what’s happening at Tesla feels more serious than routine attrition. Its sales are plunging across the world, profits are down and brand image is, well… not good. It has finally launched the long-overdue Robotaxi service, but the rollout certainly hasn't been flawless.

90%: Rivian Slashes Manufacturing Jobs

Photo by: Rivian

Rivian has laid off about 140 employees, TechCrunch reported Thursday. The layoffs affected the automaker’s manufacturing teams the most and were initiated to eliminate “process inefficiencies.”

“We have made the difficult decision to reduce a small number of our salaried manufacturing employees as part of an ongoing effort to improve operational efficiency for R2,” Rivian told the outlet in an email.

The R2 is the automaker's upcoming mid-size SUV to rival the Tesla Model Y and make Rivian accessible to a broader audience.

Its R1T electric truck and R1S SUV are considered luxury EVs that are expensive and out of reach for the masses, even though they do have a growing and loyal customer base of their own.

At an expected starting price of $45,000 before factoring in any tax credits, the R2 aims to change that and make Rivian a higher-volume automaker.

LENEXA, KAN. (JUNE 27, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 leadership visited Springfield, Missouri, to congratulate 15 graduates of the Green for Greene job training program.

Green for Greene is an environmental workforce development and job training program that has trained over 300 students since 2016, including the 15 today. This program is made possible through EPA’s Brownfields Job Training program and serves as an example of how EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback to provide clean air, land, and water to all Americans while fostering economic growth through job training across the country.

""Brownfields job training programs enhance EPA's mission by equipping individuals to restore clean land throughout our region,"" said EPA Region 7 Brownfields Redevelopment and Reuse Branch Supervisor Stan Walker. ""By training hundreds of students in environmental remediation, the program not only opens doors to well-paying jobs, but also ensures that these graduates contribute directly to revitalizing the communities they call home.""

“The Green for Greene environmental job training program has enhanced the lives of hundreds of graduates in southern Missouri since its inception in 2016,” said Green for Greene Program Supervisor Carmen May. “More than 300 individuals have taken advantage of this no-cost training, which offers numerous credentials and leads to higher-paying job opportunities. In short, this program changes the trajectory of people’s lives.”

Graduates of Brownfields Job Training (JT) programs learn valuable, sought-after skills and have the opportunity to earn a variety of certifications, ensuring that employment opportunities result not just in temporary contractual work, but in long-term environmental careers.

For more information on the selected Brownfields Job Training Grant recipients, including past grant recipients, please visit the Brownfields Grant Fact Sheet Search page.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields JT Grants allow nonprofits, local governments, and other organizations to recruit, train, and place unemployed and underemployed residents of areas affected by the presence of brownfield sites. Through the JT program, graduates develop the skills needed to secure full-time, sustainable employment in various aspects of hazardous and solid waste management and within the larger environmental field, including sustainable cleanup and reuse, and chemical safety. These green jobs reduce environmental contamination and build more sustainable futures for communities.

EPA previously announced that the City of Springfield was selected to receive a $500,000 Brownfields Job Training Grant. This grant funding was used to expand the Green for Greene program, which offers free instruction and certifications to students that enable them to find jobs in environmental fields, such as hazardous waste; lead and mold abatement; lead renovation, repair, and painting; and asbestos abatement.

Green for Greene is tuition-free for accepted students, and the program targets Springfield residents who are unemployed or underemployed, veterans, and individuals with justice system involvement. The program also serves Christian, Taney, Stone, Webster, Dallas, and Polk counties.

The European wind industry’s competitiveness is built on a strong innovation legacy.","The European Investment Bank has raised its 2025 financing ceiling to a record €100bn to strengthen Europe’s energy security, industrial competitiveness and technology leadership. This includes new counter-guarantee facilities: €1.5bn for grid component manufacturers, €500m for corporate PPAs and €250m to support mid-sized green tech manufacturers. The EIB also increased its existing counter-guarantee facility for wind manufacturers from €5bn to €6.5bn.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) is continuing to ramp up its support for Europe’s energy security and industrial competitiveness. Its increased 2025 financing ceiling of €100bn will help deliver on key measures under the EU Clean Industrial Deal.

Counter-guarantee scheme for wind manufacturers increased

That’s good news for wind manufacturers. Under the Wind Power Action Plan the European Commission instructed the EIB to provide de-risking tools and €5bn in counter-guarantees for wind energy manufacturing. The EIB has made good progress since – €3bn have been disbursed already. The EIB is now increasing the successful counter-guarantee scheme from €5bn to €6.5bn.

This will help strengthen Europe’s wind supply chain and support the scale-up of domestic manufacturing. But with a large volume of offshore wind projects in the pipeline – which require significantly higher counter-guarantee values than onshore projects – it’s vital to already consider the next increase. A total envelope closer to €10bn would ensure continued support for manufacturers and help Europe meet its clean energy targets.

New counter guarantees for grids, PPAs and SMEs

Next to that, a new €1.5bn package of counter-guarantees for grid component manufacturers will help manufacturers ramp up the production of grid equipment. Eligible technologies include transmission and distribution equipment, batteries, hydrogen and EV charging infrastructure. These technologies are essential to the integration of competitive renewable electricity into the energy system. They will help deliver affordable and home-grown electricity to European homes and businesses.

To give more companies the opportunity to procure renewable energy, the EIB and the European Commission will launch a €500m pilot programme to support corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The programme is a key deliverable under the EU Clean Industrial Deal, as we explained in this video.

Aimed at mid-sized and large energy-intensive companies, the PPA pilot programme will utilise counter-guarantees to de-risk long-term clean energy contracts while also supporting the development of new renewable energy projects.

A further €250m CleantechEU guarantee scheme will provide liquidity and working capital to innovative small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) that are developing green technologies.

“All these measures will help to de-risk investments, facilitate access to finance and accelerate the deployment of clean energy. That’s excellent. But to unlock their full potential, the scope of the counter-guarantee schemes must be expanded – and more support is needed for wind research and innovation” said Phil Cole, Director of Industrial Affairs at WindEurope.

Further adjustments needed

The EIB has shown it can move fast and deliver impact. Now it’s time to go further – and make sure Europe’s wind industry has the tools it needs to thrive.

To fully unlock the benefits of the wind manufacturing counter-guarantee facility, its scope should be expanded to include warranty bonds. This would streamline the process, reduce costs for the manufacturers and ensure a more efficient use of the scheme.

The current counter-guarantee scheme excludes warranty bonds. This means manufacturers still need to obtain separate guarantees from commercial banks to cover warranty periods which adds complexity and cost – and undermines the scheme’s full effectiveness. Because commercial banks can’t access the scheme to provide warranty cover, they remain constrained by prudential limits. Ironically, this reintroduces the very bottleneck the scheme was designed to remove.

Looking ahead, the EU and the EIB must also step up support for wind energy research and innovation. The European wind industry’s competitiveness is built on a strong innovation legacy. But current EU R&I funding averages around €500m a year – far below that provided by countries outside the EU and what’s needed to stay competitive globally.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/wind-turbine-foundation-factory.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 12:23:55.185588

This retrospective report examines the first two years of JETP’s implementation, tracing how shifting political leadership, fragmented governance, and misaligned frameworks influenced the progress even as the partnership committed to mobilize US$20 billion for coal retirement, renewables, and transition activities.

Drawing on stakeholder consultations, policy analysis, and deep dives into Indonesia’s power-planning architecture, the report unpacks four core challenges: (1) institutional gaps that constrain coordination between the JETP Secretariat, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), state-owned utility (PLN), and other agencies; (2) data and planning shortfalls that overstate demand and misallocate capacity; (3) financing structures that lean heavily on commercial loans rather than concessional finance; and (4) policy distortions — from coal price caps to rigid take-or-pay contracts — that continue to tilt the playing field toward fossil fuels.

Trump’s EPA says carbon emissions from U.S. power plants are too insignificant to regulate.

U.S. power plants emit 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year, a little less than the entire country of Russia. The Trump Administration is proposing to end all regulation of carbon emissions by power plants, on the theory that these emissions should be considered insignificant. There are two parts to EPA’s argument: first, that the statute requires EPA to make a finding that those specific emissions cause significant harm, and second that the emissions are actually insignificant. In a series of blog posts, I’ve argued that both of EPA’s contentions are seriously flawed.

Does the statute really require EPA to make a significance finding before it regulates? The subsection of the Clean Air Act that directly applies to those regulations does not mention such a requirement. EPA has not historically made such findings when it issues a new pollution control regulation for an industry on the list. My previous posts argue that EPA’s effort to reconcile its interpretation of the statute with past practice is contrived and unpersuasive. (Here and here.)

Second, even if a finding is required, is EPA’s conclusion defensible that the U.S. power sector is an insignificant contributor to climate change? My last post argued that the answer is no. To get to its conclusion, EPA had to interpret the word “significant” in a wildly all-inclusive way. The considerations it cites, like Trump’s emphasis on the importance of fossil fuels, go far beyond assessing the harm from the emissions. And much of EPA’s more specific analysis is highly questionable. EPA emphasizes that the U.S. power sector’s emissions are only 3% of global emissions. But EPA ignores the fact that causing 3% of climate harm is still significant harm – a small percentage of a huge number is still a big number.

The speciousness of EPA’s analysis of significance is highlighted by its need to completely ignore what it did in Trump’s first term. Back then, it had no difficulty in finding that U.S. power plant emissions were significant, because they are a large share of total U.S. carbon emissions. In other words, the first Trump Administration hadn’t completely lost touch with common sense, something the current Administration prefers to ignore.

To put it bluntly: EPA’s arguments against regulating power plant emissions are basically a house of cards. They may look impressive at first glance, but they’re at risk of collapsing in the first stiff breeze.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Donald_Trump_rally_in_Huntington_a_.png,N,,2025-06-27 12:24:29.531636

In Europe and South America, Statkraft has a “large pipeline” of projects and plans to continue to grow in solar, wind, batteries and grid services, but at a lower growth rate than previously expected.
In offshore wind, Statkraft will stop further activities in new projects, including the upcoming allocation round of Utsira Nord in Norway.
Statkraft has also decided to assess its investment position in solar, wind and batteries in Poland and will close down development activities in Portugal.
“At this time, Statkraft will prioritize our financial capacity on near term profitable technologies, such as solar, wind and batteries in fewer markets.","Statkraft, Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy, announced it will shift focus away from hydrogen and offshore wind production to focus on its flexible hydropower fleet in the Nordics, and solar, wind and battery activities in Europe and South America, in an effort to “strengthen its core competitive advantages.”

Last year, after Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal took over as CEO, Statkraft adjusted the company’s strategy by focusing on fewer technologies and markets. While the company maintains that underlying drivers remain strong, the energy transition is “moving at a slower pace” due to increased global uncertainty, higher costs and lower power prices. The new strategy focuses on core activities, placing near term cash flow over volume growth.

“By concentrating on our core competitive advantages and prioritizing investments in near term profitable opportunities, we will be able to continue our growth and value creation, while contributing significantly to the energy security and energy transition,” said Statkraft President and CEO Birgitte Ringstad Vartdal.

The company has plans to invest NOK 16–20 billion (USD $1.58–$1.98 billion) annually in the coming years, including large hydropower capacity upgrades in Norway, and maintenance of the operational asset fleet and onshore wind power developments in Sweden and Norway. In Europe and South America, Statkraft has a “large pipeline” of projects and plans to continue to grow in solar, wind, batteries and grid services, but at a lower growth rate than previously expected.

As announced in May, Statkraft will stop new development of hydrogen projects. In offshore wind, Statkraft will stop further activities in new projects, including the upcoming allocation round of Utsira Nord in Norway. Development of the North Irish Sea Array (NISA) project will continue, however. Statkraft has also decided to assess its investment position in solar, wind and batteries in Poland and will close down development activities in Portugal. The market activities will continue in both countries, the country added.

“At this time, Statkraft will prioritize our financial capacity on near term profitable technologies, such as solar, wind and batteries in fewer markets. We have been successful in developing an attractive portfolio in several European markets. As we need to prioritize, parts of the portfolio will benefit from getting new owners. Offshore wind will play an important role in the power mix in Europe, but the pace of development of the industry has been slower than previously forecasted, and this has impacted the ability to drive down costs in the short term,” Vartdal said.

By focusing on fewer technologies and countries, Statkraft aims to decrease the complexity of the company and reduce payroll and other operating expenses with around NOK 2.9 billion (~ USD $287 million) annually by 2027. This is a 15% reduction compared to the estimate for 2025.

“Statkraft needs to adapt to the changing market and increased geopolitical uncertainty. Unfortunately, this also impacts our most important asset: Our people. We will do what we can to limit uncertainty and mitigate negative effects on employees,” said Vartdal.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-26-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 12:26:26.447249

Four days later, the Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute sued Vermont for abusing its power and putting an unreasonable burden on the industry.

On May 1, the Trump Department of Justice sued both Vermont and New York to block enforcement of climate superfund laws, which seek to hold major fossil fuel companies accountable for their share of the emissions that have contributed to the increasing scale of costly climate disasters between 1995 and 2024.

The lawsuits came a day after the Trump administration sued Hawaii and Michigan to block more conventional liability suits the states were yet to file against the fossil fuel industry for costs associated with specific climate-related damages.

Now, Vermont is facing twin climate challenges, both with big economic considerations.

State Treasurer Michael Pieciak and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources are working to find the cost of environmental damage that can be linked to individual companies’ fossil fuel products from 1995 until 2024, a calculation that will rely heavily on climate attribution science.

In the courts, meanwhile, the state is left to decide how best to defend the novel Climate Superfund Act, which is based on the established environmental doctrine of “polluter pays” for hazardous waste remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act—the existing Superfund law—and adapts that to climate change.

Through all this, the question remains: how will the small northern rural state afford much-needed adaptations to a warming climate in a world where natural disasters are increasing in scope and fury and don’t wait for court verdicts.

The Justice Department’s involvement, in particular, increases the likelihood that court battles will be long and expensive, experts said. Despite this, those who stand behind the bill show no signs of giving up.

“Did I expect it? No. Am I surprised? Also, no,” state Sen. Anne Watson, a sponsor of the Vermont Climate Superfund Law, said about the challenge from the federal government. Her confidence in the defensibility of the superfund act hasn’t wavered.

The quick response by the oil lobby and federal government, she said, was, “really heartening, weirdly, because it tells me that we have hit upon a strategy that is effective, that is getting the attention of the fossil fuel industry, that they know this is a legitimate mechanism to hold them accountable.”

Ben Edgerly Walsh, the Climate and Energy Program director at the Vermont Public Interest Group, said the Justice Department’s involvement was unusual, but not a shock. VPIRG was a key advocate in passing the bill, and Edgerly Walsh views the lawsuit as a direct response from President Trump to big oil CEOs who met with him, seeking protection from state actions, in March.

“Frankly, the president is using the Department of Justice as a political shield for his allies in the oil industry,” Edgerly Walsh said. “It’s incredibly disappointing to see the U.S. system of justice used that way. It’s unprecedented.”

Trump in April signed an executive order for Attorney General Pam Bondi to “take action to stop the enforcement of state laws that unreasonably burden domestic energy development.”

In a press release on May 1, Bondi wrote: “These burdensome and ideologically motivated laws and lawsuits threaten American energy independence and our country’s economic and national security. The Justice Department was working to ‘Unleash American Energy’ by stopping these illegitimate impediments to the production of affordable, reliable energy that Americans deserve.” The Justice Department declined to respond further about the ongoing court action.

The Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute’s legal filings from December in opposition to the climate superfund laws passed by Vermont stated that the federal government, not states, has the power to regulate emissions. Attorneys general from 24 conservative states–including West Virginia, Alabama and Alaska—joined the Chamber of Commerce’s earlier challenge to Vermont’s climate superfund law on the same day the Trump Administration filed its own suit in May.

The Justice Department told the court that Vermont had infringed on presidential authority, and that its legislation is a danger to the nation’s security. This came with a nearly identical lawsuit against New York.

Watson, a Democrat representing Montpelier, said her motivation is to hold the industry accountable for its harms and ease the load that a warming climate is causing Vermonters. “We’re moving forward with it,” she said. ”People are having to shoulder a huge financial burden that they shouldn’t otherwise have to bear because of the products from the fossil fuel industry.”

The climate superfund is a strategy for the state to bring in money it needs to help cover the costs of climate disasters. Residents already pay high taxes, and Vermont hasn’t been able to find the funds to adapt to climate change within its borders.

“Governor Scott is right, you just can’t tax Vermonters any more.” said Patrick Parenteau, professor emeritus at the Vermont Law and Graduate School and former counsel to the EPA’s regional office in New England. Lawmakers have been working to keep education spending under control, he said, and the fiscally conservative governor is unlikely to add climate costs to the burden on taxpayers.

The same goes for the legal costs of defending the new superfund law in court—Parenteau warned the legislature hasn’t realized just how much this cost will grow in the coming years. “They saw it coming. They heard about it. I don’t think they fully appreciated just how complicated and expensive it’s going to get,” he said.

Even if Vermont successfully fights off the lawsuits, he predicts it could take up to a decade for money to actually come back in from the superfund to help people pay for climate adaptation.

Meanwhile, the climate crisis has already arrived. A year ago, Hurricane Beryl tore through the middle of the state, flooding homes and farmland, and two years ago a once-in-a-lifetime flood did around a billion dollars of damage to the state, Watson said. Lawmakers saw this wreckage firsthand, as the river in the state’s capital overflowed in 2023, spilling into government buildings while local businesses resorted to piling their soaked belongings in the streets.

Anthony Iarrapino, a lawyer for the Conservation Law Foundation, is one of the Vermonters who has seen this extreme weather and lobbied for the climate superfund last year. While he isn’t directly involved in the lawsuits, he and Edgerly Walsh were in communication with the Agency of Natural Resources during this year’s legislative session about implementing the law.

“I’m happy to say that our legislature was not bullied by the Trump administration’s lawsuit out of moving forward,” Iarrapino said.

Iarrapino said the Trump administration’s support and protection of the fossil fuel industry do not reflect the real costs greenhouse gas emissions have had on the state through extreme weather events heightened by a warming planet.

“It’s just hard to accept their complaints with a straight face,” he said. “They just don’t have credibility here in Vermont, where we’re still hurting, we’re still suffering, we’re still paying the bills, we’re still nervously watching the weather forecast every time extreme rain is predicted or the air is too filled with forest fire smoke to go out.”

Iarrapino also said Vermont’s legislators and attorney general don’t believe there is a national energy emergency, as Trump declared on his first day in office, as domestic energy production has exceeded consumption in recent years.

Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark is trying to prove the claim of an emergency is false. On May 9, Vermont joined with 14 states, including Michigan, in a lawsuit against the president’s Energy Emergency declaration.

“There is no energy emergency in this country. American energy production is at an all-time high, and this is an attempt by the Trump Administration to illegally circumvent environmental protections that keep us healthy and protect our rivers, wildlife, and other natural resources,” Clark said in a statement.

While Clark is gearing up for legal battles, the treasurer is slowing down—not out of fear, Parenteau said, but from dedication to the task of figuring out how much the big oil companies actually owe the state.

In the last legislative session, Pieciak received more money and time to work with experts on putting the superfund law into action. The new deadline for estimating the cost of fossil fuels on Vermont’s climate is 2027.

“He’s smart about this,” said Parenteau. “He’s listening to people like me say, you better have a bomb-proof case because it’s going to be challenged to the max.”

Meanwhile, Vermont House Republicans introduced legislation in May to stop the program to enact the superfund altogether. This also didn’t come as a surprise—the superfund passed in 2024 without the support of most Republicans, and Gov. Scott, a Republican, refused to sign it out of concern for the cost and risk of taking on big oil companies alone. Still, he’s a named defendant in the Trump Administration’s lawsuit. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

This partisan divide has come up in other disputes this year over whether Vermont’s climate goals are too ambitious. In response to the effort to repeal the superfund program, Watson said, “The House Republicans are trying to do a lot of things around walking back any sort of climate legislation, and especially as chair of natural resources, I have no intention of entertaining that.”

Watson’s commitment to the superfund approach has taken root in other states that are considering following Vermont’s example. “I think if other states or countries want to see a dime from the fossil fuel industry, they should initiate similar laws of their own to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable,” she said.

Four states now have their own bills pending, and six more have introduced bills that didn’t pass committee this year but could come back in 2026. Nor is the United States the only country where a desire for this type of legislation is gaining support. A new survey from Greenpeace and Oxfam shows that a majority of people from across the world would support their governments fining polluters for climate damages.

In the U.S., it is the red states that are arguing state superfund laws would create a “‘confused patchwork of standards.’” In the Chamber of Commerce’s lawsuit, these states support the argument that climate superfunds are preempted by the federal Clean Air Act, as well as multiple clauses of the Constitution—arguments that are at the heart of the Trump Administration’s lawsuit, as well.

Environmental advocates behind the superfund legislation anticipated this attack and made sure their approach did not seek to regulate current and future emissions, as the Clean Air Act does. Instead, the superfund imposes retroactive fines on past greenhouse gas pollution, using attribution science to calculate harms caused by individual companies’ emissions.

Watson has confidence going forward in the legality of the superfund. “I firmly believe that our bill is constitutional and that it is lawful,” she said. “… They wouldn’t be pushing back so hard if we didn’t have an excellent case.”

Both suits are on track to reach the Supreme Court, unless a new president comes to office and drops the Trump administration case before then. Even if the superfund survives this first round of challenges, there could be another set of tests in the future when the oil companies that have been watching from the sidelines so far become directly involved. Parenteau said those companies will likely file their own lawsuits against state superfund laws.

On the other side, Vermont’s lawyers could soon be joined by regional organizations supporting the superfund law, among them the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farmers Association, both of which are waiting to hear if the federal district court will approve them to jointly intervene in the chamber’s case on behalf of Vermont citizens and farmers.

No one has intervened on either side in the Trump Administration’s lawsuit, and it’s still unclear whether the cases will be consolidated. Recently, the judge appears to be slowing down to coordinate the schedules of both cases. On Wednesday, all parties filed an agreed-upon request for both cases to share the same schedule, which suggests it’s likely that the court will hear them together.

All three projects located in Texas are expected to reach commercial operation date within a year.

Inaki Herrero, Enertis Applus+ Managing Director North America, responded: “BESS projects are gaining increasing relevance as part of the overall energy infrastructure. Standalone BESS systems such as these, which are directly connected to the electrical grid, provide much-needed flexibility and reliability to the overall network.

We proudly contribute our extensive BESS engineering expertise to key renewable energy players such as Lydian Energy and Excelsior Energy Capital.”

The Enertis Applus+ team, including licensed professional engineers, accredited project managers, and OSHA 30 certified site personnel, performed technical due diligence (TDD) for project financing for each project. Via comprehensive analyses, the team verified that each project complied with the required technical regulations and quality standards, and identified any additional technical and economic risks. Each analysis evaluated site characteristics, design and main equipment, and grid connection, among other aspects.

Enertis Applus+ will perform milestone certification for mechanical completion, substantial completion, and final completion, as the projects progress. All three are at or near notice to proceed status. Team members also evaluated Excelsior Energy Capital’s coverage of equipment warranties and operational agreements, minimising risks and maximising performance.

Just west of Marshall, south of I-94, a massive factory is rising — BlueOval Battery Park Michigan. On a hot June morning, journalists from across the country gathered for a tour of the site before it becomes an ultra-clean, dust-controlled zone for battery production. This opportunity was possible because the building structure is nearly complete, but the delicate equipment had not yet arrived.

Reporters from the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Bloomberg, Crain’s Detroit, Axios, and local TV stations and newspapers attended.

Lisa Drake, Ford’s CFO for electric vehicles, highlighted the deeper strategy behind the Marshall battery plant. Instead of pouring hundreds of millions more into R&D, Ford chose to invest in large-scale American manufacturing – its core strength. The decision to license existing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology wasn’t a compromise, she explained, but a way to move fast while creating high-tech jobs in Michigan. The technology, she said, originated in U.S. research labs decades ago but was commercialized overseas. Now, Ford is bringing it back and building the systems and workforce to match.

Lisa Drake, Ford’s VP of EV industrialization, explained the broader strategy. “The equipment is on boats coming over from China and going into a large warehouse. It will be all Ford equipment,” she said. “It is better to pay tariffs on the equipment and make the cells here. We will have full control of the production.”

Drake described how the facility’s design integrates every piece of equipment from the ground up. “You don’t just build a building and roll in the machinery,” she said. “The machinery designs the building.” Ford is using three types of battery chemistries across its EV lineup—a global first—and has already mapped out equipment and prototypes for Marshall. She also acknowledged the Inflation Reduction Act as a turning point, not only aligning incentives but prompting Ford to re-shore supply chains and regain control over battery production. For Ford, the mission is clear: invest in American innovation, jobs, and long-term energy leadership.

Filming inside the facility was not allowed. From this point on, the story would unfold through observation—boots on the ground, notebooks and audio recorders in hand. The journalists were directed toward vans, one for local journalists and another for state and national media. The first stop was the far west end of the mile-long building where the final battery packs, containing the cells, are packed and ready to go to the automobile manufacturing plants. This area is known as the back end. Currently there is no rail built, but there is a plan for that in case the need arises. Each of the rooms is set up to eliminate contamination, and there is a long hall called “the spine” through the center of the building, spanning from east to west.

Automated guided vehicles will run up and down this main corridor. The building is zoned east to west, with raw materials entering on the east end and the finished LFP battery cells exiting on the west.

Rooms are already designated for the anode and cathode processes. These are essential components of EV batteries. The journalists next visited the future main entry point for employees, on the south side of the structure. From there, support team workers will go upstairs to work, while the other workers will go to a room with lockers where they will shower and put on their work clothes to help maintain the clean room nature of the facilities.

Next, the bus took the media to the eastern front end of the structure, where the raw materials would be coming in, and the anodes and cathodes pieces of each cell would be created. Some of the other media in attendance, including Wall Street Journal writer Christopher Otts, wrote about the ongoing “difficulties obtaining vital magnets made with rare-earth elements, despite a deal the U.S. struck with China to ease export controls, a company executive said Monday.” These rare earth minerals include dysprosium and terbium.

According to Drake in her blog post titled “American Battery Plant Helps Power the Future of Electric Vehicles,” the project represents: “a historic step: An American automotive company is manufacturing — without relying on a foreign joint venture — LFP battery cells and battery packs domestically with American workers for American-assembled next-generation electric vehicles.”

She explained that parts of the plant would transition in stages to “clean room” status, supporting the production of C-sample cells—the final prototype phase before mass production. Ford, she emphasized, would fully own and operate the facility.

When Drake described the BlueOval Battery Michigan project as “the first plant where we’ll build prismatic LFP batteries at scale,” she was highlighting a turning point in EV battery manufacturing in the U.S.

Prismatic LFP batteries are named for their flat, rectangular shape. Unlike cylindrical cells (which resemble AA batteries), prismatic cells can be stacked tightly, making them well-suited for space-efficient vehicle battery packs.

Key advantages of LFP batteries include stable chemistry and long cycle life. These batteries can handle many charge/discharge cycles with minimal degradation. Their shape allows for fewer electrical connections, reducing complexity and improving reliability. While LFP batteries generally have a lower energy density than some nickel-based chemistries, they are more affordable and safer, making them ideal for mass-market EVs. Ford’s investment in Marshall aims to localize production of this next-generation battery format, using technology licensed from China’s CATL, a global battery leader.

A key uncertainty shadowing the plant is a sweeping federal budget bill officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, if passed, would eliminate key clean-energy incentives before their current expiration date. Among them: the $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles and a $4,000 credit for used EVs—set to sunset Dec. 31, 2025, instead of under the existing law through 2032.

For Ford, these tax credits have been a crucial part of the economic justification of building this plant. The automaker has insisted it will continue regardless—but warns that removing subsidies could imperil the plant’s cost-competitiveness.

Additionally, the bill proposes new annual fees on EV owners—$250 for electric and $100 for hybrids—to fund road infrastructure, a move consumer advocates say contradicts the goal of promoting sustainable transportation.

This political backdrop adds tension to the day’s message of progress and local pride. As Ford executives push for American jobs, they’re navigating a legislative landscape that could reshape the industry’s financial foundation.

The Ford Blue Oval Plant is a model for future plants, and the best way to get feedback to fine-tune the operation is to get it running.

At a meeting spot outside near the end of the tour, Blue Oval CEO Scott Davis explained. “Ford has invested three billion dollars in the Marshall plant. The job pay and benefits will be competitive to the local market. It is not a union plant since there is no hired production team.”

The battery plant represents an important investment in the future of both Ford and Calhoun County. Whether it becomes a national model or another flashpoint in Marshall’s long civic history remains to be seen. But the project’s scale—and the conversations around it—are too large to ignore.",https://i0.wp.com/wilcoxnewspapers.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BlueOval_Battery_Park_Michigan_June_2025_08.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-27 12:23:44.947760

Glicksman",,,,,https://therevelator.org/nepa-lies-mistakes/,"Congress adopted a series of subject matter-specific exemptions and provisions to accelerate NEPA review in 1996, 2005, 2014, and 2018.

Ensuring environmentally sound and democratic decisions can of course be consistent with efficient permitting and NEPA review.","Suppose a friend calls you up and says he wants you to invest a million dollars in a new company that he heard is going to make tons of money. Before you decide whether to do so, wouldn’t you expect to know what the risks of losing your money might be? Wouldn’t you investigate the people who are going to run the new company and the kind of activities they intend to engage in, so you have a sense of whether it’s a safe thing to do with your money?

That’s the common-sense idea behind the National Environmental Policy Act, whose adoption by Congress kicked off the “environmental decade” of the 1970s.

NEPA requires government agencies to use a transparent process with meaningful public participation to consider the potential environmental effects of their actions before committing to them. It is one of the United States’ bedrock environmental protection statutes and has been so widely emulated in other countries that it has become known as the “Magna Carta” of global environmental law.

In the U.S., however, NEPA has recently been the subject of withering scrutiny and attack by critics across the political spectrum. Its opponents have called for the narrowing of NEPA’s scope and the “streamlining” of its processes, charging that the Act’s core mandate to “look before you leap” has spun out of control and created unintended and massive obstacles to approval of critical infrastructure.

These criticisms have prompted corrosive actions by all three branches of the federal government that have weakened NEPA and impaired its ability to serve its valuable, intended functions.

Congressional actions: Proposals to adopt “permitting reform,” often simply a euphemism for weakening NEPA, have been the subject of congressional debate and legislation for over a decade. Congress adopted a series of subject matter-specific exemptions and provisions to accelerate NEPA review in 1996, 2005, 2014, and 2018.

In the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, it also enacted extensive amendments that authorized the enhanced use of “categorical exclusions” from the NEPA process and required agencies to move through that process much more quickly when NEPA does apply.

Notwithstanding all of these laws, the reconciliation bill currently being crafted in Congress proposes further curtailments to environmental reviews. These provisions include the creation of unprecedented shortcuts for developers, including exemption from judicial review — as long as they agree to pay for and carry out the NEPA analysis process. Because the federal courts have been the primary forum for enforcing NEPA since its inception, this mechanism risks turning NEPA into a “paper tiger” that looks good on the page but has no real teeth.

Executive actions: In 2020 the first Trump administration adopted the first significant revisions to the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality that govern agency compliance with NEPA since their initial adoption in 1978. These revisions sharply scaled back opportunities for public input, completely contrary to Congress’ intent when it enacted NEPA in 1969. The Biden administration essentially restored the pre-2020 status quo while retaining some of the streamlining the critics desired.

But the second Trump administration seeks a more permanent, more radical, and more dangerous solution. CEQ is trying to repeal in their entirety the regulations that have governed NEPA for over 45 years. Such a repeal would leave individual agencies free to adopt their own, disparate versions of NEPA review, with attendant inconsistencies and uncertainties. In addition, there is little chance that CEQ will call out agencies that take advantage of this new-found discretion to avoid meaningful NEPA compliance.

The Trump administration has also introduced what it calls “alternative NEPA procedures” that ludicrously reduce project timelines, even for major projects, from what would normally require a couple of years to evaluate carefully to as little as two weeks. Such an abbreviated process amounts to not bothering to check out the financial risks before sinking a million dollars into your friend’s investment scheme.

The federal courts: Some of the most alarming erosions of NEPA’s authority are happening in the judiciary. In 2024 a panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that CEQ has no authority to issue regulations that bind other federal agencies — even though no party in the case even raised the issue. Although the full D.C. Circuit disavowed that holding, a federal district court in North Dakota subsequently reached the same conclusion.

On May 29 the Supreme Court issued a decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, sharply cutting the scope of environmental effects, especially indirect effects, that agencies must consider under NEPA. In doing so the Court chastised lower courts for their supposedly excessive interpretations of what NEPA requires of agencies (despite longstanding legal support for such interpretations). It even provided a green light for a court to allow projects to go forward even if that court determines NEPA has been violated. Subsequently, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a concurring opinion that blasted NEPA as well as judicial efforts to enforce it, making even Justice Kavanaugh’s critiques in Seven County look mild.

There are two common threads to this surge of NEPA-demonizing actions: the complete absence of evidence that NEPA is the principal culprit for delays in development; and ignorance of and impairment to the core democratizing function of NEPA.

First, the repeated justification for this latest outbreak of NEPA reforms is the argument that the Act has stymied beneficial development, in part because public interest litigants have abused it by bringing frivolous lawsuits whose sole purpose is delay. But astonishingly, critics in all three government branches have provided no empirical support whatsoever for their claims that NEPA is responsible for the delays they decry. In fact, there is more evidence for the countervailing view, that other factors — in particular poor project financing and lack of resources — have constituted the main barriers to project completion.

Second, those who call for “streamlining” regard increasing the efficiency of the NEPA process as the most important, if not the only, goal. But NEPA’s primary goal has never been efficient analysis. Rather, NEPA was established to make government decisions better, through accumulation and consideration of information concerning a project’s environmental risks, followed by tailoring of the project to mitigate those risks, and more democratic, by inviting affected stakeholders to weigh in from a project’s inception about how it might affect the environment and the manner in which they rely on it.

The efforts in each branch of the federal government to rush NEPA review consistently disregard the reasons that Congress adopted NEPA in the first place. Congress directed NEPA in large part at government agencies that were regularly ignoring disastrous potential environmental consequences and shutting out affected people from their decision-making process. These harmful and anti-democratic decisions were particularly committed by agencies with development-oriented missions that viewed environmental concerns as frustrating and unwanted obstacles to desired projects. By completely ignoring this history and the problems NEPA was established to address, its critics seem to be going out of their way to make it easy for agencies and private project sponsors to sweep environmental and health risks under the rug and make it hard for the public to discover that they have done so.

While NEPA’s critics routinely and incorrectly blame the statute for stalling development, they rarely acknowledge the incalculable public benefits that have flowed from NEPA. These include:

The discovery of adverse effects that would have remained hidden from public view until it was too late to avoid them.

The education of agencies and affected stakeholders that increased awareness of environmental risks and provided opportunities for timely project alterations to minimize them.

The democracy-enhancing opportunities for public participation.

And the environmental damage avoided by judicial injunctions halting ill-advised projects approved despite defective NEPA compliance.

That is why actual studies throughout the years have repeatedly found that NEPA has saved money, time, and improved big projects while protecting the environment.

The drive to improve NEPA, particularly for projects that may be environmentally beneficial in the long term like the buildout of clean energy infrastructure, certainly has merit. Indeed, for decades Congress and presidents periodically engaged in sensible efforts to improve NEPA. Nearly all these earlier initiatives, however, focused on promoting not only more efficient processing but also more effective environ­mental review. Unfortunately, virtually all recent efforts, including legislation passed during the Biden administration, have bought into a myopic focus on hastening review without even considering whether it will lead to worse decisions or erode democracy.

Ensuring environmentally sound and democratic decisions can of course be consistent with efficient permitting and NEPA review. For instance, any new streamlined track should include standards guaranteeing that a project eligible for streamlined review is environmentally beneficial and should ensure that binding mitigation requirements are incorporated into the review process. There may be other kinds of projects designed to promote important social goals, such as affordable housing, that are also deserving of expedited review. Deciding which projects to subject to a streamlined review process requires careful consideration of how best to balance competing social goals. We have not seen anything close to that kind of debate among policymakers for a long time.

No public policy mechanism can be expected to work flawlessly. NEPA is no exception. Experience in implementing the statute since 1970 surely provides valuable lessons that can provide the foundation for improvement in its review and disclosure processes. It is critically important, though, that neither policymakers nor the public lend their support to quick fixes lacking in evidence and strident denunciations that wind up trashing a law that has served the nation so well.

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavor,” said Chancellor Tedd Mitchell.
The Texas Tech University System has also not disclosed projected water or electricity usage.
Fermi America has also pledged to support a long-term excellence fund to advance research, promote academic priorities and expand student success initiatives throughout all five institutions in the Texas Tech University System.","Texas Tech University System and Fermi America are partnering to build a massive energy and AI campus near Amarillo.

The campus will utilize multiple energy sources, including nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas, to power 18 million square feet of AI data centers.

The project aims to address growing energy demands for AI infrastructure and bolster U.S. competitiveness in the technology sector.

While promising economic and educational benefits, the project's environmental impact, including water and electricity usage, remains undisclosed.

The Texas Tech University System is partnering with Fermi America to build what officials say will be the world’s largest advanced energy and artificial intelligence campus, a first-of-its-kind development just outside Amarillo.

The planned Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus will span approximately 5,800 acres near the Pantex Plant and include 18 million square feet of AI data centers, powered by up to 11 gigawatts of electricity from nuclear, solar, wind, and natural gas sources.

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavor,” said Chancellor Tedd Mitchell. “Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this campus will not only be the largest energy and data complex of its kind, but also a testament to the unshakable spirit of our system, the Texas Panhandle and this great state.”

Fermi America, co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, aims to meet the rapidly growing energy demands tied to AI infrastructure. Perry said the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

“The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today,” Perry said. “We’re behind, and it’s all hands on deck. No one does energy better than Texas, and Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System are answering the call.”

The announcement follows a May executive order from President Donald Trump directing the U.S. Department of Energy to designate AI data centers, and the nuclear reactors powering them, as critical defense infrastructure.

The project’s ambitions also align with the CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in 2022, which includes $280 billion in federal investment to strengthen U.S. leadership in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and clean energy. The law’s $200 million workforce development initiative and Regional Technology Hubs program could support Texas Tech’s academic mission and research goals, preparing students for careers in AI and energy. Texas has already secured over $8 billion from the CHIPS Act for projects involving companies such as Samsung and Texas Instruments.

Fermi officials said the Amarillo site was selected for its proximity to major natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber, strong solar potential and one of the country’s largest natural gas fields. Geotechnical work has already begun, and the company expects to bring its first gigawatt of capacity online by the end of 2026.

The facility will integrate multiple power sources on an unprecedented scale, including nuclear energy, a combined-cycle natural gas plant, solar generation, utility grid access and battery storage.

Though located near the Pantex Plant — a Department of Energy facility and Superfund site — officials have not said whether the new campus will include an on-site nuclear reactor. The Texas Tech University System has also not disclosed projected water or electricity usage. Large-scale AI campuses have drawn increasing scrutiny for their environmental footprint.

A recent report found that AI data centers could significantly increase air pollution in Texas. For comparison, APR Energy’s upcoming data project near Pampa is expected to consume 2 gigawatts of natural gas and 1.5 million gallons of water per day on an 800-acre site.

Texas Tech officials said the Amarillo campus will serve as more than a technology hub. It is also expected to deliver academic, research and workforce benefits for the region.

“This collaboration will not only position Texas Tech to address the evolving demands of the energy and technology sectors, but will also create meaningful educational opportunities for our students and research possibilities across many disciplines,” said Texas Tech University President Lawrence Schovanec.

In addition to internships and training programs, the project includes a dedicated academic and research facility with classrooms, offices and conference space for students and faculty across the university system.

Fermi America has also pledged to support a long-term excellence fund to advance research, promote academic priorities and expand student success initiatives throughout all five institutions in the Texas Tech University System.

So now Republicans are scrambling behind closed doors, trying to rewrite the bill just enough to keep their Medicaid cuts alive.

And why are they doing this? We know why they’re doing this: they want to cut taxes for billionaires!

But here’s a thought: instead of finding new ways to pass the same old cuts, why don’t Republicans keep the promises they’ve been making for weeks not to cut Medicaid?

The dissonance we’re hearing from Republicans is head-spinning.

Because on one hand we’ve been hearing the same talking points for weeks:

That somehow they’re not going to cut people’s Medicaid.

That they’re “not in favor of cutting benefits regarding Medicaid.”

That “no one’s losing their health care.”

That there “should not be any cuts.”

Those are real quotes I just read from our Senate Republican colleagues in the last month—from Senators Blackburn, Boozman, Cassidy, and Cornyn.

There’s plenty more where this came from.

But their words don’t match their actions.

The Republican bill does exactly the opposite of what they’re saying: it doesn’t save Medicare and health care, it eviscerates it!

Independent studies show the Republican bill would cut health care for 16 million Americans. It would decimate rural hospitals. It would harm nursing homes. It would kill nearly a million jobs. And it would raise health care costs for everyone — even those with private insurance.

That’s the bill Republicans are working on right now. That’s what it would do.

Apparently, Republicans are ok with the consequences.

Former Leader McConnell shrugged off people’s concerns, saying folks worried about Medicaid cuts will simply “get over it.”

Meanwhile, Senator Ernst, told people to stop fussing — because, quote, “we’re all going to die.”

What planet are they on? Is this how Republicans talk to people back home worried about seeing a doctor, taking care of their kids, and affording prescription drugs?

Now, a few Senate Republicans have shown flickers of lucidity, in closed-door meetings, and in hallway conversations. A few at least claim they recognize what the rest of us already know: their own bill will decimate their own constituents.

The Senior Senator from North Carolina was handing out flyers at a recent Republican lunch detailing how his own state—and nine others—would lose tens of billions in funding and see hundreds of thousands of people lose insurance.

The Senior Senator from Missouri acknowledged: “it’s just not the right thing to do to shut down a bunch of rural hospitals to pay for tax cuts.”

The Senator from Wisconsin warned “We are mortgaging [our children’s] future. It’s unconscionable. It’s immoral. It has to stop.”

Well, these are all nice words, but they mean nothing if the only thing Republicans do over the next few days is find new ways to pass the same old cuts.

New lipstick, same pig. That’s what’s going on right now with the Republican bill.

So Republicans have a choice to make.

They can keep chasing arbitrary deadlines.

They can keep making edits and changes in the hopes that some combination of Medicaid and SNAP and clean energy cuts will make it to the floor.

They can keep rewriting a bad bill into a slightly different bad bill.

Or they can ask the obvious question: should we pass this bill at all?

The answer is no. They should abandon Donald Trump’s so-called beautiful bill.

It makes no sense whatsoever for Republicans to pass a bill that even they admit will kick millions of hardworking Americans off health insurance.

It makes no sense for Republicans to pass a bill that will kill good paying energy jobs—most of them in Republican states—while surrendering American energy independence to China.

It is morally bankrupt to take food away from kids to give to the ultra-rich. It is morally bankrupt to saddle future generations with insurmountable debt. And it is morally bankrupt to ask working and Middle Americans to bankroll tax breaks for billionaires at a time they’re struggling to pay for groceries and rent.

So the Senate Republicans’ bill is not just flawed—it is irredeemable.

Shapiro Administration leverages federal investment of $9 million to move quickly and build out the Commonwealth's infrastructure.

Harrisburg, PA – The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) announced the opening of six new federally-funded Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, bringing total number of stations built using funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program(opens in a new tab) to 17. With the opening of the six new charging locations, Pennsylvania is second in the nation in stations built using the federal funds.

“he Shapiro AdministrationPennsylvania a national leader on NEVI,” said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. “The rollout of EV charging stations in the Commonwealth is moving along at speed, and we’re excited to make clean transportation more accessible for Pennsylvania travelers.”

The 17 stations opened under the NEVI program, representing a federal investment of more than $9 million, buil on the Shapiro Administration’s effort to ensure the reliability and accessibility of EV charging and get things done for Pennsylvania travelers. In total, PennDOT has obligated roughly $70 million of the $171.5 million allotted by the NEVI program, of which 90 projects totaling roughly $59 million are under contract and expected to move forward.

The new stations are at the following locations:

Tesla in New Castle, Lawrence County on Route 224 along Interstate 376 (Exit 13) at Sheetz;

Love’s Travel Stop in Brookville, Jefferson County along I-80 (Exit 81);

Tesla in Meadville, Crawford County along I-79 (Exit 147) at Giant Eagle.

NEVI funding supports the expansion of EV charging along the previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors (AFCs) (see a map of AFCs here(opens in a new tab)). Pennsylvania has over 1,800 miles of AFCs. Per guidance from U.S. DOT, NEVI formula funds must first be used to ""build out"" designated AFCs (meaning there must be no more than 50 miles between stations and less than 1 mile from an AFC exit) and meet U.S. DOT minimum standards and requirements.

The PA NEVI program includes multiple rounds of funding. During , of which these stations were awarded, the focus was on building out the AFC network along the interstates to meet the NEVI requirements.

The news comes as the governor continues to push for sustainable energy throughout the state as part of emissions legislation approved two years ago.

“As New York State electrifies its economy, deactivates aging fossil fuel power generation and continues to attract large manufacturers that create good-paying jobs, we must embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence and supply chain security to ensure New York controls its energy future,” Governor Hochul said.

“This is the second time during my administration that I am calling on the New York Power Authority to lead a critical energy initiative, and just as it is doing with the expedited buildout of renewable energy and transmission, it will now safely and rapidly deploy clean, reliable nuclear power for the benefit of all New Yorkers.”

Hochul said the power generated would support a ""reliable and affordable electric grid"" while providing the necessary zero-emission electricity to achieve a clean energy economy.

The move to implement a nuclear power plant comes as fossil fuel power plants are phased out, with state lawmakers continuing their push to move toward new, clean energy sources that will benefit new industrial development, while supporting building electrification and electric vehicles, state officials said.

NYPA, in coordination with the Department of Public Service (DPS), will seek to develop at least one new nuclear energy facility with a combined capacity of no less than one gigawatt of electricity, either alone or in partnership with private entities, to support the state's electric grid and the people and businesses that rely on it.

NYPA will immediately begin evaluation of technologies, business models, and locations for this first nuclear power plant and will secure the key partnerships needed for the project. This process will include site and technology feasibility assessments as well as consideration of financing options, in coordination with the forthcoming studies included in the master plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development in New York, led by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and DPS. Candidate locations will be assessed for suitability based on public safety, strength of community support, compatibility with existing infrastructure, as well as skilled labor and land availability.

While Hochul made the announcement in the morning, Assemblyman Scott Gray is planning to be in Alexandria Bay on July 8 to advocate for the facility to be placed in the North Country.

He will hold an ""Advanced Nuclear 101"" event from 5-7 p.m. at 31 Holland Street, with speakers from Nuclear NY, GAIN, NYS Pipe Trades Union, Clarkson University and IBEW.

Gray said the facility would look like ""a high-tech office building,"" a drastic change from the large steam stacks one would expect to see.

Gray said he's not going to let his fellow lawmakers in Albany forget about the North Country as they finalize plans to build the facility.

According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Oswego County is being eyed for the site at the existing Nine Mile Point nuclear complex.

State officials say conversations are ongoing between NYPA, the Governor's Office and other stakeholders, with no definitive plans in place just yet.

But the announcement of a new nuclear power plant was not welcomed by everyone, as Conservative Party leaders slammed Hochul's plans.

“No state knows how to burn cash more efficiently than the State of New York under one-party Democrat leadership,” Chairman Gerard Kassar said.

“New York families have suffered double-digit electricity rates, thanks to repeated liberal blunders over the years,” he said.

Kassar pointed to ConEd's proposed electric rate hike, 11.4% for electric and 13.3% for gas, as a major issue for residents throughout the state.

He said those figures would equate to each household spending $275 more per year on utilities.

“Although we have a favorable opinion of Mrs. Hochul’s move toward investing in this smart new technology, the reality is that nuclear power in New York, that was safe, clean and efficient, was irreparably damaged by policies the Governor supported at the highest levels of government. Now taxpayers will have to shoulder billions more in costs through their monthly electric bills. It has been a historic management blunder,"" Kassar said.

As US Congress negotiates the new federal budget, it is seeking to make drastic cuts to clean energy tax credits to fund extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

However, the cost savings of cutting solar tax credits far outweighs the benefits, found analysis from the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the Brattle Group, and the University of Louisiana.

SEIA estimated solar tax credits cost about $25 billion per year. But the benefits to US ratepayers far outweighs this cost, it found. NERA Economic consulting found that cutting energy tax credits would raise average utility bills by 7% for residential customers and 10% for small businesses. Analysis from the Brattle Group found that solar tax credits lower electricity costs for US ratepayers by a combined $51 billion per year, more than double the cost of the credits.

What’s more, analysis from SEIA and the University of Louisiana found that the solar industry generates $12 billion in federal tax revenues and $3.7 billion in state and local tax revenues each year.

All told, SEIA estimated that US ratepayers in total save $2.67 per $1 in solar tax credit spending.

In 2023 alone, solar added over $75.5 billion to America’s gross domestic product, said SEIA. This includes $3.4 billion added to the Texas economy, $1.3 billion in Utah, $1.2 billion in North Carolina and $1.1 billion in Georgia, all states that have Republican representatives in Congress that are actively considering gutting the tax credits that helped launch this economic boom.

SEIA estimates that nationwide, over 300 announced factories would close or never open, $286 billion in investment halt, and 330,000 American jobs would be lost if solar tax credits are repealed.

“Energy tax credits are a worthwhile investment in American competitiveness, American energy security, and American communities. Each dollar spent repays itself multiple times over,” said SEIA.

Virtual power plants were moving from theory to practice in California and Texas, where they are credited with eliminating many of the rolling brownouts and blackouts that plagued the states due to insufficient power.","Who’s to blame for these skyrocketing electricity bills? The causes are many: aging infrastructure, economic uncertainty, tariffs, wars, red tape, the failure to build enough renewable energy, inefficient construction, rising demand, the responsibility of investor-owned utilities to generate profits for shareholders and rapidly changing climates, both atmospheric and political.

Over the next few weeks, we’ll examine some of these causes and innovative solutions being proposed. But to understand utility prices, you first must understand how the largest machine in the world works — one so ubiquitous that although we use it every minute of every day, we hardly notice it.

New York’s power grid consists of 11,000 miles of transmission lines that can supply up to 41,000 megawatts of electricity. The problem is that the grid is losing power faster than it can be replaced. Fossil-fuel plants are aging out of service. Since 2019, New York has added 2,274 megawatts while deactivating 4,315 megawatts.

“It’s an old system,” said Rich Dewey, president of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), the nonprofit tasked with running the grid, on an episode of its podcast, Power Trends. “The expectation that it’s going to continue to perform at the same high level that it has, say, for the last couple of decades, is just not reasonable. We’re going to need to replace those megawatts” to maintain a reliable transmission system.

The state has undertaken several initiatives to boost the energy flowing through the grid. Six years ago, the state Legislature passed an ambitious law that stipulates that New York must be powered by 70 percent renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent zero-emission electricity by 2040. Last year, 48 percent of the energy produced by the state was zero-emission; nearly all that energy is produced upstate, where solar and hydropower are abundant.

The $6 billion Champlain Hudson Power Express, which will carry 1,250 megawatts of renewable energy from Quebec to New York City, and passes by the Highlands buried beneath the Hudson River, is expected to go online in 2026. This week, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced her intention, citing the Build Public Renewables Act of 2023, to construct nuclear plants that will produce at least 1 gigawatt.

The site or sites for those plants are expected to be in less-populated areas upstate or in western New York, which would make them subject to the same problem that prevents solar and hydropower from reaching downstate, including the Highlands: a bottleneck where the upstate and downstate grids meet.

The $2 billion question

If Jeffrey Seidman, a Vassar College professor, sounds philosophical when discussing climate change, it’s to be expected. Seidman is an associate professor of philosophy.

A few years ago, he began having second thoughts about his chosen field of study. “Watching the world visibly burning, I began to doubt that continuing to teach philosophy was morally defensible at this moment,” he said.

A career change seemed out of the question — Seidman had just turned 50 — but Vassar’s Environmental Studies department is interdisciplinary. So he developed a class called Climate Solutions & Climate Careers.

Lately, he has been taking his lectures outside the classroom to clear up misinformation for lawmakers. Renewable energy faces strong headwinds these days, as President Donald Trump’s executive orders and proposed legislation demonstrate that he intends to make it more difficult to build wind and solar projects. Before relenting, the federal government briefly halted an offshore wind project that was under construction off Long Island.

At a June 3 meeting of Dutchess County mayors and supervisors, Seidman explained the potential of battery energy storage systems (BESS) to facilitate the transfer of renewable energy from upstate to the Hudson Valley. Jennifer Manierre of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) discussed how the state can help municipalities quickly and safely site renewable energy projects. And Paul Rogers spoke about his experiences at the New York City Fire Department, where he was tasked with helping the city develop fire codes for BESS within dense urban environments.

Al Torreggiani, the supervisor for the Town of Hyde Park, was unimpressed. “Where are you going to come in and save me money?” he said. “Because everything you’re talking about is going to cost me money.”

Grid Basics

The U.S. electric grid dates to 1882, when Thomas Edison opened the first power plant at the Pearl Street Station in lower Manhattan. Today, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, plants that burn coal, oil or natural gas create 59 percent of the nation’s energy, nuclear plants account for 18 percent and renewables 23 percent.

To transport electricity over long distances, utilities use high-voltage lines. When the power reaches local substations, it is converted to a lower wattage to be sent to homes and businesses. The national grid includes 11,000 plants, 3,000 utilities and 2 million miles of power lines.

Due to the substantial costs of infrastructure, most utilities are granted local monopolies but are heavily regulated.

At the same time, municipalities are enacting moratoriums on renewables. Last year, Carmel and Putnam Valley passed moratoriums on battery energy storage systems and other projects. In some cases, doubts are fueled by conspiracy theories that wind and solar cause cancer (they don’t). In others, the resistance is for aesthetic reasons.

Battery energy storage systems are needed because solar and wind power suffer from being, to use the industry term, “intermittent.” Fossil fuels may be dirty, expensive and subject to the whims of war, but you can burn them whenever you want. Although the infrastructure costs of solar energy have dropped by 90 percent over the last decade, we have not yet figured out how to keep the sun from dipping below the horizon. Batteries store the excess power collected from solar panels and wind turbines for use when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.

“As prices [of battery units] have plummeted, it’s made deploying them at the scale where they can support the whole electrical grid more and more feasible,” Seidman said.

The downside is that they can catch fire. In 2023, three BESS units in New York caught fire, including one in Orange County. The state says no hazardous chemicals were released.

Seidman thinks that the risks and dangers have been overblown. During his talk on June 3, he explained how battery units are becoming safer and more affordable. Like solar, battery costs have come down 90 percent over the past decade. He noted that 15 years ago, cellphones caught fire.

“The reason you don’t read those stories is because we have gotten so much better at making these things,” he said. “Even though billions of people carry them in their pockets, they don’t catch fire.” Likewise, the batteries that power electric vehicles have also gotten safer. According to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, a gas-powered vehicle is 60 times more likely to catch fire than an electric one.

Paul Rogers, the former FDNY lieutenant who spoke at the June 3 meeting, explained the increasingly rigorous safety testing that battery storage units undergo, including making sure that if one battery catches fire, it doesn’t spread. Several firefighters attended the meeting to hear about training programs for fighting BESS fires (water isn’t effective) and to develop site-specific emergency plans.

In the Hudson Valley, there’s not as much open, available and affordable space for wind and solar projects. But with battery storage units, the downstate grid could receive the ample renewable energy from upstate to replace closer but more expensive and dirtier fossil-fuel plants. With battery units in place, renewable energy could be sent downstate at night, when transmission rates are cheaper and the grid is less crowded.

That is one answer to the “Where are you going to save me money?” question: Renewable energy sent to battery storage units could lower the “supply charges” section of electricity bills. In addition, with battery storage units, utilities don’t have to spend as much on substations and transmission lines, costs passed on as “delivery charges” on customer bills. A recent NYSERDA study showed that putting 6 gigawatts of battery power in New York by 2030 would save ratepayers across the state $2 billion.

At no point in Seidman’s talk did he mention climate change or the state climate laws. That’s intentional. Seidman said it’s easier to explain the benefits of the transition to renewable energy by focusing on less pollution and lower bills, which everyone wants. Some elected officials at the meeting discussed using BESS moratoriums to collaborate with the state on creating guidelines, rather than rejecting the technology outright.

What if your house was the battery?

Imagine you own a department store with an oversized parking lot that is full only one day of the year: Black Friday. As it happens, there’s another lot next door that’s always empty, including on Black Friday.

You ask your neighbor if, on Black Friday, your customers can use his parking lot. Sure, he says, for $1,000 per car. He says he needs that much to pay his property taxes, since the lot is otherwise empty.

Sounds ridiculous? In a nutshell, that’s how the electrical grid works. For 360 days of the year, the grid has enough power. However, on peak days — such as during this week’s heat wave — it requires more. So, operators turn to “peaker” plants, such as Danskammer, located on the Hudson River north of Newburgh.

Because these fossil-fuel plants operate only a few days a year, they charge exorbitant rates to cover their operating expenses. That drives up costs across the grid. For example, on Tuesday (June 24) at 5:51 p.m., with the peaker plants running, the price per megawatt in the Hudson Valley was $2,886. A month earlier, on a mild May afternoon, the price was $26.

These plants release copious amounts of pollution on days when air quality, because of the heat, is already poor. In addition, they tend to be built in low-income neighborhoods.

What if, on Black Friday, instead of paying an exorbitant rate to rent your neighbor’s lot, you coordinated with customers so they didn’t all show up at 6 a.m. when the doors opened? If they did that, you could lower your prices even more.

That’s the concept behind virtual power plants. Electricity customers join a program in which a smart meter in their home or business distributes energy, so that everyone is not using the grid at once. That allows operators to “reduce the peak and those extraordinarily high costs,” said Seidman. Like battery storage, it’s a way of getting more power from the grid without having to build costly substations and transmission lines.

Many people with EVs plug their cars in when they return home for the day, so they will be charged in the morning. With a virtual power plant, a utility can spread out the charging of cars, saving it for the middle of the night, when power is cheaper and the load is lighter. The same can be done with water heaters — after your morning shower, you don’t need your water to be hot again immediately.

Homes equipped with solar panels and battery storage can create their own peaker plant. When the grid needs more power, it draws from the battery unit instead of relying on a more expensive fossil-fuel plant.

“We call it a virtual power plant because we’re calling on all these smaller batteries to give us the power of a much larger system,” said Christian Woods of Orange & Rockland Utilities, which operates across the Hudson River. “It’s not a big eyesore installation that takes up a lot of space. It’s diluted across the system.”

During this week’s heat dome, customers participating in the Orange & Rockland virtual power plant fully charged their batteries thanks to ample sunshine. At night, O&R drew from those batteries and dispatched about 1.6 megawatts into the grid. On a day when the grid statewide was carrying more than 30,000 megawatts, 1.6 MW might not seem worth the trouble. However, that came from just 346 of the 300,000 homes O&R services in the two counties.

Orange & Rockland launched the program in 2015, when New York State offered funding to utilities that developed methods that cleaned up the grid while lowering costs for customers. Virtual power plants were moving from theory to practice in California and Texas, where they are credited with eliminating many of the rolling brownouts and blackouts that plagued the states due to insufficient power.

After receiving funding from the state, O&R developed a system in which new customers of Sunrun, a rooftop solar installation company, received a free battery storage unit if they agreed to allow the utility to draw from it during peak periods. If there’s an “outflow,” the customer receives a bill credit.

Solar systems are designed to provide up to 110 percent of a home’s annual usage, Woods said. There are seasonal fluctuations in energy usage, “but once you go through a full year, you’ve built up enough credits that you don’t need to buy energy from us,” he said.

Woods called it a win-win-win situation: Sunrun got new customers, O&C didn’t have to build substations and ratepayers got a free battery and lower bills. He said the most challenging part about implementing the program was convincing customers it wasn’t a scam.

Not everyone was eligible for the program: It was only for new customers who had roofs that could support solar panels and got enough sunlight, and who had garages with room for a battery. But Woods said the pilot program provides valuable data. “We’re seeing how much energy is being released through these systems and trying to extrapolate from that,” he said. “What if we had one in every 10 homes? In every five homes? We can take that data to our regulator and say, ‘This is what we’re looking to spend, and this is the benefit.’ This can defer the need to build out traditional infrastructure.”

Together, battery storage and virtual plants could be the solution to preparing the grid for the renewable energy era without raising rates. For that to happen, the state and utilities will need to develop plans that benefit a broader range of people. Even as the mayors and supervisors in Dutchess County warmed up to the idea, there was still skepticism.

“Does Central Hudson have to be involved with any of this?” asked Torreggiani, the Hyde Park supervisor, pointing to photos of battery storage units that Seidman had projected on a screen. “Because they’ll just jack the shit out of the price.”

This “Clean Energy Superpower Mission”, underlines the government’s commitment to make the UK a global leader in clean energy.
The plan notes that other industries within the clean energy sector, including “solar, bioenergy, storage including Long Duration Energy Storage, heat networks, and smart technologies”, are “vital”, but still not considered as part of these frontier industries.
Key aspects of Clean Energy Plan One major investment is a £700 billion increase in funding for Great British Energy Company, a new public company, which will “develop, invest in, build and operate clean energy projects and supply chains”.

This “Clean Energy Superpower Mission”, underlines the government’s commitment to make the UK a global leader in clean energy.

Clean energy is one of 8 sectors, known as the IS-8, which the Industrial Strategy prioritises. These sectors are considered by the government to have the most potential for economic growth.

Emphasising clean energy as a government priority

Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, wrote that “the global transition to net zero calls for huge investment” in a variety of “frontier industries” within the sector.

These industries include: Wind (onshore, offshore and floating offshore), Nuclear Fission, Fusion Energy, Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) including Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGRs), Hydrogen, and Heat Pumps.

Miliband continued that each of these “frontier industries” within the sector will benefit from “a doubling of current investment levels”, which will hopefully reach £30 billion overall by 2035.

The clean energy industry has already benefitted from over £40 billion in private investment since the Labour government was elected in July.

The plan notes that other industries within the clean energy sector, including “solar, bioenergy, storage including Long Duration Energy Storage, heat networks, and smart technologies”, are “vital”, but still not considered as part of these frontier industries.

Recent analysis from the Energy Transitions Commission and consultants Systemiq has found that 40 per cent of the solutions needed to move the economy to net zero are already cheaper than fossil fuels, or would be by 2030.

Key aspects of Clean Energy Plan

One major investment is a £700 billion increase in funding for Great British Energy Company, a new public company, which will “develop, invest in, build and operate clean energy projects and supply chains”.

This additional funding brings the government’s total public and private funding in clean energy supply chains to £1.7 billion.

Another major part of the plan is a new Workforce Strategy, which will be published by the Office for Clean Energy Jobs later this year. This will seek to transfer the UK’s existing energy workforce into the clean energy sector.

The government will also establish a new £1 billion Clean Energy Supply Chain Fund, overseen by GB Energy, which will be particularly focused on offshore wind supply chains.

The plans also included a £544 million Clean Industry Bonus for offshore wind developers aimed at supporting coastal industrial areas.

£13.2 billion for its Warm Homes Plan, to support the roll-out of heat pumps in British homes. The government will also soon launch its Heat Pump Accelerator Competition, which will give £30 million in grants to manufacturers investing in new heat pump capacity.

How have the Clean Energy plans been received?

The plans have been well-received by many within the energy industry, in key unions, and in think tanks.

Martin Pibworth, Chief Executive designate at SSE, welcomed the focus on clean energy, claiming: “It’s exactly the kind of commitment that gives industry the confidence to deliver at pace and scale”

Jon Butterworth, CEO of National Gas, also backed the plan, saying it “will position Britain as a world leader in technologies like hydrogen and carbon capture.”

The bosses of other major organisations also welcomed the news. These include E.ON UK, the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, the Trades Union Congress, GMB and Schneider Electric.

The Energy Transitions Commission’s chair Adair Turner responded to the announcements, saying: “We now need the right policies to enable other sectors of the economy to reach that tipping point, and to enable all countries to share in the economic opportunities created.”

Laith Whitwam, Senior Policy Adviser at the think tank E3G, also said: “This strategy cuts the sky-high electricity prices driven by gas dependency and gives British industry the shot in the arm it needs to lead the charge to a clean economy.”

Far more potent, it escapes from fossil fuel extraction sites and is produced by livestock and farming.
Governments have tended to ignore the potential for methane cuts, but pressure is growing for the gas to be included prominently in countries’ NDCs at Cop30.

Ana Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, said: “Transitioning away is a responsibility of everyone, not only producing countries, consumer countries – many countries in the north don’t produce fossil fuel, but they consume fossil fuel.","Two weeks of negotiations on the climate crisis have just concluded in Bonn in preparation for the Cop30 summit taking place in Brazil this November. What did we learn?

Success or failure? Pledges will be key

Limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels is vital for a healthy planet, but hopes of doing so are rapidly vanishing as greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and temperatures soar. The main task for Cop30 in Belém this November is for every country to submit a national plan, required under the 2015 Paris agreement, to cut carbon as far as necessary to hold to the 1.5C limit.

Few countries have submitted their plans, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which set out a target on emissions to 2035 and an indication of the measures that will be taken to meet them. They were due in February, but the US presidency of Donald Trump, his vacillations over tariffs and the prospect of a global trade war led many to adopt a “wait and see” approach. Military conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Iran have further frightened governments and taken attention away from the climate.

Brazil is urging all countries to come forward with their NDCs in September, in time for the UN to assess them before Cop30 begins. Even if they meet the deadline, however, it was abundantly clear from the preliminary negotiations in Bonn that the NDCs will not add up to the emissions cuts needed to stay within 1.5C, assuming that is still possible.

That leaves Brazil with a dilemma. The Cop host has no control over how countries set their NDCs, as that is done by national governments before they arrive in Belém. No country is likely to revise its NDC at the Cop. But a summit that ends with inadequate NDCs that would lead to global heating far in excess of 1.5C or even 2C will be labelled a failure.

Brazil must find a way to show how NDCs that come up short can be improved or remedied, or how countries can collaborate to make faster and deeper cuts, if it is to keep the goals of Paris alive.

How hard it will be – US, war and wreckers

Work at Bonn was held up for two days because countries could not agree on the agenda for the meeting, and by the end they had little progress to show on key issues. This was just a foretaste of the fights and recriminations that Brazil can expect in earnest at Cop30.

As well as the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement, and the dangerous geopolitical circumstances, Brazil will have to contend with a cadre of countries and vested interests that want to stymie the talks.

Developed countries are widely, and reasonably, blamed for their failures to cut emissions fast enough and to provide the finance needed by the poor world. But behind the scenes many fossil fuel producers and their allies that are supposed to be on the side of the developing world are also happy to hold up negotiations, exploiting the complexity of the talks to cover their actions. If Bonn was frustrating, Cop30 could be far worse.

Money

For developing countries, the key question remains: how can they gain access to the resources they need to protect their citizens against the impacts of climate breakdown? Many are already experiencing “loss and damage” from extreme weather, in the form of droughts, floods, heatwaves and encroaching seas. But the funding that developed countries promised has been slow to arrive.

Richard Sherman, a South African delegate, told the Bonn conference: “There is no money. The funds that we have are not able to support the need.”

At Cop29, developed countries promised that $1.3tn a year would flow to the poor world by 2035, made up of at least $300bn from public sources and the rest from innovative forms of finance such as levies on polluting activities, carbon trading and private investment.

Only the broad outlines were agreed, however. There is not yet a blueprint showing how the money can be delivered and distributed over the next decade. Last year’s host, Azerbaijan, is collaborating with Brazil to produce a roadmap with more detail. Delegates warn it must set out a clear timetable of concrete actions, rather than more vague promises.

Mutirão

At recent Cops, hosts have taken to having special meetings based on traditional formats. This began at Durban in 2011, when as the negotiations stretched long past their official deadline, heads of delegation moved into special indaba meetings, named after a traditional Zulu gathering of tribal elders. Since then, Cop28 in Dubai had its majlis, and Cop29 in Baku had a qurultay, modelled on a Turkic chieftains’ gathering.

At Cop30, delegates will be invited to a mutirão, a Portuguese word derived from the Indigenous Tupi-Guarani language that refers to a group coming together to work on a shared task.

Methane

Carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels is the main greenhouse gas affecting the planet, but increasingly scientists and activists are focusing on another gas: methane. Far more potent, it escapes from fossil fuel extraction sites and is produced by livestock and farming.

Methane breaks down in the atmosphere much faster than carbon dioxide, but warms the planet about 80 times as much while it lasts, so cutting methane gives more bang for the emissions reduction buck. Given its smaller number of sources, plugging emissions of methane should also be easier than cutting carbon.

Governments have tended to ignore the potential for methane cuts, but pressure is growing for the gas to be included prominently in countries’ NDCs at Cop30.

‘Transition away from fossil fuels’

At Cop28 in Dubai, countries agreed for the first time to “transition away from fossil fuels”, a historic commitment that should have signalled a dramatic shift in the global economy. No sooner was that conference over, however, than some countries were seeking to unpick the resolution.

Last year, at Cop29, attempts to reinforce the language on the transition, and to set out clearer plans on how it could be brought about, met fierce – though sometimes covert – opposition, and came to nothing. Many campaigners want to bring the subject back at Cop30. But Brazil is resisting having a “cover decision” – a wide-ranging text that would incorporate all sorts of resolutions, arguing that the resolutions of previous Cops need not be revisited.

Bonn ended without a clear path forward on the issue, but it is unlikely to disappear before Cop30.

Cop clearup

Every Cop generates its own baggage – presidents and host countries want to put their own stamp on proceedings, and so bring forward pet projects that focus on one aspect of the climate crisis, such as electric vehicles, or coal, or aspects of food or forestry. Over the years, these initiatives have proliferated so that now there are scores of them, some still useful but others in effect left orphaned as the ministers who invented them have faded into political obscurity and the money behind them has been spent. Brazil is aiming to tackle some of this bloat.

But the wider and more radical reforms to the Cop process that some have called for will not be on the programme.

Logistics

Belém, a rainforest city and port, lies near the mouth of the Amazon River. While charming, it has never been a tourist mecca, and to have an estimated 60,000 people – and perhaps many more – land on its shores will be a major strain.

It seemed as if every conversation in Bonn, whether it started on NDCs, climate finance or the substantive issues of climate governance, always ended up on the same subject: logistics. With just four months to go, most people have yet to secure anywhere to stay in Belém.

Brazil has promised that 29,000 rooms and 55,000 beds will be made available, but so far these have yet to materialise. Cruise ships are being pressed into service, supplying more than 3,000 cabins, and some people are gratefully looking forward to spending a fortnight in shipping containers.

But the prices being asked in advance are astronomical, and beyond the reach of most developing countries’ delegations and climate-activist charities. Without them, the Cop will be skewed towards moneyed interests, will reinforce global inequalities and will fail the most vulnerable. Choosing Belém for Cop30 has created a logistical conundrum that the hosts have yet to solve.

Brazil’s fossil fuels

The choice of Belém was meant to highlight the plight of the Amazon rainforest, one of the world’s greatest carbon sinks and vital to the health of the planet – and which is under threat not just from deforestation, but from the climate crisis itself, as rapidly rising temperatures could push the Amazon over a tipping point that would transform it from rainforest into a savannah-like state. That would be catastrophic for the planet, potentially leading to further rapid escalations in temperature from which there could be no return.

But the spotlight on Belém has also brought into focus Brazil’s own adventures with fossil fuels. Oil and gas deposits discovered in and around the Amazon, and off the coast not far from Belém, are being considered for exploitation.

Brazil’s oil sector regulator, ANP, will auction the exploration rights to 172 oil and gas blocks spanning 56,000 sq miles (146,000 sq km), an area more than twice the size of Scotland, most of it offshore. The “doomsday auction”, as campaigners have called it, includes 47 blocks in the Amazon basin, in a sensitive area near the mouth of the river that fossil fuel companies consider a promising new oil frontier.

Brazil has argued that developing countries should be allowed to exploit their fossil fuel reserves while developed nations, many of which have grown rich over centuries of exploiting their own resources, must take the lead in closing down operations. Ana Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, said: “Transitioning away is a responsibility of everyone, not only producing countries, consumer countries – many countries in the north don’t produce fossil fuel, but they consume fossil fuel. We’ve gone to this era of finger pointing on countries. We need to find solutions for producer countries that depend financially on that income.”

Cop31

One of the many tasks at which Bonn failed was to broker an agreement on who should host the Cop31 summit. Australia and Turkey are vying for the presidency of next year’s meeting. Neither is willing to concede to the other, and the obscure process for choosing future presidencies tends to rely on consensus candidates emerging and a system of gentlemen’s agreements, rather than a real competition or vote.

Australia’s newly re-elected government wants to showcase its commitment to climate action, despite being one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel exporters, as climate policy was one of its key battlegrounds in the recent elections. Turkey has long been unhappy with its status at the talks – in 1992, when the UN framework convention on climate change was signed, Turkey was lumped in with developed countries, which have clear obligations to cut emissions and provide climate finance to the poor world, but has since argued it should have been aligned with the developing world.

There are hints that Turkey could be persuaded to drop its bid if its status were reconsidered. But opening up the parent treaty to the Paris agreement would be legally difficult and stir up much wider issues: for if Turkey’s status has changed since 1992, what of countries such as China, now the world’s second-biggest economy with a GDP per capita comparable to some EU member states, and wealthy Gulf petrostates such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates?",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76bc0c1dfa976c0902d421d124addcb086e1a5b3/854_445_4443_3555/master/4443.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a7b281560af93bc9df278d728a0ff8e,N,,2025-06-27 12:25:42.437532

Australia’s Clean Energy Council (CEC) estimates that 32,000 electricians are needed to meet the federal government’s commitment to generate 82 per cent renewable electricity by 2030.

That number is dwarfed by the number of construction workers needed. Industry estimates say 450,000 labourers are needed to construct the energy generation and transmission infrastructure of the renewable future.

Training all of these frontline workers in the new ways of renewables is a conundrum that needs to be solved, and quickly.

Arron Wood is the chief policy and impact officer at the CEC. He says that while the deadline for the shift to renewables may be five years away, recruiting for those positions needs to happen now.

“One of the greatest opportunities and challenges for the clean energy industry over the next five years is that it will need to recruit an additional 40,000 workers,” says Wood.

Once they are on board, the labour force needs to be upskilled to meet the tasks at hand.

“The lack of standardisation in training and skills requirements across employers has traditionally posed a challenge for the industry, and creates confusion for workers and students trying to understand the pre-requisites to be ready for clean energy jobs.”

Now, the CEC, MyPass Global, and the Victorian and Queensland governments have joined forces to provide a contemporary solution to the recruitment and upskilling challenge. The new platform is called the Clean Energy Job Ready.

“From tradespersons from regional areas, adjacent industries, under-represented groups to mature talent with transferrable skills, the Skills Passport and Career Pathways help workers understand the skills needed to pursue careers in the sector,” says Matt Smith, the CEO of MyPass Global founded in Sydney in 2015.

“The better we are at helping workers match their skills to what industry needs, the closer we are to realising Australia’s net zero vision.”

The ‘Jobs Ready’ platform features career pathways information, easily identifiable industry-agreed skills, training, and a ‘digital skills passport.’

The latter enables workers in the renewables sector to upload their qualifications and credentials, and employers to easily cross-check those against role and site-specific requirements. This maintains a safe work environment and operational agility, says Smith.

It is a space Smith knows well, counting Shell, Woodside, and BHP as customers, alongside 1,300 other companies.

“Using MyPass technology to achieve real-time worker competency assurance enables clean energy operators and their suppliers to unlock new levels of productivity and safety needed to keep renewable projects on track,” says Smith.

And that’s good news for the well-being of Australian workers – and for the planet.

“The Clean Energy, Job Ready program is the result of our close collaboration with industry in Victoria and Queensland to define a common, consistent set of skills and training requirements for clean energy projects,” says Wood. “This sector-wide standardisation is key to closing workforce gaps and accelerating our shift to a green economy.”

However, regulatory pressures, intensifying competition, political climate, and a maturing EV market are beginning to challenge its long-held dominance.
What Scout Motors told Newsweek: ""A storied legacy and a running start combine to create an enduring brand and business built for success.
Scout Motors combines highly credible vehicles with a beloved brand and a passionate community that has kept the scout spirit alive for decades.
There's plenty of road ahead as Scout Motors works to bring these incredible vehicles to life and invest in communities and people.""","The road to automaker profitability is littered with names that are both familiar and long since forgotten. Even in today's business climate, where vast amounts of data are available at the fingertips, creating a car that people are willing to pay for is a moonshot.

Henrik Fisker tried twice. VinFast has already pulled out of the U.S. Peugeot promised to come to America and is now firmly against it.

""Ultimately, surviving in the automotive industry isn't just about vision—it's about endurance. The startups that win will be the ones that don't just launch well, but scale wisely, deliver consistently, and adapt faster than the giants they're trying to disrupt,"" Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific, told Newsweek.

Newsweek asked some of the world's top auto industry analysts to weigh in on the potential future of six companies, all of which fit into the category of startup, even if they have been around for a while: Rivian, Lucid Motors, Tesla, Slate, Dacora and Scout Motors.

Rivian

Rivian is the standout in this group, turning a profit where others have struggled. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the automaker had a gross profit of $170 million. In the first quarter of 2025, a gross profit of $206 million was achieved.

""Rivian, despite still experiencing financial growing pains, is on a good path. The recent mid-cycle actions on the R1 models have resulted in truly world class software that actually rivals Chinese efforts,"" Ed Kim, president and chief analyst at AutoPacific, told Newsweek.

Rivian's future was more securely put in place when its joint venture with Volkswagen was announced. VW invested $5.8 billion in Rivian VW Group Technology, LLC to develop an electric vehicle platform and software based on current and future Rivian technologies.

""With Amazon as a flagship customer, and a Volkswagen partnership, Rivian is aggressively scaling its EV footprint across delivery fleets and consumer vehicles. But this transition year brings production costs and margin pressure into focus, as competition from legacy automakers intensifies. If successful, Rivian's strategic partnerships and expanding charger network could secure its place as a dominant player — but sustainable profitability remains the most important objective,"" Tony Salerno, vice president at J.D. Power, told Newsweek.

The next major hurdle Rivian looks to clear is the production of its R2 SUV, which is smaller than the established R1 model. With a lower price point and larger market appeal, it could be the home run that the company needs to find even firmer footing.

""Now, Rivian faces its biggest make-or-break moment yet, the introduction of its R2 electric SUV. The R2 will be Rivian's first volume model with pricing expected to start below $50,000, and it's conceived to take Rivian into the mainstream. Plenty of consumers seem to be excited as it will offer all the style and capability of the R1S with a smaller and more manageable size and price tag. The success or failure of R2 will largely determine Rivian's fortunes going forward,"" Kim said.

What Rivian's CEO RJ Scaringe told Newsweek:

""As we head into the second half of 2025, there's tremendous amount of momentum as we work towards the launch of R2. I couldn't be more excited for what's ahead, and can't wait for R2 deliveries to start next year.""

Lucid Motors

Lucid Motors started its work on its first car in 2014 and debuted the Lucid Air sedan in 2016. Production of the model commenced in 2021. A year prior, the company showed off an SUV concept that would evolve into the Gravity production model. Deliveries of Gravity began late last year.

""Launching a luxury car might be seen as misreading the market, but the Air's lower profile and lighter weight compared to an SUV allowed them to hit that magic 500-mile mark for EV range, which established their technological capabilities. Early reviews on the Gravity are positive, but, like Rivian, they are waiting for their 'Model 3' moment to scale up with their new affordable SUV (and face the same challenges as Rivian in that regard). Their chances of survival are not quite as strong as Rivian but still good,"" Adam Bernard, founder and principal at AutoPerspectives, told Newsweek.

""Backed by the deep pockets of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, Lucid has built some of the most technically advanced luxury EVs on the road. Yet it continues to struggle with sales and profitability targets, putting pressure on execution. The Gravity SUV may offer a much-needed volume boost, but the company's success hinges on continued foreign backing and its ability to navigate current EV market headwinds,"" Salerno added.

The California-based automaker is looking ahead to its next model, Earth, a smaller crossover.

""As it prepares to launch its more attainable sub-$50K electric crossover by the end of this year, it - like Rivian - aims to enter the mainstream auto market and utilize its signature Lucid strengths detailed above to make its mark among regular, non-luxury customers,"" Kim said.

Lucid Motors did not reply to a request for comment from Newsweek.

Tesla

Tesla was early to the electric vehicles (EVs) game and continues to make models that buyers want. The company has struggled as of late between political controversies surrounding the business and its leaders, and the Cybertruck not reaching its perceived potential with customers. But, with its Cybercab robotaxi fleet aimed to come to fruition soon, there's fresh meat on the horizon.

""Tesla remains the undisputed heavyweight of the EV industry, with unmatched scale, brand awareness, and a vertically integrated model few can replicate. However, regulatory pressures, intensifying competition, political climate, and a maturing EV market are beginning to challenge its long-held dominance. That being said, Elon is a fierce competitor that should not be underestimated,"" Salerno said.

Is Tesla a startup? Is it one of America's new legacy automakers (a grouping that usually includes General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Stellantis)? At two decades old, it fits somewhere in between. If it's going to stick around, it needs to weather the current storm and continue to evolve.

""This company is no longer a startup. They have plants in three countries and sold more than 1.8 million units last year—twice Subaru's global sales and more than Mazda,"" Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility, told Newsweek.

""Tesla's opportunity is still in its EV accomplishments, even with consumer concerns over the CEO's affiliation with U.S. politics, and his other controversial statements. Tesla's sales challenges in the past year or so are more deeply rooted in the impact of inconsistent pricing strategies and aging models than the headlines.

""The updates to Model 3 and Y are not enough to get loyal buyers to upgrade or buy for a third time. For new EV buyers, there is much more competition, and most of it looks fresh compared with the older Tesla designs. Delayed products and minimal updates for existing models are fundamental car company problems, and Tesla has them.

""The Cybertruck has been polarizing and not met the sales targets Tesla wanted. Even if it turns out to be a miss, a single product miss isn't enough to end most car companies, and it won't end this one,"" she said.

Tesla did not reply to a request for comment from Newsweek.

Slate

Slate made big headlines this year when it first debuted a peek at its upcoming model in the pages of Newsweek, then again a few weeks later at its formal brand and company launch event.

The company plans an American-made truck that converts into a number of other body-style configurations, including an SUV. Slate intends to begin selling the vehicle by the end of next year.

Kim calls the company's offering, ""a true countercultural proposition."" He also said: ""Many car enthusiasts like to wax poetic about bare bones vehicles of the past, but the reality is that most of today's new vehicle shoppers want amenities. Are there enough people who want a bare-bones DIY electric trucklet to the tune of 150,000 units a year? Slate thinks so and is betting its future on it.""

Salerno warns that Slate, ""...faces some vulnerability if one of the established automakers like Ford shifts the playing field.""

Brinley sees vulnerabilities elsewhere as well saying, ""The Slate also underscores that to get something affordable or inexpensive means giving up features and technology – though there are some buyers who will appreciate that it isn't connected. A two-door pickup formula is easier to engineer and cheaper to build, but U.S. consumers shun two-door pickup trucks for almost anything but work trucks. The two-door configuration will limit sales. Slate is intriguing and will be a great formula for some buyers. But will it be enough buyers for a sustainable business? We'll see.""

What Slate told Newsweek:

""Slate is revolutionizing the build process by simplifying it, allowing us to get to high quality volume production and pass the savings on to our customers. Having a reliable, affordable vehicle may be a life-changing opportunity for those who thought it was impossible.""

Dacora

Dacora is hoping to break into the super high-end market with an electric vehicle that is designed and engineered in the U.S. The company is just beginning to talk about its business and take reservations.

""Dacora is still largely unproven publicly, but like any stealth startup, it will need to prove that its idea translates not just to a cool prototype but to a business with staying power. As with many mobility upstarts, the runway is short, and expectations are high,"" Waatti said.

Bernard is equally skeptical: ""With Bentley and Ferrari boasting about the profit-generating capabilities of their bespoke services, Dacora is going after a relatively small but valid niche (where Rolls-Royce and Cadillac's Celestiq already play). However, information on the business plan is difficult (or impossible) to find. The website is sparsely populated; buyers interested in dropping $50,000 will have to dig through LinkedIn to find who will be spending their money. They will soon discover many functions aren't represented (yet) and there's not a lot of automotive experience in the existing team. Right now, this seems like a fascinating idea that hasn't been fleshed out enough to know if it will work.""

Once up and producing, scaling production is key to Dacora's success, even with few orders to execute per year, Salerno said. ""Dacora is entering the EV market with a uniquely American, ultra-luxury offering — handcrafted and priced north of $300,000. Its exclusive, retro-inspired design targets an elite clientele, but scaling sustainable profitable production with heavyweight rivals like Rolls-Royce and Bentley presents obstacles.""

What Dacora told Newsweek:

""Dacora truly stands apart. We've fused the rich culture and heritage of ultra-luxury automotive with a powerhouse team — deep technical talent alongside seasoned industry veterans who know what it takes to scale and succeed,"" said Kristie D'Ambrosio-Correll, co-founder and CEO of Dacora Motors. ""The ultra-luxury segment is vastly underserved and offers exceptional unit economics. Our coachbuilding approach reduces upfront capital needs and allows us to rewrite the traditional EV go-to-market playbook. And it's working — pre-orders already represent nearly $40 million in first-year revenue.""

Scout Motors

Last year, Scout publicly revealed plans to bring a Terra truck and Traveler SUV to market in two years. Building on the roots of decades of branding from the mid-1900s, Scout Motors, though a thoroughly American company in terms of product and engineering, is financed under the Volkswagen Group umbrella.

The company plans a direct-to-consumer sales model but has been challenged in court by new car dealers over the legality of those plans, something that Salerno notes adds complications to its launch.

In the pros column, Kim lists the company's plug-in hybrid powertrain variant as being on track to appeal to customers in ways a fully-electric vehicle does not. And, Scout's manufacturing plant near Columbia, South Carolina, is poised to benefit Volkswagen Group brands in the future as the company looks to regionalize production, he explained.

""Having VW support will be critical, in terms of funding but also in terms of expertise and talent. Scout has drawn heavily from Volkswagen Group ranks and been able to poach respected industry veterans from other companies. Scout's plans to use the Rivian architecture via a Rivian-VW joint venture is an illustration of the importance of having a strong parent,"" Brinley said.

""At first blush and on paper, the Scout products look terrific. They are attractive, have plenty of technology delivered in a more familiar setting, and the mix of range-extended electric and battery electric powertrains provide choice.""

Bernard sees parallels between the history of General Motors and today's Volkswagen Group business plan. ""In many ways, Scout is intending to do for SUVs and VW Group what Saturn did for small cars and General Motors; for VW Group, it's a new brand, a new architecture, a new plant, and a new way of selling vehicles. America's continued interest in SUVs may offset lower-than-expected demand for the pickup, and the range extender (which uses a configuration that no other automaker has yet tried) should address concerns over EV demand,"" Bernard said.

There are additional concerns. ""Expectations are high, and success hinges on the flawless execution of both product and manufacturing in the U.S.—something VW hasn't always nailed in the past,"" Waatti said.

What Scout Motors told Newsweek:

""A storied legacy and a running start combine to create an enduring brand and business built for success.

Scout Motors meets the American market by entering the core of the U.S. automotive segments – rugged SUVs and full-size pickup trucks. The Scout Traveler SUV and Terra truck will address roughly 40 percent of the U.S. auto market and will be built in America in a way that combines American entrepreneurship with the backing, scale, and manufacturing know-how of the Volkswagen Group. This enables Scout Motors to deliver upon a competitive cost base and move with speed.

Scout Motors meets the American moment by supporting the revitalization of American manufacturing through its multibillion-dollar investment into its Production Center in Blythewood, South Carolina. Spanning 1,100 acres and creating more than 4,000 good-paying jobs, Scout Motors' Production Center will have the capacity to build more than 200,000 Scout vehicles per year when fully ramped up. Construction is on track, and factory hiring will start soon.

Across categories, the most successful American brands and products have always had a bit of magic. Scout Motors combines highly credible vehicles with a beloved brand and a passionate community that has kept the scout spirit alive for decades. By combining its product heritage with modern ingenuity while leaning in and listening to the existing Scout community and fans, Scout Motors is unlike any other new automotive entrant.

Consumer response to the reveal of the Scout Traveler and Terra is extremely positive. The Harvester range-extender option, connection-focused features like the bench seat, and a return to tactility and utility are resonating with consumers. That enthusiasm is reflected in reservation counts.

There's plenty of road ahead as Scout Motors works to bring these incredible vehicles to life and invest in communities and people.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662671/tesla-cybercab.png,N,,2025-06-27 12:27:34.368980

That shouldn’t be news, but it is.

Three times this week PJM Interconnection, which runs the 13-state (plus District of Columbia) electric grid that Virginia is part of, issued a “Maximum Generation Alert,” in which it instructed utilities to crank out as much power as possible. That was the fourth such alert this year, twice as many as last year.

The prompt this week was a brutal heat wave, but those triple-digit temperatures came on top of electric demand that was rising anyway, due primarily to the growth of energy-guzzling data centers.

Here’s how close we came to maxing out: On Tuesday afternoon, the grid was using 97.1% of the power available. Even then, the power demand was reduced by “Pre-Emergency Load Management Action,” meaning some big electric users were paid to not use electricity.

We Americans don’t like being told we must do without something. The prospect of not having enough electricity seems a problem for some less fortunate country, yet here we are having to ration electricity. Get used to it. I could say what happened this week is just the tip of the iceberg, but that would definitely be the wrong cliché. The problem is we’re increasing demand for power faster than we’re increasing the generation of that power. There are enough politics here to be difficult for both sides: a warming planet for some, an increased reliance on renewables for others, the explosive growth of data centers for all.

I wrote about some of those earlier this week in a column about how even some Democrats are now saying Virginia needs to revise the Clean Economy Act, the landmark energy bill in 2020 that mandated the state’s two biggest utilities (Dominion and Appalachian) adopt a carbon-free electric grid by 2050. It was authored during a period that saw electricity demand rising slowly; the sudden growth of data centers has changed things. We don’t live in that world anymore.

Asked about the PJM generation alerts during an appearance in Fincastle on Thursday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said this is evidence of why the Clean Economy Act needs to be “dismantled” because it’s holding back some forms of energy. “We’re growing Virginia and growing power demands,” he said. “We must contruct more generatiing capacity, that is all of the above —everything, all-American, all of the above. That’s finishing the wind project, finishing our solar project, that’s building gas, using clean coal and nuclear.”

Democrats don’t see things that way at all, but neither do many Republicans in Washington. However, there isn’t a two-way argument over energy, it’s more of a three-way argument — Democrats want renewables, some Republicans want “all of the above” but now some Republicans in Washington are ditching “all of the above” for their version of just “some of the above,” which doesn’t really include renewables but is heavy on carbon-based energy and nuclear, both of which take longer to develop. That has created an odd situation where the policies being pursued by some Republicans in Washington would actually reduce power generation in the short term, at a time when power demand is rising.

Let’s walk through all this.

Everything we’re doing as a society demands more power

It’s easy to blame data centers for our power problems, but data centers aren’t alien entities that have landed among us. We are the ones who are using all that data — every time we send an email, doomscroll on social media or stream something from Netflix. President Donald Trump wants to increase the use of artificial intelligence and wants to increase manufacturing; both of those are power-intensive. Before we blame Trump, though, let’s remember that if Kamala Harris had won, she’d have done the same thing. She would have certainly done things differently, but the market forces driving our power demands would still be there, no matter who’s in the White House. There are lots of things we can do to reduce power demands — construct energy-efficient buildings, for one thing — but I have yet to hear a politician say we should ration our Netflix consumption or limit the number of cat videos we post on Facebook.

Data centers aren’t really the ones creating the power demands; we are.

Congress is about to reduce our ability to generate more power

We need more power, and we need it quickly. Nobody seems to disagree on that basic point, even though they disagree on which kind of power we should be generating. However, Congress appears on the verge of reducing our ability to generate more power in the short term. That’s not the intent of Republicans pushing the One Big Beautiful Bill; they simply want to retire tax credits for renewables as soon as possible, a combination of philosophical distaste for such incentives, a belief that renewables aren’t a reliable power source and a desire to reconfigure federal spending (which Democrats portray as finding ways to afford lower taxes for the rich).

Whatever your views on taxes and federal spending, it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that doing away with those tax credits would slow power generation at a time when we need to increase it — and therefore, under the law of supply and demand, make power even more expensive. That’s because most of the new power coming onto the grid these days is almost entirely from renewables. If we eliminate or reduce those renewables, we could replace them with the types of energy Republicans prefer — coal, gas, nuclear — but those typically take longer to develop than renewables. Hence, a temporary shortfall between demand and supply, with more potential blackouts and higher electric rates.

Let’s walk through the numbers. The figures for 2024 show that 90% of the new power added to the grid nationally came from renewables — 82% solar, 8% wind. That’s up from 77% of new power in 2023 being renewable, according to the Clean Market Annual Power Report. Whether rightly or wrongly (I’m trying hard here to avoid value judgments and just stick to the numbers), we have built a system where the vast majority of new power being developed is coming from renewables — mostly solar, some wind (and battery storage to store that power for later use). Now, a new administration and a new Congress want to undo all that. Trump has already issued executive orders to shut down much of the offshore wind development that’s been planned. Solar developers warn that the One Big Beautiful Bill will virtually shut down solar development. If so, that’s a lot of projected power that’s going to have to be replaced. Let’s look at those details.

Here in Virginia, Appalachian Power says it has no new energy projects in the works — although it’s exploring a small nuclear reactor in Campbell County. Dominion Energy is adding from 0.5 to 1 gigawatts of solar power in Virginia every year. It’s building a wind facility off the coast of Virginia Beach that is projected to start revving out 2.6 gigawatts by the end of 2026. It’s hoping to add 1 gigawatt of natural gas at a plant in Chesterfield County in 2029 and increase the output of existing natural gas plants by 0.5 gigawatts over “the next few years.” It’s also looking at small nuclear reactors at its existing North Anna nuclear station in Louisa County and at the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, but those are a long way off. (Dominion, by the way, is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.)

There are some other energy projects that don’t seem to fit into these calculations. For instance, Apex Clean Energy of Charlottesville is building the state’s first onshore wind farm on a mountain north of Eagle Rock in Botetourt County; that’s a 79.3-megawatt project whose energy will go to run Google’s data centers in Virginia. (This, by the way, is said to be completely separate from the data center campus that Google is now planning to build in Botetourt’s industrial park at Greenfield.)

There are several observations to be made here:

Notice that most of this new power in Virginia is renewable, just as it is nationally. You may like that, you may not like that, but it’s still a fact we need to deal with.

Some of that new power wouldn’t be affected by the Big Beautiful Bill, but some of it would be. The current version calls for those clean energy tax credits to end after 2026. If solar advocates are right that the industry withers without those tax credits, then that’s 0.5 to 1 gigawatts of new solar power we won’t be adding to the grid every year in Virginia.

Virginia’s data centers consumed 4,100 megawatts last year, according to a study by the General Assembly’s research arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. That report also warned that the energy consumption of data centers could triple by 2040 if it’s not restrained. If that’s right, that means we need 12,200 megawatts for data centers — or, another 8,200 megawatts of power. A more recent report put Virginia’s data center megawatt consumption at 4,900 megawatts, so that’s a 19.5% increase since just last year.

On Tuesday, when we came closest to running out of power, the grid still had an excess capacity of 4,664 megawatts we could have used. That means if Virginia’s data center load doubles — far less than the warning about tripling — then we don’t have enough power. If data centers triple, then we really don’t have enough power on the grid for everybody. Also, keep in mind that Virginia’s not the only state with data centers, just the one with the most. We also have more on the way: Also on Tuesday, the hottest day of the year so far, Botetourt County announced that Google had bought 312 acres in its industrial park for a data center complex.

There are 1,000 megawatts in a gigawatt, so you can see why Dominion’s offshore wind project is a big deal — that’s 2,600 megawatts more to add to the grid. Had that wind farm been in full operation on Tuesday, the grid presumably would have had 7,264 megawatts of capacity leftover. But that still doesn’t get us to the 8,200 additional megawatts we might need. And, again, that’s just our data centers; that’s not counting anybody else’s or all the other things we’re trying to plug in. If 0.5 to 1 new gigawatts of solar every year — or 500 to 1,000 megawatts, if you prefer — go away, we’re likely to miss that. Congress is about to reduce part of our power generation in the short term, while the power that could replace it can only be built long-term.

Let’s take a look:

It’s not easy to replace renewables quickly

If all energy sources were equally available, we could have a different discussion about the relative merits of solar vs. wind vs. gas vs. coal vs. nuclear vs. anything else technology can come up with. They’re not, though. Notice that I’m not talking about carbon emissions or cost or reliability; I’m just looking at how quickly we can get each one into place.

Solar can be added relatively quickly. Let’s take some random examples: The 100-megawatt Sadler solar project in Greensville County took about a year to complete. The 1.5-megawatt Merck solar project in Rockingham County took about a year to complete. The 120-megawatt Maplewood solar project in Pittsylvania County took about three years.

No other form of power can go from bare ground to power generation in such a short period of time.

Let’s say you think natural gas is the way to go — and many do. S&P Global reports that the wait time for key parts for gas turbines is “upwards of five to seven years.” That’s not even talking about building the plant; that’s just getting the parts. The demand for gas has created those backlogs, which are getting longer. Dominion proposed its Chesterfield gas project in 2024 and has an estimated 2029 completion date — so five years, which puts it on the shorter end of things. The website Power Engineering reported this year that “If you’re building a project that involves a gas turbine, the largest manufacturers say you should be talking to your OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] as long as seven or eight years out.” Place and order today and wait until 2032 or 2033. You might prefer gas as an energy source, but if you need energy quickly, think of how much solar you could get into operation while you’re still waiting on that gas turbine order. If a new pipeline is required, just remember that the Mountain Valley Pipeline took 10 years and required a literal act of Congress to complete.

Every other form of energy takes even longer.

The Rocky Forge wind farm in Botetourt was first proposed in 2015; construction didn’t start until this year, and the developer hopes to be up and spinning power by the end of next year. That’s an 11-year timeline. Most of that was spent on permitting and finding a buyer for the power, so the actual construction time is only two years. Rocky Forge is on the long side, but maybe not that much. The Beech Ridge wind farm across the line in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, took at least five years from start to finish. The Amazon Wind Farm US East, near Elizabeth City, North Carolina, took 11 years.

All that is onshore wind; Dominion’s offshore wind project will have taken 14 years in development by the time it goes into service.

The most recent nuclear plant to open in the United States took 18 years. The industry hopes that small reactors can be built and placed into service on a quicker, cheaper timeline, but we really don’t know yet since no one has ever done that.

As for coal, no one has built a coal plant in the United States since 2013. None are under construction now. There might be some old ones that could be reopened, but many are like the old coal plant at Glen Lyn in Giles County — decommissioned.

Here’s what all that means: If we decided today that we didn’t want any more solar power and started right away on building other forms of energy, it would take at least five years, and probably longer, to get even the quickest ones (gas) into operation. In the meantime, we wouldn’t be adding any new generation because we just shut down solar. You can see how close we just came to maxing out our power supply. Are we going to stop adding new power demands to the grid while we build out all those other forms of power? Can we guarantee it won’t be even hotter next summer or the summer after that — and require more power to cool things down? The answer to both questions is the same: Of course not.

If we shut down solar and hope we can get these other power sources online, we would enter a five-year period (or longer) in which blackouts are more likely than they are now. That does not seem to be making America greater. Republicans in Virginia contend the Clean Economy Act is limiting our ability to develop energy sources; it’s certainly limiting our ability to develop some energy sources. However, those who want to develop nonrenewable sources of energy, such as gas and nuclear, might find that developing more solar energy in the short term is the only way to bridge that narrowing gap between demand and supply, whether they like that or not.

Put another way, if you support the Clean Economy Act, then that means more solar and wind, especially solar because wind is harder to build in Virginia. However, if you oppose the Clean Economy Act, then you still need to support solar in the interim because, otherwise, we’ll face a period where there’s no new energy being added to the grid while we wait for natural gas plants or nuclear plants to get built. That’s not good news for those in rural Virginia who have become increasingly resistant to large-scale solar projects, and it’s not good news for those who think solar energy is some kind of “voodoo energy” anyway (a phrase I heard at a recent energy conference), but this is the math — math that Congress doesn’t seem to be acknowledging.

While lawmakers have tightened the screws on tax incentives for wind and solar projects, battery storage has emerged as a rare bright spot in the clean energy policy arena. This divergence in support creates a tailwind for Fluence, a leader in energy storage software and systems, even as near-term headwinds like supply chain bottlenecks and project delays weigh on its short-term results. For investors focused on renewable infrastructure resilience, Fluence's strategic positioning makes it a compelling buy for the long haul.

Tax Policy: A Tailwind for Batteries, a Headwind for Wind/Solar

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and recent Senate updates to clean energy tax credits have reshaped the playing field. While wind and solar projects face phased reductions in tax incentives starting in 2026—dropping to just 20% of their value by 2027—battery storage retains robust support. The Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for standalone energy storage systems remains at 30% until 2032, with adders for domestic manufacturing (up to 40%) and projects in disadvantaged communities. This preservation of incentives contrasts sharply with wind and solar's declining trajectory, creating a structural advantage for battery-focused firms like Fluence.

The Senate's June 2025 bill, while introducing stricter foreign entity restrictions, also reaffirmed the ITC's role in battery storage. Fluence's recent moves—such as its partnership with Northvolt to establish U.S. manufacturing capacity—position it to capture these domestic content bonuses, avoiding penalties tied to “Foreign Entity of Concern” (FEOC) sourcing.

Why Fluence Stands Out: Software, Safety, and Scale

Fluence's moat isn't just its hardware. The company's energy software platform, which optimizes grid storage performance and integrates with renewable assets, gives it a critical edge. As grids grow more complex—balancing intermittent solar/wind generation with baseload needs—software that maximizes storage efficiency becomes a must-have. Fluence's Acceso software, for example, reduces curtailment by 30% in solar-plus-storage projects, a feature that utilities desperate for grid stability increasingly demand.

But hardware innovation is equally vital. Fluence's Iron Edison systems, which use non-lithium iron-sulfur flow batteries, address a key pain point: fire safety. Unlike lithium-ion, these systems are inherently non-flammable, making them ideal for dense urban grids. This validation from regulators and insurers opens doors to projects in high-risk areas, where safety concerns previously limited adoption.

Near-Term Challenges vs. Long-Term Opportunity

Fluence's Q2 2025 guidance cut—attributed to supply chain delays and permitting bottlenecks—has spooked short-term traders. However, these are execution hiccups, not existential threats. The company's backlog of $2.5 billion (as of Q1 2025) suggests strong demand, particularly for its grid-scale projects. Meanwhile, its shift toward direct-pay credits (vs. tax equity) mitigates risks tied to volatile equity markets.

The real prize lies in the $100+ billion market for grid modernization. As utilities invest in resilience against climate volatility, battery storage becomes a foundational layer. Fluence's software-hardware stack and FERC-certified control systems make it a one-stop shop for utilities seeking turnkey solutions.

Investment Thesis: Buy for Grid Resilience, Not Short-Term Volatility

Fluence is not a “growth at any cost” story. It's a capital-light, high-margin play on a structural shift in energy infrastructure. With a 15% operating margin (vs. 8% for wind/solar peers) and a focus on recurring software revenue, FLNC's financial model is robust.

Key catalysts to watch:

1. U.S. Manufacturing Milestones: Northvolt-Fluence's first gigafactory in Georgia (targeting 2026) will reduce reliance on Asian suppliers.

2. Regulatory Validation: Expected FERC rulings on grid storage interconnection standards could accelerate project timelines.

3. Software Adoption: A 2025 partnership with GE Digital to integrate its platform into industrial grids signals expanding software sales.

Risks to Consider

Supply Chain Delays: Lithium and cobalt prices remain volatile, though Fluence's push for non-lithium solutions mitigates this.

Policy Uncertainty: The Senate's FEOC rules could complicate sourcing, though Fluence's early move to U.S./EU supply chains limits exposure.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Winner in the Energy Transition

Fluence Energy is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the IRA's battery storage tailwind, even as wind/solar subsidies shrink. Its software-driven solutions and fire-safe hardware address grid operators' core needs: reliability and safety. While near-term volatility may test nerves, the secular growth of energy storage—projected to hit $100 billion annually by 2030—ensures Fluence remains a pillar of the renewable infrastructure boom. For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, FLNC offers a rare blend of defensive moats and transformative upside.",,N,,2025-06-27 18:14:33.860885

The commemorative model, a 2025 Toyota Sienna Platinum in Wind Chill Pearl, was completed with a flash of lights and honk of the horn, symbolizing a key moment in the company’s electrification journey.

Toyota Indiana Hybrid Milestone

Toyota Indiana has produced the Sienna since 2003. A team of 7,650 employees assembled the latest generation, built exclusively as a hybrid.

With recent updates to its interior, the 2025 Sienna continues to blend style and practicality. The minivan recently earned the top position in its segment in the 2025 J.D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study.

“It’s a significant achievement to reach this milestone and something our team members should be proud of,” said Jason Puckett, president of Toyota Indiana. “The all-hybrid Sienna demonstrates our commitment to electrification. It remains a top-selling vehicle in Toyota’s lineup.”

Electrified Lineup Drives Sales Growth

The Sienna plays a key role in Toyota’s expanding electrified vehicle lineup. In May, Sienna sales surged by more than 95% year-over-year. At the same time, electrified vehicles made up nearly half of Toyota’s total sales volume for the month.

This growing portfolio supports the company’s broader goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, it said.

Letter marks a shift for dealers

Dealers and their representatives at the National Automobile Dealers Association have generally criticized EV incentives established under the Biden administration. The letter marks a shift as Congress considers eliminating the federal government’s support for EVs through the budget bill ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.

David O’Brien, used-car sales manager at Campbell Auto Group’s Volkswagen and Nissan stores in Edmonds, Wash., said he signed the letter because the EV tax credits have reduced costs for consumers and generated new business.

He said he supports keeping the credits or phasing them out gradually.

The Senate text would eliminate the $7,500 EV tax credit 180 days after passage. The House version would stop the credit at the end of 2025.

Should the reconciliation package go forward, tens of billions in federal investments and tax credits would be eliminated, driving up costs for individuals and businesses alike.
However, the Administration continues to sit on — and explore ways to eliminate — $3.3 billion in unspent funds from the Clean School Bus program.
Homeowners would lose $1 billion per year in rooftop solar and energy efficiency tax credits.","The House and Senate reconciliation bills propose devastating cuts to federal climate and clean energy investment programs. These cuts would be especially harmful to Floridians living in a state that does not produce its own fossil fuels, and where the risk from extreme weather is growing fast, threatening further price increases to already-inflated utility, housing, and insurance costs.

Nationwide, estimates peg the total climate and energy cuts at over $500 billion. These cuts would effectively gut the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed by Congress in 2022, which, combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, had already invested over $3.5 billion in Florida — with tens of billions more scheduled to come in the coming years. These programs — now at-risk — had just started to make investments designed to lower Floridians’ utility bills, improve resilience to flooding and extreme weather, and create more clean energy jobs. Should the reconciliation package go forward, tens of billions in federal investments and tax credits would be eliminated, driving up costs for individuals and businesses alike.

Here’s how the House and Senate proposals would impact Floridians:

1. Electricity prices would increase for Florida households and businesses, adding more price hikes to already-inflated utility bills.

Repealing the IRA clean energy tax credits would raise electricity prices by more than $110 per year for American households starting next year — and this is on top of significant rate hikes investor-owned utilities (IOUs) Tampa Electric Company (TECO), Florida Power & Light (FPL), and Duke Energy Florida have implemented since 2022.

Florida's IOUs provide electricity to 75 percent of Floridians. Since 2020, the three largest IOUs have increased utility rates by 43 to 74 percent. The House and Senate proposals would drive utility costs even higher. (See Figure 1 and Table 1.)

Imported natural gas, which supplies 78 percent of Florida’s energy market, has been the main driver of recent utility rate increases. From 2014 to 2020, natural gas prices were relatively stable; however, they spiked sharply in 2021 and 2022 and have remained volatile since. In response, average utility bills for investor-owned and municipal utilities surged in 2022 and 2023 and have remained elevated. The House and Senate proposals would eliminate the subsidies, credits, and investments aimed at transitioning Florida’s energy system away from costly imported gas toward more affordable, locally generated clean energy.

Florida’s solar production has skyrocketed in recent years, even as natural gas imports have grown, growing from less than 1 percent of Florida’s energy mix in 2017 to over 7 percent in 2025. Wind and solar are now the cheapest forms of energy to produce and the fastest-growing energy sources nationwide. Unfortunately, both the House and Senate proposals would gut tax credits that, for example, cover more than 30 percent of the cost for individuals, churches, schools, utilities, and other Florida entities to begin generating solar energy — tax credits that could insulate homes and communities from continued IOU rate increases. As a result of the cuts, Florida’s utilities sector alone could lose $29 billion in direct investment. The proposals would also eliminate dozens of grant programs aimed at lowering household energy costs and expanding rooftop solar in low-income communities — including programs that have already directed hundreds of millions of dollars to Florida utilities such as Seminole Electric Cooperative.

Duke Energy Florida reported in its recent rate case that it planned to use $50 million of federal clean energy tax credits to offset a rate increase in 2027, offering a clear demonstration of the way in which the credits would be passed along as cost savings to residents.

Finally, the state continues to sit on $346 million in IRA funds designated explicitly for low-income homeowners to address their growing energy burdens through energy efficiency upgrades. These funds would likely be returned to the federal government.

2. Schools would lose out on a significant opportunity to lower energy costs, exacerbating the school funding crisis.

‍The House and Senate bills would rescind unobligated funds from all new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs established under the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including unspent funds in the EPA Clean School Bus Program, which awarded 12 Florida school districts $106.1 million for new fleets of electric, air-conditioned school buses. Countless other districts utilized clean electricity tax credits to reduce their electricity bills, thereby driving cost savings back into the school district.

After the Senate released its bill, the Senate parliamentarian ruled these clawbacks in violation of the Byrd rule, potentially stymying efforts to claw back funding appropriated by the IRA. However, the Administration continues to sit on — and explore ways to eliminate — $3.3 billion in unspent funds from the Clean School Bus program.

Dixie County in North Central Florida received a fleet of 23 new electric school buses along with funding for a charging station. Not only were these buses funded by the federal government, but they also featured air conditioning, a feature that most diesel-powered school buses lack. Thirty-seven children, on average, die each year of vehicular heat stroke, and extreme heat also negatively impacts school engagement and achievement. Moreover, the school buses will also now power the cooling systems in recreational centers and storm shelters during power outages and hurricanes, which is particularly important in a county where three hurricanes have struck in less than two years.

Already reeling from a $4 billion shortfall due to the state’s voucher expansion, cash-strapped public schools, which rely on clean energy tax credits, clean school bus grants, and energy efficiency funding to lower energy costs — their largest expense after teacher salaries — would face significant economic setbacks under the House and Senate reconciliation bills.

3. Homeowners would lose $1 billion per year in rooftop solar and energy efficiency tax credits. Individuals and local governments would lose much-needed funding for storm resilience.

‍The House and Senate proposals would cut programs to protect coastal communities from extreme weather impacts, phase out energy efficiency and clean energy tax credits, and eliminate funding to restore urban tree canopies and implement nature-based solutions that insulate communities from hotter, wetter storms that have inundated Florida homes and communities in recent years — and driven up insurance rates.

Florida homeowners received just under $1 billion in clean energy, clean vehicle, and energy efficiency home improvement tax credits in 2023 (2024 data has not yet been made available by the IRS). These tax credits have been in place since 2005 when George W. Bush established the Residential Energy Efficient Property tax credit, and were expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act. These tax credits subsidize improvements that decrease utility (by improving efficiency and subsidizing rooftop solar) and insurance costs (by subsidizing the cost of more efficient coastal impact windows and other mitigation measures that can lower rates). The Senate proposal would eliminate the rooftop solar credit 180 days after the bill is enacted.

The proposed cuts by the House and Senate reconciliation bills would exacerbate recent federal funding cuts for disaster recovery and home repair, including $292 million in cuts this year to flood mitigation and storm resilience projects across the state. This includes $144 million for the South Florida Water Management District to address flooding challenges in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties.

To make matters worse for disaster-prone states like Florida, the Trump administration has announced plans to wind down the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) by the end of the year and cut the funding states rely on for disaster recovery. Since 2015, Florida has received $14.3 billion from FEMA—more than any other state. FEMA typically covers 75 percent of recovery costs when a federal disaster is declared. But that's only part of the support now at risk. FEMA also provides funding for mitigation and long-term recovery. For example, it allocated $400 million to the Elevate Florida program, which pays for 75 percent of the cost to raise homes in flood-prone areas that have sustained at least one loss covered by the National Flood Insurance Program. In addition, the state received $4.1 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Disaster Recovery program to address damage from the 2023 and 2024 storms, with about half of that amount dedicated to home repairs.

Other cuts in the House and Senate bills target the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Communities and Climate Resilience Program and the Department of Agriculture’s Urban and Community Forestry Program. Both of these programs are focused on making America’s communities more resilient to extreme weather. NOAA invested tens of millions in coastline projects to address flooding and hurricane risks, while the Urban Forestry Program invested millions in restoring urban tree canopies to address flooding and extreme heat.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5cd5801dfdf7e5927800fb7f/685ea06d6c113bfd48a2baaf_Power-lines.png,N,,2025-06-27 10:07:49.210356

Yet behind the glossy campaigns lies a complex reality: unresolved structural safety flaws, regulatory scrutiny over a fatal crash, and a troubling reliance on affiliate sales to prop up its financials. Investors eager to capitalize on the EV boom must weigh VinFast's growth potential against these risks, which could derail its U.S. ambitions.

The Emotional Edge: ""Cars as Family Members""

VinFast's marketing leans heavily on cultural narratives. Its U.S. campaigns emphasize Vietnamese heritage, innovation, and the idea that its EVs are ""more than machines""—they're companions for families. This approach resonates with consumers seeking authenticity in an oversaturated EV market dominated by Silicon Valley disruptors and Detroit stalwarts. The company's Super Bowl ad in 2024, depicting a Vietnamese-American family bonding in a VF8, was a masterclass in emotional branding.

But marketing magic alone cannot mask foundational risks.

Structural Safety Concerns: A Former Engineer's Whistleblow

The most pressing risk lies in VinFast's engineering integrity. Hazar Denli, a former Tata Technologies engineer who worked on VinFast's chassis designs, alleges critical flaws in the VF8 and VF9 models. He claims the front suspension components—specifically the strut-to-knuckle connection—are prone to loosening, risking wheel detachment during sudden maneuvers or pothole impacts. Even more alarmingly, he states these parts were designed to last just 15,000–25,000 miles, a fraction of the industry-standard 150,000-mile lifespan.

These concerns align with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) ongoing investigation into a fatal April 2024 VF8 crash in California. The probe, expanded in September 2024 to cover 3,118 vehicles, focuses on steering malfunctions and lane-keeping system failures. While VinFast insists its systems are safe, the NHTSA's findings—expected by late 2025—could validate Denli's claims, triggering costly recalls or lawsuits.

Regulatory Scrutiny: The VF8 Crash and Trust Deficit

The NHTSA's probe into the Pleasanton crash, which killed four people, is particularly damning. The complainant reported prior instances of the VF8's lane assist system veering the vehicle out of its lane—issues VinFast allegedly failed to address. Fire safety is also under the microscope: the crash vehicle caught fire post-collision, raising questions about battery integrity.

If the NHTSA concludes a safety defect exists, VinFast could face mandatory recalls, fines, or even a ban on imports—a nightmare scenario for a company already struggling to meet U.S. demand. The incident has also fueled calls for stricter oversight of foreign automakers, potentially slowing VinFast's expansion.

The Affiliate Sales Conundrum: Growth or Dependency?

VinFast's financial health hinges on its ability to shift from affiliate-driven sales to retail success. In 2023, a staggering 72% of its sales were to related entities, such as Green SM (GSM), a taxi firm 95% owned by VinFast's billionaire founder. This incestuous model inflated sales figures but masked weak retail demand. By late 2023, only 265 of 3,118 imported U.S. vehicles were registered by private buyers—a paltry 8%.

VinFast's plan to triple sales to 100,000 units by 2024 (from 35,000 in 2023) relies on its delayed North Carolina factory, now set to open in late 2025. Yet even if production ramps up, without genuine consumer traction, the company risks becoming a cautionary tale of overextension.

Investment Implications: A Risk-Adjusted Call

VinFast's U.S. strategy is a high-stakes bet. On one hand, the EV market's long-term growth is undeniable, and VinFast's price competitiveness ($30,000–$50,000 range) could attract budget-conscious buyers. Its partnership with Tata Group and plans for Asia-centric expansion also hint at global scale.

Yet the risks are existential. The NHTSA's findings, due by year-end, could expose VinFast to recalls that erode confidence. Its reliance on affiliates underscores a lack of organic demand, while delays in North Carolina threaten its cost structure. For now, investors should proceed with caution:

Wait for Regulatory Clarity: Hold off until the NHTSA concludes its probe. A clean bill of health could unlock value, but a defect finding could crater the stock.

Monitor Retail Adoption: Track U.S. registrations beyond affiliates. If sales to private buyers exceed 30% by late 2025, it signals progress.

Watch Liquidity Metrics: VinFast's cash reserves ($96.6 million as of Q1 2025) are thin against $6.3 billion in liabilities. A liquidity crunch could force more dilutive financing.

For aggressive investors willing to bet on EVs, VinFast offers upside—but only if it can transform its narrative from ""family car"" to ""trustworthy automaker."" Until then, this is a story of hope clashing with hard reality.",,N,,2025-06-27 12:27:39.821754

As it stands, the bill would terminate most clean energy tax credits long before their original phase-out date in 2032.

The tax credits, which include money back on electric cars, electric appliances, energy efficiency improvements, and more, have a lot of public support. In a December 2024 survey, researchers at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, the publisher of this site, found that 91% of liberal Democrats, 70% of moderate or conservative Democrats, 42% of liberal or moderate Republicans, and 28% of conservative Republicans support tax rebates for electric vehicles. A Yale Climate Connections analysis found that red states stood to benefit the most from the law’s incentives to individuals and businesses.

Some hoped that the Senate would save tax credits that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives proposed cutting in their version of the budget bill that passed in May, but that has not been the case for consumer tax credits for EVs or home improvements. That said, senators have not yet voted on the bill, and because the Senate made substantial changes, the bill will need to return to the House before heading to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. So there is still time for constituents to let members of Congress know their thoughts about the proposed legislation.

If the Senate version of the bill does become law as-is, the credits won’t expire immediately. For the most part, consumers will have 180 days to take advantage of the credits before they’re fully terminated.

Replace your combustion engine car with a new or used EV

As the bill currently exists in the Senate, EV tax credits would expire either 90 (for used cars) or 180 days (for new cars) after the bill becomes law. That means there’s still time to get up to $4,000 in the form of a tax credit for a used EV and $7,500 for a new one.

Read: Don’t get fooled: Electric vehicles really are better for the climate

The clean vehicle credit is worth $7,500 and applies to new vehicles that:

Are electric vehicles with batteries of at least seven kilowatt-hours or are hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

Cost less than $80,000 for vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks, or under $55,000 for all other vehicles

Completed assembly in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico.

Meet requirements related to where battery components are manufactured and the source of critical minerals used in the batteries.

To qualify for the tax credit, the adjusted gross income of the person or people purchasing the car must be under $300,000 if their tax status is married filing jointly, under $225,000 for head of household status, or under $150,000 for single or married filing separately status.

If you’re interested in buying a used car, similar restrictions apply — but with lower income and vehicle cost thresholds. Your adjusted gross income must be under $150,000 if your tax status is married filing jointly, or under $75,000 if your filing status is single or married filing separately.

For a vehicle to qualify for the credit for previously owned clean vehicles, it must also:

Meet the requirements for a clean vehicle used in the clean vehicle credit

Have a model year at least two years earlier than the date of sale

Weigh less than 14,000 pounds

Cost less than $25,000.

This credit is for either $4,000 or 30% of the cost of the vehicle, whichever is smaller.

If you own a business or nonprofit, you might also want to consider buying an EV for that organization. The commercial clean vehicles credit gives businesses and tax-exempt organizations (like churches, universities, and other nonprofits) money back for purchasing a qualified vehicle. Businesses can get a $7,500 credit for a small vehicle or up to $40,000 for a large vehicle like a school bus or semitruck.

Put an EV charging station in your home or small business

Currently, the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit allows individuals and businesses that install EV charging stations to get up to 30% (up to a maximum of $1,000 for individuals and $100,000 for businesses) off the cost of the project in the form of tax credits. The Senate bill would kill this credit, and if passed, the credit would end one year from the passage date.

Improve your home’s energy efficiency with new windows, insulation, and doors

Currently, the energy efficient home improvement credit gives homeowners who make qualifying purchases like energy efficient windows, home energy audits, heat pumps, and a tax credit worth 30% of the cost up to $1,200 for energy-efficient property costs and certain energy-efficient home improvements. The cap resets each year, which will be handy if the tax credit manages to survive into 2026. The bill would terminate the credits 180 days after the bill passes.

Energy audit

Home energy audits help you understand how much energy your home uses and improvements that can reduce that use. The energy-efficient home improvement tax credit will help cover the cost of home energy audits. The credit covers 30% of the cost of a home energy audit and is capped at $150.

“A home energy assessment should be your first step before making energy-saving home improvements, as well as before adding a renewable energy system to your home,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

New wiring

The tax credit also applies to rewiring if you have an older home that isn’t prepared to support new electric appliances. Contact a trusted electrician or contractor and tell them that you’re hoping to replace your gas furnace or other appliances with their electricity-based equivalents in the near future. Ask if those upgrades will require a new electric panel or wiring.

Improve insulation in your home

A well-insulated home stays warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. Improving your home’s insulation reduces your heating and cooling needs, potentially enabling you to purchase a smaller, cheaper rooftop solar system if you go that route.

New windows and exterior doors

With the tax credit, homeowners can get up to $250 back per exterior door ($500 total), and $600 total back for exterior windows and skylights.

Replace your furnace, AC, and water heater with a heat pump

Heat pumps can both cool and heat your home. In the summer, they pull heat from the air of your home and move it outside. In the winter, they pull heat from the outdoor air into your home to warm it. Heat pumps are more energy-efficient than conventional air conditioning or heating, and they run on electricity rather than natural gas or oil.

Homeowners can receive up to $2,000 per year for qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. This $2,000 is separate from the $1,200 cap on other home improvements.

Several different kinds of heat pumps are available, so work with your contractor or energy efficiency professionals to determine which type makes the most sense for your climate and living situation.

Get a renewable energy system to power your home

Not every home is suitable for a renewable energy system, but if your property can support one, the residential clean energy credit can help you pay for it — for now. Systems that qualify for the credit include:

Home solar

Qualified battery storage

Solar water heating

Fuel cells

Geothermal heat pumps

Small wind energy

The residential clean energy tax credit amount is 30% of the cost of a qualifying system, including installation. As written by the Senate, this credit would expire 180 days after the bill is passed.

Savings will ripple through energy bills

In order to get these tax credits before they’re terminated, consumers will have to pony up large amounts of money on short notice. But in addition to getting money back on taxes, more efficient homes and cars can lead to savings on energy bills. Congress’ budget reconciliation bill, as written, is predicted to increase energy costs as the once-booming renewable energy industry faces cancelled investments and projects. For consumers who can afford it, the next few months might just be the best time to make energy efficiency investments.

Measuring and Standardizing AI’s Energy and Environmental Footprint to Accurately Access Impacts

06.27.25 | 15 min read | Text by Mitul Jhaveri & Vijaykumar Palat

The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving a surge in data center energy consumption, water use, carbon emissions, and electronic waste—yet these environmental impacts, and how they will change in the future, remain largely opaque. Without standardized metrics and reporting, policymakers and grid operators cannot accurately track or manage AI’s growing resource footprint. Currently, companies often use outdated or narrow measures (like Power Usage Effectiveness, PUE) and purchase renewable credits to obscure true emissions. Their true carbon footprint may be as much as 662% higher than the figures they report. A single hyperscale AI data center can guzzle hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per day​ and contribute to a “mountain” of e-waste​, yet only about a quarter of data center operators even track what happens to retired hardware​.

This policy memo proposes a set of congressional and federal executive actions to establish comprehensive, standardized metrics for AI energy and environmental impacts across model training, inference, and data center infrastructure. We recommend that Congress directs the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to design, collect, monitor and disseminate uniform and timely data on AI’s energy footprint, while designating the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to coordinate a multi-agency council that coordinates implementation. Our plan of action outlines steps for developing metrics (led by DOE, NIST, and the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]), implementing data reporting (with the Energy Information Administration [EIA], National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA], and industry), and integrating these metrics into energy and grid planning (performed by DOE’s grid offices and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC]). By standardizing how we measure AI’s footprint, the U.S. can be better prepared for the growth in power consumption while maintaining its leadership in artificial intelligence.

Challenge and Opportunity

Inconsistent metrics and opaque reporting make future AI power‑demand estimates extremely uncertain, leaving grid planners in the dark and climate targets on the line.

AI’s Opaque Footprint

Generative AI and large-scale cloud computing are driving an unprecedented increase in energy demand. AI systems require tremendous amounts of computing power both during training (the AI development period) and inference (when AI is used in real world applications). The rapid rise of this new technology is already straining energy and environmental systems at an unprecedented scale. Data centers consumed an estimated 415 Terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2024 (roughly 1.5% of global power demand), and with AI adoption accelerating, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data center energy use could more than double to 945 TWh by 2030. This is an added load comparable to powering an entire country the size of Sweden or even Germany. There are a range of projections of AI’s energy consumption, with some estimates suggesting even more rapid growth than the IEA. Estimates suggest that much of this growth will be concentrated in the United States.

The large divergence in estimates for AI-driven electricity demand stem from the different assumptions and methods used in each study. One study uses one of the parameters like the AI Query volume (the number of requests made by users for AI answers), another tries to estimate energy demand from the estimated supply of AI related hardware. Some estimate the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of data center growth under different growth scenarios. Different authors make various assumptions about chip shipment growth, workload mix (training vs inference), efficiency gains, and per‑query energy. Amidst this fog of measurement confusion, energy suppliers are caught by surges in demand from new compute infrastructure on top of existing demands from sources like electric vehicles and manufacturing. Electricity grid operators in the United States typically plan for gradual increases in power demand that can be met with incremental generation and transmission upgrades. But if the rapid build-out of AI data centers, on top of other growing power demands, pushes global demand up by an additional hundreds of terawatt hours annually this will shatter the steady-growth assumption embedded in today’s models. Planners need far more granular, forward-looking forecasting methods to avoid driving up costs for rate-payers, last-minute scrambles to find power, and potential electricity reliability crises.

This surge in power demand also threatens to undermine climate progress. Many new AI data centers require 100–1000 megawatts (MW), equivalent to the demands of a medium-sized city, while grid operators are faced with connection lead times of over 2 years to connect to clean energy supplies. In response to these power bottlenecks some regional utilities, unable to supply enough clean electricity, have even resorted to restarting retired coal plants to meet data center loads, undermining local climate goals​ and efficient operation. Google’s carbon emissions rose 48% over the past five years and Microsoft’s by 23.4% since 2020, largely due to cloud computing and AI.

In spite of the risks to the climate, carbon emissions data is often obscured: firms often claim “carbon neutrality” via purchased clean power credits, while their actual local emissions go unreported. One analysis found Big Tech (Amazon, Meta) data centers may emit up to 662% more CO₂ than they publicly report​. For example, Meta’s 2022 data center operations reported only 273 metric tons CO₂ (using market-based accounting with credits), but over 3.8 million metric tons CO₂ when calculated by actual grid mix according to one analysis—a more than 19,000-fold increase​. Similarly, AI’s water impacts are largely hidden. Each interactive AI query (e.g. a short session with a language model) can indirectly consume half a liter of fresh water through data center cooling​, contributing to millions of gallons used by AI servers—but companies rarely disclose water usage per AI workload. This lack of transparency masks the true environmental cost of AI, hinders accountability, and impedes smart policymaking.

Outdated and Fragmented Metrics

Legacy measures like Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) miss what is important for AI compute efficiency, such as water consumption, hardware manufacturing, and e-waste.

The metrics currently used to gauge data center efficiency are insufficient for AI-era workloads. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), the two-decades-old standard, gives only a coarse snapshot of facility efficiency under ideal conditions​. PUE measures total power delivered to a datacenter versus how much of that power actually makes it to the IT equipment inside. The more power used (e.g. for cooling), the worse the PUE ratio will be. However, PUE does not measure how efficiently the IT equipment actually uses the power delivered to it. Think about a car that reports how much fuel reaches the engine but not the miles per gallon of that engine. You can ensure that the fuel doesn’t leak out of the line on its way to the engine, but that engine might not be running efficiently. A good PUE is the equivalent of saying that fuel isn’t leaking out on its way to the engine; it might tell you that a data center isn’t losing too much energy to cooling, but won’t flag inefficient IT equipment. An AI training cluster with a “good” PUE (around 1.1) could still be wasteful if the hardware or software is poorly optimized.

In the absence of updated standards, companies “report whatever they choose, however they choose” regarding AI’s environmental impact. Few report water usage or lifecycle emissions. Only 28% of operators track hardware beyond its use, and just 25% measure e-waste​, resulting in tons of servers and AI chips quietly ending up in landfills. This data gap leads to misaligned incentives—for instance, firms might build ever-larger models and data centers, chasing AI capabilities, without optimizing for energy or material efficiency because there is no requirement or benchmark to do so.

Opportunities for Action

Standardizing metrics for AI’s energy and environmental footprint presents a win-win opportunity. By measuring and disclosing AI’s true impacts, we can manage them. With better data, policymakers can incentivize efficiency innovations (from chip design to cooling to software optimization) and target grid investments where AI load is rising. Industry will benefit too: transparency can highlight inefficiencies (e.g. low server utilization or high water-cooled heat that could be recycled) and spur cost-saving improvements. Importantly, several efforts are already pointing the way. In early 2024, bicameral lawmakers introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act, aiming to have the EPA study AI’s environmental footprint and develop measurement standards and a voluntary reporting system via NIST. Internationally, the European Union’s upcoming AI Act will require large AI systems to report energy use, resource consumption, and other life cycle impacts​, and the ISO is preparing “sustainable AI” standards for energy, water, and materials accounting​. The U.S. can build on this momentum. A recent U.S. Executive Order (Jan 2025) already directed DOE to draft reporting requirements for AI data centers covering their entire lifecycle—from material extraction and component manufacturing to operation and retirement—including metrics for embodied carbon (greenhouse-gas emissions that are “baked into” the physical hardware and facilities before a single watt is consumed to run a model), water usage, and waste heat​. It also launched a DOE–EPA “Grand Challenge” to push the PUE ratio below 1.1 and minimize water usage in AI facilities​. These signals show that there is willingness to address the problem. Now is the time to implement a comprehensive framework that standardizes how we measure AI’s environmental impact. If we seize this opportunity, we can ensure innovation in AI is driven by clean energy, a smarter grid, and less environmental and economic burden on communities.

Plan of Action

To address this challenge, Congress should authorize DOE and NIST to lead an interagency working group and a consortium of public, private and academic communities to enact a phased plan to develop, implement, and operationalize standardized metrics, in close partnership with industry.

Recommendation 1. Identify and Assign Agency Mandates

Creating and Implementing this measurement framework requires concerted action by multiple federal agencies, each leveraging its mandate. The Department of Energy (DOE) should serve as the co-lead federal agency driving this initiative. Within DOE, the Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET) can coordinate AI-related efforts across DOE programs, given its focus on AI and advanced tech integration. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will also act as a co-lead for this initiative leading the metrics development and standardization effort as described, convening experts and industry. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) will act as the coordinating body for this multi-agency effort. OSTP, alongside the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), can ensure alignment with broader energy, environment, and technology policy. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take charge of environmental data collection and oversight. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) should play a supporting role by addressing grid and electricity market barriers. FERC should streamline interconnection processes for new data center loads, perhaps creating fast-track procedures for projects that commit to high efficiency and demand flexibility.

Congressional leadership and oversight will be key. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and House Energy & Commerce Committee (which oversee energy infrastructure and data center energy issues) should champion legislation and hold hearings on AI’s energy demands. The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and Senate Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee (which oversee NIST, and OSTP) should support R&D funding and standards efforts. Environmental committees (like Senate Environment and Public Works, House Natural Resources) should address water use and emissions. Ongoing committee oversight can ensure agencies stay on schedule and that recommendations turn into action (for example, requiring an EPA/DOE/NIST joint report to Congress within a set timeframe(s).

Congress should mandate a formal interagency task force or working group, co-led by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) serving as the coordinating body and involving all relevant federal agencies. This body will meet regularly to track progress, resolve overlaps or gaps, and issue public updates. By clearly delineating responsibilities, The federal government can address the measurement problem holistically.

Recommendation 2. Develop a Comprehensive AI Energy Lifecycle Measurement Framework

A complete view of AI’s environmental footprint requires metrics that span the full lifecycle, including every layer from chip to datacenter, workload drivers, and knock‑on effects like water use and electricity prices.

Create new standardized metrics that capture AI’s energy and environmental footprint across its entire lifecycle—training, inference, data center operations (cooling/power), and hardware manufacturing/disposal. This framework should be developed through a multi-stakeholder process led by NIST in partnership with DOE and EPA, and in consultation with industry, academia as well as state and local governments.

Key categories should include:

Data Center Efficiency Metrics: how effectively do data centers use power?

AI Hardware & Compute Metrics: e.g. Performance per Watt (PPW)—the throughput of AI computations per watt of power.

Cooling and Water Metrics: How much energy and water are being used to cool these systems?

Environmental Impact Metrics: What is the carbon intensity per AI task?

Composite or Lifecycle Metrics: Beyond a single point in time, what are the lifetime characteristics of impact for these systems?

Designing standardized metrics

NIST, with its measurement science expertise, should coordinate the development of these metrics in an open process, building on efforts like NIST’s AI Standards Working Group—a standing body chartered under the Interagency Committee on Standards Policy which brings together technical stakeholders to map the current AI-standards landscape, spot gaps, and coordinate U.S. positions and research priorities. The goal is to publish a standardized metrics framework and guidelines that industry can begin adopting voluntarily within 12 months. Where possible, leverage existing standards (for example, those from the Green Grid consortium on PUE and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), or IEEE/ISO standards for energy management) and tailor them to AI’s unique demands. Crucially, these metrics must be uniformly defined to enable apples-to-apples comparisons and periodically updated as technology evolves.

Review, Governance, and improving metrics

We recommend establishing a Metrics Review Committee (led by NIST with DOE/EPA and external experts) to refine the metrics whenever needed, host stakeholder workshops, and public updates. This continuous improvement process will keep the framework current with new AI model types, cooling tech, and hardware advances, ensuring relevance into the future. For example, when we move from the current model of chatbots responding to queries to agentic AI systems that plan, act, remember, and iterate autonomously, traditional “energy per query” metrics no longer capture the full picture.

Recommendation 3. Operationalize Data Collection, Reporting, Analysis and Integrate it into Policy

Start with a six‑month voluntary reporting program, and gradually move towards a mandatory reporting mechanism which feeds straight into EIA outlooks and FERC grid planning.

The task force should solicit inputs via a Request for Information (RFI) — similar to DOE’s recent RFI on AI infrastructure development​, asking data center operators, AI chip manufacturers, cloud providers, utilities, and environmental groups to weigh in on feasible reporting requirements and data sharing methods. Within 12 months of starting, this taskforce should complete (a) a draft AI energy lifecycle measurement framework (with standardized definitions for energy, water, carbon, and e-waste metrics across training and data center operations), and (b) an initial reporting template for technology companies, data centers and utilities to pilot.

With standardized metrics in hand, we must shift the focus to implementation and data collection at scale. In the beginning, a voluntary AI energy reporting program can be launched by DOE and EPA (with NIST overseeing the standards). This program would provide guidance to AI developers (e.g. major model-training companies), cloud service providers, and data center operators to report their metrics on an annual or quarterly basis.

After a trial run of the voluntary program, Congress should enact legislation to create a mandatory reporting regime that borrows the best features of existing federal disclosure programs. One useful template is EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which obliges any facility that emits more than 25,000 tons of CO₂ equivalent per year to file standardized, verifiable electronic reports. The same threshold logic could be adapted for data centers (e.g., those with more than 10 MW of IT load) and for AI developers that train models above a specified compute budget. A second model is DOE/EIA’s Form EIA-923 “Power Plant Operations Report,” whose structured monthly data flow straight into public statistics and planning models. An analogous “Form EIA-AI-01” could feed the Annual Energy Outlook and FERC reliability assessments without creating a new bureaucracy. EIA could also consider adding specific questions or categories in the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey and Form EIA-861 to identify energy use by data centers and large computing loads. This may involve coordinating with the Census Bureau to leverage industrial classification data (e.g., NAICS codes for data hosting facilities) so that baseline energy/water consumption of the “AI sector” is measured in national statistics. NTIA, which often convenes multi stakeholder processes on technology policy, can host industry roundtables to refine reporting processes and address any concerns (e.g. data confidentiality, trade secrets). NTIA can help ensure that reporting requirements are not overly burdensome to smaller AI startups by working out streamlined methods (perhaps aggregated reporting via cloud providers, for instance). DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (GDO) and Office of Electricity (OE), with better data, should start integrating AI load growth into grid planning models and funding decisions. For example, GDO could prioritize transmission projects that will deliver clean power to regions with clusters of AI data centers, based on EIA data showing rapid load increases. FERC, for its part, can use the reported data to update its reliability and resource adequacy guidelines and possibly issue guidance for regional grid operators (RTOs/ISOs) to explicitly account for projected large computing loads in their plans.

This transparency will let policymakers, researchers, and consumers track improvements (e.g., is the energy per AI training decreasing over time?) and identify leaders/laggards. It will also inform mid-course adjustments that if certain metrics prove too hard to collect or not meaningful, NIST can update the standards. The Census Bureau can contribute by testing the inclusion of questions on technology infrastructure in its Economic Census 2027 and annual surveys, ensuring that the economic data of the tech sector includes environmental parameters (for example, collecting data center utility expenditures, which correlate with energy use). Overall, this would establish an operational reporting system and start feeding the data into both policy and market decisions.

Through these recommendations, responsible offices have clear roles: DOE spearheads efficiency measures in data center initiatives; OE (Office of Electricity and GDO (Grid Deployment Office) use the data to guide grid improvements; NIST creates and maintains the measurement standards; EPA oversees environmental data and impact mitigation; EIA institutionalizes energy data collection and dissemination; FERC adapts regulatory frameworks for reliability and resource adequacy; OSTP coordinates the interagency strategy and keeps the effort a priority; NTIA works with industry to smooth data exchange and involve them; and Census Bureau integrates these metrics into broader economic data. See the table below.Meanwhile, non-governmental actors like utilities, AI companies, and data center operators must not only be data providers but partners. Utilities could use this data to plan investments and can share insights on demand response or energy sourcing; AI developers and data center firms will implement new metering and reporting practices internally, enabling them to compete on efficiency (similar to car companies competing on miles per gallon ratings). Together, these actions create a comprehensive approach: measuring AI’s footprint, managing its growth, and mitigating its environmental impacts through informed policy.

Conclusion

AI’s extraordinary capabilities should not come at the expense of our energy security or environmental sustainability. This memo outlines how we can effectively operationalize measuring AI’s environmental footprint by establishing standardized metrics and leveraging the strengths of multiple agencies to implement them. By doing so, we can address a critical governance gap: what isn’t measured cannot be effectively managed. Standard metrics and transparent reporting will enable AI’s growth while ensuring that data center expansion is met with commensurate increases in clean energy, grid upgrades, and efficiency gains.

The benefits of these actions are far-reaching. Policymakers will gain tools to balance AI innovation with energy and environment goals. For example, by being able to require improvements if an AI service is energy-inefficient, or to fast-track permits for a new data center that meets top sustainability standards. Communities will be better protected: with data in hand, we can avoid scenarios where a cluster of AI facilities suddenly strains a region’s power or water resources without local officials knowing in advance. Instead, requirements for reporting and coordination can channel resources (like new transmission lines or water recycling systems) to those communities ahead of time. The AI industry itself will benefit by building trust and reducing the risk of backlash or heavy-handed regulation; a clear, federal metrics framework provides predictability and a level playing field (everyone measures the same way), and it showcases responsible stewardship of technology. Moreover, emphasizing energy efficiency and resource reuse can reduce operating costs for AI companies in the long run, a crucial advantage as energy prices and supply chain concerns grow.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why do we need AI-specific environmental metrics? Don’t data centers already have efficiency standards?

While there are existing metrics like PUE for data centers, they don’t capture the full picture of AI’s impacts. Traditional metrics focus mainly on facility efficiency (power and cooling) and not on the computational intensity of AI workloads or the lifecycle impacts. AI operations involve unique factors—for example, training a large AI model can consume significant energy in a short time, and using that AI model continuously can draw power 24/7 across distributed locations. Current standards are outdated and inconsistent​: one data center might report a low PUE but could be using water recklessly or running hardware inefficiently. AI-specific metrics are needed to measure things like energy per training run, water per cooling unit, or carbon per compute task, which no standard reporting currently requires. In short, general data center standards weren’t designed for the scale and intensity of modern AI. By developing AI-specific metrics, we ensure that the unique resource demands of AI are monitored and optimized, rather than lost in aggregate averages. This helps pinpoint where AI can be made more efficient (e.g., via better algorithms or chips)—an opportunity not visible under generic metrics.

How will multiple agencies work together to implement these recommendations?

AI’s environmental footprint is a cross-cutting issue, touching on energy infrastructure, environmental impact, technological standards, and economic data. No single agency has the full expertise or jurisdiction to cover all aspects. Each agency will have clearly defined roles (as outlined in the Plan of Action). For instance, NIST develops the methodology, DOE/EPA collect and use the data, EIA disseminates it, and FERC/Congress use it to adjust policies. This collaborative approach prevents blind spots. A single-agency approach would likely miss critical elements (for instance, a purely DOE-led effort might not address e-waste or standardized methods, which NIST and EPA can). The good news is that frameworks for interagency cooperation already exist​, and this initiative aligns with broader administration priorities (clean energy, reliable grid, responsible AI). Thus, while it involves multiple agencies, OSTP and the White House will ensure everyone stays synchronized. The result will be a comprehensive policy that each agency helps implement according to its strength, rather than a piecemeal solution. See below:

Roles and Responsibilities to Measure AI’s Environmental Impact

Department of Energy (DOE): DOE should serve as the co-lead federal agency driving this initiative. Within DOE, the Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET) can coordinate AI-related efforts across DOE programs, given its focus on AI and advanced tech integration. DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) can lead on promoting energy-efficient data center technologies and practices (e.g. through R&D programs and partnerships), while the Office of Electricity (OE) and Grid Deployment Office address grid integration challenges (ensuring AI data centers have access to reliable clean power). DOE should also collaborate with utilities and FERC to plan for AI-driven electricity demand growth and to encourage demand-response or off-peak operation strategies for energy-hungry AI clusters.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): NIST will also act as a co-lead for this initiative leading the metrics development and standardization effort as described, convening experts and industry. NIST should revive or expand its AI Standards Coordination Working Group​ to focus on sustainability metrics, and ultimately publish technical standards or reference materials for measuring AI energy use, water use, and emissions. NIST is also suited to host stakeholder consortium on AI environmental impacts, working in tandem with EPA and DOE.

White House, including the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP): OSTP will act as the coordinating body for this multi-agency effort. OSTP, alongside the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), can ensure alignment with broader climate and tech policy (such as the U.S. Climate Strategy and AI initiatives). The Administration can also use the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer and OMB guidance to integrate AI energy metrics into federal sustainability requirements (for instance, updating OMB’s memos on data center optimization to include AI-specific measures​).

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): EPA should take charge of environmental data collection and oversight. In the near term, EPA (with DOE) would conduct the comprehensive study of AI’s environmental impacts, examining AI systems’ lifecycle emissions, water and e-waste. EPA’s expertise in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting will ensure metrics like carbon intensity are rigorously quantified (e.g. using location-based grid emissions factors rather than unreliable REC-based accounting).

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC): FERC plays a supporting role by addressing grid and electricity market barriers. FERC should streamline interconnection processes for new data center loads, perhaps creating fast-track procedures for projects that commit to high efficiency and demand flexibility. FERC can ensure that regional grid reliability assessments start accounting for projected AI/data center load growth using data​.

Congressional Committees: Congressional leadership and oversight will be key. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and House Energy & Commerce Committee (which oversee energy infrastructure and data center energy issues) should champion legislation and hold hearings on AI’s energy demands. The House Science, Space, and Technology Committee and Senate Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee (which oversee NIST and OSTP) should support R&D funding and standards efforts. Environmental committees (like Senate Environment and Public Works, House Natural Resources) should address water use and emissions. Ongoing committee oversight can ensure agencies stay on schedule and that recommendations turn into action (for example, requiring the EPA/DOE/NIST joint report to Congress in four years as the Act envisions​, and then moving on any further legislative needs).

What exactly will companies and utilities have to report?

The plan requires high-level, standardized data that balances transparency with practicality. Companies running AI operations (like cloud providers or big AI model developers) would report metrics such as: total electricity consumed for AI computations (annually), average efficiency metrics (e.g. PUE, Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE), and WUE for their facilities), water usage for cooling, and e-waste generated (amount of hardware decommissioned and how it was handled). These data points are typically already collected internally for cost and sustainability tracking but the difference is they would be reported in a consistent format and possibly to a central repository. For utilities, if involved, they might report aggregated data center load in their service territory or significant new interconnections for AI projects (much of this is already in utility planning documents). See below for examples.

Metrics to Illustrate the Types of Shared Information

Data Center Efficiency Metrics: Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) (refined for AI workloads), Data Center Infrastructure Efficiency (DCIE) which measures IT versus total facility power (the inverse of PUE), Energy Reuse Factor (ERF) to quantify how much waste heat is reused on-site, and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) to link energy use with carbon emissions (kg CO₂ per kWh). These give a holistic view of facility efficiency and carbon intensity, beyond just power usage​.

AI Hardware & Compute Metrics: Performance per Watt (PPW)—the throughput of AI computations (like FLOPS or inferences) per watt of power, which encourages energy-efficient model training and inference​. Compute Utilization—ensuring expensive AI accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) are well-utilized rather than idling (tracking average utilization rates). Training energy per model—total kWh or emissions per training run (possibly normalized by model size or training-hours). Inference efficiency—energy per 1000 queries or per inference for deployed models. Idle power draw—measure and minimize the energy hardware draws when not actively in use​.

Cooling and Water Metrics: Cooling Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER)—the output cooling power per watt of energy input, to gauge cooling system efficiency​. Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE)—liters of water used per kWh of IT compute, or simply total water used for cooling per year​. These help quantify and benchmark the significant water and electricity overhead for thermal management in AI data centers.

Environmental Impact Metrics: Carbon Intensity per AI Task—CO₂ emitted per training or per 1000 inferences, which could be aggregated to an organizational carbon footprint for AI operations​. Greenhouse Gas emissions per kWh—linking energy use to actual emissions based on grid mix or backup generation. Also, e-waste metrics—such as total hardware weight decommissioned annually, or a recycling ratio. For instance, tracking the tons of servers/chips retired and the fraction recycled versus landfilled can illuminate the life cycle impact​.

Composite or Lifecycle Metrics: Develop ways to combine these factors to rate overall sustainability of AI systems. For example, an “AI Sustainability Score” could incorporate energy efficiency, renewables use, cooling efficiency, and end-of-life recycling. Another idea is an “AI Energy Star” rating for AI hardware or cloud services that meet certain efficiency and transparency criteria, modeled after Energy Star appliance ratings.

Won’t this be a burden or risk revealing trade secrets?

No, the intention is not to force disaggregation down to proprietary details (e.g., exactly how a specific algorithm uses energy) but rather to get macro-level indicators. Regarding trade secrets or sensitive info, the data collected (energy, water, emissions) is not about revealing competitive algorithms or data, it’s about resource use. These are analogous to what many firms already publish in sustainability reports (power usage, carbon footprint), just more uniformly. There will be provisions to protect any sensitive facility-level data (e.g., EIA could aggregate or anonymize certain figures in public releases). The goal is transparency about environmental impact, not exposure of intellectual property.

How will these metrics and data actually be used by the government?

Once collected, the data will become a powerful tool for evidence-based policymaking and oversight. At the strategic level, DOE and the White House can track whether the AI sector is becoming more efficient or not—for instance, seeing trends in energy-per-AI-training decreasing (good) or total water use skyrocketing (a flag for action).

What are some examples?

Energy planning: EIA will incorporate the numbers into its models, which guide national energy policy and investment. If data shows that AI is driving, say, an extra 5% electricity demand growth in certain regions, DOE’s Grid Deployment Office and FERC can respond by facilitating grid expansions or reliability measures in those areas​.

Climate policy: EPA can use reported emissions data to update greenhouse gas inventories and identify if AI/data centers are becoming a significant source—if so, that could shape future climate regulations or programs (ensuring this sector contributes to emissions reduction goals).

Water resource management: If we see large water usage by AI in drought-prone areas, federal and state agencies can work on water recycling or alternative cooling initiatives.

Research and incentives: DOE’s R&D programs (through ARPA-E or National Labs) can target the pain points revealed—e.g., if e-waste volumes are high, fund research into longer-lasting hardware or recycling tech; if certain metrics like Energy Reuse Factor are low, push demonstration projects for waste heat reuse.

This could inform everything from ESG investment decisions to local permitting. For example, a company planning a new data center might be asked by local authorities, “What’s your expected PUE and water usage? The national average for AI data centers is X—will you do better?” In essence, the data ensures the government and public can hold the AI industry accountable for progress (or regress) on sustainability. By integrating these data into models and policies, the government can anticipate and avert problems (like grid strain or high emissions) before they grow, and steer the sector toward solutions.

The tech industry is global, so how will U.S. metrics align internationally?

AI services and data centers are worldwide, so consistency in how we measure impacts is important. The U.S. effort will be informed by and contribute to international standards. Notably, the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is already developing criteria for sustainable AI, including energy, raw materials, and water metrics across the AI lifecycle NIST, which often represents the U.S. in global standards bodies, is involved and will ensure that our metrics framework aligns with ISO’s emerging standards. Similarly, the EU’s AI Act also has requirements for reporting AI energy and resource use​. By moving early on our own metrics, the U.S. can actually help shape what those international norms look like, rather than react to them. This initiative will encourage U.S. agencies to engage in forums like the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) or bilateral tech dialogues to promote common sustainability reporting frameworks. In the end, aligning metrics internationally will create a more level playing field—ensuring that AI companies can’t simply shift operations to avoid transparency. If the U.S., EU, and others all require similar disclosures, it reinforces responsible practices everywhere.

What if these measures make AI development more expensive or slow down innovation?

Shining a light on energy and resource use can drive new innovation in efficiency. Initially, there may be modest costs—for example, installing better sub-meters in data centers or dedicating staff time to reporting. However, these costs are relatively small in context. Many leading companies already track these metrics internally for cost management and corporate sustainability goals. We are recommending formalizing and sharing that information. Over time, the data collected can reduce costs: companies will identify wasteful practices (maybe servers idling, or inefficient cooling during certain hours) and correct them, saving on electricity and water bills. There is also an economic opportunity in innovation: as efficiency becomes a competitive metric, we expect increased R&D into low-power AI algorithms, advanced cooling, and longer-life hardware. Those innovations can improve performance per dollar as well. Moreover, policy support can offset any burdens—for instance, the government can provide technical assistance or grants to smaller firms to help them improve energy monitoring. We should also note that unchecked resource usage carries its own risks to innovation: if AI’s growth starts causing blackouts or public backlash due to environmental damage, that would seriously hinder AI progress.

Veterans Power America aims to mobilize veterans to advocate for renewable-energy projects in their communities, and to communicate the benefits of renewable energy to their neighbors.

Lloyd knows that importance firsthand, having served nearly two decades as a military police officer. She says the culture of training and discipline in the military makes veterans an especially good fit for jobs in renewable energy.

“I feel that veterans could make a larger impact [than others] when telling this story about clean energy because they’ve experienced it,” Lloyd said. “Anyone who’s been downrange knows that the only reason why they were able to have power on their forward operating base was because of solar microgrid technology.”

Whisper Valley is a peek into what the future could look like.

The sweeping community in the Austin, Texas, suburb of Manor is filled with modern homes, small manicured lawns, quiet streets, and rooftops outfitted with solar panels. Hidden beneath it is a network of pipes and man-made reservoirs that heat and cool hundreds of households via geothermal technology — a source that currently provides less than 1% of the U.S. electrical demand.

When completed, Whisper Valley will consist of approximately 7,500 owner-occupied and rental homes and multifamily units ranging in price from $350,000 to $750,000; three schools; 2 million square feet of commercial space; and 700 acres of park and outdoor community spaces. Habitat for Humanity is set to build affordable housing, which will hook up to the geothermal network.

Zac Turov, business development manager for EcoSmart Solutions, which runs the community’s geothermal system, says savings on utility bills for residents here with geothermal-powered heat pumps that cool and heat buildings can run up to $2,000 a year — based on a third-party-verified Home Energy Rating System.

Michael Wilt has lived in the community for six years, moving into his three-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot house during the first phase of Whisper Valley’s development.

He says he’s never had utility costs higher than $70 during the summer months or $45 a month during the winter. That doesn’t count the $60 monthly fee he pays to EcoSmart in operation fees.

“It absolutely works better than the HVAC system I had in the house that I was renting before purchasing the house,” Wilt, 47, said.

“The geothermal system was definitely part of the appeal, but really it was kind of the entire ​‘agrihood’ feeling of the whole development,” he added, referring to places that are ​“intentional” about incorporating green infrastructure into the neighborhood and individual homes.

Developer Michael Thurman has built 30 of the more than 600 homes in this massive mixed-use development. And his company, Thurman Homes, is set to build up to 50 more.

The developer calls geothermal a commonsense way to preserve the planet by cutting the use of fossil fuels to power the homes and businesses here. Heating, cooling, and providing electricity to residential and commercial buildings accounts for about 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The community sits 15 miles northeast of Austin. It’s an area home to multiple tech companies, including Google, Tesla, Dell, Samsung, and Applied Materials.

But not all of the developers building in Whisper Valley tap into its geothermal system.

The reason, said Thurman, is money. It costs approximately $40,000 per home to install the heat pumps and hook up to the geothermal network.

“We can’t keep doing the same things,” Thurman said, referring to the imperative to cut greenhouse gas emissions. ​“This isn’t tough to do, but you have to have core values that make you want to do it.”

Geothermal is more expensive than other forms of renewable energy, including wind and solar, according to new estimates from the consulting firm Lazard.

“The goal is for all the developers who build here to use geothermal,” Turov said. ​“But it’s still a tough sale.”

Geothermal possible ​“almost anywhere”

Drilling advancements have expanded how and where geothermal technology can be used for heating and cooling individual buildings — and broader power generation.

“The thing is: It is hot everywhere underground,” said Drew Nelson, vice president of programs, policy, and strategy at the Houston-based, geothermal-focused nonprofit Project Innerspace. ​“Today, with the advances in modern drilling, we are now able to tap into that heat almost anywhere.”

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates there is enough next-generation geothermal potential to power the world 140 times over. And Nelson says the United States has the most potential to be a leader in the industry, with countries including China and India also having the resources to generate geothermal power.

“As more projects are implemented, costs will continue to come down,” Nelson said, noting the IEA analysis also predicts geothermal in coming years will be ​“competitive with solar and wind paired with battery storage.”

Geothermal: old technology with new interest

Using underground water reservoirs for heating and cooling or to generate electricity isn’t new. But until recently it was mostly confined to specific regions where it was easier to drill into hot water reservoirs — like in Iceland or California.

As of 2021, geothermal was concentrated in Western states, with California and Nevada accounting for more than 90% of the country’s geothermal power production, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Geothermal is one of the cleanest ways to produce electricity. And it is the only renewable energy technology that has largely stayed out of the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who has slashed federal support for renewable and clean energy, including wind and solar.

“One of the reasons President Trump really likes geothermal right now is that it’s all American,” said Bryant Jones, executive director of Geothermal Rising, a California-based nonprofit that advocates for the industry internationally. ​“It’s local. It’s a way to help rural America figure out their own economies as they transition from one technology to another.”

Geothermal tax credits — for both developers and for homeowners who install heat pumps — helped Whisper Valley thrive in its infancy.

However, industry insiders are ringing the alarms and pressuring the U.S. Congress to not eliminate clean energy tax credits and incentives included in former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. If those tax credits are phased out, insiders say it would cripple the industry before it has a chance to get on its feet.

While billions in federal funding for wind, solar, and other clean energy technology are on the chopping block, the budget bill mulled by Senate Republicans currently would retain tax credits for geothermal, nuclear, and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.

The U.S. Department of Energy did not respond to multiple requests for comment on whether it would continue to support geothermal through federal funding and tax incentives, as it did under the previous administration.

“We do need the tax credits for geothermal energy to be maintained,” Jones said. ​“Geothermal doesn’t have a technology problem, it has a policy problem. [It’s] been around for over 100 years, [but] it hasn’t had the policy support the way the oil and gas industry has, or the nuclear industry, and most recently, the solar and wind industry.”

People ​“obsessed” with geothermal

Traditionally, geothermal was limited to places with naturally occurring underground hot reservoirs, usually near tectonic plates or in volcanic areas.

But evolutions in geothermal have opened the door for developers to utilize oil and gas drilling technologies which help lower costs and allow them to create their own reservoirs almost anywhere. The models fall in two categories: enhanced geothermal systems, or EGS, and closed-loop geothermal systems like the one in Whisper Valley.

With EGS systems, developers create artificial underground reservoirs through hydraulic fracturing or ​“fracking,” and then inject water or other fluids into a well. The water is heated as it moves through hot rocks and is then pumped up into a separate production well to generate energy.

Closed-loop systems use an underground network of sealed wells where water or fluid is pumped and heated without ever coming in direct contact with rocks. It is then piped into the homes and buildings connected to the system. These systems also cool buildings by drawing out heat during warm weather.

“The more that people learn about geothermal,” Jones said, ​“the more obsessed they become.”

He says geothermal’s appeal includes a low carbon footprint, reliability, and established drilling technology pioneered by the oil and gas industry. Unlike batteries and wind power, geothermal does not rely on critical minerals whose supply can be disrupted by geopolitical events.

It’s also among the more expensive energy sources because it requires specialized drilling, installation equipment, and skilled workers trained to build it all. Supporters say the industry will continue to need federal tax credits and funding to grow, especially in communities where utility bills are already unaffordable.

While many geothermal units serve just a single household, systems that serve many buildings are more affordable.

“A way to address that is through thermal energy networks, or geothermal district networks,” Jones said, referring to connecting multiple homes and buildings, which means ​“the cost goes down for everybody.“

He cites Framingham, Massachusetts, where one utility, Eversource, is providing geothermal energy for roughly 140 residential and commercial customers in one neighborhood. After the two-year pilot project ends, customers can return to natural gas, also known as methane, or continue using geothermal, the company says.

“We are still collecting data as we enter the start of the cooling season, but over the winter we saw strong system performance even during the January and February cold snaps,” said Olessa Stepanova, spokesperson for Eversource.

Stepanova says the company expects to have insight into energy savings from the project within a year from when each customer is connected to the geothermal system. And the utility is in final negotiations with the DOE and state to expand the network.

“This would not only demonstrate the scalability of networked geothermal systems,” she added, ​“but also how they become more cost-effective as they are expanded.”

Federal funding sparks geothermal development

Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Office awarded a total of $37.7 million to five cities to install district-scale geothermal heating and cooling systems.

Ann Arbor, Michigan, was awarded the most money, $10 million, which the city is using to build and operate a community geothermal system. It is projected to provide heating and cooling to 262 homes, a local elementary school, and community center in the Bryant neighborhood. The predominantly minority, lower-income area seeks to become the most sustainable neighborhood in the United States.

“It’s a neighborhood that has been disinvested in, and as we were working on our climate goals to be carbon neutral, we wanted to do that in a just and equitable way,” said Missy Stults, director of the city’s Office of Sustainability and Innovations.

Stults says some households in the community shell out up to 30% of their income on utility bills.

“We started to think about what’s a sustainable source of heating that we could look at that helps maintain affordability for everyone [and] that’s clean,” Stults said. ​“And so geothermal was one thing that came up, and the residents were really interested in it.”

Stults says it’ll likely be a year before the city starts drilling — and that’s only if Congress or the Trump administration keeps the federal funding in place. The city has been ​“sort of treading water” since Trump announced freezes on various renewable energy program spending. As of June, Stults says the grant had not been terminated, but the funding still hadn’t been allocated to move their project forward.

For the three-bedroom,1,800-square-foot home he built in Whisper Valley, utility bills in June and August 2023 were $42.16 and $74.54, respectively. A home the same size he built using an HVAC system had bills in those same two months of $233 and $326, respectively.

Turov says some developers have opted to build homes in Whisper Valley that use traditional HVAC systems instead of geothermal.

“Developers are reluctant to innovate, usually because it costs more, even though there are great benefits from using the technology,” he said. ​“We might have to make it work without [federal] subsidies, which will be a challenge but could be good for the long-term viability of the technology in the United States.”

EcoSmart Solutions successfully lobbied Texas state lawmakers for changes in state law and initiatives that can help geothermal grow there — with or without federal subsidies. They include measures that cut drilling regulations for geothermal projects, allow such systems to be added to the electric grid and pave the way for financing through bonds and ​“special purpose” taxing districts.

Turov explains that such districts allow developers to install infrastructure such as lights, roads, and water systems, the cost of which is then repaid by owners on their property tax bills.

“I think right now, we’re in the first adopter stage,” Turov said. ​“And that’ll probably still be the case for the next few years. And then I think more and more people will adopt it.”

The Chamber of Congress sent a letter to lawmakers pushing them to make Trump’s signature tax cuts from his first term, many provisions of which are set to expire at the end of the year, permanent by passing Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” The group said making the tax cuts permanent will help grow the economy, increase wages and create more jobs.

“Now Congress has the opportunity to make these policies permanent as part of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act.’ Doing so would provide businesses the certainty and stability they need to make the long-term investments that drive growth, accelerate productivity, and increase prosperity across all segments of the economy,” a letter signed by dozens of businesses across the country says.

Progress on getting the bill to Trump’s desk stalled out this week when the Senate parliamentarian ruled one of its biggest cost-cutting provisions, putting a cap on health care provider taxes, that dictates what can be included in legislation being passed along party lines to avoid the Senate filibuster. The provision would cut hundreds of billions of dollars in federal Medicaid spending.

The loss of the cap puts Republican leadership in a challenging spot to find a new way to offset billions in lost savings to offset some of the costs of the massive tax cuts included in the bill.

Senators were expected to vote on a motion to advance the bill on Friday, which is now in question as leadership and budget Republicans search for new ways to save money.

The path forward in the House is also murky, as a variety of Republican lawmakers have objected to various provisions that Senate Republicans have changed after the House passed its version of the legislation earlier this summer. Senate Republicans are trying to draft a bill the House can pass and send to Trump without making any further changes.

But there is mounting resistance to some of the provisions of the Senate version along with its overall impact on the deficit.

The Senate bill is more expensive than the House version with the preservation of some Biden-era tax credits for clean energy and there are negotiations about how much to raise the limit on deductions of local and state taxes that is a priority to some blue-state Republicans in the House. House budget hawks have also questioned whether they would support the Senate version of the bill over concerns about its , which comes after they nearly tanked the legislation in May.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House-passed legislation would increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over 10 years. The Senate version would be more costly with changes to spending and cuts, along with provisions that have been ruled out by the parliamentarian.

Earlier this week, Trump told lawmakers to stay in session and skip the upcoming July 4 recess to finish the bill and get it to his desk.

“To my friends in the Senate, lock yourself in a room if you must, don’t go home, and GET THE DEAL DONE THIS WEEK. Work with the House so they can pick it up, and pass it, IMMEDIATELY. NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT’S DONE,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Trump has been working to rally support for the bill despite running into obstacles in both chambers. He hosted an event at the White House on Thursday with a group of American workers the administration says would benefit from the passage of the bill through provisions like ending taxes on tips and overtime.

At the event, he criticized Republican “grandstanders” who are standing in the way of implementing his agenda, a reference to holdouts in both chambers that have refused to support the legislation so far or threatened to withdraw it if certain provisions aren’t changed.

""I shouldn’t say this, but we don’t want to have grandstanders where one or two people raise their hand, ‘we’ll vote no.’ And they do it to grandstand,” he said. “Not good people. They know who I’m talking about. We don’t need grandstanders.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been having meetings and direct conversations with lawmakers to smooth out their concerns.

“I saw some senators rolling out of the Oval Office the other day, and the president remains on the phones talking to his friends in the Senate when necessary,” she said. “And when they call, he picks up the phone.”",https://abc45.com/resources/media2/16x9/5555/986/0x290/90/d5dbe45a-1a82-4793-90bb-76dfa40d6142-AP25175712654984.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 11:17:25.019011

Enphase is a market leader in solar microinverters, which convert DC electricity produced by solar panels into AC electricity that can be used by home appliances.

Enphase, like all other U.S.-related rooftop solar companies, has been decimated this year following the passage of the new budget bill by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives in May, which rapidly ended the rooftop solar credit.

However, it appears pushback from industry players on key senators may be having an effect as the Senate considers its version.

Senator Cramer: Rooftop solar tax credits being ""discussed""

This week, North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer told reporters that Senate Republicans are considering restoring the rooftop solar credit in the Senate's version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, or at least phasing out the credit more gradually. The rooftop credits were extended into the 2030s by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed under the Biden administration.

Back in May, the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill, which eliminated the 30% tax credit for rooftop solar buyers this year, as well as the credit for companies that lease solar panels to residential customers. The abrupt rescission of the tax break could have severe consequences for the rooftop solar industry. Every stock affiliated with the sector plunged after the bill was passed.

However, as the Senate considers its own version of the bill, Senator Cramer told reporters that the committee is making a slate of changes to the renewable energy tax credits, likely delaying their phaseout schedules and easing the burden on the industry. Cramer also noted specifically, ""lawmakers are also discussing changes for rooftop solar credits.""

Since the House version was just about the worst possible version of the bill for the rooftop solar industry, any ""changes"" are likely to be positive.

Speed Grid Connection Using ‘Smart AI Fast Lanes’ and Competitive Prizes

06.27.25 | 10 min read | Text by Costa Samaras

Innovation in artificial intelligence (AI) and computing capacity is essential for U.S. competitiveness and national security. However, AI data center electricity use is growing rapidly. Data centers already consume more than 4% of U.S. electricity annually and could rise to 6% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028. At the same time, electricity rates are rising for consumers across the country, with transmission and distribution infrastructure costs a major driver of these increases. For the first time in fifteen years, the U.S. is experiencing a meaningful increase in electricity demand. Electricity use from data centers already consumes more than 25% of electricity in Virginia, which leads the world in data center installations. Data center electricity load growth results in real economic and environmental impacts for local communities. It also represents a national policy trial on how the U.S. responds to rising power demand from the electrification of homes, transportation, and manufacturing– important technology transitions for cutting carbon emissions and air pollution.

Federal and state governments need to ensure that the development of new AI and data center infrastructure does not increase costs for consumers, impact the environment, and exacerbate existing inequalities. “Smart AI Fast Lanes” is a policy and infrastructure investment framework that ensures the U.S. leads the world in AI while building an electricity system that is clean, affordable, reliable, and equitable. Leveraging innovation prizes that pay for performance, coupled with public-private partnerships, data center providers can work with the Department of Energy, the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (FESI), the Department of Commerce, National Labs, state energy offices, utilities, and the Department of Defense to drive innovation to increase energy security while lowering costs.

Challenge and Opportunity

Targeted policies can ensure that the development of new AI and data center infrastructure does not increase costs for consumers, impact the environment, and exacerbate existing energy burdens. Allowing new clean power sources co-located or contracted with AI computing facilities to connect to the grid quickly, and then manage any infrastructure costs associated with that new interconnection, would accelerate the addition of new clean generation for AI while lowering electricity costs for homes and businesses.

One of the biggest bottlenecks in many regions of the U.S. in adding much-needed capacity to the electricity grid are the so-called “interconnection queues”. There are different regional requirements for power plants to complete (often, a number of studies on how a project affects grid infrastructure) before they are allowed to connect. Solar, wind, and battery projects represented 95% of the capacity waiting in interconnection queues in 2023. The operator of Texas’ power grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), uses a “connect and manage” interconnection process that results in faster interconnections of new energy supplies than the rest of the country. Instead of requiring each power plant to complete lengthy studies of needed system-wide infrastructure investments before connecting to the grid, the “connect and manage” approach in Texas gets power plants online quicker than a “studies first” approach. Texas manages any risks that arise using the power markets and system-wide planning efforts. The results are clear: the median time from an interconnection request to commercial operations in Texas was four years, compared to five years in New York and more than six and a half years in California.

“Smart AI Fast Lanes” expands the spirit of the Texas “connect and manage” approach nationwide for data centers and clean energy, and adds to it investment and innovation prizes to speed up the process, ensure grid reliability, and lower costs.

Data center providers would work with the Department of Energy, the Foundation for Energy Security and Innovation (FESI), the Department of Commerce, National Laboratories, state energy offices, utilities, and the Department of Defense to speed up interconnection queues, spur innovation in efficiency, and re-invest in infrastructure, to increase energy security and lower costs.

Why FESI Should Lead ‘Smart AI Fast Lanes’

With FESI managing this effort, the process can move faster than the government acting alone. FESI is an independent, non-profit, agency-related foundation that was created by Congress in the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to help the Department of Energy achieve its mission and accelerate “the development and commercialization of critical energy technologies, foster public-private partnerships, and provide additional resources to partners and communities across the country supporting solutions-driven research and innovation that strengthens America’s energy and national security goals”. Congress has created many other agency-related foundations, such as the Foundation for NIH, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and the National Park Foundation, which was created in 1935. These agency-related foundations have a demonstrated record of raising external funding to leverage federal resources and enabling efficient public-private partnerships. As a foundation supporting the mission of the Department of Energy, FESI has a unique opportunity to quickly respond to emergent priorities and create partnerships to help solve energy challenges.

As an independent organization, FESI can leverage the capabilities of the private sector, academia, philanthropies, and other organizations to enable collaboration with federal and state governments. FESI can also serve as an access point to opening up additional external investment, and shared risk structures and clear rules of engagement make emerging energy technologies more attractive to institutional capital. For example, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation awards grants that are matched with non-federal private, philanthropic, or local funding sources that multiply the impact of any federal investments. In addition, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has partnered with the Department of Defense and external funding sources to enhance coastal resilience near military installations. Both AI compute capabilities and energy resilience are of strategic importance to the Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and other agencies, and leveraging public-private partnerships is a key pathway to enhance capabilities and security. FESI leading a Smart AI Fast Lanes initiative could be a force multiplier to enable rapid deployment of clean AI compute capabilities that are good for communities, companies, and national security.

Use Prizes to Lessen Cost and Maximize Return

The Department of Energy has long used prize competitions to spur innovation and accelerate access to funding and resources. Prize competitions with focused objectives but unstructured pathways for success enables the private sector to compete and advance innovation without requiring a lot of federal capacity and involvement. Federal prize programs pay for performance and results, while also providing a mechanism to crowd in additional philanthropic and private sector investment. In the Smart AI Fast Lane framework, FESI could use prizes to support energy innovation from AI data centers while working with the Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) to enable a repeatable and scalable public private partnership program. These prizes would be structured so that there is a low administrative and operational effort required for FESI itself, with other groups such as American-Made, National Laboratories, or organizations like FAS, helping to provide technical expertise to review and administer prize applications. This can ensure quality while enabling scalable growth.

Plan of Action

Here’s how “Smart AI Fast Lanes” would work. For any proposed data center investment of more than 250 MW, companies could apply to work with FESI. Successful application would leverage public, private, and philanthropic funds and technical assistance. Projects would be required to increase clean energy supplies, achieve world-leading data center energy efficiency, invest in transmission and distribution infrastructure, and/or deploy virtual power plants for grid flexibility.

Recommendation 1. Use a “Smart AI Fast Lane” Connection Fee to Quickly Connect to the Grid, Further Incentivized by a “Bring Your Own Power” Prize

New large AI data center loads choosing the “Smart AI Fast Lane” would pay a fee to connect to the grid without first completing lengthy pre-connection cost studies. Those payments would go into a fund, managed and overseen by FESI, that would be used to cover any infrastructure costs incurred by regional grids for the first three years after project completion. The fee could be a flat fee based on data center size, or structured as an auction, enabling the data centers bidding the highest in a region to be at the front of the line. This enables the market to incentivize the highest priority additions. Alternatively, large load projects could choose to do the studies first and remain in the regular – and likely slower – interconnection queue to avoid the fee.

In addition, FESI could facilitate a “Bring Your Own Power” prize award that is a combination of public, private, and philanthropic funds that data center developers can match to contract for new, additional zero-emission electricity generated locally that covers twice as much as the data center uses annually. For data centers committing to this “Smart AI Fast Lane” process, both the data center and the clean energy supply would receive accelerated priority in the interconnection queue and technical assistance from National Laboratories. This leverages economies of scale for projects, lowers the cost of locally-generated clean electricity, and gets clean energy connected to the grid quicker. Prize resources would support a “connect and manage” interconnection approach to cover 75% of the costs of any required infrastructure for local clean power projects resulting from the project. FESI prize resources could further supplement these payments to upgrade electrical infrastructure in areas of national need for new electricity supplies to maintain electricity reliability. These include areas assessed by the North American Reliability Corporation to have a high risk of an electricity shortfall in the coming years, such as the Upper Midwest or Gulf Coast, or areas with an elevated risk such as California, the Great Plains, Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, or the Northeast.

Recommendation 2. Create an Efficiency Prize To Establish World-Leading Energy and Water Efficiency at AI Data Centers

Data centers have different design configurations that affect how much energy and water are needed to operate. Data centers use electricity for computing, but also for the cooling systems needed for computing equipment, and there are innovation opportunities to increase the efficiency of both. One historical measure of AI data center energy efficiency is Power Use Effectiveness (PUE), which is the total facility annual energy use, divided by the computing equipment annual energy use, with values closer to 1.0 being more efficient. Similarly, Water Use Effectiveness (WUE) is measured as total annual water use divided by the computing equipment annual energy use, with closer to zero being more efficient. We should continue to push for improvement in PUE and WUE, but these are incomplete current metrics to drive deep innovation because they do nor reflect how much computing power is provided and do not assess impacts in the broader infrastructure energy system. While there have been multiple different metrics for data center energy efficiency proposed over the past several years, what is important for innovation is to improve the efficiency of how much AI computing work we get for the amount of energy and water used. Just like efficiency in a car is measured in miles per gallon (MPG), we need to measure the “MPG” of how AI data centers perform work and then create incentives and competition for continuous improvements. There could be different metrics for different types of AI training and inference workloads, but a starting point could be the tokens per kilowatt-hour of electricity used. A token is a word or portion of a word that AI foundation models use for analysis. Another way could be to measure the efficiency of computing performance, or FLOPS, per kilowatt-hour. The more analysis an AI model or data center can perform using the same amount of energy, the more energy efficient it is.

FESI could deploy sliding scale innovation prizes based on data center size for new facilities that demonstrate leading edge AI data center MPG. These could be based on efficiency targets for tokens per kilowatt-hour, FLOPS per kilowatt-hour, top-performing PUE, or other metrics of energy efficiency. Similar prizes could be provided for water use efficiency, within different classes of cooling technologies that exceed best-in-class performance. These prizes could be modeled after the USDA’s agency-related foundation’s FFAR Egg-Tech Prize, which was a program that was easy to administer and has had great success. A secondary benefit of an efficiency innovation prize is continuous competition for improvement, and open information about best-in-class data center facilities.

Recommendation 3. Create Prizes to Maximize Transmission Throughput and Upgrade Grid Infrastructure

FESI could award prizes for rapid deployment of reconductoring, new transmission, or grid enhancing technologies to increase the transmission capacity for any project in DOE’s Coordinated Interagency Authorizations and Permit Program. Similarly, FESI could award prizes for utilities to upgrade local distribution infrastructure beyond the direct needs for the project to reduce future electricity rate cases, which will keep electricity costs affordable for residential customers. The Department of Energy already has authority to finance up to $2.5 billion in the Transmission Facilitation Program, a revolving fund administered by the Grid Deployment Office (GDO) that helps support transmission infrastructure. These funds could be used for public-private partnerships in a national interest electric transmission corridor and necessary to accommodate an increase in electricity demand across more than one state or transmission planning region.

Recommendation 4. Develop Prizes That Reward Flexibility and End-Use Efficiency Investments

Flexibility in how and when data centers use electricity can meaningfully reduce the stress on the grid. FESI should award prizes to data centers that demonstrate best-in-class flexibility through smart controls and operational improvements. Prizes could also be awarded to utilities hosting data centers that reduce summer and winter peak loads in the local service territory. Prizes for utilities that meet home weatherization targets and deploy virtual power plants could help reduce costs and grid stress in local communities hosting AI data centers.

Conclusion

The U.S. is facing the risk of electricity demand outstripping supplies in many parts of the country, which would be severely detrimental to people’s lives, to the economy, to the environment, and to national security. “Smart AI Fast Lanes” is a policy and investment framework that can rapidly increase clean energy supply, infrastructure, and demand management capabilities.

It is imperative that the U.S. addresses the growing demand from AI and data centers, so that the U.S. remains on the cutting edge of innovation in this important sector. How the U.S. approaches and solves the challenge of new demand from AI, is a broader test on how the country prepares its infrastructure for increased electrification of vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, as well as how the country addresses both carbon pollution and the impacts from climate change. The “Smart AI Fast Lanes” framework and FESI-run prizes will enable U.S. competitiveness in AI, keep energy costs affordable, reduce pollution, and prepare the country for new opportunities.

By repurposing still-functional batteries, Redwood’s new division, Redwood Energy, is creating modular energy storage systems that address critical energy grid gaps at a fraction of the cost of new projects, according to The Verge.

Repurposing EV Batteries for a Sustainable Future

Redwood processes over 20 gigawatt-hours of batteries annually—equivalent to 250,000 EVs—representing about 90% of North America’s recycled lithium-ion batteries. Many of these batteries, though unsuitable for EVs, retain up to 50% of their energy capacity. Instead of recycling them, Redwood’s engineers run diagnostics to identify reusable packs, which are then integrated into flexible, modular storage systems. These systems can operate independently or connect to the grid, offering a sustainable solution as more EVs retire. The company estimates over 100,000 EVs will exit roads in 2025, with reusable battery capacity growing by 5 gigawatt-hours next year.

First Major Deployment Powers AI Data Center

Redwood has deployed its first microgrid at its Nevada campus, a 12-megawatt system with 63 megawatt-hours of capacity, powering a 2,000-GPU data center for Crusoe, an AI infrastructure company. Described as the “largest second-life battery deployment in the world,” it can store enough energy to power 9,000 homes, support 20 Amtrak trips between New York and Washington, D.C., or charge an EV for a 240,000-mile journey—roughly the distance to the moon. With over 1 gigawatt-hour of reusable batteries in its pipeline, Redwood is scaling up to meet rising demand.

Economic and Operational Benefits

By repurposing batteries, Redwood offers storage systems that cost “substantially less” than new projects, making renewable energy more accessible. These microgrids provide reliable power for applications like data centers, homes, or transportation infrastructure, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Operationally, the modular design allows for easy scaling and integration, supporting both off-grid and grid-connected setups. This innovation aligns with growing industry trends toward circular economies, where materials are reused to minimize waste and environmental impact.

Regulatory and Industry Implications

As EV adoption accelerates, regulatory frameworks are evolving to manage battery disposal and recycling. Redwood’s approach supports compliance with emerging standards by diverting functional batteries from landfills. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla technologist JB Straubel, already recycles batteries from major players like Ford, Toyota, and Nissan, and produces battery components in South Carolina. This positions Redwood as a key player in the EV ecosystem, driving sustainability and cost efficiency.

Redwood’s initiative marks a significant step in addressing the growing challenge of EV battery waste while providing practical energy solutions. As the company expands its microgrid deployments, it could reshape how the industry views battery lifecycles, turning retired EV batteries into valuable assets for a cleaner energy future.

“Leftist policies that attempted to gut our grid’s reliance on fossil fuels and convert to renewables have pushed America’s electric grid to the brink.
“This derisking compensation fund will make it harder for federal policies to discourage and phase out these reliable energy sources.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – The following op-ed by Congressman Morgan Griffith (VA-09), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment, appeared in the Washington Examiner this week.

“The intense heat wave battering the United States pushes America’s electric grid to the brink and could lead to power outages. But House Republicans offer a policy change that bolsters the grid and helps protect the public from blackout threats.

“Communities across much of the country face scorching temperatures, prompting power companies to take notice and act accordingly.

“In my part of Virginia, local power companies affiliated with the Tennessee Valley Authority are encouraging their customers to reduce electricity use. This request appears to be based on an announcement from the TVA.

“Alerts of possible breaking points in America’s electric grid are not unique to the TVA and are, unfortunately, becoming more and more frequent.

“The Friday before Memorial Day, Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order directing the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the Midwest grid operator, to keep a coal-fired power plant in Michigan in operation. These emergency actions are authorized for up to 90 days at a time under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

“Wright issued the order to minimize the risk of blackouts ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.

“MISO runs north to south from Manitoba and Michigan down to Louisiana and a portion of East Texas.

“Notwithstanding keeping the plant in Michigan open, the New Orleans metro area suffered a large and unexpected power outage during Memorial Day weekend. At the blackout’s peak, more than 100,000 customers lost electricity.

“Utilities knew high demand was likely that weekend, but they had no extra power capacity. When one plant went down, their customers were plunged into darkness.

“Reports confirmed that two of the region’s nuclear power plants lost connection to the grid. One was due to expected maintenance, while the other was unexpected. Constrained by a lack of energy supply, grid operators cut power to customers in New Orleans.

“Entergy, an electric utility company in the region, said that the forced outages directed by MISO were done to prevent a larger-scale and more prolonged power outage from affecting the electric grid.

“This blackout was not the only major power outage in recent memory.

“On April 28, Portugal and Spain witnessed the worst blackout in their history, affecting 55 million people, per the Guardian.

“Airports shut down, cars drove on streets without traffic lights, hospitals resorted to backup generators, and some people were stuck in elevators.

“The Iberian Peninsula blackout continues to be investigated. Lots of finger-pointing is going on between Spain’s grid operator, the government, and plant operators. But it is interesting to note that on April 16, Spain reported its first weekday when its national power grid was 100% reliant on renewable power.

“A coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.

“Coincidentally, in a recent Virginia Tech press release, professor and Power and Energy Center Director Ali Mehrizi-Sani highlighted how the systems that control these clean energy sources are more susceptible to blackouts.

“As parts of the world transition to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, the lack of seamless grid adaptation to the use of these sources, as illustrated by the blackouts in Spain and Portugal and by experts like Mehrizi-Sani, threatens the destabilization of electric grids and could lead to more blackouts.

“Leftist policies that attempted to gut our grid’s reliance on fossil fuels and convert to renewables have pushed America’s electric grid to the brink.

“Federal policies, like the Obama-era ‘War on Coal’ and the Biden administration’s so-called Inflation Reduction Act, shunning reliable baseload forms of energy like coal and natural gas have made our electric grid more vulnerable to failure.

“But House Republicans offer a policy change that levels the playing field and openly welcomes baseload power.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtails some Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, which disincentivize coal and natural gas power plants. We maintain the incentives for nuclear because of its significant potential for baseload power.

“The bill also creates an energy project insurance pool to help protect energy investors from permits being revoked for coal, oil, critical minerals, natural gas, or nuclear installations.

“This derisking compensation fund will make it harder for federal policies to discourage and phase out these reliable energy sources.

“As extreme summer heat continues to pose the threat of power outages, we must secure and equip our electric grid with reliable energy solutions.

“We do not need to follow in Spain’s footsteps and make Iberian Peninsula-style blackouts the norm.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act helps the public avoid blackout threats by instituting reliable forms of baseload power.”

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-06-27 13:22:36+00:00,Canada's National Observer,Louisiana is latest state to redefine natural gas — a GHG-producing fossil fuel — as green energy,"Jack Brook, Jennifer Mcdermott",,,,,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/06/27/news/louisiana-latest-state-redefine-natural-gas-ghg-producing-fossil-fuel-green-energy,"Louisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy under a new law the Republican governor signed this week, even though it's a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.
It's unclear to what extent Louisiana's utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy.","Louisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy under a new law the Republican governor signed this week, even though it's a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Three other states led by Republicans— Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee— have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.

President Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state's petrochemical industry, says the new law “sets the tone for the future” and will help the state “pursue energy independence and dominance.”

Environmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It's ""pure Orwellian greenwashing,” said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.

Globally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute — solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana's law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.

Natural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.

Switching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

Besides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.

Redefining natural gas

Louisiana’s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to “prioritize” natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state's electricity.

The law’s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.

“I don’t think it’s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don’t blow all the time and the sun don’t shine every day,” Landry said. The legislation “is saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,” he added.

Landry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry’s billionaire Koch family.

ALEC helped shape Ohio’s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post.

ALEC spokesperson Lars Dalseide said that just because an Ohio lawmaker left the 2022 ALEC convention with what he described as a model for legislation to define natural gas as clean energy does not mean the group shaped Ohio law. Dalseide said the convention is “a place where legislators from across the country gather to exchange ideas.”

Ohio's legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.

According to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.

“The goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities' ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,” Anderson said, adding that ALEC's legislation makes natural gas “eligible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.”

Questions over grid reliability

Gov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s grid is already powered by natural gas.

Landry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state's electric grid. He highlighted Meta's plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.

Louisiana’s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the US does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.

Consumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.

Legally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is “blind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,” Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana's law.

It's unclear to what extent Louisiana's utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law “unenforceable” and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas “aligns well” with the state's economic growth.

The project is also a centerpiece of the state’s long-term energy strategy, combining environmental stewardship with economic growth.
“This restart will safely take advantage of existing infrastructure while creating thousands of energy jobs and strengthening Pennsylvania’s legacy as a national energy leader,” said Gov.
“The U.S. nuclear industry is uniquely positioned to meet the rising demand for clean, reliable, and affordable energy.
The Crane Clean Energy Center is a powerful example of how our industry is rising to the challenge.”","Pennsylvania’s future as a clean energy and economic powerhouse took a major step forward this week as more than 400 workers and local leaders gathered Wednesday to celebrate the restart of the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), the Middletown, Pa., nuclear power plant formerly known as Three Mile Island, Unit 1.

Plant operator Constellation Energy Corp. said the plant’s restart could come as early as 2027, with the approval of an early interconnection request by grid operator PJM Interconnection and significant progress made on hiring, reactor operator training, and major equipment purchases.

Revival of the plant is expected to deliver thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in economic growth, and reliable, emissions-free power to the commonwealth. The project is also a centerpiece of the state’s long-term energy strategy, combining environmental stewardship with economic growth.

“This restart will safely take advantage of existing infrastructure while creating thousands of energy jobs and strengthening Pennsylvania’s legacy as a national energy leader,” said Gov. Josh Shapiro during the June 25 event. “My proposed energy plan would spark the next generation of energy production here in Pennsylvania, and projects like this are going to help us continue to create energy jobs and build a more reliable, affordable energy grid.”

Constellation’s $1.6 billion investment to bring the retired nuclear facility back online is projected to generate 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, add $16 billion to Pennsylvania’s GDP, and contribute more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

“Today we begin a new chapter for reliable, emissions-free nuclear energy, returning thousands of good jobs and billions in economic opportunities for Pennsylvania families and businesses,” said Joe Dominguez, Constellation president and CEO. “With PJM’s action, Microsoft’s historic investment, and strong support from Gov. Shapiro, elected officials, and members of this community, we’re on track to make history ahead of schedule, helping America achieve energy independence, supercharge economic growth, and win the global AI race.”

The CCEC site is already more than 64-percent staffed, with nearly 400 full-time employees and dozens more hires on the way. Local contractors, electricians, rigging experts, and construction workers are on site working in plant renovations, including upgrades to training facilities, turbines, and generators.

“Crane is a huge shot in the arm for the 130,000 building and construction trades workers I am privileged to represent in Pennsylvania,” said Rob Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council. “This plant will give our workers the best opportunity to truly have a middle-class living, making good money with great benefits — something they can all be proud of.”

Shapiro said his administration has worked closely with Constellation and PJM Interconnection — the regional grid operator — to fast-track approvals, including a critical early interconnection request that clears the way for a 2027 restart.

Microsoft’s partnership with Constellation will also add more momentum to restart by helping to ensure that the carbon-free electricity from CCEC will support the state’s grid reliability while meeting growing demand for clean energy from tech and manufacturing sectors.

“As Microsoft continues its path to become a carbon negative company, this agreement brings a significant supply of new, reliable, carbon-free electricity back to the PJM power grid,” said Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy at Microsoft. “This will help address the grids’ capacity and reliability needs in the regions we operate.”

Constellation said it has also pledged $1 million in community support over five years, with donations already reaching $185,000 this year.

Most recently, the company announced Tuesday new contributions of $25,000 to the Lower Dauphin Bookmobile and $20,000 to Veterans Outreach of Pennsylvania, said Constellation.

“An active plant helps our entire region thrive,” said Anna Dale, Londonderry Township Supervisor. “Constellation has been a strong community partner, and this restart will lift local businesses, emergency services, and families across the area.”

Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said the center’s restart is a national model for how Pennsylvania can lead the transition to clean, reliable power without leaving workers or communities behind.

“We congratulate Constellation, Microsoft, and the state of Pennsylvania for doing something that seemed impossible just a few years ago: restarting a shuttered nuclear plant,” Korsnick said during the event. “The U.S. nuclear industry is uniquely positioned to meet the rising demand for clean, reliable, and affordable energy. The Crane Clean Energy Center is a powerful example of how our industry is rising to the challenge.”",https://pennbizreport.com/favico.ico?v=1751033116,N,,2025-06-27 10:06:37.547644

The commission had previously launched the Clean Industrial Deal plan in February 2025 aiming to support clean technology manufacturing with €100 billion (see EU: Over €100 Billion For Clean Manufacturing Under Clean Industrial Deal).
Member States may offer equity, loans, or guarantees to attract private investment in clean energy and infrastructure projects.
Having been implemented on June 25, 2025, the new framework CISAF will remain in place until December 31, 2030 to ensure investors get a long-term predictability.
Hemetsberger explained, “The option to temporarily support electricity costs of existing heavy industries is not evidently available for new solar manufacturing projects.","The European Commission has adopted the new Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF) which empowers member states to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy projects across the European Union (EU).

The CISAF replaces the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) that has been in place since 2022 that was aimed at supporting bloc members to invest in key sectors in view of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The commission had previously launched the Clean Industrial Deal plan in February 2025 aiming to support clean technology manufacturing with €100 billion (see EU: Over €100 Billion For Clean Manufacturing Under Clean Industrial Deal).

Member states, under the CISAF, will be able to grant support to fast-track renewable energy and low-carbon fuel projects by simplification of procedures, especially to support transition for companies in hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

They will also get additional tools to integrate intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar into their energy supply. Additionally, member states will be able to support investments in new manufacturing capacity for net-zero technologies and those covered by the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) to prevent such investments from leaving the EU.

State aid will be capped at €200 million for every selected project. Member States may offer equity, loans, or guarantees to attract private investment in clean energy and infrastructure projects.

Having been implemented on June 25, 2025, the new framework CISAF will remain in place until December 31, 2030 to ensure investors get a long-term predictability.

“The new framework simplifies and speeds up support for decarbonisation, but it goes further: it recognises the state as a strategic investor in our future. It’s a tool to drive climate ambition, strengthen Europe’s resilience, and ensure our industry remains globally competitive,” said Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, Teresa Ribera.

European solar PV lobby association SolarPower Europe (SPE) welcomed the new framework calling it a watershed moment for the European industry in its efforts to compete globally and decarbonize.

“For the first time, EU governments can support the electricity costs for their nations’ heavy industry. If applied properly, the new rules will help more European businesses to access the competitive and climate advantages of solar-based electrification,” said SPE CEO Walburga Hemetsberger.

Yet, she rued the fact that there is not much for solar manufacturers in the new rules. Hemetsberger explained, “The option to temporarily support electricity costs of existing heavy industries is not evidently available for new solar manufacturing projects. We call on the European Commission to turn to the EU budget and swiftly set up a Clean Tech Manufacturing Bank, including a dedicated Solar Manufacturing Facility, that rewards projects with production-linked aid, covering opex costs for new factories.”",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-06-27%2Frjmo4l8r%2FEuropean-Commission-ST.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-27 13:15:03.651511

Blue states that are deliberately putting more clean energy onto their grids would still see prices rise over the coming decade, albeit far less, Orvis said. They are more immune to price shocks because they won’t be as heavily reliant on gas and coal.

“You’re moving from not using a lot of fossil fuels to using a lot of fossil fuels. That makes the price go up a lot,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.

Energy analysts expect the cost of natural gas and the cost of building new gas-powered plants will increase, and with it, consumer energy bills.

“Everybody’s electricity prices are going to go up,” said Rich Powell, CEO of trade group the Clean Energy Buyers Association. “I think people have in their minds that gas is a cheap way to generate power. New build natural gas is not a cheap way to generate electricity.”

Powell’s group was not involved in the Energy Innovation analysis, but has produced their own analysis with NERA Economic Consulting, also finding repealing the tax credits would raise household energy costs.

Powell added it’s an especially bad time for solar and wind tax credits to go away because there is simply more demand for electricity, with data centers and electrification of homes and vehicles. Since 2022, retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation, according to the US Energy Information Administration, which predicts they will continue to rise through next year. US natural gas prices have also gone up, and the EIA predicts they will continue to do so next year.

On the transportation side of things, the Energy Innovation model predicts that without a $7,500 consumer tax credit to help defray the cost of electric vehicles, more people will continue to drive gas powered cars.

“That increases the spending a lot, plus that gasoline is actually a little bit more expensive because there’s so much more demand for it,” Orvis said.

Red states will see the biggest price hikes. Oklahoma, for instance, is already a wind powerhouse, with wind generating close to 44% of the state’s electricity. With the energy tax incentives, the state was set to see another huge spike in wind development that could make the state’s electricity generation carbon-free, the Energy Innovation modeling found.

With the energy tax credits staying intact, Oklahoma would become “a major exporter of electricity, because there’s so much wind being deployed,” Orvis said. “The loss of the tax credits means a lot less wind gets deployed, and that’s replaced with in-state fossil resources.”

It’s a similar story in South Carolina, the state that’s expected to see the biggest spike in annual energy costs if the bill goes away. The state generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear, with natural gas supplying much of the remainder. Orvis said South Carolina stood to add a lot of solar to its electrical grid with tax incentives but would have to revert back to gas once those credits go away.

“You’re going from gas setting that price to renewables, and when you undo the tax credits, you see it reverting back to gas,” Orvis said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/energy-costs-hp-20250627113208604.png?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-06-27 12:23:48.832359

By taking into account the combined burdens, a cumulative impacts ordinance requires local governments to take into account the existing environmental threats on communities before permitting new major industrial operations or developments.
Implementing cumulative impacts ordinances is, of course, not without its challenges.
Local governments must confront deeply rooted practices that prioritize industrial interests over community health.
In this era of unstable federal protections, local governments must lead the way.","As the Trump Administration dismantles federal environmental protections and strips the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of its capacity to do its job, local governments are emerging as frontline defenders against dangerous and unchecked pollution.

On Chicago’s Southeast side, where I live, our parks, schools, and homes are surrounded by facilities that produce or handle dangerous toxic chemicals. Our only high school has an EPA monitor device that consistently registers some of the highest concentrations of toxic brain-damaging metals in the air.

That has made the local fight to reform broken zoning laws, which are at the root of many of the city’s environmental injustices, more urgent than ever.

Millions of people around the country are similarly engaged. Communities living next to industrial or distribution facilities are losing an important line of defense as enforcement dwindles, inspections decrease, and polluters feel emboldened to cut corners at the expense of public health.

As we face unprecedented attacks from the Trump Administration and a regulatory vacuum that leaves neighborhoods like mine dangerously vulnerable, local governments must step up to fill these gaps with policies that will protect us during times like these.

The segregation that has resulted from our city’s zoning laws is not just social, it’s also environmental. Industrial facilities are clustered in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods that create dangerous “sacrifice zones.” In these areas of the city, residents disproportionately suffer from asthma, cancer, and chronic illnesses due to cumulative pollution exposure.

Neighborhoods like mine in Chicago tend to be vulnerable in many different ways—economically, socially, and politically—and having polluting industries surrounding our homes, schools, and parks only compounds those vulnerabilities. The added stress of poverty, limited health care access, and systemic neglect make pollution an even greater threat.

Historically, zoning policies in Chicago and many other major U.S. cities have been deliberately or inadvertently shaped to place dangerous industry near marginalized communities, perpetuating environmental injustice for generations. The Trump Administration’s systematic gutting of critical climate and environmental programs has made matters much worse. If we are going to protect the health of our communities, we need to act at the local level.

The cumulative impacts policies enacted in some states and cities, including California, Washington, Minnesota, and New Jersey and programs in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, acknowledge that pollution does not exist in isolation. Rather, various negative impacts usually compound on top of each other, creating greater health risks than any single pollutant might individually. By taking into account the combined burdens, a cumulative impacts ordinance requires local governments to take into account the existing environmental threats on communities before permitting new major industrial operations or developments.

These laws empower residents, ensuring that developments truly reflect local needs and promoting sustainable growth that benefits everyone. Using a clearly defined process that involves community members from the start, cities can have developments that are cleaner and more sustainable.

This helps neighborhoods thrive economically—raising property values, attracting new investments, and encouraging community revitalization. Public spaces become safer and healthier, promoting greater community engagement and cohesion. This fosters a cycle of positive reinforcement, where healthier communities attract better educational opportunities, employment, and overall quality of life.

Historically marginalized communities, frequently excluded from development discussions, gain the ability to voice concerns and shape projects that directly impact their health and environment. This empowerment can lead to more direct engagement in our communities and more transparent governance processes, as residents become active participants in shaping their neighborhoods’ futures.

Implementing cumulative impacts ordinances is, of course, not without its challenges. Local governments must confront deeply rooted practices that prioritize industrial interests over community health. Proactively adopting comprehensive environmental policies not only avoids these costs but also positions cities as leaders in environmental innovation and social justice.

In this era of unstable federal protections, local governments must lead the way. By adopting cumulative impacts ordinances, cities like Chicago can demonstrate their commitment to protecting public health, ensuring environmental justice, and fostering equitable and sustainable development for all communities.",https://progressive.org/downloads/21926/download/GeneralIron.jpg?cb=5fe0e7ea40ee2067efbf77e8c89f925c&w=1200,N,,2025-06-27 10:07:13.313901

The majority of the plaintiffs — 16 states plus the District of Columbia — had still not completed a single charger funded by the program over the past four years.

The order excluded National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure charger funding for Minnesota, Vermont and the District of Columbia from the order, finding they had not submitted required documentation.

The ruling says that because the funding is allocated according to the federal highway funding formula, and was expressly funded by Congress, that the distribution of money for already-approved plans must proceed.

“The Court finds that, in effectively suspending the NEVI Formula Program, Defendants have overstepped their Constitutional and statutory authority and have attempted to override the express will of Congress,” wrote U.S. District Judge Tana Lin.

The judge also noted the Trump administration is likely to make nationwide changes to disbursement criteria moving forward, consistent with earlier administrations.

“Given that the injunctive relief here will likely be rendered moot once Defendants follow through on their stated intention to issue new NEVI Formula Program guidance that comports with the current administration’s policies, and states submit their new state deployment plans, the Court is not overly concerned that certain Plaintiff States’ deployment plans will for the near-term future be active, while other states’ deployment plans will remain revoked,” continued Lin. “Presumably, Defendants will issue new NEVI Formula Program guidance, at which point all states, plus the District of Columbia, will be required to submit updated State Plans, just as they were required to do under the former administration.”

Lin issued a seven-day stay with the injunction, giving Trump administration time to file an appeal with the Ninth Circuit.

As covered earlier by The Center Square, the majority of the coalition that filed the lawsuit, including lawsuit leaders California and Washington, has failed to build any chargers using the $3.3 billion in awarded funds over the past four fiscal years. With $3.3 billion awarded, $1.7 billion in funding remains to be allocated, and could be impacted by changes to program guidelines from the Trump administration.

Of the 44 states and territories that had solicited NEVI funding applications, 38 have been issued funding — only 16 of which have at least one operational station.

EV charging speeds have been rapidly increasing in recent years, putting the efficiency of spending limited taxpayer funds on quickly changing technology into question.

In 2019, over half the nation’s “fast” chargers put out less than 50 kilowatts. In 2021, the plurality of fast chargers put out between 150kw and 249 kw. By 2023, nearly half of the nation’s chargers put out between 250kw and 349kw, with the even faster chargers putting out 350kw or more growing 39% over the previous quarter.

To put that into perspective, a Tesla Model 3 with a 60 kilowatt-hour battery takes eight to 12 hours to charge at 240-volt-outlet-powered charger, 40 minutes to reach 80% at a 150kw charger and 20 minutes on a 250kw charger.

Should charging and battery technology continue to advance at this rapid pace, recharging could soon rival two-minute gas tank fill-ups in speed, rendering older, slower chargers obsolete.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/95/e9556b00-13d8-11ef-8a49-a394299d0345/6646919b01391.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 18:16:12.610589

In past years, Congress has refused to accept proposed drastic cuts to EPA’s budget.","To understand the federal government’s true priorities, follow the money.

After months of saying his administration is committed to clean air and water for Americans, President Donald Trump has proposed a detailed budget for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal year 2026. The proposal is more consistent with his administration’s numerous recent actions and announcements that reduce protection for public health and the environment.

To us, former EPA leaders – one a longtime career employee and the other a political appointee – the budget proposal reveals a lot about what Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin want to accomplish.

According to the administration’s Budget in Brief document, total EPA funding for the fiscal year beginning October 2025 would drop from US$9.14 billion to $4.16 billion – a 54% decrease from the budget enacted by Congress for fiscal 2025 and less than half of EPA’s budget in any year of the first Trump administration.

Without taking inflation into account, this would be the smallest EPA budget since 1986. Adjusted for inflation, it would be the smallest budget since the Ford administration, even though Congress has for decades given EPA more responsibility to clean up and protect the nation’s air and water; handle hazardous chemicals and waste; protect drinking water; clean up environmental contamination; and evaluate the safety of a wide range of chemicals used in commerce and industry. These expansions reflected a bipartisan consensus that protecting public health and the environment is a national priority.

The budget process in brief

Federal budgeting is complicated, and EPA’s budget is particularly so. Here are some basics:

Each year, the president and Congress determine how much money will be spent on what things, and by which agencies. The familiar aphorism that “the president proposes, Congress disposes” captures the Constitution’s process for the federal budget, with Congress firmly holding the “power of the purse.”

EPA’s budget can be difficult to understand because individual programs may be funded from different sources. It is useful to consider it as a pie sliced into five main pieces:

Environmental programs and management: the day-to-day work of protecting air, water and land.

Science and technology: research on pollution, health effects and new environmental tools.

Superfund and trust funds: cleaning up contaminated sites and responding to emergency releases of pollution.

State and Tribal operating grants: supporting local implementation of environmental laws.

State capitalization grants: revolving loans for water infrastructure.

The Trump administration’s budget proposals for EPA represent a striking retreat from the national goals of clean air and clean water enacted in federal laws over the past 55 years. In the budget document, the administration argues that the federal government has done enough and that the protection of gains already achieved, as well as any further progress, should not be paid for with federal money.

This budget would reduce EPA’s ability to protect public health and the environment to a bare minimum at best. Most dramatic and, in our view, most significant are the elimination of operating grants to state governments, drastic reductions in funding for science of all kinds, and elimination of EPA programs relating to climate change and environmental justice, which addresses situations of disproportionate environmental harm to vulnerable populations. It would cut regulatory and enforcement activities that the administration sees as inconsistent with fossil energy development. Other proposed changes, notably for Superfund and capitalization grants, are more nuanced.

These changes to EPA’s regular budget allocation are separate from changes to supplementary EPA funding that have also been in the news, including for projects specified in the Inflation Reduction Act and other specific laws.

Environmental programs and management

Funding for basic work to protect the environment and prevent pollution would be cut by 22%. The reductions are not spread equally, however. All activities related to climate change would be eliminated, including the Energy Star program and greenhouse gas reporting and tracking. Funding for civil and criminal enforcement of environmental laws and regulations would be cut by 69% and 50%, respectively.

The popular Brownfields program would be cut by 50%. Since 1995, $2.9 billion in federal funds have produced public and private investments totaling $42 billion for cleaning and redeveloping contaminated sites, and created more than 200,000 jobs.

A program to set standards and conduct training for safe removal of lead paint and other lead-containing materials from homes and businesses would be eliminated.

The administration has been clear that EPA will no longer do environmental justice work, such as funding to monitor toxic air emissions in low-income neighborhoods adjacent to industrial areas. This budget is consistent with that.

Science and technology

Scientific support functions would be cut by 34%. The Office of Research and Development would go from about 1,500 staff to about 500 and would be redistributed throughout the agency. This would diminish science that supports not just EPA’s work but that of organizations, industries, health care professionals and public and private researchers who benefit from EPA’s research.

Superfund and other trust funds

Superfund is by far the largest of EPA’s cleanup trust funds. It allows EPA to clean up contaminated sites. It also forces the parties responsible for the contamination to either perform cleanups or reimburse the government for EPA-led cleanup work. When there is no viable responsible party, Superfund gives EPA the funds and authority to clean up contaminated sites.

Prior to 2021, Superfund was funded through EPA’s annual budget. In 2021 and 2022, Congress restored taxes on selected chemicals and petroleum products to help pay for Superfund. During the Biden administration, EPA reduced the Superfund’s line in the general budget, with the expectation that the Superfund tax revenues would more than make up for the reduction. Administrator Zeldin, who has said that site cleanup is a priority, is proposing to shift virtually all funding for cleanups to these new tax revenues.

There is risk in this approach, however. The Superfund tax expires in 2031 and has raised less than Treasury Department predictions in both 2023 and 2024. In fiscal year 2024, available tax receipts were predicted to be $2.5 billion, but only $1.4 billion was collected. Future funding is uncertain because it depends on the amounts of various chemicals that companies actually use. Experts disagree on whether this is significant for the Superfund program. The petrochemical industry, on whom this tax largely falls, is lobbying for its repeal.

Funds to address leaks at gas station tanks would be cut nearly in half. Funds to clean up oil and petroleum spills would be cut by 24%.

State operating grants

The budget proposal seeks to reset the EPA’s relationship with state agencies, which implement the vast majority of environmental regulations.

EPA has long delegated some of its powers to state environmental agencies, including permitting, inspections and enforcement of regulations that govern air, water and soil pollution. Since the 1970s, EPA has helped fund those activities through basic operating grants that require minimum state contributions and reward larger state investments with additional federal dollars.

The proposed budget would eliminate all of those grants to states – totaling $1 billion. The document itself explains that federal funding over decades has totaled “hundreds of billions of dollars” and has resulted in programs that “are mature or have accomplished their purpose.”

States disagree. They note that EPA has delegated 90% of the nation’s environmental protection work to state authorities, and states have accepted that workload based on the expectation of federal funding. The states say reduced funding would greatly diminish the actual work of environmental protection – site inspections, air and water monitoring, and enforcement – across the country.

State capitalization grants

Since 1987, EPA has given states money for revolving loan programs that provide low-interest loans to state and local governments to clean up waterways and provide safe drinking water. The proposed budget would cut that funding by 89%, from $2.8 billion to $305 million.

These capitalization grants were originally envisioned as seed money, with future loans available as the initial and subsequent loans were repaid. But the need for water infrastructure continues to grow, and Congress has for many years allocated additional money to the program.

In protecting the environment, you get what you pay for. In past years, Congress has refused to accept proposed drastic cuts to EPA’s budget. It remains to be seen whether this Congress will go along with these proposed rollbacks.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/676287/original/file-20250624-62-se8ofu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C500%2C5999%2C2999&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-27 10:07:16.835408

➤ A transmission-only (transco) subsidiary of NextEra Energy Inc. in the California ISO asked FERC for authorization to increase the return on equity (ROE) in the company's formula transmission rate by more than 200 basis points. The NextEra transco joined at least three other companies seeking significant ROE increases in their transmission formula rates at the commission.

➤ The commission is also considering a settlement filed by a second NextEra transco that would establish a base ROE of 10.27% in the company's transmission formula rate in the PJM Interconnection LLC, an increase from the transco's currently authorized ROE of 9.60%. The company initially asked the commission to approve an increase in its ROE to 11.00%.

➤ A third NextEra transco asked FERC to authorize transmission incentives for its investment in a planned $2.6 billion transmission project in the Midcontinent ISO. The company argued, among other things, that the incentives are warranted due to supply chain uncertainty resulting from the recent imposition of tariffs on imported goods. The company also argued that the investment will result in significant negative cash flows and the potential to adversely impact the company's credit ratings.

➤ Three Fortis Inc. transcos in MISO have asked FERC to authorize transmission incentives for the companies' investments in six new high-voltage transmission projects with a total estimated cost of approximately $3 billion. The companies argued the incentives are warranted in part because of the regulatory and environmental risks and challenges of developing the projects, as well as high construction costs, supply chain issues and labor shortages.

A more detailed discussion of these developments that Regulatory Research Associates is following is provided below.

The commission

FERC's membership continued to undergo change when the White House nominated a Washington, DC, lawyer to the seat on the commission held by Chairman Mark Christie: Trump nominates industry lawyer Laura Swett to fill Christie's spot at FERC. Swett's nomination was submitted to the US Senate on June 2, 2025, and referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Swett's nomination is subject to the committee's approval and confirmation by the full Senate.

Christie's term is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2025, and his imminent departure follows quickly on the heels of the departure of Commissioner Willie Phillips, who resigned on April 22, 2025: Former FERC Chairman Willie Phillips to step down as commissioner early. Phillips' term was scheduled to expire on June 30, 2026.

Earlier this month, FERC held a much-anticipated two-day technical conference to discuss resource adequacy issues in the six regional transmission organizations and independent system operators (RTOs/ISOs) in the US. The first day featured a panel of representatives from all six RTOs/ISOs and the North American Electric Reliability Corp.'s president and CEO: US grid operators stress reliability challenges amid retirements, high demand.

The conference also included panels that focused specifically on PJM, MISO, the New York ISO and ISO New England. See PJM stakeholders debate need for state intervention to solve resource concerns, Stakeholders debate whether MISO faces an imminent threat to system reliability and Northeast grid operators discuss offshore wind challenges at FERC conference.

Transmission ROEs and formula rates – Horizon West

On May 30, 2025, NextEra subsidiary Horizon West Transmission LLC asked the commission to approve an increase to the base ROE in the company's transmission formula rate from 9.70% to 11.98%. The proposed base ROE, when combined with Horizon West's authorized 50-basis-point adder for participation in an RTO/ISO (RTO adder), would result in a total ROE for the company of 12.48%. Horizon West was formed in 2014 to develop and own electric transmission facilities in the CAISO region.

Horizon West noted it was recently selected by CAISO to construct and own two major new 500-kV transmission projects in Arizona and California with an estimated total cost of $2.6 billion. The approximately 80-mile North Gila-Imperial Valley Project is designed to improve access to renewable resources for customers in Southern California. Horizon West stated the second project, the approximately 140-mile Imperial Valley-North of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and 500/230-kV Substation Project, ""was identified as necessary to meet the future needs of the region's electric grid.""

In support of the proposed ROE, Horizon West argued ""[r]ecent upward movement in interest rates suggests that long-term capital costs, inclusive of the cost of equity, have increased significantly in recent years."" Further, Horizon West argued that ""[f]ailing to provide investors with the opportunity to earn a rate of return that is commensurate with Horizon West's risks will weaken its financial integrity and undermine its ability to attract necessary capital.""

Horizon West's request joins at least three other pending requests at FERC seeking significantly higher transmission ROEs. The three requests are currently in settlement judge procedures, while a fourth similar request, filed by another NextEra transco, is the subject of a pending settlement and is described further below.

The three requests in settlement judge procedures include a proposal filed on Oct. 24, 2024, by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) asking FERC to approve a base ROE of 10.98% in NYPA's transmission formula rate, an increase of more than 200 basis points from NYPA's currently authorized base ROE of 8.95%. NYPA's current base ROE is the result of a 2016 settlement that initiated NYPA's formula transmission rate.

In addition, on Oct. 30, 2024, Sempra subsidiary San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) filed a proposed new transmission formula rate and asked FERC to authorize the company a base ROE of 11.75%, an increase from the utility's currently authorized base ROE of 10.10%. SDG&E argued that it is an above-average risk utility due to the combination of higher wildfire exposure in California and California's inverse condemnation law ""that makes a utility responsible for any utility-caused wildfire, regardless of fault, which increases the frequency and amount of property subject to liability.""

Finally, on Jan. 9, 2025, New York Transco LLC filed a proposal to modify the company's formula transmission rate and establish a base ROE of 10.90% for all New York Transco's transmission investments except the $2.8 billion Propel NY Energy Project. Under New York Transco's existing formula rate, the company has a project-specific base ROE for each project that it develops and owns. In accordance with the terms of a FERC-approved settlement in 2024, a base ROE of 10.30% applies for the Propel NY Energy Project. A stay-out provision in that settlement prohibits New York Transco from making any filings that would modify the base ROE for the project prior to May 31, 2030.

New York Transco's proposal would increase the ROEs that currently apply to the company's projects known as the Transmission Owner Transmission Solutions, which have a current base ROE of 9.50%, and certain segments of the AC Transmission Projects, which have a current base ROE of 9.65%. New York Transco is owned by affiliates of the major investor-owned utilities in the state, including Consolidated Edison Transmission, LLC, Grid NY LLC, Avangrid Networks New York TransCo LLC, and Central Hudson Electric Transmission LLC.

Transmission ROE and formula rates – NEET MidAtlantic

On May 28, 2025, NextEra subsidiary NextEra Energy Transmission MidAtlantic LLC (NEET MidAtlantic) filed a proposed settlement of the company's request to increase the authorized ROE in its transmission formula rate from 9.60% to 11.00%. The 9.60% base ROE for the company was established in 2018 when FERC approved a settlement in an earlier proceeding.

The proposed settlement filed on May 28 provides that NEET MidAtlantic's base ROE will be set at 10.27%, nearly splitting the difference between the company's current and requested ROE. The base ROE proposed in the settlement, when combined with NEET MidAtlantic's previously authorized 50-basis-point RTO adder, would result in a total ROE for the company of 10.77%.

The proceeding was initiated on June 12, 2024, when NEET MidAtlantic filed proposed revisions to increase the base ROE in its formula rate, asserting that ""recent macroeconomic trends and indicators point to a higher cost of equity for electric utilities than during the pre-pandemic period,"" when the company's 9.60% base ROE settlement was negotiated. NEET MidAtlantic also described the risks faced by the company as a transmission-only entity and the critical role the company's allowed ROE will have in access to investment capital to support new transmission infrastructure investments.

NEET MidAtlantic noted PJM recently selected it from among other transmission owners in the region to develop and construct the $1 billion MidAtlantic Resiliency Link Project, a new 129-mile, 500-kV transmission line crossing through four states — Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania — and a new 500/138-kV substation located in Virginia.

The company argued, among other things, that ""expected ROE is the key economic signal that allocates finite capital among competing opportunities"" and ""allowed ROE and a reasonable opportunity to earn it are key to ensuring the flow of investment capital for new utility facilities."" The company also argued that ""[u]tilities and their investors must commit huge sums to expand the transmission grid with new and upgraded facilities and additional funding will be provided only if investors anticipate an opportunity to earn a return that is sufficient to compensate for the associated risks.""

Transmission incentives – GridLiance Heartland

On May 30, 2025, NextEra subsidiary GridLiance Heartland LLC asked FERC to approve two incentives for the company's $354 million investment in a new 139-mile, 765-kV transmission line project in Minnesota and Wisconsin that it will co-develop with Dairyland Power Cooperative. Specifically, GridLiance asked the commission for authorization to recover 100% of prudently incurred transmission-related costs if the project is abandoned or canceled for reasons beyond GridLiance's control (abandoned plant incentive) and include in rate base 100% of prudently incurred construction work in progress (CWIP incentive).

GridLiance stated the project is the middle segment of a larger 273-mile North Rochester-Columbia 765-kV transmission line that also involves interconnected projects by Xcel Energy Inc., American Transmission Co. LLC and a developer that will be selected through MISO's competitive transmission development process.

GridLiance argued the project ""represents a significant transmission investment from both a construction and cost perspective,"" noting that its $345 million portion of the project is a ""level of investment that exceeds [the company's] current net transmission plant of approximately $32 million."" GridLiance added that given the size of its existing rate base, ""the magnitude of these investments over the short term will result in significant negative cash flows and the potential to adversely impact credit ratings absent approval of the requested incentives.""

GridLiance also argued that the project ""will pose engineering and construction challenges as it is a first-of-its-kind project where a 765-kV circuit will be co-located with a 161-kV circuit on the same structures."" GridLiance asserted that ""there is considerable supply chain uncertainty resulting from the recent imposition of tariffs on imported goods, and tight labor conditions should not be overlooked."" The company added it is ""ultimately competing for goods and services both regionally and nationally. These industry conditions generally contribute to the risks and challenges, and further the potential for the project to be cancelled for reasons beyond [the company's] control.""

Transmission incentives – Fortis companies

On June 4, 2025, two Fortis subsidiaries sought FERC authorization for the abandoned plant incentive for their investment in five proposed transmission projects in MISO. On June 6, a third Fortis subsidiary asked FERC to authorize the abandoned plant and CWIP incentives for the company's investment in another transmission project in MISO with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.

The first Fortis subsidiary, International Transmission Co. d/b/a ITC Transmission (ITCT), asked FERC to approve the abandoned plant incentive for the company's investment in a 138-mile, 765-kV transmission line from a substation owned by ITCT in Michigan to a substation in Indiana owned by American Electric Power Co. Inc. ITCT would construct 68 miles of the line to the Michigan-Indiana state border, and the company's investment in the project is estimated to be $535 million.

The second Fortis subsidiary, ITC Midwest LLC, asked FERC to approve the abandoned plant incentive for the company's investment in four planned transmission projects in Minnesota. ITC Midwest's share of the projects includes 135 miles of new 765-kV transmission lines, 17 miles of new 345-kV transmission lines and a new 765-kV substation. ITC Midwest's investment in the four projects will total approximately $972 million.

The third Fortis subsidiary, Michigan Electric Transmission Co. LLC (METC), asked FERC to approve the abandoned plant and CWIP incentives for the company's investment in the Denver Project in Michigan, which includes a 159-mile, 345-kV transmission line, a 40-mile, 345-kV line and a 55-mile, 345-kV line. METC's investment in the project is estimated to be $1.5 billion.

The three Fortis companies argued that the incentives are warranted because ""development of the projects presents regulatory and environmental risks and challenges, particularly with respect to the federal, state, and local regulatory approvals and authorizations that are required for the development and construction of large-scale transmission assets like the [projects]."" The companies also argued that costs for construction materials, specialized skilled labor, and specialized equipment ""remain high and fluctuate significantly due to supply chain issues and labor shortages.""

Interestingly, agricultural regions such as the Midwest, Southeast, and Central Valley of California, have the worst air quality in the future CMAQ scenario that considers climate goals.","Globally, chronic and acute exposures to elevated concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) represent a significant risk factor for non-communicable diseases and increased premature mortality. Typical morbidities include chronic rhinosinusitis, respiratory diseases, and worsening cardiovascular health due to oxidative stress and systematic inflammation1. PM2.5 mass is associated with cognitive decline as well as neurological dysfunction, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and autism spectrum disorder2,3. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) presently sets health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 at values of 9 μg m−3 for the annual average, and 35 μg m−3 for the daily 24-hour average. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for PM2.5 are more stringent. The WHO recommends that the ambient annual average mass concentration not exceed 5 μg m−3 and the 24-hour average not exceed 15 μg m−3. In reality, there is no documented safe level for PM2.5 exposure.

Most PM2.5 mass forms in the atmosphere from reaction products of precursor gases that condense and change phase. Predominant inorganic gaseous species that contribute to PM2.5 are nitrogen oxides (NO2 + NO = NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ammonia (NH3). Acute exposure during severe air pollution events in the U.S. associated with PM2.5 formation resulted in premature deaths (e.g., Donora, PA in 1948) similar to other catastrophes such as the great London smog in 19524. Such events helped spur the creation of the EPA, passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA), and later its amendments. Under the CAA, EPA regulates air pollution through airshed-based approaches with health- and ecosystem-based NAAQS, and with emission limits and performance standards for most controllable source sectors. Early EPA rules reduced NOx and SO2 emissions to avoid exceedances of the ozone NAAQS and to ameliorate the deleterious impacts of acid rain, respectively. Ancillary benefits include dramatic reductions in domestic surface level PM2.5 mass concentrations, primarily a consequence of reduced particulate sulfate in the Eastern U.S. Here, we estimate the annual mortality from chronic exposure to air pollution for a counterfactual scenario where the EPA did not enforce the 1970 CAA relative to present-day air quality conditions. We explore ancillary health benefits from improved air quality should the U.S. achieve net-zero electricity production and complete electrification of the transport sector, roughly equal to a 50% emission reduction outlined in the international treaty on climate change, the 2016 “Paris Agreement”. We specifically consider rural areas where air quality for PM2.5 is not improved to the same degree as for high population areas5, the NH3 burden continues to rise, and the agricultural source sector is largely unregulated federally.

Routine surface PM2.5 network monitors have recorded dramatic reductions in mass concentrations since 1999, most notably in the eastern U.S.5 Yet, despite decades of successful air quality rules, only a handful of monitoring locations record annual averages below the 5 μg m−3 WHO annual guideline. Several monitors routinely record concentrations above 9 μg m−3, which exceed the EPA’s current PM2.5 annual NAAQS value. EPA’s atmospheric photochemical model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, also employed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for forecasting air quality, improves upon the spatial limitations of monitoring networks and provides PM2.5 mass concentration estimates for all locations in the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) as applied here. CMAQ exhibits high predictive skill when compared to surface PM2.5 mass recorded by routine monitoring networks (Fig. 1a). CMAQ indicates widespread non-attainment of WHO recommendations in densely populated regions, such as southern California, and East Coast metropolitan areas, in addition to more sparsely populated agricultural regions in the Central U.S. and California’s San Joaquin Valley. This suggests widespread adverse health endpoints for urban and rural U.S. populations alike. EPA’s Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) model predicts that the present-day air quality in the ‘current’ CMAQ simulation is associated with approximately 186,000 premature U.S. deaths each year due to the annual burden of PM2.5. This fatality rate constitutes nearly one-third of all heart disease-related deaths, the leading cause of death in the U.S., and exceeds the number of all unintentional accidental deaths combined6. Detailed discussion regarding uncertainties in these estimates is provided in the supplemental information (Table S1).

Air quality and the associated health impacts in the contiguous U.S. would be significantly worse had the 1970 CAA and its amendments not been implemented, especially the PM2.5 NAAQS (Fig. 1b). In such a scenario, the WHO-recommended annual average PM2.5 mass would be exceeded everywhere in the Eastern U.S., as well as in many densely populated locations such as California, Oregon, Washington. The 24-hour average ambient PM2.5 mass concentrations would frequently exceed 100 μg m−3 across the CONUS (Fig. S1). Exceedances of the daily WHO recommendation of 15 μg m−3 would be the norm rather than the exception (Fig. S2). The air avoided is associated with 298,000 additional excess deaths each year relative to current U.S. air quality. This air quality-induced mortality rate (484,000 deaths per year) is approximately half of the yearly U.S. cancer-related deaths and about twice as many respiratory system cancer deaths6. The number of avoided deaths is highest in densely populated counties, with the greatest number occurring in Chicago, IL (Cook County), New York City, NY (e.g., Queens), and Los Angeles, CA (Fig. 2). The highest number of additional annual deaths by state occur in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio at a rate of more than 18,000 each year (Table S2). In addition to avoided deaths, hospitalization rates, Medicare, and Medicaid costs would also be substantially greater7. Precise extrapolation of subsequent socioeconomic impacts is difficult to explicitly quantify, but continued substantial acidic deposition (Fig. S3) would have further contributed to acidification of soil and surface waters, a decline in forest and vegetation cover, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agriculture8,9. Other societal impacts, such as the frequency and duration of school closures that occur during severe air pollution events today, incur costs that are not calculated here.

The emission sources that contribute to global warming are the same that lead to poor air quality. In light of the ongoing climate emergency, the U.S. pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% of the 2005 (base year) level by 2030 to prevent a global average temperature increase above 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels10 in accordance with the Paris Agreement of 2016, signed on April 22, 2016. The U.S. recently reversed course on its commitment for a second time. A significant decrease in anthropogenic emissions for a climate impetus can also improve air quality. In the U.S., the electricity, transportation, and agriculture sectors are the dominant sources of greenhouse gases (GHG), collectively accounting for more than 60% of all domestic GHG emissions11. In an ambitious scenario, where the U.S. attains net-zero emissions for both the electricity generation and transportation sectors, substantial improvement in ambient PM2.5 mass concentration is predicted, most dramatically in urban locations (Fig. 1c). We estimate that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will cost nearly 65,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. Counties with high population densities will bear much of the excess mortality (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, agricultural regions such as the Midwest, Southeast, and Central Valley of California, have the worst air quality in the future CMAQ scenario that considers climate goals. Agricultural NH3 emissions are approximately 90% of the total U.S. NH3 inventory11 and occur largely in the absence of federal regulation. Emissions reductions for NH3, a key ingredient of PM2.5, and a toxic pollutant, may be warranted to safeguard human health in rural areas. European Union members have set a target to reduce agricultural NH3 emissions by 19% by 2030 relative to 2005 emissions. A recent air quality modeling study finds that meeting the interim target for 2020, a 6% reduction in total European agricultural NH3 emissions, reduces PM2.5 mass concentrations in Central Europe substantially. The economic benefits from avoided premature deaths exceed the cost of compliance with the NH3 regulations12. This is suggestive that air quality strategies for agriculture are cost-effective. Further, in the U.S., agriculture is the largest source of methane and nitrous oxide, potent greenhouse gases, but the sector is often exempt from international climate agreements. Effective policies to mitigate agricultural air pollution and the extent to which cost considerations should play a role in policy development are important topics for future study.

Independent federal science, such as the tools and models used in this work, safeguards human health and the environment. A weakening of federal agencies will degrade environmental quality, increase sickness and death, and incur costs. Such burdens will add to rising environmental and climate-related stresses. For example, wildland and infrastructure fires continue to increase in frequency, duration, and severity13. U.S. regions subject to exceptional fire events frequently exceed the WHO 24-hour average guideline for acute exposure to PM2.5 by almost an order of magnitude. It is anticipated that such exceptional events will become sufficiently more frequent in some regions to perturb annual average PM2.5 mass concentrations14. Large-scale wildland and infrastructure fires are not a direct consequence of federal policy, and are challenging to control. Air quality and climate questions in a changing global context include: To what degree should the government limit controllable emissions from all sectors? Do we want to save lives at risk from poor environmental quality? And to what extent should cost be a factor?

Electric vehicle (EV) sales have plummeted in Canada, dropping by a staggering 53% between Q4 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025.

This sharp decline in sales comes at the very moment governments across Canada have imposed increasingly aggressive EV sales mandates requiring consumers to switch to EVs.

An immediate course correction is required before government mandates wreak havoc on consumers and the auto industry, jeopardizing the livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people it employs.

How did we get here?

Proponents of mandates argued that regulations were required to increase the supply of EVs in the Canadian market. But prior to the federal government introducing its mandate, Transport Canada concluded that eight of 10 provinces had already reached or exceeded appropriate EV inventory levels.

Despite a plentiful and growing supply of EVs, the federal government proceeded to mandate 20% EV sales in 2026, 60% in 2030, and 100% in 2035. So much for evidence-based policymaking.

Now, less than two years after the federal mandate was introduced, weak consumer demand, affordability challenges, technology constraints, infrastructure shortfalls, and slow adoption by commercial and government fleets have made the targets unrealistic and unattainable.

With EV sales falling to 7.5% in April, governments are learning the hard way that mandates can’t dictate what Canadians buy.

What happens now?

Complying with EV sales mandates requires automakers to achieve a government-dictated ratio of EV sales to gas-powered vehicle sales. Given evaporating EV demand, automakers can only meet the ratio by limiting the sales of gas engine and hybrid vehicles and/or purchasing credits from automakers like Tesla to fill the shortfall between their EV sales and the government-set target.

In both scenarios consumers will ultimately bear the cost.

Perhaps most concerning is that the federal government anticipated and ignored the range of negative impacts when the mandate was introduced. According to Environment and Climate Change Canada’s own assessment, the mandate would increase vehicle prices and reduce consumer choice as non-EVs are phased out of the Canadian market. Low-income, rural, and northern Canadians would be disproportionately and negatively impacted.

The situation in B.C. and Quebec is even more dire, where provincial governments have regulated EV sales of 90% and 85% by 2030, respectively. The regulated targets are already so unrealistic that dealerships are facing vehicle inventory restrictions.

Fortunately, there is a better way forward. Governments across Canada should immediately repeal EV mandates and let the federal government’s existing emissions regulations drive cleaner on-road transportation. These regulations continue to require year-over-year emissions reductions that necessitate advanced technology solutions, including battery electric, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and extended-range electric vehicles.

Most importantly, existing regulations support Canada’s environmental goals while also helping Canadian consumers and business owners though the transition by providing greater flexibility in what technology they choose.

The key to higher EV adoption is governments working with industry to address barriers to adoption rather than mandating consumer behavior. An obvious place to start is charging-infrastructure, with 40,000 public charging ports needing to be built every year for the next decade.

At a time when Canada’s auto sector is already facing significant pressure from U.S. tariffs and global competition, it is critical that policymakers avoid doing self-inflicted damage. Now more than ever we must collectively protect this vital sector.

The auto industry fully supports a timely transition to EVs, but causing deliberate harm with unattainable EV sales mandates would be irresponsible — jeopardizing Canadian jobs, auto investment, affordable consumer access and choice of vehicles, and ultimately the stability of our economy.

Brian Kingston is president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association.

Despite concerns over U.S. tariffs under President Trump, the company’s strategic global operations and strong client base, including Tesla, fueled its financial success, pushing shares to a nine-month high, according to Le Times.

EV Charger Boom Fuels Growth

Volex’s pivot to EV charging infrastructure has proven lucrative. The company, which supplies chargers to Tesla and other unnamed automakers, saw sales climb 19% to $1.09 billion from $913 million. Pre-tax profits rose to $64.3 million, up from $51.6 million, marking what Executive Chairman Nat Rothschild called “an outstanding year for Volex.” This growth was partly boosted by the full-year integration of Murat Ticaret, a Turkish cable manufacturer acquired in 2023, which supports heavy equipment like tractors.

The EV charger segment is thriving as global adoption accelerates. With 46% of Volex’s sales tied to the U.S., where EV sales are projected to grow steadily, the company’s focus on reliable, high-quality charging cables positions it as a key player in the electrification trend.

Navigating Tariff Challenges

Concerns over Trump’s trade policies, which impose tariffs on goods from Chine, Mexique, Indonesia, and Turkey, initially dented Volex’s shares by nearly a third in March 2025. These countries host Volex factories, and tariffs could impact 12% of last year’s sales. However, the company remains optimistic, leveraging its global manufacturing network to mitigate costs. By relocating production or passing expenses to customers, Volex expects minimal disruption.

“We view these challenges as opportunities,” Rothschild stated, emphasizing the company’s “extensive international footprint, deep customer relationships, and track record in complex programme relocations.” This flexibility ensures Volex can adapt supply chains without compromising delivery to clients like Apple, Microsoft, and Dyson, who rely on its critical components.

Financial and Strategic Outlook

Volex’s robust performance led to a 7% dividend increase to 3 pence per share (approximately $0.04), payable on September 5, 2025. The company’s market value nears £700 million ($875 million), making it a standout on London’s Aim stock market. Shares surged 17.3% to 370 pence ($4.63) after the tariff concerns eased, reflecting investor confidence.

The acquisition of Murat Ticaret has diversified Volex’s portfolio, adding cables for industrial applications. This move, combined with its EV charger expertise, strengthens its resilience against economic fluctuations. As automakers expand EV lineups, Volex’s ability to scale production and maintain quality will be critical.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry

For EV owners, Volex’s success signals a reliable supply of high-quality chargers, essential for expanding charging networks. The company’s ability to navigate tariffs could stabilize prices, avoiding cost spikes for consumers. Industry-wide, Volex’s adaptability sets a benchmark for suppliers facing geopolitical trade shifts. Its global footprint—spanning 1,200 miles of factory coverage from Mexico to Indonesia—offers a model for balancing cost and efficiency.

As EV adoption grows, Volex’s role in powering infrastructure underscores the importance of specialized components. With demand for chargers projected to rise, the company’s strategic moves ensure it remains a linchpin in the EV ecosystem, delivering both performance and stability.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img_8961-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 09:04:26.512866

Fermi America, co-founded by former US Energy Secretary and Texas governor Rick Perry, will provide critical infrastructure energy solutions. The company said geotechnical work has already begun on the campus and is expected to deliver 1GW of power by the end of 2026.

Details on how this project - which would likely require tens of billions of dollars - will be funded have not been shared.

Fermi says its HyperGrid behind-the-meter campus will combine the “largest nuclear power complex in America, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power, and battery energy storage” into one development serving hyperscale data center companies.

The company said the planned campus is located at the “confluence of several of the nation's largest gas pipelines and located atop one of the nation's largest known natural gas fields.”

Fermi also said the planned campus is also in proximity to Pantex, the nation's primary nuclear facility. Located 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Amarillo, in Carson County, the site is the US’ primary nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility.

The Wall Street Journal notes Fermi has submitted a federal application to build a nuclear power complex totaling four 1GW Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. The firm reportedly aims to start construction next year and launch the first phase of the nuclear plant by 2032. The NRC confirmed to the WSJ it was reviewing applications from Fermi, which should be made public soon.

“The Texas Tech University System is proud to partner with Fermi America on this historic endeavor,” said TTU System chancellor, Tedd L. Mitchell. “Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this campus will not only be the largest energy and data complex of its kind, but also a testament to the unshakable spirit of our system, the Texas Panhandle, and this great state.”

“The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today,” added Perry. “We’re behind, and it’s all hands on deck. President Trump’s first executive order spoke to the energy issue and how we must continue to make America energy dominant. No one does energy better than Texas, and Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System are answering the call.”

The departure, confirmed by three sources familiar with the matter, comes as Tesla grapples with a 19% year-to-date drop in its stock price and intensifying competition in key markets, according to Reuters.

Leadership Shakeup Amid Strategic Shift

Afshar, a trusted confidant of CEO Elon Musk since joining Tesla in 2017, played a pivotal role in overseeing sales and manufacturing across two continents. His exit follows a wave of executive departures over the past 14 months, including chief battery engineer Drew Baglino, supercharging division lead Rebecca Tinucci, and global public policy head Rohan Patel in spring 2024.

The company’s focus has shifted from traditional EV production to artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving technology, highlighted by the recent debut of Tesla’s robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, 2025. Afshar celebrated the launch on X, calling it an “absolutely historic day for Tesla” and thanking Musk “for pushing us all.”

Declining Sales and Market Pressures

Tesla faces significant headwinds in North America and Europe, where demand for its aging vehicle lineup has weakened. In 2024, the company reported its first annual sales drop since it began mass-producing EVs over a decade ago.

Former Tesla sales manager Matthew LaBrot, recently fired for publicly criticizing Musk, noted that Afshar faced “significant pressure internally” to address sales declines, particularly severe in Europe, where rivals offer more affordable EVs. Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin, Texas, a project Afshar helped lead, produces the Modell Y und Cybertruck but struggles to offset slumping demand.

Robotaxi Ambitions and Technical Challenges

Tesla’s robotaxi launch, covering roughly 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Austin streets, signals Musk’s ambition to redefine the company as a leader in autonomous transport. However, analysts warn that expanding the service to other cities by late 2025 could face regulatory and safety hurdles.

The technology relies on Tesla’s Vollständig selbstfahrend (FSD) system, which uses cameras and AI to navigate roads but remains under scrutiny for reliability. The company’s shift to robotics, including the Optimus humanoid robot, has also led to exits like that of Optimus team head Milan Kovac earlier this month.

Industry and Economic Implications

Afshar’s departure, alongside North America HR Director Jenna Ferrua’s reported exit, underscores Tesla’s ongoing restructuring. The company has slashed thousands of jobs to cut costs, with Musk redirecting resources to AI and autonomy.

At approximately $250 billion in annual revenue, Tesla faces pressure to deliver on its $1 trillion valuation, driven largely by investor optimism about robotaxis. However, with shares down 19% in 2025, economic challenges and reputational risks tied to Musk’s political activities, including his $300 million support for Donald Trump’s campaign, could deter some buyers.

What’s Next for Tesla Owners and Enthusiasts?

For Tesla owners and EV enthusiasts, Afshar’s exit raises questions about the company’s ability to stabilize leadership while scaling new technologies. The robotaxi service could transform urban mobility, potentially reducing ownership costs if expanded successfully. However, Tesla must address FSD safety concerns and refresh its vehicle lineup to compete with affordable rivals.

Big US tariff hike would spark review of expected policy impact

ERLANGEN, Germany, June 26 (Reuters) – Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE) is expecting to start U.S. production of big industrial power transformers in 2027 and can further expand its Charlotte factory if demand, and import tariffs, stay high, senior executives at the group said.

Siemens Energy makes more than a fifth of its sales in the U.S. market, where it employs around 12% of its roughly 100,000 staff and runs several production plants that make everything from wind and gas turbines to electricity grid components.

Overall, more than 80% of so-called large power transformers (LPT) – bus-sized components needed to convert voltage levels for grid transmission – are currently imported into the United States, Siemens Energy board member Tim Holt said.

That’s why Siemens Energy is expanding its site in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the first local LPTs are expected to run off the factory lines in early 2027, Holt said, adding there was enough space to expand further if needed.

The company expects a total of $2 trillion of investment in the dated U.S. power grid by 2050, fuelled by an expected surge in power demand thanks to data centres that are needed for artificial intelligence technology.

“This time we expect a longer boom cycle for grid expansion than the usual two to three years. The market is very positive right now,” Holt, who is in charge of Siemens Energy’s U.S. business, said at a company event.

Siemens Energy’s finance chief Maria Ferraro said the group was taking a mid- to long-term view on the U.S. market, at a time when some firms are reconsidering their footprint there in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war.

“Do we change our tactic or the way to approach the U.S.? I would say no, because we already have a long-established basis there and it is a key market for us,” Ferraro said.

Siemens Energy said in May it expected U.S. import tariffs to cut less than 100 million euros ($117 million) from group net profit in 2025, comments that were made before Trump threatened 50% levies on EU goods if a deal cannot be agreed by July 9.

“Any large change in the tariffs would also mean a review of our estimated impact,” Ferraro said.

As the country’s energy demand surges due to new technologies and population growth, it’s time to stop subsidizing failure and let energy innovation respond to real-world demand.
The IRA subsidies were sold as a smart investment, with promises of jobs and economic growth.
Congress should repeal them entirely and stop forcing Americans to pay for climate giveaways that don’t serve their needs.","Congress isn’t getting a summer vacation until the One Big Beautiful reconciliation bill is passed. Debate continues as the House and Senate clash on key priorities, including rolling back the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)’s solar and wind subsidies (enacted in the form of tax credits).

At least 21 House Republicans signed a public letter in March opposing a full repeal of the IRA energy subsidies. Numerous Senate Republicans support a more tapered version of the repeal, claiming they will “phase out” certain provisions over time. But failing to fully reverse these solar and wind subsidies is a grave mistake — and President Trump agrees.

Congress should completely repeal the IRA’s solar and wind subsidies to restore the weakened American electric grid and save trillions in taxpayer dollars. As the country’s energy demand surges due to new technologies and population growth, it’s time to stop subsidizing failure and let energy innovation respond to real-world demand.

Today, the United States is powered by electricity, from artificial intelligence data centers to home appliances. More and more of the U.S. power grid relies on solar panels, which often produce only about a quarter of their rated capacity. This shortfall is expected to cause an alarming 30% gap between electricity supply and demand by the end of the decade.

The IRA subsidies for solar, as well as wind, jumble the energy market by subsidizing a simply inconsistent energy source — leading to blackouts, price fluctuation, and unpredictability. Americans cannot predict when a cloudy week might wreck their electric bill as a result of lawmakers’ presumptive decisions. If consumers want solar or wind energy, let them buy it. But these subsidies are dictating outcomes, not creating choices.

As the federal government already sits $37 trillion dollars and counting in debt, the estimated costs of the IRA subsidies are simply an economic catastrophe in the making. Updated projections forecast they would cost $1.2 trillion over ten years, with that number reaching $4.7 trillion by 2050 and even more beyond. While substantially increasing the national debt, these subsidies would also perpetuate inflation and reduce America’s capacity to invest in national security and future generations.

A watered down partial repeal, as suggested by some Congressional Republicans, does not go far enough. Every extra year of these subsidies means another summer where millions of Americans could lose power. Blackouts can be dangerous, especially for the elderly, disabled, and working class families who can’t afford to go without air conditioning or lose money from spoiled food. And the debt will keep climbing.

These narrower proposals miss out on roughly a quarter-to-half a trillion dollars in savings for Americans in the decades to come. Cutting off new subsidized projects by the end of this administration, and closing additional loopholes, is the only logical way to prevent new leadership from renewing the IRA.

America’s energy future should be built on innovation, resilience, and real consumer demand — not trillion-dollar guesswork by Washington. The IRA subsidies were sold as a smart investment, with promises of jobs and economic growth. Those fantasies never came to fruition, while taxpayers bear the costs of unreliable solar and wind dependency.

Congress should repeal them entirely and stop forcing Americans to pay for climate giveaways that don’t serve their needs. Households across the country need to keep the lights on and their red, white & blue popsicles cool in the freezer. Don’t let subsidies turn the grid off!",https://assets.realclear.com/images/68/687043_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-06-27 10:08:06.879340

The four contracted projects include the 300MW Yellow Wood Solar Energy Center in Clinton County, Ohio, targeted for commercial operations in 2027; the 140MW Pleasant Prairie Solar Energy Center in Franklin County, Ohio, expected to reach commercial operations in 2027; the 155MW Decoy Solar Energy Center in Arizona, expected to reach commercial operations in 2027; and the 198MW Seaway Wind Energy Center in Texas, which is expected to begin commercial operations in 2028.

The agreement follows a similar deal between the two companies inked in December of last year, which saw Meta purchase 760MW of Renewable Energy Credits (REC) from four projects in Ohio, Texas, New Mexico, and Arkansas.

It is unclear whether the latest deal is contracted through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) or an Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreement (EAPA).

Meta has increasingly favoured EAPAs over PPAs in recent years. EAPAs do not involve the direct purchase of energy. Instead, they represent the purchase of the project's environmental benefits through renewable energy credits, with the power generated fed directly into the grid.

However, controversy remains over the efficacy of EAPAs, with critics contending they represent the lowest quality of renewable energy investment.

Despite concerns, Meta has signed several EAPAs over the last 12 months to bolster its green energy credentials. Earlier this week, the company signed two solar EAPAs with Adapture for 360MW of power in Texas, expanding upon a previous agreement between the two companies signed in late 2023 for 333MWac of capacity.

These organizations are supposed to keep power costs as low as possible, “and clearly, that’s not working with PJM anymore,” Smith added.","While utility consumers grapple with skyrocketing costs, lawmakers say they are looking for ways to keep electricity affordable and demand accountability from power companies.

Led by Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Somerset), a group of bipartisan lawmakers announced a package of six bills intended to modernize New Jersey’s electric grid and keep rates stable. The state has previously relied on utility companies to upgrade the grid, but things haven’t moved fast enough — leaving it to the Legislature to act, Zwicker told reporters Thursday at the Statehouse in Trenton.

“Our transmission lines, as I’m sure some of you have heard, are unprepared to deal with the skyrocketing demand for energy. New innovations, such as electric cars, appliances, AI-based technology, all require massive amounts of electricity,” Zwicker said. “We are right now plugging 21st-century technology into a 20th-century energy grid, and the problems continue to mount.”

Democrats have blamed PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization that oversees and controls the electric grid for 12 states, including New Jersey, for the spike in electric bills seen starting this month. They have called for an investigation of the company’s capacity market auction, a price-setting auction that saw a nearly tenfold increase over the previous sale last July.

“If you’re hearing, as you drive through New Jersey, blood-curdling screams, they’re real, and they’re from the citizens of the state,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex). “People are going to be unbelievably angry, and they should be unbelievably angry.”

Some of the bills in the package announced Thursday would:

Require artificial intelligence data centers and crypto mining facilities to submit an energy plan to the Board of Public Utilities and mandate certain renewable energy for AI and crypto newly coming to New Jersey.

Establish a program to “facilitate the development of energy-related projects.”

Create a new incentive program to redevelop decommissioned power plant sites into fusion energy hubs.

Lawmakers said three other bills would be filed Thursday.

Smith stressed that New Jersey has to work in conjunction with the 13 states and the District of Columbia that PJM also oversees. Even if New Jersey rejected data center plans here, he noted, they could still be built in places like Virginia using the same electric grid New Jersey relies on.

He suggested that without major reforms at PJM, New Jersey should considering working with another regional transmission organization. These organizations are supposed to keep power costs as low as possible, “and clearly, that’s not working with PJM anymore,” Smith added.

Smith said New Jersey could absolutely remain with PJM, but “they know they have a problem.”

“It’s unfair, inherently unfair to everybody out there in New Jersey. So I think putting that out there — let’s investigate,” he said. “Could we have a better deal someplace else? Should we do it ourselves? It’s smart for New Jersey to do it.”

New Jersey Republicans have blamed Democrats and Gov. Phil Murphy’s energy policies for the price hike, criticizing Murphy’s focus on offshore wind projects that have yet to materialize and have been blocked by the Trump administration.

Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) said New Jersey is “being held hostage,” echoing other Democrats who have claimed PJM is keeping prices high by refusing to connect various renewable energy sources to its grid.

“Bottom line is very simple — Legislature has to concentrate on what we can do and be effective. Modernizing the grid is real. It should happen,” he said. “We shouldn’t have to tell the utilities to do it. We should not have to direct the BPU to do it.”

PJM has previously blamed the current price spike on a divergence between supply and demand.

“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” Dan Lockwood, a spokesperson for PJM, told the New Jersey Monitor earlier this month.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-92/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/0js15866_1-1024x6031751022309.jpg?h=b6101ac9&itok=UyqVkac4,N,,2025-06-27 11:18:16.592811

The captured zone spans approximately 40 hectares and is home to one of Europe’s most promising lithium deposits — a resource often referred to as “white gold” due to its growing importance in energy and defense sectors.

The village, seemingly unremarkable at first glance, lies roughly 10 kilometers from Velyka Novosilka, a town that fell to Russian troops in January.

The site’s value lies in its lithium deposits, which are used in battery manufacturing for electric vehicles, electronics, glass-ceramics, aerospace alloys, and energy storage systems. As demand for such components rises globally, lithium has become a highly sought-after strategic resource.

According to Le Figaro, this move allows Russia to tighten its grip on Ukraine’s mineral wealth at a time when global powers are racing to secure access to battery-grade lithium. In 2022, lithium prices peaked at over $80,000 per ton. As of June 27, 2025, the price in China stands at $8,500 per ton — a sharp decline, but still economically and strategically relevant.

By occupying this territory, Russian forces are not only expanding their military presence in eastern Ukraine but also gaining access to long-term economic and industrial assets. The Shevchenko deposit had previously drawn attention from foreign investors and Ukrainian state agencies as part of plans to reduce dependence on imported raw materials.

Analysts say the capture of lithium deposits may be part of a broader Russian strategy to control resource corridors and disrupt Ukraine’s ability to finance and rebuild its energy and industrial base. The seizure of such a site also raises concerns over future access to rare earths and critical minerals within the region.

Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy and Environment had previously identified the area as a priority for domestic exploration and foreign partnership. That potential now lies in contested territory under Russian occupation.

The seizure comes after Ukraine and the United States signed a major strategic agreement focused on resource security. On May 1, both governments finalized a joint framework to establish the Investment Fund for Reconstruction and Critical Mineral Partnership. The fund is a 50/50 initiative between Washington and Kyiv, intended to channel capital exclusively into Ukraine-based projects related to mining, oil, gas, infrastructure, and processing.

The newly formed fund underscores U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty over its critical raw materials, particularly in sectors vulnerable to disruption from military occupation or foreign exploitation. The lithium-rich Shevchenko site had been among the locations considered for future development under this framework.

Occupying this territory, Russia not only expands its physical footprint in the Donbas but also potentially undermines Ukraine’s ability to leverage key assets in its postwar recovery and strategic industrial planning.",https://defence-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/photo_5323369328260805612_y.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 10:06:26.840408

One generator shut down, followed by a large loss of other power plants of various types, and the Spanish and Portuguese systems collapsed 27 second after the initial loss.
In Spain’s case, some power plants that were expected to absorb excessive reactive power did not do so.
“Most of the conventional generation … with dynamic voltage control did not act as expected,” Lauby said.

Mark Lauby, senior vice president of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., briefed members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the massive blackout in southwestern Europe as a brutal heat wave across the eastern U.S. pushed power providers to the limit.

In his report, Lauby sought to put an end to finger-pointing about whether the Iberian Peninsula experienced blackouts simply as a result of its reliance on wind power.

“I want to be clear that this is not simply a resource’s fault,” Lauby told FERC commissioners. “People like to point fingers at resources. Rather, it’s an engineering and operational challenge that must be addressed to ensure system conditions are understood and precautions are taken to be ready for system events.”

Lauby didn’t identify who was pointing fingers. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright was one of those who appeared to immediately pin the blackout on Spain’s high percentage of wind power as a warning to the U.S. not to take that path.

“It’s very sad to see what’s happened to Portugal and Spain and so many people there. But you know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it’s just a risky endeavor,” Wright told CNBC shortly after the initial blackouts.

FERC Commissioner David Rosner seconded Lauby’s point. “This was not any particular resource’s fault. This was an operational and engineering challenge, or series of challenges,” he said. Failures affected both the region’s wind turbines and conventional fossil fuel plants and were compounded by operator errors.

At the time of the blackout, two-thirds of Spain’s power was coming from wind and solar; nuclear and hydropower added about 10 percent each, and the rest was from fossil fuel generation. A series of disruptions in power flows on the Spanish system that are not fully explained caused high-voltage levels to drop, the Spanish government investigation found. One such disruption may have been improper control settings in a large solar power plant.

Operators responded with measures to dampen the disruptions and restore voltage levels but lost control of the process, Lauby said. One generator shut down, followed by a large loss of other power plants of various types, and the Spanish and Portuguese systems collapsed 27 second after the initial loss.

“It was very quick, and [there was] not much the operators could do,” Lauby said.

A key factor in the loss of control was an obscure but vital factor in power flows over high-voltage lines called reactive power, Lauby explained. The same culprit played a central role in the 2003 Northeast U.S. blackout that cut off power to 50 million people, investigators of that incident found.

Reactive power is created by controlling the relationship between current and voltage, and precise levels must be maintained to allow power to keep flowing.

In Spain’s case, some power plants that were expected to absorb excessive reactive power did not do so. “Not sure why,” Lauby said. Rising voltages caused generators to trip protectively and shut down, putting more stress on the network, pushing systems toward automatic shutdown levels, he added. “It’s kind of a death trap at that point,” he said.

The ability to add or reduce reactive power is a critical component of voltage support and marks a fundamental difference in the U.S. and Spanish systems, he added.

In this country, wind and solar power installations are required to provide dynamic voltage support, but that is not a requirement in Spain, Lauby said. That responsibility is solely with conventional generators, but in the April emergency, some generators failed that mission.

“Most of the conventional generation … with dynamic voltage control did not act as expected,” Lauby said. “By the time control room operators recognized the problem, it was too late,” Lauby said.

Andrew Thompson, a Madrid-based analyst with the Brattle Group consultancy, noted to POLITICO’s E&E News that the investigation showed that some gas, hydro and nuclear plants that are paid for provide voltage control services failed to do so as contracted.

Lauby added, “In hindsight, if operators understood how fragile the system was, they could have planned for additional dynamic voltage support from other plants” and had them standing by. “So, lessons learned.”

But another vital operating issue affecting the U.S. grid has persisted for years and still awaits final resolution, Rosner noted, centered on the ability of solar installations to keep operating during short-term drops in voltage in the surrounding power grid. NERC’s proposal for a new requirement for solar installations to have low-voltage ride-through technology is awaiting a decision at FERC.

“I think it’s absolutely needed,” FERC Chair Mark Christie told reporters following the commission meeting. “It very controversial because people whose ox is gored obviously don’t like it.

“But I have no reason to think that what NERC has proposed is not the proper engineering solution, and that’s what we ought to be supporting,” Christie said.

He did not comment on the status of the proposed regulation as it is still before the commission. “This certainly is an example of the need for better … standards” on this issue, Brattle Group’s Thompson said.

Another recommendation by Spanish authorities resonates for the U.S., said Michael Goggin, vice president of Grid Strategies.

The government’s report urged stronger transmission interconnections with the rest of the European grid system. Had Spain been more interconnected with its neighbors, the initial disturbance would probably have been smaller and more easily contained, noted Goggin, whose firm advocates for a larger, more interconnected U.S. grid to increase competition and resilience.

“It’s so important that we look holistically at all the resources on the grid today and identify whether there are any gaps in our bulk power system reliability standards that would prevent a similar incident from occurring,” Rosner concluded.

“If we don’t do this, it’s just a recipe for failure,” he said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/21/3e/84df567e487c9df0c31532cb9780/aptopix-spain-power-outage-59121.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 12:24:47.471665

The people that are out of power around here, we're all rushing to go in to get power back.","ALEXANDRIA - Minnesotans in Arizona in April are hardly novelties.

But Mike McGrane and Bob Steidl, journeyman lineworkers from ALP Utilities in Alexandria, were hardly there on vacation.

Although if you ask them if they’d ever go back, they'll tell you “yes” before the question is completely out of your mouth.

In April, they went to work bringing electricity to families on the largest Native American reservation in the country: 17.5-million-acre Navajo Nation , which includes land in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.

A total of five volunteers from three Minnesota communities joined a team of employees from Missouri River Energy Services (MRES), including Steidl and McGrane from Alexandria, and volunteers from Detroit Lakes Public Utilities and Westbrook Public Utilities. And they joined over 300 volunteers from 44 utility companies across the country to take part in a project called ""Light Up Navajo.""

Some 13,000 households living on the Navajo Nation’s reservation have no electricity, according to the US Department of Energy’s Office of Indian Affairs . In fact, Navajo households make up most of the 17,000 Native American tribal homes without electricity across America. Light Up Navajo is a collaborative project launched in 2019 by the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and the American Public Power Association. According to MRES, ""Every year from April to August, volunteer lineworkers from public power utilities across the U.S. journey to the Navajo Nation to provide power to homes without electricity.""

McGrane and Steidl admit they volunteered for the project without knowing a lot about what it was.

“I guess when we were first asked about it, we didn't really know what we were really getting into — what it was all about.” says McGrane. ""I didn't know what the Navajo Nation even was.”

So in April, McGrane and Steidl loaded up their own truck with their own tools (which proved to be a smart decision in hindsight) and headed south to Window Rock, where they would start their work in the Fort Defiance Utility District along the Arizona-New Mexico border.

Seeing for themselves that there are places in America where people don’t have electricity was an unwelcome surprise.

“That's crazy,” says McGrane, shaking his head. “There's 10,407 families that don't even have power there yet. And this is 2025.”

“This is the sixth year they've been doing it,” adds Steidl. “They took a year off for COVID and they got funding to 2028 to do it. They try to get to 200 or 300 customers a year.”

“I think the first or the second year they helped around 200 families and then they haven't been able to reach that since then,” McGrane says. “They were hoping to get 200 on (the grid) this year — that’s their goal.”

Did it shock them to see poverty like that?

“Oh, yeah,” says Steidl, quietly. “Well, you know, for being in the United States … I never thought it'd be what it is.”

“You see these garden sheds that they been hauling around? They'll go and buy one of those and put it out there,” says McGrane. “And that's a new house to them, to a lot of the people. And they insulate it. And that's what they live in. That's what they can afford. A garden shed.”

It’s the stories of the people that stick with Steidl and McGrane.

“There was that one lady. She was 85 years old, never had power before,” remembers Steidl.

“You know, her and her family sat there the whole day and watched us set about four poles,” says McGrane. “And they watched the whole day. She was pretty emotional when her lights came on. Before her, the last guy who we built a line to has been waiting 60 years for power.”

“And he doesn't even speak English (only Navajo),” added Steidl. “We got power to a family, they started their house four years ago, right when they were getting ready to have their first kid, and finally they got the roof on in July. They're supposed to be having their third kid and they’ll finally have power for their house.”

“Even like the kids,” says McGrane, “they go to school and then they come home and try to do homework, well they don’t have lights or internet or nothing. You know, it's tough for the kids to get their studies done. So the one family where the girl was in school and we got power to them. Just for her to be able to get the internet and have electricity to stay up, once it got dark out, to do her homework and stuff — it's going to be huge.”

Making a difference like that is why both men would volunteer again in a heartbeat.

“(The people were) just so thankful that we took time away from our families,” says Steidl. “I don't know how many times I heard, ‘thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.’ Just for coming out there and giving them power.

“It's just the nature of our job, just helping people, like when we go to a tornado. Not everybody can do our job. It's like being a fireman. You get more reward in return. There was a guy from California. He was out there once and he was going to retire, but his rotation was to go back another year. So he's going to hold off to retire so he can go back.”

And what else would they tell potential volunteers?

“Bring a lot of ChapStick,” says Steidl, and laughs.

“I would just say, they won't regret it,” says McGrane. “I just can't see anybody that would ever regret going down there.”

In the meantime, Mike McGrane is still thinking about the living conditions he saw first-hand.

“I just think, as a country, we need to do more for them,” he says. “I mean, man, this is crazy. That we have money going elsewhere when we have people in our own country that need that help. You know, right now, there's storms that went through Bemidji and out in the Dakotas. The people that are out of power around here, we're all rushing to go in to get power back. Well, this is an ongoing storm. It's been there their whole life. They don't have power. So it's time to get going and do something. That's the way I look at it.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/fd4c5fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x4032+0+0/resize/800x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2Fe2%2F89eeefcc44688f873ccfbf0b72d9%2Fbob-steidl-left-and-mike-mcgrane-from-alp.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 08:06:39.811193

Nestled in the Pisgah National Forest, the town is known more for its natural beauty than its infrastructure. With a single power line delivering electricity to the entire community and no backup generator, residents expected the storm’s damage would leave them in the dark for weeks.

But that didn’t happen.

Instead, a first-of-its-kind solar microgrid developed by Duke Energy stepped in, dramatically reducing what could have been a multi-week power outage to just a few days.

A community powered by the sun

Installed in 2023, the Hot Springs microgrid consists of a 2-megawatt solar array and a 4.4-megawatt battery storage system designed to supply emergency electricity in case the town’s primary substation fails.

That’s exactly what happened on September 27. The Marshall substation that powers Hot Springs was nearly destroyed by flooding from Hurricane Helene. Repairs would take weeks. But on October 2, just five days after the storm, the microgrid isolated itself from the main grid and began providing power to Hot Springs. It kept the downtown core running continuously and served much of the rest of the town during daylight hours until power was fully restored on October 8.

It was a breakthrough moment. As towns across the region struggled with outages, Hot Springs demonstrated how clean, renewable power could not only reduce emissions but also protect lives and livelihoods.

Local leadership, long-term vision

Mayor Abigail Norton supported the microgrid from the beginning, even when some residents were skeptical. “Residents knew the microgrid was here. But it had only delivered power once,” she said. “Now, I think people are glad it’s here.”

The town’s geographic isolation made traditional grid upgrades impractical. Running a second distribution line through mountainous, wooded terrain would have been costly and environmentally disruptive. Fossil fuel generators weren’t a viable solution, either.

That’s where Duke’s solar and battery system filled a critical gap: delivering reliable, emissions-free backup power from a “black start” situation, when no other energy sources were online.

What’s at stake without clean energy support

The Hot Springs microgrid didn’t appear out of nowhere. It was the result of years of collaboration between Duke Energy, the Energy Innovation Task Force and regional advocates like Ned Doyle, who championed the integration of battery storage and renewables into the regional grid.

It also benefited from the growing national support for clean energy through energy tax credits and funding incentives, including those in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These incentives help lower the cost of installing cutting-edge technology like the solar-plus-storage system in Hot Springs.

But now, that support is in jeopardy. The future of these tax credits—and the innovative projects they make possible—is uncertain.

The concern is real. Duke Energy has already begun testing similar microgrids in other areas, including fire stations, military bases and emergency centers. These projects depend on the same tax structures and incentives that helped Hot Springs weather the storm.

“If these incentives go away, the pipeline of future projects dries up,” said Doyle. “The Hot Springs model works—and we’re just getting started. But we can’t do this without stable federal support.”

A model for the country

The success of the Hot Springs microgrid is already inspiring interest from utilities and municipalities nationwide. In an era of increasingly intense storms, rural communities are especially vulnerable and especially in need of solutions like this.

For Mayor Norton, the next big test will be during winter storms. “We want it to work when there is an outage during cold weather,” she said. “That will be key.”","https://www.citizen-times.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/25/PFTC/84350175007-getty-images-1453859222.jpg?crop=2120,1194,x0,y109&width=2120&height=1194&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-27 11:17:32.982429

Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda. On the chopping block are incentives that encourage solar developers to buy American-made products, like solar panels and components.

Abruptly unwinding the incentives would threaten a decade-long push to onshore solar manufacturing and challenge China's dominance of the sector, according to industry executives and analysts.

""What I see two years out is low-cost will once again drive demand in this market,"" says McDaniel, general manager of Bila Solar. He adds, ""That's going to be a hard road for some of us who have [higher costs] than panels made over in China or Southeast Asia.""

President Trump supported solar manufacturing in his first term

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Reams' group has called for lawmakers to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""

Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.

""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""

With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.

""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese.""

What you’ll get in the episode:

Why “leveling the playing field” leaves out 100+ year old coal, oil, and gas subsidies (aren’t they mature industries at this point?)

How a $300 increase per household could be heading for your utility bills

What the real consequences of a 60-day cliff would be (I explain it in plain English)

Why this is really about consumers and voters, more than renewables, which will get built anyway, but they’ll cost more… which is probably why so many people oppose ending the clean energy tax credits.

This is more than just a policy argument, it’s a warning. And a reminder that what Congress chooses in the next few days and weeks will show up on bills, ballots, and balance sheets.

Savanna Strott reports for Public Health Watch.

In short:

The Trump administration cut National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff and proposed slashing its budget by 25%, undermining storm forecasts in hurricane-prone areas like Channelview, where inaccurate warnings can trigger unnecessary evacuations and pollution.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is ending environmental justice programs, closing regional offices, scrapping data tools like EJScreen, and reversing enforcement of pollution controls, disproportionately harming communities with high cancer risk.

Repeals or delays of Biden-era rules on air toxics, chemical safety, and grant funding affect 218 petrochemical sites, including Channelview facilities emitting ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen.

Key quote:

“It’s a leg-up to the polluters. It’s a double-whammy on the communities that are going to bear the burden of that pollution the most.”

Why this matters:

Industrial communities along the Gulf Coast face mounting health threats as regulatory protections unravel. Channelview sits in the heart of one of the country’s largest petrochemical corridors and already ranks in the top percentile for cancer risk from air pollution. When federal safeguards are stripped away, local and state governments often lack the will or resources to fill the gap. The rollback of rules governing toxic air pollutants, flood risk, and emergency response puts people in greater danger — especially during storms, accidents, or facility shutdowns. In areas where children play next to chemical tanks and benzene hangs in the air, policy shifts in Washington have real consequences for lives, lungs, and futures.

The result is a feedback loop: more carbon emissions fuel more climate change, leading to stronger storms that take out more trees and more carbon emissions.
“The number one thing we can do to mitigate climate change is to reduce emissions via less consumption,” Hagedorn said.
“The scientific evidence is that climate change is here, it has been and will continue to be,” Hagedorn said.","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — When Hurricane Helene tore through western North Carolina, towns like Chimney Rock and Lake Lure were hit hard. The French Broad River overflowed, inundating streets and homes, and leaving communities to clean up and rebuild. The storm left behind a changed landscape—one that researchers say offers insight into both the problem of climate change and a possible solution.

Jacob Hagedorn, an assistant professor at UNC Asheville, studies biogeochemistry and environmental systems. He says Helene fits into a larger pattern of climate-driven weather events that are intensifying and becoming more frequent.

“We've seen natural disasters, billion-dollar natural disaster events, accounting for inflation, increase by at least two to sixfold in the past 5 years,” Hagedorn said. “Those extreme events are going to cost us more money are going to um lead to more danger.”

Climate change, he says, amplifies natural disasters. And the damage it causes—like widespread loss of tree cover—can make future events even worse.

In Buncombe County alone, nearly 40% of trees were damaged or downed during Hurricane Helene, according to Forest Service reports. That loss isn’t just aesthetic—trees play a major role in carbon storage, helping remove CO₂ from the atmosphere and storing it in the soil.

“Any time that you can keep a forest, keep trees intact, you're keeping that pump of carbon from the atmosphere into the soil alive, so that's gonna help mitigate emissions,” Hagedorn said.

The result is a feedback loop: more carbon emissions fuel more climate change, leading to stronger storms that take out more trees and more carbon emissions.

Hagedorn believes the key to addressing climate change now is mitigation.

“The number one thing we can do to mitigate climate change is to reduce emissions via less consumption,” Hagedorn said. “Electrification and industrial practices are changing, agricultural practices are changing. However, they can modify to reduce emissions, that's gonna be the key to climate change mitigation.”

One of the top strategies gaining traction is a farming method called adaptive grazing, also known as regenerative grazing. The idea is to rotate animals across different pasture sections in a way that mimics how herds move in nature, giving grass time to regrow, building deep roots, and improving soil health.

That technique is the focus of Roots So Deep, a four-part documentary series by filmmaker and researcher Peter Byck. The series follows farmers and scientists working together to study whether adaptive grazing outperforms conventional grazing on a range of climate and environmental metrics.

“I was asked myself what one thing now of all the solutions to climate change that we studied, what one thing would I focus on, and it was soils,” Byck said.

Byck has spent over a decade studying climate solutions and said soil health has become his “north star.” His work shows that regenerative grazing not only helps pull carbon from the air, but it also makes farms more resilient to extreme weather like floods and droughts.

“People want to know how to lessen the impact of Mother Nature at this point. Using Mother Nature in the way we grow our food is, to me, it's the best method we can think of,” Byck said.

Hickory Nut Gap Farms in Fairview, North Carolina, practices regenerative grazing and saw the benefits firsthand when Hurricane Helene hit.

“Essentially, we had no erosion except for the roads and around the creeks, it's just flooded everything, so it's pretty cool,” Jamie Ager, CEO of Hickory Nut Gap Farms said.

Ager says regenerative grazing is more difficult and more time-consuming, but it is worth it.

“The scientific evidence is that climate change is here, it has been and will continue to be,” Hagedorn said. “Whatever strategy it takes to cut emissions—that should be the number one priority.”",https://media.wbir.com/assets/WBIR/images/b230e5e2-7fb9-4509-814d-06faf663d7b6/20250627T103008/b230e5e2-7fb9-4509-814d-06faf663d7b6_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 09:04:23.239166

The cost of staying cool is higher now than a year ago, thanks to an increase in the price of electricity.

Electricity costs were up 4.5% in May compared to a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The recent increase comes after the price of retail electricity — a rate paid per kilowatt-hour for service at homes and commercial businesses — had already risen by about 20% nationwide between 2019 and 2023.

“It’s a dangerous situation,” said Katrina Metzler, executive director for the nonprofit National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition.

With increasing costs, air conditioning can become prohibitively expensive, and “there’s an immediate risk of heat-related illness and even death this summer,” Metzler told Straight Arrow News from her home in Washington, D.C., where the “feels like” temperature hit 105 degrees.

Electricity prices in the United States obey the laws of supply and demand. Electricity powers more essentials of everyday life than ever before, and new data centers are adding demand to the grid. At the same time, infrastructure and supply chain constraints have stopped power generation companies from adding supply at the same rate.

On top of that, experts say flawed market designs, tariffs and rising natural gas prices all contribute to more expensive electricity. High prices at a time when federal support for energy efficiency is getting cut threaten to put more stress on consumers already burdened by inflation.

How fast are electricity prices going up?

From 2010 to 2020, the peak average monthly residential electricity rate only increased by about 1.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. In the past five years, it has gone up by 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. That equates to about $31 more per month for a home using the national monthly average consumption of 899 kilowatt-hours, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Where does electricity cost the most?

The most expensive state in terms of the average retail electricity rate and average monthly bill is Hawaii. Several states, such as California and New York, also have high prices. However, because of smaller residences and improved energy efficiency, the average monthly bill in these states is lower than in states like Texas, Florida and Alabama.

Why is electricity so expensive?

Higher prices are a result of many interconnected factors. Most of America’s power plants are getting old, as are the power lines and equipment that make the grid work. That drives up the cost of keeping the existing system running.

Transitioning to wind and solar, and the batteries that help maximize the usage of renewable energy, is often advertised as a less expensive form of energy, but construction and raw materials still require large upfront investments. Plus, as more new wind and solar arrays are built, existing power lines reach a limit on how much electricity they can handle, and utility companies have to build costly transmission lines to connect new resources.

“We need to build more transmission lines because we can’t build the wind and solar farms in urban areas,” said Ed Hirs, a lecturer and energy economist at the University of Houston.

Utility companies typically pass these costs to their customers. At the same time, forecasts show energy demand will skyrocket in the near future. Data centers for artificial intelligence are the biggest driving force.

Virginia already hosts the most data centers of any state. Those data centers consume about 5,050 megawatts of power — roughly equivalent to the electricity needs of 2 million households, or about 60% of all the state’s homes, according to a report from Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

And as tech companies build more data centers across the country, the International Energy Agency expects the centers will consume nearly half of all new electricity supply added to the grid in the next five years.

“That increased demand will lead to incrementally higher prices for all consumers on that grid,” Hirs said.

At the same time, demand is surging, natural gas prices have trended up, and gas is the fuel source for more than 40% of electricity in the U.S. It’s also becoming more difficult to build new natural gas power plants.

Hirs said prospective gas plants face a five-year backlog to receive turbines that are an essential part of generating electricity. New 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum are also driving up costs.

Is the electricity market design the problem?

Beyond all of these factors, experts point to the way electricity is bought and sold and how prices are set.

“Many of the deregulated states are seeing higher retail prices,” said Noah Dormady, an energy economist and professor at Ohio State University. In these states, the company that runs the local distribution grid is different from the company that owns power plants or renewable energy generation. And another set of retail supply companies sell electricity to consumers.

“This creates an army of middleman companies,” Dormady said.

In Ohio and similar states, consumers can shop for electricity plans from different retail providers, a system intended to create more competition and drive down costs. Dormady’s research indicates that it hasn’t worked that way.

Dormady told Straight Arrow News that the prices most consumers pay are not based on market fundamentals. Instead, the retail providers’ rates are based on auctions that utilities hold months in advance with limited market competition, his research shows.

“People are paying a markup that is not trivial,” Dormady said.

Market designs may also keep developers from building new power plants.

“Pricing electricity minute by minute is the failure of these so-called ‘deregulated market’ designs,” Hirs said.

Companies have a profit incentive to keep electricity prices high, but building new power plants could eventually lower prices by increasing the electricity supply.

Who is most at risk?

Diana Hernandez, an associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University and co-director of the Energy Opportunity Lab, said not being able to afford adequate energy is known as “energy insecurity,” which she described as a “cascading experience where it’s much easier to go deeper into the hole and much harder to climb out of it.”

While researching for her latest book, “Powerless,” Hernandez found that 20% of households making $24,000 had made partial or late payments on their electricity bills. That decreases to 13% of households making $24,000 to $50,000 and 6% of households with an income over $50,000.

In 2024, a survey from Lending Tree found that 23% of all Americans could not pay part or all of their utility bill, and 34% had cut back on or skipped necessary expenses to pay their utility bills.

“There are so many people that are already underconsuming energy,” Hernandez said. When bills get too high, she said people will avoid using air conditioning when it is hot, or they will use space heaters, ovens or stoves to heat their homes when it is cold. Hernandez said these coping mechanisms present health and safety risks from heat-related illness, fire and exposure to volatile organic compounds.

Metzler, who leads an advocacy group around energy affordability, said she is most worried about the elderly, people on fixed incomes and families with young children. Both Metzler and Hernandez pointed to the 1995 Chicago heatwave that killed 739 people as an example of how real and deadly the dangers of energy insecurity are.

The situation could get worse, Metzler said, because the federal Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is at risk of elimination in the latest budget proposed by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. The program provides bill assistance and financial support for home weatherization upgrades to low-income households.

Metzler said LIHEAP has already faced staffing shortages, but the program “should be protected along with those people in their homes.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-11.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 12:24:51.287507

Louisiana is the latest state to redefine natural gas as green energy under a new law the Republican governor signed this week, even though it’s a fossil fuel that emits planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Three other states led by Republicans— Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee— have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.

President Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state’s petrochemical industry, says the new law “sets the tone for the future” and will help the state “pursue energy independence and dominance.”

Environmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It’s “pure Orwellian greenwashing,” said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.

Globally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute — solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana’s law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.

Natural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.

Switching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

Besides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.

Redefining natural gas

Louisiana’s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to “prioritize” natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state’s electricity.

The law’s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.

“I don’t think it’s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don’t blow all the time and the sun don’t shine every day,” Landry said. The legislation “is saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,” he added.

Landry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry’s billionaire Koch family.

ALEC helped shape Ohio’s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post. Ohio’s legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.

According to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.

“The goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities’ ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,” Anderson said, adding that ALEC’s legislation makes natural gas “eligible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.”

Questions over grid reliability

Gov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s grid is already powered by natural gas.

Landry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state’s electric grid. He highlighted Meta’s plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.

Louisiana’s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the U.S. does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.

Consumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.

Legally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is “blind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,” Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana’s law.

It’s unclear to what extent Louisiana’s utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law “unenforceable” and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas “aligns well” with the state’s economic growth.

This provision would effectively allow oil and gas drillers to avoid the CAMT altogether.","On June 16, the Senate Finance Committee released the tax portion of the FY2025 budget reconciliation bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Senate draft text would significantly slash the suite of energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) but contains several provisions that would expand tax subsidies for the carbon capture and oil and gas industry.

Structured like a carbon production tax credit, Section 45Q provides a credit for every ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) captured from power plants or other industrial sources and permanently stored underground in geological formations. The IRA expanded and extended the credit by lowering the minimum capture threshold, increasing the credit amount, and extending eligibility to facilities that begin construction before the end of 2032. Since it was first created in 2008, 45Q has always offered different credit amounts based on the end uses of the captured carbon—higher amount for geological sequestration, lower amount for enhanced oil recovery and other uses. EOR is a technique that boosts production by injecting carbon into depleted wells to eke out more oil and gas. The Senate Finance proposal would, for the first time, increase the 45Q credit for EOR and other end uses to match the rate for geological sequestration—up to $180 per ton. By contrast, the House-passed bill leaves the credit amount unchanged. Both versions maintain the current expiration date but would apply new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions to facilities claiming the credit.

Under current law, facilities that are placed in service after 2022 can claim $17 ($36 in the case of a direct air capture, or DAC facility) for every ton of carbon captured and then stored in geological sequestration, and $12/ton (or $26/ton in the case of a DAC facility) if carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or other uses. The credit amount is inflation adjusted and can be multiplied by 5 if certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met. The Senate proposal would increase the credit amount for EOR and other uses to $17/ton ($36/ton in the case of a DAC facility) to match the credit amount for geological sequestration for facilities placed in service after 2022.

The Treasury Department estimates that 45Q will cost taxpayers $36.2 billion over FY2024-FY2033. JCT estimates that this expansion of 45Q (combined with the effect of the foreign entity of concern restrictions) would cost taxpayers an additional $14.2 billion over FY2025-2034, on top of the $36 billion price tag.

45Q was first introduced to incentivize the adoption of CCS to reduce emissions. However, CCS’s lack of scalability, heavy dependence on taxpayer subsidies, threats to private property rights through eminent domain, and long-term risks to public health and safety make it a costly and ineffective endeavor—at taxpayers’ expense. Both the House and the Senate are missing out on the opportunity to protect taxpayers and raise revenue by not eliminating 45Q in reconciliation, especially when a bipartisan proposal that would repeal 45Q was already introduced earlier this year.

Additional Boost for CCS and Oil and Gas

The Senate draft also includes a provision similar to one in the House-passed bill that further benefits the CCS industry. Although the two versions differ on exactly which sources of income would qualify, both proposals would treat income from CCS-related activities as “qualifying income” for publicly traded partnerships (PTPs).

Current law generally requires PTPs with publicly traded partnership interests to be taxed as corporations. However, if at least 90 percent of a PTP’s gross income is derived from qualifying sources—such as rents, capital gains from real properties, or income from the exploration, production, processing, refining, transportation, or marketing of minerals or natural resources—it is taxed as a partnership instead. This allows PTPs to avoid corporate-level taxation by passing through their income directly to partners.

Both the Senate proposal and the House-passed bill would allow CCS facilities that meet 45Q’s minimum capture thresholds and capture at least 50% of total carbon output to count any income from electricity generation (for power plants), storage of electricity, and carbon capture as qualifying income for PTPs. There would be no construction deadline for these facilities to qualify. This provision would allow CCS facilities and investors to form tax-shielding PTPs to avoid corporate taxation.

The biggest boost to the oil and gas industry is a provision in the Senate finance draft that would allow intangible drilling costs to be deducted when calculating Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT). The House-passed bill does not include a similar provision.

Under current law, the corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) imposes a 15% minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of large corporations with average annual financial statement income exceeding $1 billion, effective in 2023. Corporations pay the larger of the minimum tax or the regular corporate tax. The AFSI allows for tax depreciation, net of operating losses, and other adjustments that reduce the base of the CAMT.

The Senate Finance proposal would allow operators of oil and gas, and geothermal wells to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) from AFSI when calculating CAMT, without any regard for depletion expenses that’s taken into account in the financial statement with respect to IDC. Expensing of IDCs is a long-standing oil and gas subsidy established in 1913 that allows all of the non-salvageable costs for drilling an oil or gas well (e.g. wages, fuel, and drilling sit preparation) to be deducted the year these costs are incurred, while other industries must expense costs slowly over the life of an asset.

This provision would effectively allow oil and gas drillers to avoid the CAMT altogether. Although the JCT estimates that this provision would cost $427 million over the next decade, a prior JCT analysis of the H.R. 662 Promoting Domestic Energy Production Act, a bill that includes the same provision, allowing IDC to be deducted for purpose of determining CAMT will cost taxpayers $1.1 billion over a decade.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/anthony-maw-zb5ebmpsAGo-unsplash-scaled-e1750977059511.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 10:08:13.356004

A group of Senate Republicans wants to phase out the incentives in a way that doesn’t jeopardize projects and jobs, and they’re taking advantage of delays resolving other issues to make their case.

But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Thursday that the Senate’s language on the IRA tax credits “needs to get reversed.”

Legislation released by the Senate Finance Committee would soften the House’s harsh phase-down of solar and wind energy credits by removing requirements forcing projects to start construction within 60 days and be plugged into the grid by 2028. But moderates want to give companies even more room to maneuver.

“People should know that the policy is set to have these expire, and I support that. It’s more a matter of doing it in a responsible [and] sustainable way,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Thursday.

POLITICO reported there’s a potential compromise floating around that would give wind and solar projects a full year of production and investment tax credits. That would allow the incentives to be cut off during the Trump administration.

“It could have legs,” said a Senate Republican aide granted anonymity to talk freely. “There’s a lot going back and forth.”

Negotiations on the tax credits and other issues involve members of both chambers and the White House to make sure a final bill can become law quickly. But Scalise — reflecting the view of many conservatives — wants the House’s language to prevail.

“You saw where the House position was,” he said. “We had a lot of back-and-forth over getting that language right to keep it tight. And President Trump, by the way, is where we are, if not more aggressive, at getting rid of it.”

Conservative Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) did not mince words: “I think it’s going to cause real problems. So if I were the Senate, I would take the House’s position right now.”

Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah), who may see top priorities left out of the megabill, amplified a social media post from fossil fuel advocate Alex Epstein arguing that ending IRA subsidies immediately could generate $500 billion in savings.

“Now more than ever, we need deficit-reduction wins,” Lee posted on X after the parliamentarian ruled against a proposal on Medicaid that was supposed to help pay for the tax cut, energy and border spending budget package.

The parliamentarian — a referee of the budget reconciliation process that will allow Republicans to bypass the filibuster to pass their megabill — has also ruled against rule-busting and public land sale provisions favored by Lee.

Tillis rebutted the idea that senators would target energy tax credits to find more savings. Beyond Medicaid, Republican leaders are looking for a deal on raising state and local tax deductions.

Tillis said the discussions were on “separate tracks” and geared toward “preserving the majority of the savings that come from the House but doing it in a way that appears to be more conducive to a graceful ramp-down.”

Asked about Scalise’s comment, Tillis said, “I’m wondering if their goal is to just end the tax credits or to achieve savings, which we believe that we do, only with better treatment for the businesses. I guess I need to figure out what I’m missing.”

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who favors a more aggressive phasedown of the credits, stressed the importance of the politics at play.

“Can you get 50?” he asked about securing the necessary votes. And Tillis similarly recognized the need to make sure whatever senators do can pass the House.

Senators are not expecting to make major changes from the Senate Finance text. They will also soon run out of time to talk.

“This is not going to be the thing that’s holding up the bill,” the Republican aide said. “Once they have decided on Medicaid and SALT, pens are down, this is not the issue No. 1 for offices moving forward on the bill.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6e/3c/450e3bc44ff7a7494901d1aec928/u-s-congress-50915.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 10:08:16.991672

GLOBAL TURMOIL PROVES URGENCY OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE Our energy producers are not the enemy.
If America wants to lead in energy, technology, trade, and security, Congress must shore up the legal foundations of that leadership.","The Trump administration has taken critical actions to protect U.S. economic security from this irrational behavior. In April, the president signed an executive order affirming that energy policy is a matter of national concern, not one to be dictated piecemeal by individual states. Then, in May, the Department of Justice sued four states — New York, Michigan, Vermont, and Hawaii — arguing that their climate liability actions overstep constitutional limits and threaten the cohesion of America’s energy economy.

Trump’s actions represent a critical first step toward restoring constitutional order in energy policy. However, executive action and litigation are not enough to deliver the legal clarity and investment stability that our economy needs. Only Congress can finish the job.

These types of state lawsuits raise serious constitutional issues. The Commerce Clause prohibits states from regulating activity that affects interstate commerce, and the Supremacy Clause bars states from overriding federal regulatory frameworks. Yet, in these cases, states are effectively trying to dictate upstream and downstream energy policy by imposing financial penalties on producers operating within the bounds of federal law.

If allowed to proceed, these lawsuits would fragment the national energy landscape into a patchwork of conflicting legal regimes. Infrastructure developers and investors would face immense uncertainty, unsure whether a project approved at the federal level might still result in liability under state law. That chilling effect is already slowing investment in pipelines, liquefied natural gas export terminals, and other long-term assets vital to meeting U.S. and global demand.

The stakes are only growing. America’s economic resurgence — driven by the artificial intelligence boom, manufacturing investments, and data center expansion — depends on reliable and affordable energy. If we allow politically motivated litigation to destabilize the foundation of that progress, we’ll stall innovation and lose our competitive edge.

There are geopolitical consequences as well. If U.S. producers are driven out of the market or slowed by lawsuits, state-owned enterprises in countries such as Russia and Iran will gladly step in to fill the gap. These foreign producers often operate with less environmental oversight and greater impunity, undermining both global emissions goals and U.S. strategic interests.

Lawmakers should pass legislation reinforcing the constitutional principle that federally regulated energy producers cannot be held liable under conflicting state tort regimes for emissions tied to lawful activity. This step would not protect polluters, as some activists would argue. It would merely provide legal clarity for companies doing exactly what the law asks of them: powering the U.S. economy under federal oversight.

Congress has taken similar steps before. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it extended targeted liability protections to essential industries operating in good faith. The same logic applies here. Without such clarity, we risk exposing one of our most critical sectors to legal paralysis at a time when both domestic stability and global events demand maximum energy resilience.

GLOBAL TURMOIL PROVES URGENCY OF ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Our energy producers are not the enemy. They make the electricity in our homes, the fuel in our vehicles, and the power behind our industrial capacity possible. They are also key to our geopolitical leverage, providing allies with alternatives to hostile regimes.

If America wants to lead in energy, technology, trade, and security, Congress must shore up the legal foundations of that leadership. That starts with ensuring that our country’s energy policy stays national and that the rules are written by elected lawmakers, not state attorneys general with a political agenda.

They pressured companies to divest from fossil fuels. They built an entire moral and financial architecture around the concept of decarbonization.

But this June, two major events confirmed the slow demise of the great North American decarbonization experiment.

First, Nippon Steel finalized its historic acquisition of U.S. Steel, signaling a massive resurgence of energy-intensive manufacturing on American soil. Up North, the government of Saskatchewan announced its plan to keep coal-fired plants alive beyond 2030, openly defying federal regulations and international climate agreements.

They are not minor setbacks to the climate agenda but fundamental course corrections, powerful acknowledgments that the prosperity and security of nations depend on energy-dense resources and the industries they power.

Steel Deal That Shattered Green Illusions

On June 18, Nippon Steel acquired the legendary Pittsburgh-based company to reshape the global steel industry. The $14.9 billion transaction, one of the largest in recent industrial history, creates a powerhouse with a crude steel capacity of 86 million metric tons.

“Together, Nippon Steel and U. S. Steel are moving forward as the ‘Best Steelmaker with World-Leading Capabilities,’” says the press release. Massive capital will be unleashed across steelmaking facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Arkansas, Minnesota and Alabama. The overall investment package is expected to protect 10,000 jobs and create 10,000 more in construction trades through the addition of a new electric arc furnace.

Steel production consumes enormous quantities of energy – primarily from coal and natural gas. The blast furnaces, coke ovens and electric arc furnaces that make up the lifeblood of steel mills are not powered by solar panels or wind turbines. They are powered by carbon-based fuels. Period.

This acquisition alone smashes multiple climate illusions in one blow. One, that emissions-intensive sectors would be phased out in rich countries. Another, that ESG-aligned finance would avoid “dirty” industries. And a third, that international treaties would keep governments and corporations aligned toward decarbonization.

Look who helped push this deal through. Citibank served as the financial advisor to Nippon Steel. Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Evercore were among the advisors for U.S. Steel. These are the same firms that plaster their websites with ESG statements and Net Zero commitments.

The same firms that swore to ""align their lending portfolios with climate goals"" and pressure companies to reduce carbon footprints. Yet here they are, actively greasing the wheels of a carbon-heavy industrial renaissance.

Saskatchewan Calls the Bluff on Coal Phaseouts

Then the same week, came another announcement, this time from the political frontier of Western Canada. The government of Saskatchewan made clear that it would extend the life of its coal plants beyond 2030, despite federal mandates to the contrary.

Energy Minister Dustin Duncan was unapologetic. “We’re not going to let federal politicians in Ottawa tell us to turn off the lights,” he said. Citing energy security and cost stability for residents, the province says it will keep coal-fired plants past the 2030 deadline imposed by Canada’s federal Clean Electricity Regulations,

This open rebellion is framed as a strategic return to realism with no use of euphemisms such as “transition” or “temporary extension.”

Collapse of the Climate Narrative

The Net Zero facade has collapsed massively, undeniably, irreversibly – because no policy survives violations of the laws of physics and market demand. Despite trillions spent on “renewables,” their contribution to energy production has barely budged in two decades.

What we’re witnessing in North America is not an anomaly but rather the beginning of a new phase. In 2023, fossil fuels still accounted for over 80% of global primary energy use. Globally, energy-intensive industries are thriving. China, the world’s largest coal consumer, approved 106 gigawatts of new coal power in 2024 alone.

The thud you hear is the sound of the decarbonization fantasy crashing to Earth. The sigh is one of relief as common sense returns to the public square.

There is no post-carbon future on the horizon, only a post-illusion present. And fossil fuels remain the lifeblood of progress.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/41/415519.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 08:06:48.049550

The bill is a massive piece of legislation that adjusts taxes and government spending on several sectors and industries across the country.

The legislation passed the House and is currently being reviewed in the Senate. Zeldin said the bill is in “the home stretch.”

Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has been opposed to the bill despite discussions with Trump.

Reeves of the Musconetcong Watershed Association said its water quality is considered good overall in most sections.
The association is also working with Hunterdon County through a grant from the Highlands Council to examine other water quality issues and potential solutions.
The Highlands Council’s current budget is about $3.5 million, with a potential cut to $3.3 million recommended by Gov.","In New Jersey’s Highlands region, stretching like a sash through 88 municipalities from Bergen County down to Hunterdon, it seems like every success is met with a new challenge impacting the Delaware River and its precious watershed.

For example, a massive warehouse development was slated in 2022 to cover 575 acres of farmland in White Township, just across the road from the Delaware. Its heavy truck traffic and 2.8 million square feet of buildings and asphalt would have increased stormwater runoff, leading to potential flooding problems and sending oil, road salts and other pollutants into the river.

The state Agriculture Development Committee ultimately agreed to buy and preserve the land, now known as Buckhorn Creek Farm, closing on the sale in May 2024. Yet keeping the land open, and the river clean, came at a high price — $27 million, the highest per-acre price ever paid by the state for farmland.

Two years ago, NJ Spotlight News in its special project “Water’s Edge” highlighted the Highlands’ importance to the watershed and its vast network of tributaries that provide drinking water to millions. This week, as we revisit some Highlands locations for signs of progress, the warehouse land swap is just one example in the region of the pressures that continue from development and other threats.

Six months after the warehouse exchange and 10 miles away in Warren County, an investigation escalated into significant water contamination in a section of Washington Township along the Musconetcong River, which meanders 46 miles through the Highlands before emptying into the Delaware River.

‘Forever chemicals’

The levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, known as “forever chemicals,” found at one Washington Township location appeared to be the highest ever recorded in New Jersey: 18,997 parts per trillion, more than 1,000 times greater than the maximum levels set by the state for the most common PFAS, measured in June 2023.

Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency sampled water in the area known as the Route 31 Sludge Disposal Site and now are providing free bottled water to about 180 homes where levels of PFAS contamination exceed federal maximum contaminant levels.

It is still unknown whether the PFAS have leached into the Musconetcong, considered one of the best trout fishing waters in the state, with both wild and stocked rainbow, brook and brown trout. Working with officials from the EPA, Delaware River Basin Commission and New Jersey Fish and Wildlife, members of the Musconetcong Watershed Association were in the river earlier this week sampling the water for contamination.

‘What we’ve been able to accomplish is nowhere near what we need to accomplish, and we have nowhere near the resources to be able to do that.’ — Ben Spinelli, executive director, New Jersey Highlands Council

“By combining surface water sampling with fish tissue analysis, the project aims to better understand the scope of PFAS pollution in the watershed,” said Christa Reeves, the association’s interim executive director, adding that the association has also tested home wells that are outside the EPA focus area.

To alleviate the contamination, the New Jersey Highlands Council last week approved the extension of a water main in Washington Township by New Jersey American Water Company to 142 properties whose wells are contaminated with PFAS. The move comes even though that area is considered a conservation zone that is environmentally restricted and where the expansion of water service normally would not be allowed.

“You’ve got contamination levels that are the highest that have been recorded in the state,” said Ben Spinelli, executive director of the regional agency. “We do know that the groundwater has been impacted and who knows what the long-term consequences of the chemicals are. It’s troubling.”

Laws and limits

Threats to the region and its part of the watershed are not new. In 2004, lawmakers created the New Jersey Highlands Council to protect the region’s water quality and quantity because the Highlands provides some or all the drinking water for some 7 million people. It also defined the region, designating roughly half the 860,000 acres as a preservation area, where the state Department of Environmental Protection set limits on development near waterways, on steep slopes, in forests and on farmland. The remaining half of the Highlands is covered by rules set in the Highlands regional master plan adopted in 2008, but only for those municipalities that agree to follow the plan.

Although the council celebrated the law’s 20th anniversary last year, it continues to draw at least trepidation, and in some cases outright hostility, among landowners and public officials. Only half of the municipalities have agreed to follow the master plan for at least part of their land, though over the last six months, 15 communities have at least started the conformance process. That’s at least partly due to the potential reduction in the state’s separate affordable housing obligation for any conforming town, due to the master plan’s protections for certain types of lands, including wetlands and forests.

Council staff developed a mapping tool that overlays all the zones the master plan created and resource constraints throughout the region, allowing municipal officials to see what parcels could be developable. Only municipalities that agree to follow the master plan are able to use the build-out tool to lower their affordable housing obligations. In the case of Byram in Sussex County, for example, the state Department of Community Affairs estimated the township needs to zone for 115 new low-cost homes. But Byram reduced that number to two in its housing plan filed with the state, because an analysis that factored in the Highlands restrictions found only one parcel in the township is in a sewered area and developable.

Curbing suburbanization

“We took what I think was a very logical and sound approach to how to evaluate the capacity of the region,” said Spinelli one of the original members of the Highlands Council. “People in the Highlands need affordable places to live … You want the right number built in the right place in the right matter, and that was our approach.”

Over the last two decades, he said, the Highlands restrictions have been largely successful in preserving the character and the clean water of the region, which sends about 860 million gallons of water a day to homes and businesses in other parts of the state.

“For the most part, the rapid suburbanization of the region has been significantly slowed,” Spinelli said. “Not eliminated. Obviously, the last house wasn’t built, but the alarming rate that development was taking place has certainly been addressed. Water still coming out of the region still substantially looks like it did twenty years ago, which was the real purpose of the Highlands [law].”

Between 2019 and 2022, the most recent year for which data was available, the number of acres preserved in the Highlands was about four times greater than the number developed, with 5,538 acres protected compared to 1,382 developed.

Lakes under pressure

Still surface waters in the region continue to face other threats. The condition of lakes is one concern.

Lakes in the Highlands that drain into the Delaware River have been having fewer large-scale harmful algal blooms (HABs) than in many years. Lake Hopatcong, the source of the Musconetcong River, was closed for part of the summer of 2019 due to an especially large bloom.

But the problem remains a stubborn one to solve. Leaking septic tanks and poor stormwater management systems can carry human and animal waste, fertilizer and other chemicals into open waters, causing algae and cyanobacteria normally found in lakes to grow out of control and make the water appear green. These can be exacerbated by high temperatures and excessive rainfall. High algal counts can make the water toxic to people and animals who drink it or spend time in it.

The DEP has decided to ‘retire’ Spruce Run Recreation Area in Hunterdon County as a lake for swimming, a spokesman said.

Due to continuing HABs at Spruce Run Reservoir, which provides water to more than 1.5 million people in Central Jersey and has been a popular spot for swimming and boating, the DEP has decided to “retire” Spruce Run Recreation Area in Hunterdon County as a lake for swimming, a spokesman said. The state park service plans to create a recreational redevelopment plan for the area.

“While Spruce Run is an integral part of water supply in the Central Region, it is over 35 miles upstream of the nearest drinking water intake, making impact unlikely” to the drinking water supply, said DEP spokesman Vincent Grassi.

Still, DEP’s most recent annual report on algal blooms, released in May of 2024, found that while Lake Hopatcong and several other locations in the Highlands had algal blooms in 2023, none of those persisted into the winter. Statewide, the number of harmful algal blooms declined slightly from 2022 to 2023, though was still higher than in 2017, when the DEP implemented a statewide response strategy.

Trying to protect the Musconetcong River

Other challenges facing the waters of the 158-square mile Musconetcong River watershed are road salt and other pollution sources.

More than 60% of the Musconetcong has been designated a National Wild and Scenic River, which provides it with some protections meant to safeguard its natural character and keep it free-flowing. Reeves of the Musconetcong Watershed Association said its water quality is considered good overall in most sections. To assess the river, association members measure temperature, dissolved oxygen, acidity and nitrate levels and collect creatures that live in the river bottom at several locations four times a year.

But the river’s conductivity level — the amount of electricity that can travel in water — has more than doubled over the last half-century, and after storms, the levels can spike even higher. Officials blame that on the overuse of salt during snowstorms. Salt both washes into the river directly and gets into the soil from where it leaches into the river over time. Studies have shown that insects, which trout and other fish eat, and some fish can die from chronic levels or major spikes in chloride.

“Nitrogen and phosphorus levels are generally within expected seasonal ranges, but localized spikes, particularly downstream of developed or agricultural areas, suggest ongoing inputs from runoff and septic systems,” said Reeves of the Musconetcong Watershed Association.

The association is in the midst of its fourth year of monitoring road salts at a host of locations throughout the area and has found “clear signs” of impacts on local streams, particularly following winter storms, she said.

“Data collected at several sites, before and after storm events, revealed spikes in both conductivity and chloride levels following snow and ice treatments,” Reeves continued. “This all underscores the need to balance how and when salt is applied and the use of other techniques to serve both public safety and human and ecological health.

“It is well known that these salts infiltrate into groundwater and people’s personal wells and can have serious health impacts, especially those with heart problems,” she said.

There is more to be accomplished to protect the region and its watershed, say advocates. For example, the Musconetcong Watershed Association planted more than 1,100 trees this spring in several sections of the middle and lower watershed, aimed at restoring the riparian buffers, which help regulate the water temperature and improve habitat resilience.

The association is also working with Hunterdon County through a grant from the Highlands Council to examine other water quality issues and potential solutions.

But there are also constraints due to a lack of funding. The Highlands Council’s current budget is about $3.5 million, with a potential cut to $3.3 million recommended by Gov. Phil Murphy for the coming fiscal year, which starts July 1.

Said Spinelli, “What we’ve been able to accomplish is nowhere near what we need to accomplish, and we have nowhere near the resources to be able to do that.”

But they are a key part of the built-to-order nuclear power plants Aalo wants to mass produce to sell to AI data centers.
“This is, essentially, the world's first factory that can produce nuclear power plants kind of wholesale,” he said.
Nuclear power currently accounts for only 10% of the energy consumed in the state, generated at the Comanche Peak and South Texas Project nuclear power plants.
“Nuclear power provides the most reliable and energy dense electricity available to mankind,” the Texas Nuclear Deployment Act’s author, Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, said on the House floor.","On a recent spring afternoon, Aalo Atomics' cavernous manufacturing space in Southwest Austin was quiet. Staffers had shut down the machines on the shop floor as they prepared to unveil a technology the CEO believes will change the future of electricity.

“Right now we’re coming up to the reactor vessel,” Matt Loszak said, pulling aside a big black curtain to reveal a cylindrical shining steel tank.

The vessel, displayed under a futuristic blue light, was 20 feet tall, about the size of a shipping container. Next to it, Loszak gestured to more metal components, the guts of the reactor.

“This is where the nuclear fuel would go,” he said.

To be clear, there was none of that fuel present. These small modular nuclear reactors — Loszak called them microreactors — are still in their testing phase. But they are a key part of the built-to-order nuclear power plants Aalo wants to mass produce to sell to AI data centers.

And it wasn’t just the reactors Loszak was showing off; it was the manufacturing facility itself.

“This is, essentially, the world's first factory that can produce nuclear power plants kind of wholesale,” he said. “So, not just the reactor, but also the whole plant.”

That is, if things go according to plan.

Aalo is one of a handful of nuclear companies now operating in Texas hoping to get in on the ground floor of a new atomic age.

An answer to the power crunch

Texas consumes more electricity than any other state by a wide margin and ranks sixth in energy consumption per capita.

It also is the only state in the lower 48 that operates its own power grid. That grid, managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas or ERCOT, is known for its ease-of-entry for new power generators.

But that’s not the only reason new nuclear firms have been attracted to the state.

“Texas is just an energy leader,” Loszak said, citing its deep pool of industry talent, from the oil, gas and renewable sectors and new state programs to foster and finance nuclear technology.

Those programs took shape after Gov. Greg Abbott kicked off this year’s legislative session with calls for a new “nuclear renaissance” to jump-start the industry.

A forecast from ERCOT had found that Texas energy demand could almost double by 2030, in large part because of the influx in AI data centers.

Analysts warned that, if the forecast was even close to accurate, it could pose a threat to a state power grid that has already delivered one major blackout and several close calls this decade.

Nuclear power currently accounts for only 10% of the energy consumed in the state, generated at the Comanche Peak and South Texas Project nuclear power plants.

Abbott and others saw more nuclear energy as the answer to the power crunch.

Lawmakers responded to the governor’s urging by passing the Texas Nuclear Deployment Act.

The law created a state office to promote the industry — and set aside $350 million for public financing of nuclear projects.

Private companies are already planning to build small modular nuclear reactors outside Dallas and along the Gulf Coast.

Research centers, some of which received their own dedicated funding, are also hoping to build test reactors to find safer ways to produce nuclear power at Texas A&M and Abilene Christian University.

“Nuclear power provides the most reliable and energy dense electricity available to mankind,” the Texas Nuclear Deployment Act’s author, Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, said on the House floor. “Investment in nuclear generation will ... create tens of thousands of high-wage jobs for Texans up and down the nuclear value chain from uranium mining and enrichment to technology development and advanced manufacturing.”

Harris argued a nuclear renaissance starting in Texas will soon spread beyond the state’s borders, answering rising energy demand and maintaining grid reliability.

Not everyone is as enthusiastic.

‘One accident will wipe us out’

Diane Wilson is a fourth-generation shrimper in the Gulf Coast town of Seadrift. She has spent decades trying to stop local petrochemical companies from contaminating the coast and degrading the fishery.

Wilson won a major victory in 2019, when the plastics manufacturer Formosa agreed to a landmark settlement after she showed it had been illegally discharging plastic pellets into Matagorda Bay for years.

She said the industry’s environmental record leaves her deeply concerned about plans to build a small modular reactor to power a plastics factory in Seadrift.

“We aim to stop this project in its tracks,” Wilson said of the nuclear plant, which is still years away from construction.

“Nobody has bothered to talk to people who might have some concerns, like the fisherman,” she said. “We are a fishing community. One accident will wipe us out!”

Similar projects are likely to attract resistance as well from people concerned about the risks posed by reactor accidents and radioactive waste, complicating plans for a new nuclear age in Texas and elsewhere.

Aside from environmental concerns, some doubt the small reactors touted by the industry are ready to answer the country’s looming power crunch.

“I’m not afraid of the technology. I’m afraid of the cost of the technology,” said Dennis Walmsted, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Nuclear power plants are expensive to build. They are also notorious for cost overruns and construction delays. While those are problems that small modular reactors are supposed to solve, Walmstead points out that those have never actually been deployed commercially in the U.S.

“Until you build one or five, you don’t know how long it’s gonna take,” Walmstead said. “Until you build one or five, you really have no idea what it’s gonna cost, because you haven’t built one!”

Increased demand from AI data centers

But back at the Aalo Atomics facility in Austin, Loszak is confident his company can build one and then many, many more.

He said deep-pocketed tech companies with a “higher willingness to pay upfront” have changed the calculus around what's possible in the world of advanced nuclear technology.

“The amazingly fortunate thing is that right now we have that type of demand — for the first time, really — since the creation of nuclear energy,” Loszak said. “Which is from these AI data centers.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edff4a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2F57%2F36854c044966b78e9987bb3594b6%2F20250407-nuclearmanufacturing-mm07.JPG,N,,2025-06-27 11:16:33.491510

Martha Pskowski reports for Inside Climate News.

In short:

Texas will spend an additional $100 million over two years to plug orphaned oil and gas wells, aiming to seal 1,700 wells annually, or about 20% of the state’s known total.

The average cost of plugging each well rose over 50% from 2019 to 2023, driven by blowouts and complex emergencies, especially in the Permian Basin.

A new law, SB 1150, requires plugging of wells inactive for 15 years, but loopholes and lenient extensions could limit its impact without further rule changes.

Key quote:

“We’re going to get another two years down the road in the next budget cycle and there are going to be more orphans. The Legislature has not really seen the picture of how extensive this problem is.”

— Schuyler Wight, Permian Basin landowner

Why this matters:

Orphaned and inactive oil and gas wells leak methane and can contaminate groundwater, posing a growing threat to public health and the environment. These wells often go unmonitored after companies abandon them, leaving taxpayers on the hook for cleanup. In Texas alone, nearly 9,000 orphan wells and over 150,000 inactive wells remain at risk of turning into long-term liabilities. Some have already blown out, shooting saltwater and gases into the air and soil. As plugging costs soar and aging infrastructure fails, the risk of environmental harm grows.

In short:

California’s Advanced Clean Trucks and Clean Fleets rules aim to shift the state’s trucking industry to zero-emission vehicles, but under the Trump administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked key waivers that would allow the state to enforce its mandates on private fleets.

The San Joaquin Valley, where nearly half of California’s truck traffic passes through, has some of the dirtiest air in the U.S., contributing to high asthma rates and other health problems.

Despite setbacks, state regulators and industry advocates continue building infrastructure and pushing market incentives, though some businesses are pulling back on electric truck investments amid the regulatory uncertainty.

Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Since 2022, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, companies have invested $9.1 billion in U.S. solar factories that are operating and another $36.7 billion in facilities that are under construction or in development, according to SEIA.

This year, U.S. factories will be able to make enough solar panels to meet most of the country's demand, the trade group said.

Asked about the potential impacts of ending clean-energy tax credits that help domestic solar factories, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement to NPR that the ""radical climate initiatives"" of the Biden administration are costing Americans billions of dollars. ""Rather than using taxpayer dollars to subsidize uneconomic energy sources to meet vague climate change goals, President Trump is unleashing energy sources that are economical and will drive down bills for everyday families,"" Rogers said.

But Trump himself tried to boost U.S. solar manufacturing during his first term. In 2018, Trump approved tariffs on imported solar cells and panels after the U.S. International Trade Commission found that a flood of imports hurt American companies. In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump complained that China dominates renewable energy supply chains.

Renewables are cost-competitive with fossil-fueled energy — even without subsidies, according to the financial firm Lazard. But manufacturers and industry analysts say U.S. solar developers still need incentives to use American-made products.

If the tax credits disappear too soon, companies building solar plants will ""buy the cheaper foreign panels to get that cost down as much as you possibly can,"" says Doug Lewin, an energy consultant in Texas. ""And that leaves the American manufacturer of solar modules [and components] just stranded.""

Trump's 2018 tariffs helped protect domestic manufacturers, says Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs at Qcells, which announced it was building a Georgia solar factory in 2018 shortly after Trump set the import tariffs. However, Moskowitz says the tax incentives passed under the Biden administration were key to creating demand for solar panels and components that are produced in the U.S.

""It's not a question of whether or not the country is going to install solar if these provisions are removed or phased out too quickly,"" Moskowitz says. ""It's just a matter of where [project developers] are going to get the product from.""

The stakes go beyond who supplies America's solar market. With more time, Moskowitz says U.S. manufacturers could scale up the size of their operations to compete globally.

""You want to set up that counterweight to China,"" Lewin says. ""You want to be able to tell Pakistan and Latin America and everywhere else, 'No, you can go through the United States for this vital resource for the 21st century. You don't have to go to China.'""

Presidents have tried for years to make America a solar manufacturer

Every president since Barack Obama has used tariffs to try to nurture domestic solar manufacturing by raising costs on imported panels and components — first from China and later from Southeast Asia, as well.

However, tariffs on their own weren't enough to build a manufacturing sector big enough to meet U.S. solar demand. That's why the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act were hailed as a breakthrough by advocates of the domestic solar industry.

""We were already seeing an increase in manufacturing before that, but the IRA was like throwing gas on that fire,"" says Lewin, the Texas energy consultant.

But just as American manufacturing is taking off, the outlook for the country's solar market has now been thrown into doubt by Congress.

Legislative text released by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month calls for phasing out tax credits for solar plants starting next year. Under current law, those credits, which encourage companies to use American-made products, are scheduled to start phasing out in 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector are 25% of 2022 levels, whichever comes later.

""I expect to see a couple of painful years in the U.S. solar industry, period,"" says Craig Lawrence, a partner at the investment firm Energy Transition Ventures. ""But I ultimately think it bounces back.""

Supporters push for slow tax-credit phaseout

The broader impact of rolling back incentives will depend on the details of whatever lawmakers ultimately agree to.

Without tax credits, America would build fewer clean-energy projects and use more natural gas to generate electricity, according to a study this winter commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose members range from Amazon to ExxonMobil to Walmart.

""There will be some companies that go under if they do this. But we will still see solar built. We'll just see less of it, and it'll be more expensive,"" Lewin says.

Those costs are expected to be passed on to homeowners, renters and businesses through higher electricity bills, according to the Clean Energy Buyers Association's study.

Limiting renewable energy development also raises concerns about electric reliability, says Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center advocacy group.

""You're looking at the lights going out and the air conditioning going off in the hot summer,"" Reams says. ""And then not meeting the [electricity] demands of tomorrow, leaving the U.S. behind competitively.""

Industry executives and analysts say clean energy projects are crucial to meet rising power demand from things like data centers and factories, because the plants can be constructed quickly and produce electricity that is relatively cheap.

Reams' group has called for lawmakers to delay phasing out the tax credits at least until after 2027. ""I don't think anyone's arguing they need to be here until the end of time,"" she says. ""But market certainty is something that all business owners understand.""

Manufacturers are already struggling with the looming policy changes.

""If my market is smaller, what kind of decisions do I have to make about investment, hiring and growth on my side to right-size my business for that future that will be smaller?"" says McDaniel, the Indianapolis solar manufacturer. ""We don't know how much that demand side will get impacted and how much smaller that market will be.""

With Congress under pressure to deliver Trump a tax-and-spending bill by July 4, solar manufacturers and their supporters are running out of time to sway Republican lawmakers.

""They're getting ready to walk off the field,"" Lewin says, ""and cede the 21st century to the Chinese.""

A newly-approved customer assistance program includes bill payment assistance for income-qualified electric customers, fully funded by NIPSCO, as well as elimination of deposits for income-qualified gas and electric customers and waiver of certain reconnection charges for all electric customers.
Township Trustees: A limited amount of energy assistance funds are available through local Township Trustee offices.
NIPSCO customers are encouraged to contact their local Township Trustee to see what help may be available.
For more information on bill assistance, customers can visit NIPSCO.com/FinancialSupport.","Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC (NIPSCO) received approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to adjust its electric rates.

The newly approved rates will be phased in over multiple steps beginning in July through the beginning of 2026 to spread out the changes to customers.

The approved changes reflect a collaborative agreement among NIPSCO, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and other key stakeholders, including NLMK Indiana, United States Steel Corporation, Walmart Inc., the RV Industry User’s Group and the NIPSCO Industrial Group.

“NIPSCO is committed to connecting our customers with safe and reliable energy that add value to their everyday lives,” said Vince Parisi, NIPSCO President and Chief Operating Officer. “We’re proud of the collaborative outcome reached through this process, which balances the need for critical investments with the importance of minimizing the impact on our customers. We understand that any increase in bills is significant, and we remain focused on supporting our customers through this transition with new assistance programs and continued improvements to service and reliability.”

The IURC decision follows a nearly year-long, extensive review process, which included public input.

The rate adjustment supports more than $2 billion in capital investments to transition NIPSCO’s electric generation to a more balanced generation portfolio, which is expected to deliver long-term savings and environmental benefits. An additional $769.5 million will fund critical infrastructure upgrades, including replacing aging poles and lines, constructing new substations, and modernizing the electric grid to improve reliability and reduce outage durations.

The average residential electric customer using 672 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month will see an increase of approximately $23 per month, or 16.75%, phased in over multiple steps beginning in July through Q1 2026. This is a reduction from the originally proposed increase of $32 per month.

Actual projected bill impacts may vary by customer, including nonresidential customers, depending on usage and future potential changes in market prices.

NIPSCO’s investments have already led to a 40% reduction in power outage durations and improved system resilience. The company has replaced over 300 miles of aging underground cable and treated more than 300,000 wood poles to strengthen the grid. Customers also benefit from energy-efficiency programs, enhanced digital tools and a commitment to return 100% of revenues from excess power sales back to customers.

A newly-approved customer assistance program includes bill payment assistance for income-qualified electric customers, fully funded by NIPSCO, as well as elimination of deposits for income-qualified gas and electric customers and waiver of certain reconnection charges for all electric customers.

Along with the new bill payment assistance program, available to customers beginning next year, and beyond the existing state and federal energy assistance programs and moratoriums on winter service disconnections, NIPSCO provides credit arrangements, budget plans and reduced deposits for eligible customers, including:

Payment Agreements: NIPSCO has expanded its payment plan agreements to offer its most flexible payment plans to customers who need financial support, including three-, six- and 12-month plans. Customers can learn more and enroll at NIPSCO.com/PaymentPlans.

Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP): LIHEAP support is available to households that are at or below 60% of the State Median Income (SMI). The program opens on Oct. 1 for online and mail-in applications. Customers can learn more and find out if they qualify at eap.ihcda.in.gov or by calling 2-1-1.

Township Trustees: A limited amount of energy assistance funds are available through local Township Trustee offices. NIPSCO customers are encouraged to contact their local Township Trustee to see what help may be available.

Then-President Joe Biden had just signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a law packed with tax incentives for clean energy. America's solar market was about to take off.

Since then, tens of billions of dollars have poured into solar factories that are operating or under development, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, or SEIA, which advocates on behalf of the field. Once those factories are all finished, the facilities could create close to 60,000 manufacturing jobs, the trade group has said.

But those investments are now at risk.

Congressional Republicans are on the verge of rolling back clean-energy tax credits as part of a huge tax-and-spending bill that's a cornerstone of President Trump's second-term agenda.

Without stronger regulation and enforcement, the number of dangerous, abandoned wells will likely continue to outpace efforts to close them, even as federal policy pivots to increased fossil fuel production.","Texas lawmakers approved $100 million in new funding to seal abandoned oil and gas wells, but advocates warn that weak policies will keep adding to the problem.

Martha Pskowski reports for Inside Climate News.

In short:

Texas will spend an additional $100 million over two years to plug orphaned oil and gas wells, aiming to seal 1,700 wells annually, or about 20% of the state’s known total.

The average cost of plugging each well rose over 50% from 2019 to 2023, driven by blowouts and complex emergencies, especially in the Permian Basin.

A new law, SB 1150, requires plugging of wells inactive for 15 years, but loopholes and lenient extensions could limit its impact without further rule changes.

Key quote:

“We’re going to get another two years down the road in the next budget cycle and there are going to be more orphans. The Legislature has not really seen the picture of how extensive this problem is.”

— Schuyler Wight, Permian Basin landowner

Why this matters:

Orphaned and inactive oil and gas wells leak methane and can contaminate groundwater, posing a growing threat to public health and the environment. These wells often go unmonitored after companies abandon them, leaving taxpayers on the hook for cleanup. In Texas alone, nearly 9,000 orphan wells and over 150,000 inactive wells remain at risk of turning into long-term liabilities. Some have already blown out, shooting saltwater and gases into the air and soil. As plugging costs soar and aging infrastructure fails, the risk of environmental harm grows.

Now, nearly two years later, the fate of these credits remains uncertain as both the House and Senate have proposed sweeping tax changes in the budget reconciliation process that would significantly scale back the IRA's clean energy incentives.

In our last update, available here, we summarized the House budget bill, which proposed dramatic cuts to these credits across the board despite their popularity in many Republican-led districts. The budget is now under review in the Senate, with the stated (and ambitious) goal of finalizing a tax package by July 4.

On June 16, the Senate released its draft budget bill. While still aimed at ending what it calls ""Green New Deal spending,"" the Senate takes a more measured approach than the House. Both chambers propose eliminating consumer-facing credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades. However, the Senate notably relaxes the eligibility timeline for the tech-neutral investment tax credit (""ITC"") and production tax credit (""PTC""), opting instead to phase out wind and solar projects that begin construction in 2026. By contrast, the House would require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's enactment—a tight timeline that drew backlash from investors who had expected these credits to be available much longer.

Because many of the proposed changes wouldn't take effect until after 2025, credit sales will likely continue through the end of the year, especially as buyers gain a clearer picture of their tax positions. The recent slowdown appears driven by uncertainty over potential cuts, so greater clarity alone may be enough to restore confidence in the market, at least for now.

The Senate draft is expected to undergo further revisions in the coming weeks, with the goal of finalizing the budget in July. Still, it remains to be seen how far a Republican Congress is willing to go in dialing back provisions that remain broadly popular with constituents, especially given the billions of dollars already invested in these clean energy projects.

The clean energy tax incentives, in place since 2022, are driving job creation, new investments, and pollution cuts across the state.
The House of Representatives has already voted to cut clean energy tax credits.","Rolling back clean energy tax credits will increase Ohioans' electricity costs and harm the state's economy.

Leah Ceperley is a volunteer advocate and organizer with the Miami Valley chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby.

This week’s heat dome, causing dangerously high temperatures across much of Ohio, is bad news for Ohioans already facing the prospect of higher electricity rates.

Higher temperatures over more days mean higher demand for electricity for cooling homes and businesses, driving up the prices AEP, Duke Energy, and others pay on the wholesale power markets.

These higher wholesale costs are ultimately passed to consumers. Congress’s big budget bill, if passed, is projected to make things even worse.

The proposed budget bill would roll back clean energy tax credits, meaning even higher electricity rates for Ohioans. Working with their colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee, Senators Husted and Moreno have the opportunity to spare us from this added burden.

In the absence of clean energy tax incentives, Ohio ratepayers will face electricity prices that are 9% higher in coming years.

There will be even more economic damage

As they currently stand, the clean energy tax credits are incentivizing low-cost energy development. If these tax credits are repealed, not only will our household costs go up, so will electricity costs to businesses. When businesses pay more for electricity, the costs are passed to consumers. Ohio households carry the burden.

Gutting clean energy incentives will create even more economic damage than just higher consumer costs.

We will also feel the effects of lost jobs and lost gross domestic product.

The clean energy tax incentives, in place since 2022, are driving job creation, new investments, and pollution cuts across the state. Ohio has benefited from the increased investment in clean energy and manufacturing.

Over $20 billion in new investments in Ohio, from businesses such as Honda, LG, Ford, Samsung, and Joby Aviation, have been announced since 2022 thanks to these tax credits, translating to 21,000 new jobs.

There will be consequences

Rolling back these incentives means that the new jobs won’t be created. It also means that companies, now carrying the same higher energy costs that Ohio households will face, will tighten their belts, reluctant or unable to retain the same number of workers.

In addition, modeling from Energy Innovation finds that repealing these tax credits will reduce Ohio’s GDP by $3.39 billion by 2030 compared to retaining existing policies.

Without these incentives, innovation in advanced energy technologies will stall and climate pollution will increase.

It doesn’t have to be this way

Clean energy tax credits can drive economic growth and jobs in Ohio over the next decade. The 2025-2035 Clean Power forecast for Ohio estimates $107 billion in clean energy investment will be added to the state’s economy if the clean energy tax incentives stay in place.

This translates to over 700,000 jobs supported across the transportation, power, building, manufacturing, and aviation fuel sectors, and $226 in new spending, a boon to Ohio’s economy.

The House of Representatives has already voted to cut clean energy tax credits. Negotiations are now underway in the Senate. These incentives support Ohio’s economy and Ohio households. It’s time for Senator Husted and Moreno to protect what’s working.

But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers.
1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.
(Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)
Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.","The event marked the launch of the company’s new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.

Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.

“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood’s founder and chief executive, said at the event.

This first microgrid, housed at the company’s facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation’s largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.

(That’s tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to Forbes.)

Redwood’s project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn’t be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers.

Since Redwood’s batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.

Redwood Energy’s microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.

“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.

The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as MIT Technology Review recently reported.

Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it “would be logical targets” for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia, and the Midwest as well.

“We’re talking to a broad cross section of those companies,” he says.

Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.

Redwood’s microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe’s local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.

Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)

Redwood’s new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.

The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.

If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.

“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood’s new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions.

Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.

The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they’ll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company’s recycling process.

Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour’s worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company’s new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.

Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.

“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/250626_batterypacks_hero.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-06-27 12:24:54.522688

The UK this week unveiled its Strategy, a policy roadmap for the country’s next decade, outlining how it will boost business investment and create skilled jobs across eight sectors, including clean energy.

Fundamental to the Strategy on clean energy is the position of the electricity network.

Earlier this week, when the Strategy was released, I reported on how the networks are seen as a ‘frontier sector’ for economic growth in the UK.

Under the Strategy, the UK government outlines different action points to cement the country’s position as a leader in clean energy.

Core to this, especially for the electricity networks sector, is by ensuring investment certainty, in part by working closely with NESO, Ofgem and industry to encourage greater sharing of data and early estimates of future demand for equipment and services.

Thus, will the supply chain get the confidence they need to invest in the UK.

Public investment, the strategy adds, will be catalysed, in part through a Public Finance Institutions offer and from the National Wealth Fund (NWF), which the government says will invest in the development of low-carbon power generation, flexibility and storage technologies and their supply chains.

This also isn’t to mention how the Strategy is looking to break down barriers to investment, a long list of measures, such as with the introduction of a Connections Accelerator Service, which they say will boost support for demand projects.

As I said, the plan caters for a lot.

So says Ed Miliband, UK secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, in the plan:

“Our Clean Energy Superpower Mission means we are doubling down on Britain’s strengths and giving those industries the certainty they need to invest in the UK.

“This Sector Plan builds on that certainty, addressing specific barriers to investment and growth in priority areas. Over the coming months and years we will work in partnership with industry to deliver on these goals.”

Financing grid expansion: Overhead versus the ATT side-step

Global highs for energy investment despite Trumponomics

Cautious optimism?

This looks to be a double down indeed. But the question remains: will it be effective?

Well, an inbox flooded with commentary from industry experts leads me to believe so.

Take, for example, Tony O’Carroll, CEO of Conrad Energy. He said: “The new industrial plan, and the increased investment and attention it shows from the Government, is a much-needed boost for the sector.”

In particular, O’Caroll welcomes the promise of a new Connections Accelerator Service to streamline grid access for major investment plans. Although he questions what this will look like, “anything that reduces the horde of zombie projects currently delaying viable businesses from accessing energy is a step in the right direction.”

Or Schneider Electric’s Kelly Becker, who argues the plan will bring much-needed business confidence, particularly on reducing energy costs.

Said the company’s president for UK & Ireland, Belgium & Netherlands: “The Industrial Strategy is an important policy milestone, and it provides much-needed business clarity and confidence for investment. The Government’s focus on reducing energy costs is a welcome relief, as high energy bills are one of the biggest barriers to UK industrial growth.”

And Minesh Shah, fund manager of The Renewable Infrastructure Group (TRIG):

“Government’s commitment to make access to reliable, low carbon energy the centrepiece of its industrial strategy is welcome.

“For the UK to grow and compete on the world stage – the ultimate aim here – we need plentiful, low-carbon power and the right grid infrastructure to support it, and we need it now. This is key to attracting the job-creating, high-innovation sectors of tomorrow, as well as keeping legacy industries onshore and thriving.”

Erika Wilson, who is the president of trade association BEAMA, representing manufacturers of electrical products, said the plan marks a “significant and welcome development for our sector … marking the most substantial collaboration between government and industry to date.

“It paves the way for a more stable and attractive investment environment.”

Indeed, things look quite positive.

But more is needed

Despite how comprehensive the plan may be, this does not mean it’s a perfect setup.

For example, some people argue that it’s short-termism in its provisions to lower energy bills for businesses.

Take Phil Thompson, CEO of Balance Power, who says that although exemptions from environmental levies offer some immediate relief, “they don’t tackle the root of the energy cost problem – continued reliance on an overworked and over-constrained grid system.”

Rather, he adds, “the most effective long-term method to bring down costs, cut carbon emissions, and build energy resilience, is to encourage businesses to generate their own renewable energy onsite.”

On the other end, said Schneider Electric’s Becker: “…with the new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme not being in place until 2027, businesses need support now.

“The technologies already exist to manage energy and reduce costs – increased uptake of these should be supported to help all businesses, not just those eligible under the new scheme.”

Additionally, for Caroline Bragg, CEO of heat networks and demand-side energy sector non-profit trade body ADE, although the strategy sets out positive steps, “details on funding remain vague, a concern heightened by the recent Spending Review.

“Only a small number of select businesses will qualify, sidelining thousands of businesses who desperately need support in the face of rising energy bills – particularly those businesses outside the Government’s industrial clusters.

“Ministers need to wake up, we cannot build a secure, affordable, low-carbon energy system while actively discouraging all the businesses that use it from investing in their future.”

Labour’s ambitious strategy for the UK is to be lauded, and with their recently announced plans to become a sustainable finance capital, it will be interesting to watch what projects receive the go-ahead and where investments will flow.

What do you think? Is the Strategy the gamechanger that the UK government and many industry players believe it to be? Will this investment certainty last?

Reach out and let me know your thoughts so that I can feature them in the Power Playbook.

Cheers,

Parks Alliance of Louisville, a plaintiff, lost a grant supporting the new Alberta O. Jones Park in the California neighborhood.

An EPA grant for studying air pollution near Rubbertown was also terminated, but the city's Air Pollution Control District is pursuing an administrative dispute with the agency over those lost funds.

The Parks Alliance of Louisville, Appalachian Voices and more than 20 other nonprofits, tribes and local governments across the country joined in a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, challenging its termination of $3 billion in federal grant funding.

The EPA's Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program, part of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, was designed to provide funding to local organizations and governments to mitigate health risks from extreme heat, wildfires, air pollution and other environmental threats in disadvantaged communities.

Under the Trump administration's broader push against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, the EPA has sought to ax this funding. At least $1.5 million has been terminated in Louisville so far, along with more throughout the Ohio River Valley.

The Southern Environmental Law Center, Earthjustice and others filed the complaint June 25 on behalf of plaintiffs like the Parks Alliance, and are seeking class action status for other recipients affected by roughly 350 grant terminations.

The complaint argues the EPA lacks the authority to cancel congressionally appropriated funding, and by doing so ""has harmed and continues to harm"" communities across the country vulnerable to pollution and other threats.

From February onward, the EPA slashed environmental justice grants ""without any assessment of the consequences of its actions, and without any attempt to otherwise execute Congress's directive or administer its appropriations,"" the complaint alleges.

Trump's EPA has painted environmental justice funding as wasteful spending in past statements, and has worked with the Department of Government Efficiency to slash it.

The agency declined to comment on pending litigation. The recent suit is not the first to challenge the EPA over grant terminations, and some federal judges have found the agency's actions unlawful.

""We are happy to be going to bat, not just for our own grant and the communities it serves, but for this program as a whole that supports similar work in rural communities, cities, and suburbs from coast to coast,"" Appalachian Voices Executive Director Tom Cormons said in a statement. ""The program is written into law by Congress, and it’s the EPA's job to follow the law and implement it.""

Federal cuts with local impacts

The Parks Alliance was using environmental justice funding to support planning, programming, community engagement and stewardship at the new Alberta O. Jones Park in Louisville's California neighborhood, where residents ― 90% of whom are Black ― have long struggled with urban heat and a lack of green space.

In February, the nonprofit learned most of its $500,000 grant had been terminated. It laid off a newly hired park superintendent, and had to retrench plans for establishing programs at the new park.

""This isn't just another budget line item disappearing,"" Brooke Pardue, president and CEO of the Parks Alliance, said in a statement. ""We've had to reduce staff and adjust programming. We've been forced to scale back plans to expand access to greenspace in one of the city's most underserved neighborhoods that is severely impacted by urban heat island effect. And we're having to stretch every dollar even further at a time when operating costs are already extremely tight.""

Majority-Black neighborhoods in Louisville's West End and impoverished communities in Eastern Kentucky were among those eligible for environmental justice funding. (Earlier this year, online tools to identify these communities were taken down by the EPA, but recreations of the maps are still available.)

""Environmental justice grants were created to address the real harm to public health in communities of color and low-wealth communities,"" Kym Meyer, litigation director for SELC, said in a statement. ""The communities were promised transformative funding to address generations of injustice and now that's being taken away.""

This spring, the EPA terminated a grant for air monitoring in Louisville communities near Rubbertown with a long history of air pollution and health concerns, calling it wasteful spending. The life expectancy in some of these neighborhoods is as low as 65 years, according to city data, and rates of asthma, heart disease and other conditions are steep.

Louisville's Air Pollution Control District opted to challenge the grant termination through an ""internal process"" with the EPA, the Kentucky Lantern reported. The district was not named as a plaintiff in the recent suit.

""The District is still working through EPA's administrative dispute process,"" APCD spokesperson Matt Mudd said in an email.

Kitsault Energy Pipeline Route

Best Cure Pro Health

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, June 26, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a pivotal moment for Canada’s future, the nation is making strides to reduce its reliance on the United States for energy exports and elevate its role on the global stage. Krishnan Suthanthiran, President and Founder of TeamBest Global Companies and the Global Best Cure Foundation, has been waiting for this moment. With over half a century of experience in healthcare, Suthanthiran has long been committed to improving lives, and now he is bringing this same dedication to Canada’s energy sector.

Since January 2013, Suthanthiran has been working on his vision for an energy pipeline corridor, energy export, and terminal to carry Canada’s energy products to Kitsault, British Columbia, a private town he owns. Located just northwest of Prince Rupert, BC, Kitsault is poised to be the hub for Canada’s energy future, bringing new opportunities to the region and contributing to an energy economy. With state-of-the-art housing facilities for nearly 1,000 personnel of Kitsault Energy (KE), the project promises to fuel Canada’s transition to a more sustainable energy future.

Canada’s political landscape is abuzz with discussions of energy infrastructure, with meetings, conferences, and think tanks exploring solutions for the country’s energy future. Among these conversations, Suthanthiran and his team are actively involved, supporting initiatives such as the Indigenous Resource Opportunities Conference, the BC Natural Resources Forum, and Canada 2020.

In particular, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has shown interest in building a pipeline from Alberta to the Port of Prince Rupert, which would enable more crude oil to be exported to Asia. Of all the proposed pipeline projects for the BC/Canada west coast, the Spectra/Enbridge pipeline from Alberta to Kitsault/Observatory Inlet stands out as the most economically viable and environmentally responsible option. With fewer disruptions to population centers, the pipeline promises to minimize environmental impact while maximizing economic potential.

KE will also use its dedicated export port and terminal at Observatory Inlet to transport energy to Asia. This critical infrastructure will open new markets, bringing billions of dollars in tax revenue to Alberta, British Columbia, and the federal government of Canada, while creating thousands of high-paying jobs. The project is expected to significantly bolster Canadian energy companies, offering new opportunities for growth and innovation, and reducing the discount and shipping costs significantly, thereby increasing revenues and profits substantially.

Economic and Social Opportunities for First Nations Communities:

The KE project isn’t just about economic development—it’s also about social responsibility. First Nations communities in the region will see immediate benefits, including new educational and job training centers and state-of-the-art housing facilities. Through the Best Cure Foundation Non-profit organization, KE will also provide proactive, preventive, primary medical, dental, and eye care wellness centers/services to First Nations communities. This commitment to healthcare and community empowerment is an integral part of Suthanthiran’s vision for a brighter, more inclusive future for all Canadians.

With this ambitious project, Canada is positioning itself to take control of its super power vision by increasing production and diversifying its customer base to play a larger role on the world stage. As the global energy landscape shifts, Krishnan Suthanthiran’s vision for Kitsault Energy is set to play a key role in shaping the future of Canada’s energy sector.

For industrials, energy, and tech, the next 60 days could determine years of profitability.","The Senate's “One Big Beautiful Bill” is shaping up to be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades, with its permanent corporate tax cuts and debt ceiling deadlines creating a once-in-a-generation catalyst for investors. While partisan squabbles and economic risks loom, the clock is ticking: the Treasury warns of an “X date” debt default as early as August 2025, and corporate CFOs are already pricing in the bill's passage. For investors, the urgency is clear: sectors like industrials, energy, and tech stand to gain the most from permanent tax breaks—and the window to capitalize is narrowing fast.

The Tax Bill's Near-Term Catalyst: Permanent Cuts Over Temporary Gains

At its core, the bill offers permanence where there was once uncertainty. By extending provisions like bonus depreciation and full expensing for R&D, it removes the risk of corporations facing sudden tax hikes after 2025. For industries with high capital expenditures—think construction equipment, renewable energy infrastructure, or semiconductor fabrication—this is a game-changer.

The Tax Foundation estimates the bill could boost GDP by 1.1% and create 868,000 jobs in the long run, driven by reduced costs for companies to invest. But the near-term impact is even more compelling: CFOs are already adjusting strategies. A survey of corporate finance leaders found 86% expect the bill to pass, with 64% warning that tariffs and inflation could otherwise derail growth. This confidence is reflected in market behavior.

Industrials like Caterpillar, which rely on heavy machinery and infrastructure projects, could see immediate benefits from the 100% expensing for qualifying structures (extended through 2031). Similarly, energy firms such as Chevron (CVX) stand to gain from the restoration of clean fuel production credits (Section 45K), which were preserved in the bill despite cuts to green subsidies.

Energy: Navigating the Green vs. Fossil Crossroads

The bill's treatment of energy is a microcosm of its broader trade-offs. While it repeals EV incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, it retains credits for clean fuels and R&D in fossil fuels. This creates a nuanced opportunity: investors should favor companies that can leverage both traditional and emerging energy technologies.

Take Chevron or Exxon Mobil (XOM), which have invested in carbon capture and hydrogen projects. Their ability to access R&D tax breaks while maintaining dominance in oil and gas could position them as winners. Meanwhile, NextEra Energy (NEE), a renewable leader, might struggle if the bill's green credit cuts hit its project economics—but its scale and diversification provide a cushion.

Tech: The R&D Tax Credit as a Growth Multiplier

The bill's permanent restoration of immediate expensing for domestic R&D is a lifeline for tech giants and startups alike. For companies like NVIDIA (NVDA) or Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which pour billions into semiconductor design and AI research, this reduces their effective tax rate and accelerates innovation cycles.

The Tax Foundation's analysis shows middle-income workers (a key consumer demographic) will see the largest income gains by 2026—a tailwind for tech firms selling consumer electronics, cloud services, or AI tools. Yet the sector's valuation risks remain: CFOs cite tariff-driven inflation as a 72% likelihood to resurge, which could pressure margins unless companies pass costs to customers.

The Debt Ceiling Deadline: A Sword of Damocles or a Buying Opportunity?

The Senate's goal to vote by late June is ambitious, given House-Senate disagreements over social programs and the SALT deduction. But the Treasury's “X date” deadline creates a powerful incentive to resolve differences by mid-July, with Congress possibly extending the timeline to September.

Investors should treat this as a “buy the dip” scenario: if the bill falters in June, sectors like industrials and tech—already priced for passage—could dip, offering a lower entry point. However, the risks are real: a missed deadline could trigger a recession, per the CFO survey's 55% consensus.

A Portfolio Strategy for the Tax Bill Era

Industrials: Overweight in machinery and construction (CAT, Deere (DE)), which benefit from expensing structures.

Energy: Focus on diversified players (CVX, XOM) with exposure to both traditional and clean energy credits.

Tech: Prioritize R&D-heavy firms (NVDA, AMD) and avoid pure-play EV stocks if green credits are slashed.

Cash Reserves: Maintain 10–15% in Treasuries to hedge against a potential recession or legislative delay.

Final Call: Act Before the Clock Runs Out

The Senate's tax bill is a bet on growth, and markets are pricing in its passage. Investors who wait for certainty risk missing the rally. With the debt ceiling deadline looming, the window to lock in these tax breaks—and their economic multiplier effects—is closing. For industrials, energy, and tech, the next 60 days could determine years of profitability.

Investors seeking exposure to EV supply chains should consider overweighting AXLE now, with a price target reflecting its EV driveline upside.","The global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is reshaping the automotive supply chain, and few companies are better positioned to capitalize on this shift than American Axle & Manufacturing (AXLE). The Detroit-based Tier 1 supplier recently announced a pivotal supply agreement with Scout Motors, a U.S.-focused EV startup, to provide electric drive units (EDUs) and e-Beam axles for Scout's upcoming Traveler SUV and Terra pickup truck. This deal underscores AXLE's growing role as a leader in advanced EV driveline systems and its strategic bet on the resurgence of American manufacturing—a theme amplified by federal incentives and onshoring trends.

Technical Leadership in EV Driveline Systems

The partnership with Scout Motors highlights AXLE's expertise in integrating electric motors, inverters, and transmissions into compact, high-performance systems. The front EDUs and rear e-Beam axles it will supply are critical to the Traveler and Terra's drivetrain, enabling both 100% battery-electric and range-extended (EREV) configurations. These components represent a significant step forward in EV driveline efficiency, combining power density and lightweight design to enhance range and performance.

AXLE's CEO David C. Dauch emphasized the partnership's symbolic and practical significance: “We are honored to support the rebirth of the iconic Scout brand… with AAM's award-winning electric drive technology.” This statement underscores AXLE's technical prowess and its alignment with brands prioritizing American engineering—a strategic advantage in an industry increasingly focused on domestic production.

Domestic Manufacturing Resurgence and Federal Incentives

The Scout deal also positions AXLE to benefit from broader trends in onshoring and federal support for EVs. Scout's $2 billion manufacturing complex in South Carolina—backed by Volkswagen Group and leveraging Rivian's software—aligns with the Biden administration's push for domestic EV production through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). AXLE's U.S. facilities, including its Detroit headquarters and over 75 global operations, will be key to fulfilling this demand.

Crucially, the IRA's tax credits for EVs assembled in North America and containing domestic battery materials directly favor suppliers like AXLE, which can secure long-term contracts by meeting stringent localization requirements. The Scout agreement, with production slated to begin in 2027, is a harbinger of AXLE's ability to scale its EV driveline business as automakers shift toward body-on-frame EVs—a segment underserved by competitors focused on unibody platforms.

Investment Thesis: Underappreciated EV Exposure and Durable Growth

AXLE's stock has lagged broader market gains in recent quarters, partially due to macroeconomic uncertainty and sector volatility. However, the Scout deal signals a structural growth opportunity often overlooked by investors. Here's why it's compelling now:

Undervalued EV Exposure: While AXLE is traditionally known for driveline systems in combustion vehicles, its EV driveline business is underappreciated. The Scout agreement—combined with existing contracts for GM's Hummer EV and other programs—positions it to capture 20%+ annual revenue growth in this segment through 2027.

Body-on-Frame EV Demand: Body-on-frame architectures dominate the rugged truck/SUV market, which remains EV's fastest-growing segment. AXLE's e-axle systems are uniquely suited to these vehicles, giving it a first-mover advantage over peers still optimizing for smaller EVs.

IRA Tailwinds: AXLE's U.S. manufacturing footprint and focus on localized supply chains put it in position to qualify for IRA tax credits, reducing costs for customers and enhancing competitiveness.

Near-Term Catalysts: With Scout reservations open and production starting in 2027, visibility into future revenue streams is improving. AXLE's 2025 financial outlook ($5.8–$6.05B sales, $700–$760M Adjusted EBITDA) suggests the company is scaling profitably.

Risks and Considerations

Execution Risk: Delays in Scout's production timeline or cost overruns could pressure margins.

Competition: EV driveline suppliers like BorgWarner (BWA) and Dana Incorporated (DCN) are expanding rapidly.

Policy Uncertainty: IRA eligibility criteria may shift, though AXLE's domestic focus mitigates this risk.

Conclusion: A Buy at Current Levels

AXLE is a rare play on two critical trends: the EV driveline revolution and the return of American manufacturing. While sector volatility may persist, the Scout deal and IRA tailwinds create a durable growth profile. At current prices—roughly 10x 2025 EBITDA estimates—AXLE offers a compelling risk/reward. Investors seeking exposure to EV supply chains should consider overweighting AXLE now, with a price target reflecting its EV driveline upside.

Recommendation: Buy AXLE. Hold for 12–18 months as EV demand and domestic manufacturing contracts solidify.

Three other states led by Republicans— Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee— have passed similar legislation. In some Democratic-led states, there have been efforts to phase out natural gas. New York and California cities like San Francisco and Berkeley have moved to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings, though some of these policies have been successfully challenged in court.

President Donald Trump has signed a spate of executive orders promoting oil, gas and coal, which all warm the planet when burned to produce electricity. The European Union previously designated natural gas and nuclear as sustainable, a move that Greenpeace and the Austrian government are suing over.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a major booster of the state’s petrochemical industry, says the new law “sets the tone for the future” and will help the state “pursue energy independence and dominance.”

Environmental groups say these new laws are part of a broader push by petrochemical industry-backed groups to rebrand fossil fuel as climate friendly and head off efforts to shift electric grids to renewables, such as solar and wind. It’s “pure Orwellian greenwashing,” said Tim Donaghy, research director of Greenpeace USA.

Globally, the term green energy is used to refer to energy derived from natural sources that do not pollute — solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy. Louisiana’s law could enable funds slated for state clean energy initiatives to be used to support natural gas.

Natural gas has been the top source of electricity generation in the United States for about a decade, since surpassing coal. Coal and natural gas both produce carbon dioxide that warms the planet when burned, but coal produces over twice as much.

Switching from coal to natural gas lowers carbon dioxide emissions, but it can increase emissions of methane. The primary component of natural gas, methane is an extraordinarily powerful greenhouse gas, more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide and responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

Besides coal, everything else is better than gas for the planet, said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University climate scientist. Building new gas plants locks in fossil fuel emissions for decades, he added.

Redefining natural gas

Louisiana’s law orders state agencies and utilities regulators to “prioritize” natural gas, along with nuclear power, on the grounds that it will improve the affordability and reliability of the state’s electricity.

The law’s author, Republican Rep. Jacob Landry, runs an oil and gas industry consulting firm.

“I don’t think it’s anything crippling to wind or solar, but you got to realize the wind don’t blow all the time and the sun don’t shine every day,” Landry said. The legislation “is saying we need to prioritize what keeps the grid energized,” he added.

Landry told The Associated Press that he used a model bill by the American Legislative Exchange Council as a template. ALEC is a conservative think tank with ties to the oil and gas industry’s billionaire Koch family.

ALEC helped shape Ohio’s 2023 law to legally redefine natural gas as a source of green energy, according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and first reported by the Washington Post.

ALEC spokesperson Lars Dalseide said that just because an Ohio lawmaker left the 2022 ALEC convention with what he described as a model for legislation to define natural gas as clean energy does not mean the group shaped Ohio law. Dalseide said the convention is “a place where legislators from across the country gather to exchange ideas.”

Ohio’s legislation was also heavily influenced by an advocacy group led by Republican megadonor Tom Rastin, a now retired gas industry executive.

According to Dave Anderson, policy and communications manager for the Energy and Policy Institute, these laws are part of a long-running disinformation campaign by the gas industry to cast their product as clean to protect their businesses and prevent a shift to renewable energy sources that will address the climate crisis.

“The goal is to elbow out competition from renewables from wind and solar, and in some cases preempt localities’ ability to choose to pursue 100% truly clean energy,” Anderson said, adding that ALEC’s legislation makes natural gas “eligible for state and local clean energy standards and funding.”

Questions over grid reliability

Gov. Landry and other proponents of the new law said they want to make sure that residents and businesses have a reliable electric grid. Nearly 80% of Louisiana’s grid is already powered by natural gas.

Landry said that businesses will come to Louisiana if they know they can count on the state’s electric grid. He highlighted Meta’s plan to build a massive AI data center powered by three natural gas plants.

Louisiana’s law orders utilities providers to prioritize nuclear energy as well. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases while producing electricity. However, critics say it is more expensive than solar and wind and the U.S. does not have a sufficient long-term solution for storing the waste.

Consumer advocates say states do not need to embrace natural gas at the expense of wind, solar and other technologies to have a reliable grid.

Legally mandating that utilities prioritize natural gas is “blind to innovation, market evolution, and the practical demands of modern electric systems,” Jeffrey Clark, president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable energy advocacy group, wrote in a statement opposing Louisiana’s law.

It’s unclear to what extent Louisiana’s utilities regulators will act on the order to prioritize natural gas over renewable energy. While Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, a Democrat, called the law “unenforceable” and pledged to ignore it, his Republican counterpart Jean-Paul Coussan said promoting natural gas “aligns well” with the state’s economic growth.

Energy tax credits are a worthwhile investment in American competitiveness, American energy security, and American communities.
To achieve American energy dominance and usher in a new American golden age, Congress must protect these investments in American energy.","Last Updated on:

As negotiations on the reconciliation bill continue in Congress, many lawmakers are still looking for ways to raise additional revenue and offset the cost of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Clean energy tax credits, therefore, have become a target.

Despite the surge of new solar manufacturing facilities, billion-dollar investments, and new American jobs these credits have generated, some members of Congress still want to eliminate the pro-business credits in the hope that it will lower federal deficits in the long run.

This approach is misguided.

Not only would a repeal of the tax credits upend one of the greatest industrial revivals in American history, but the bill in its current form would not even achieve the budgetary saving that that its advocates are looking for.

Worse, it would shift these costs onto working families through higher electricity bills and onto state and local governments through reduced tax revenue.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette has estimated the federal, state and local tax revenues generated by the solar industry. SEIA combined these figures with estimates of increased electricity cost due to repeal of energy credits from the Brattle group and compared these figures to the savings estimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office. These combined figures show that solar tax credits create far more value for Americans than they cost the federal budget.

National Profit

Even when setting aside the new jobs, factories, and gigawatts delivered by solar, the industry has been a major boon for America’s finances.

In 2023 alone, solar added over $75.5 billion to America’s GDP. The sector paid $12 billion in federal taxes and $3.7 billion in state and local taxes that year. From social security taxes for employees to local property taxes that fund local police stations and firefighters, solar energy adding billions to government revenues each year.

In addition to taxes, solar and energy storage have also helped keep electricity prices down for consumers across the country. A study from the Brattle Group and ConservAmerica found that eliminating the clean energy tax credits would raise electricity costs by $51 billion, with certain states seeing bill increases of over $110 per year.

All together, Americans save $2.67 for every $1 spent on solar tax credits.

State Support

A repeal of the federal clean energy tax credits would also hollow out the economic engine of many states where solar energy has surged.

Many traditionally conservative states now credit a significant portion of their GDP to solar. The solar and storage industries contributed $3.4 billion in to the Texas economy and supported $159 million in state and local tax revenue in 2023. In Utah, $1.3 billion of the state’s economy comes from solar, similar to the economic impact of Utah farms. Solar sent $50 million to Indiana’s state and local taxes and added $652.7 million to its economy, comparable to the state’s air transportation industry.

In North Carolina and Georgia, significant investments in solar have added $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion to their states respectively. Solar has added $130.9 million to Maine’s economy, $126.7 million to Iowa’s GDP, $441.5 million to Louisiana’s GDP, and $1.6 billion to Ohio’s GDP.

The economic impacts of cutting energy credits would be devastating. As SEIA has shown, over 300 factories would close or never open, $286 billion in investment halt, and 330,000 American jobs would be lost.

What’s worse, even the purported budgetary benefits of reducing the deficit would be immediately neutralized by rising energy bills and revenue shortfalls among state and local governments.

Energy tax credits are a worthwhile investment in American competitiveness, American energy security, and American communities. Each dollar spent repays itself multiple times over.

To achieve American energy dominance and usher in a new American golden age, Congress must protect these investments in American energy.

The US$300 million Peregrine project was developed and is owned and operated by Arevon. Peregrine employed more than 90 full-time equivalent personnel at the height of construction and will disburse long-term property tax benefits estimated to total more than US$28 million over the life of the project.

The facility features modern lithium iron phosphate batteries which are the best in class regarding safety in operations. Arevon’s top priority is the safety of those who live and work in its project areas, and the company has operated its energy storage facilities in US communities since 2021 without a single thermal or recordable safety incident.

Kevin Smith, CEO at Arevon, responded: “The completion of Peregrine Energy Storage is a result of the collaborative efforts of the project’s stakeholders and the local community who collectively support California’s renewable energy goals. Peregrine signifies Arevon’s ongoing commitment to energy storage and its importance in ensuring a reliable, stable energy system, as well as to advancing domestically-made energy in the state and throughout the country.”

Utility-scale battery systems allow electricity to be stored and then efficiently discharged into the grid. Peregrine enhances grid stability and will reduce the risk of brownouts and blackouts by storing electricity and providing it during high demand intervals to prevent power outages.

Energy storage projects like Peregrine also facilitate the addition of further renewable energy projects on the grid by directing energy to storage generated during low demand periods to meet peak demand later in the day. During peak electricity demand, Peregrine can power up to 200 000 homes for two hours per day. The delivery of more electricity supply to the grid during peak periods can also moderate peak electricity prices paid by customers.

Namaste Solar, an employee-owned cooperative and Certified B Corporation, installed a 333.54-kilowatt rooftop solar system at Boulder Mod, a modular home factory at 6500 Arapahoe Road. The facility is a joint project of the City of Boulder, Boulder Valley School District and Flatirons Habitat for Humanity. It produces energy-efficient, all-electric modular homes that are permanently affordable for low- to middle-income households.

The solar project supports Boulder’s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030 and achieve net-zero status by 2035. The system is designed to offset the factory’s total electricity use. City officials said the savings on utility costs will be reinvested in housing programs.

“This project exemplifies the powerful intersection of renewable energy and community development,” said Jay Sugnet, senior planner for the City of Boulder and project manager for the factory. “By integrating solar energy into Boulder Mod, we’re not only reducing our carbon footprint but also supporting the production of affordable, energy-efficient homes that our community urgently needs.”

The Boulder Mod project is the latest chapter in the city’s long-standing partnership with Namaste Solar. In 2020, the company installed 13 solar systems across municipal buildings, including parking garages and water facilities.

The new installation supports more than 20 clean energy jobs at Namaste Solar and was partially funded through incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. That legislation introduced “elective pay,” allowing non-taxable entities such as municipalities to access tax rebates for clean energy projects. Boulder also received funding through Xcel Energy’s Solar*Rewards C&I Income-Qualified and Disproportionately Impacted Communities program.

In total, the project secured a $333,540 grant from the Energy Impact Offset Fund, a city program requiring cannabis cultivators to offset 100% of their energy use.

“Municipalities have more options than ever to leverage solar energy to reduce costs and protect against rising energy expenses,” said Rachel Mountain, co-owner and director of commercial sales at Namaste Solar. “This project is a shining example of how renewable energy can empower cities to achieve their climate goals while supporting innovative programs like Boulder Mod. It’s a win-win for the community and the environment.”

According to industry’s own data, over 90 percent of coal plants have reported groundwater contamination from their coal ash storage sites.
While using encapsulated coal ash in construction materials can be a good recycling method for this waste, using unencapsulated coal ash as ground fill is not.
We’d see an increase in black lung disease in young people, more air pollution related deaths, and increased cancer rates from exposure to coal ash fill.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) delivered the following opening remarks today as prepared for delivery at an Environment Subcommittee hearing on “A Decade Later: A Review of Congressional Action, Environmental Protection Agency Rules, and Beneficial Use Opportunities for Coal Ash”:

Today, the Subcommittee is examining coal ash regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Coal ash is a waste product generated from burning coal for energy. It is radioactive and contains toxic contaminants like arsenic, lead, mercury, and chromium. Some power plants dispose of coal ash in surface impoundments, storing the waste in ponds at operating or inactive facilities. This poses serious risks to the surrounding communities – threatening human health and the environment. Contaminants can leach into groundwater and drinking water supplies or become airborne as toxic dust. Aging or deficient impoundments can fail structurally, resulting in catastrophic floods of toxic sludge entering neighboring communities.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first determined that national disposal criteria were needed for coal ash 25 years ago. This led to regulations starting in 2015, and then Congress acted nine years ago with passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act. This law gave states the ability to create their own coal ash management programs, as long as they provide equal or greater protection to federal standards. And last year, EPA finally updated their rule to include all the legacy coal ash waste sites under their purview.

The passage of this law now provides us many data points to measure the success of state and federal regulations to manage coal ash waste and protect surrounding communities. Unfortunately, the data doesn’t paint a good picture. There have been countless examples of weak state enforcement, large scale releases of toxic sludge, and public health harms.

According to industry’s own data, over 90 percent of coal plants have reported groundwater contamination from their coal ash storage sites. We still see coal ash stored in unlined pits that leach into groundwater or that gets blown into neighboring communities.

To protect the health and safety of those living near coal ash sites, we need strong federal standards for the disposal and management of this toxic waste, and strong enforcement of those standards at the state and federal levels.

But EPA’s budget proposal and staffing cuts make it clear that federal enforcement is not a priority. The Trump Administration is hurting EPA’s ability to ensure coal ash disposal and pollution do not put Americans’ health at risk. At a time when the Administration should be ensuring states are following the law, EPA Administrator Zeldin is instead turning over responsibility of coal ash management to states. This is an outrageous abdication of responsibility considering the well-documented pattern of states allowing this toxic pollution to continue unabated.

The Republican Majority is also likely to discuss the beneficial uses of coal ash and explore additional opportunities to divert more of this waste from ponds or landfills. I agree that coal ash recycling helps decrease Americans’ exposure to this toxic substance, but it is critical that we follow the science to ensure the uses don’t cause further harm and contamination. While using encapsulated coal ash in construction materials can be a good recycling method for this waste, using unencapsulated coal ash as ground fill is not. And while pilot projects extracting critical minerals from coal ash are promising, they should not be touted as a reason to prop-up uneconomic, outdated, and high-polluting coal power plants.

As we discuss this issue, let’s not forget the broader legacy of coal and what any possible resurgence would mean for communities across the country. We’d see an increase in black lung disease in young people, more air pollution related deaths, and increased cancer rates from exposure to coal ash fill. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past, in hopes of a different outcome.

I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and yield back the balance of my time.

All of these countries used wind and solar to produce at least one-third of their electricity in 2024, according to a new report from the Energy Institute. For leading countries such as Denmark, Djibouti, and Lithuania, that figure was in the range of two-thirds or more.

Those numbers are much higher than the global average: Overall last year, wind and solar accounted for 15% of global power generation, up from 13% in 2023.

To be clear, China is still by far the largest producer of solar and wind energy in the world in terms of volume. The country generated 1,836 terawatt-hours of wind and solar last year. All of Europe, for comparison, generated 990 TWh over the same period. But despite that huge amount of renewable energy generation, China received a much lower share of its power from solar and wind in 2024 than the 10 countries on this list — just about 18%.

The list is mostly populated by smaller countries, but it does include some large economies like Germany and Spain. In Germany, wind and solar accounted for a combined 43% of power. In Spain, 42%.

Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.

The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.

But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.

Here’s a closer look:

How does the process work?

Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.

Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped — usually through a pipeline — to a location where it’s injected deep underground for long-term storage.

Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.

Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.

The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves — meaning it’s not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

How much carbon dioxide is captured?

The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.

Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, “in practice, that has never happened,” said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project’s Oil & Gas Watch.

That’s because it’s difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it’s emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.

Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it’s less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.

A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that’s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.

About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide — a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.

It’s an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world’s largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.

Future of US tax credits is unclear

Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.

“It’s not a substitution for renewables … it’s just a complementary technology,” Nepal said. “It’s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.”

Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won’t be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.

They remain in the Senate Finance Committee’s draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.

“If senators really thought this was game over [for 45V] and they didn’t want to waste time on hydrogen, they would be telegraphing that,” he added.
The hydrogen industry has been actively working to “reinforce the merits of the industry” to the Trump administration since before the inauguration, Wolak explained.
For one thing, the hydrogen industry is smaller and more nascent, and is entirely aligned on a single ask: Extend the 45V credit to December 31, 2029.
“The Senate and House were not going to want to litigate among the industry,” Wolak explained.","As Congress gets close to its self-imposed July 4 deadline for finalizing a reconciliation bill, one nascent corner of the clean energy economy is feeling optimistic about its chances.

The entire hydrogen industry is tightly aligned on preserving the 45V tax credit for another five years, said Frank Wolak, who leads the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association. They’re executing a “surgical” approach to achieve that end, he said — and are gaining traction, Wolak said.

“If senators really thought this was game over [for 45V] and they didn’t want to waste time on hydrogen, they would be telegraphing that,” he added. Instead, he said, key lawmakers are still taking the industry’s calls and meeting with them during fly-ins.

The version of the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed by the House proposed ending the credit at the end of 2025. The Senate finance committee’s markup suggested a phase-out, also starting this year.

The hydrogen industry has been actively working to “reinforce the merits of the industry” to the Trump administration since before the inauguration, Wolak explained. But in the past few weeks the strategy has sharpened and the messaging has changed, he added, to something “much more tactical.”

Meetings with stakeholders on Capitol Hill have evolved: from a focus on the broad value of developing hydrogen markets and jobs, to prioritizing states that have a vested interest in sustaining hydrogen work already underway. That includes places like Louisiana, West Virginia, Texas, and Utah, all of which are part of federally funded hydrogen hubs. (The hub stakeholders themselves have also been active in rallying behind 45V, and last week all seven signed onto a letter last week urging the Senate to maintain the credit, arguing it is essential to the success of the projects.)

An intense focus on those states has brought more senators “into the fold,” Wolak said. The initial target list included Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy (R), a longtime hydrogen advocate who argued the Biden administration’s clean hydrogen definitions made it too hard for U.S. producers to qualify for 45V, and West Virginia Sen. Shelly Capito (R), who has been a strong advocate for the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub.

“What’s happened over the past several weeks is the list of senators…who have been very interested in the subject but we couldn’t tell whether they wanted to weigh in or not…starting to weigh in,” Wolak said. That includes West Virginia’s Jim Justice, Louisiana’s John Kennedy, and Texas’ John Cornyn, as well asUtah’s John Curtis, Kansas’ Jerry Moran, and Pennsylvania’s Dave McCormick, all Republicans.

“McCormick is someone who’s kind of come into the fold, who was on the fence,” Wolak explained. Pennsylvania is set to house portions of two federally funded hydrogen hubs — the Mid-Atlantic Hub and the Appalachian Hub. McCormick, who was elected to the Senate last year, chairs the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources’ subcommittee on energy, has focused on “unleashing” oil and gas production in the state. But according to Wolak, McCormick “realized quickly that he could be supportive.”

A ‘simple ask’

In the wake of November’s elections, the domestic hydrogen sector was generally optimistic that the tax credit would remain intact, in large part because hydrogen has long enjoyed bipartisan support. At the time, they were much more worried about the still-unresolved guidelines about which projects could qualify for the 45V credit, and the potential for litigation when the rules were finalized.

As Jacob Susman, CEO of developer Ambient Fuels, put it to Latitude Media last fall, “we don’t think they’re coming for hydrogen first.”

The version of the reconciliation bill passed by the House in May, of course, rendered much of the 45V debate extraneous, at least in the short term. The draft terminates the credit for any facilities not already under construction by the end of 2025, an extremely challenging timeline for massive industrial projects — and one that essentially knocks the hubs out of the running.

In the wake of that bill, the hydrogen industry has put any discussion over the guidance specifics to the side, and has instead focused on educating key senators on “the real cost benefit” of hydrogen projects, Wolak said.

It’s a strategy that is quite distinct from broader, clean energy sector work to shore up support.

For one thing, the hydrogen industry is smaller and more nascent, and is entirely aligned on a single ask: Extend the 45V credit to December 31, 2029.

“The Senate and House were not going to want to litigate among the industry,” Wolak explained. “There was a lot of pressure from congressional and Senate supporters to come in with a common ask…not hearing different things from different people.” The small nature of the hydrogen sector meant that the coalition “came to consensus” on that ask relatively quickly, he added.

Funding for the hydrogen hubs, though essential for the industry, isn’t part of that ask, partly because the fate of federal funding for those projects will be determined by the Department of Energy.

“The messaging that we’re doing about the value of 45V and the communication that’s going on with congressional leaders who have an interest in the hubs kind of ties together,” Wolak said. “We don’t want to lose the funding for the hubs…but it’s a little different from the Big Beautiful Bill that actually has language that eliminates the tax credit.”

But there are a few other key messages that Wolak said are resonating with their target list of Senators.

The first is about the threat of China. Unlike the solar manufacturing sector and others in clean energy, the hydrogen sector is arguing that “there’s still a chance, if we maintain stability, to get out ahead of China,” Wolak said. “Ceding American leadership gets a reaction.”

When it comes to hydrogen, he added, “there can still be a return on investment in the U.S., and that’s a different story than just the solar jobs, or the value to the grid.”

The other key message, Wolak said, comes down to cost compared to local economic impact: 45V is a $7 billion line item in a $3 trillion bill. In the wider context of the bill, and compared to some other IRA tax credits, 45V just isn’t that expensive, he added. And the industry hopes that will make saving it an easier sell to a few Senators.

“You don’t need to message that to 50 Senators,” he added. “You just need a handful to make sure it’s high priority and find room for it.”

At a crossroads

The domestic hydrogen sector is overall “optimistic” that the final version of the bill will expand 45V’s timeline, Wolak said. That said, they are also clear-eyed about the fact that the outcome of the bill will almost single-handedly determine what happens next for domestic hydrogen.

If the tax credit is extended to meet the industry’s ask, Wolak said, it will allow enough projects to “matriculate” that the beginnings of a strong U.S. industry will emerge, “whether it’s ammonia, whether it’s direct hydrogen, whether it’s e-fuels…you’ll see that activity happen because the credit is valuable.”

If Congress ultimately decides to stick to initial drafts and cut 45V off for projects that don’t break ground before the end of the year, the domestic market will rapidly become “stagnant,” he added

“You’ll have an industry where there [is] investment poised to come in to take part in an American market, and American companies who are looking to build upon a U.S. market,” he said. “And they’re going to have to look for opportunities overseas for developing markets that are continuing to grow hydrogen.”

Some domestic activity of course will continue, though it won’t be the same.

“Companies are going to do pilot projects, they’re going to continue to research,” Wolak added. “But it will be an industry in idle compared to the rest of the world.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-06-26T151928.148.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 07:03:55.691441

EV battery pack costs falling below USD 100/kWh is a significant step toward broad EV adoption.","By Shubhendra Anand , 27 June, 2025

The global electric vehicle (EV) industry has reached a pivotal milestone. The average price of lithium-ion battery packs has dropped below the USD 100 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) threshold, a benchmark long considered critical for achieving price parity between EVs and conventional gasoline-powered cars. This significant development is poised to accelerate the mass adoption of EVs worldwide.

This trend is expected to continue in 2025, further solidifying EVs' competitiveness. Several factors have contributed to the decline in battery prices, including overcapacity in cell manufacturing, economies of scale, reduced prices for raw materials such as lithium, and the increased adoption of cost-effective lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. These factors are anticipated to drive further reductions in battery costs by 2025, making EVs more accessible to a broader consumer base.

China has emerged as the dominant force in the global battery market, producing more than three-quarters of all batteries sold worldwide. In 2024, China's average battery pack prices dropped faster than any other region, falling nearly 30 percent to USD 94/kWh. This price point is significantly lower than in Europe and North America, where battery packs are 31 percent and 48 percent more expensive, respectively.

China's leadership in battery production is expected to continue in 2025, influencing global pricing trends and encouraging other regions to enhance their manufacturing capabilities. The affordability of batteries in China has been a significant factor in making many EV models more cost-competitive than their internal combustion engine counterparts. This price advantage has spurred domestic sales and favored Chinese manufacturers in the global market.

In February 2024, BYD delivered 322,846 EVs, and XPeng delivered 570 percent more. Chinese manufacturers' worldwide expansion is likely to continue in 2025. Lithium prices decreased 85 percent from their high in 2022, lowering battery costs. Reducing raw material costs has helped battery producers offer more competitive prices.

The EV sector may profit from stable raw material costs by 2025. Despite these advances, the global battery production environment confronts overcapacity and the need for technical innovation. More than 2.5 times the yearly lithium-ion battery demand, the worldwide battery-cell production capacity was 3.1 TWh in 2024. Overcapacity may enhance manufacturer competitiveness and drive in costs. Companies may optimize output in 2025 to balance supply and demand.

Battery costs are falling rapidly, and China dominates the industry, creating possibilities and difficulties for other areas. European carmakers face trade difficulties, Chinese competitiveness, and the complicated electric vehicle transition. Renault has overcome structural problems, proving that more minor carmakers can pursue profitability-focused strategies. European manufacturers should boost EV market competitiveness in 2025.

Continued investment in R&D, manufacturing process improvements, and supply chain capacity growth could lower battery costs. Next-generation technologies like solid-state electrolytes and cathode materials could lower prices in the future decade.

These advancements might make EVs more accessible and sustainable by 2025. EV battery pack costs falling below USD 100/kWh is a significant step toward broad EV adoption. China's battery manufacturing and price dominance highlight the global market's competitiveness, forcing other areas to innovate and adapt to electric mobility's quick evolution. By 2025, these developments will impact transportation, with EVs becoming more accessible to customers globally.",https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/uploads/new_news_image/EV_Revolution_Battery_Prices_Drop.png,N,,2025-06-27 10:06:32.294784

After President Donald Trump announced the United States’ potential withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the pressure on U.S. companies to reduce their emissions has lowered, Parsons said. Due to this, some of the biggest asset managers, such as BlackRock, J.P. Morgan and State Street, have withdrawn from climate initiatives, causing them to collapse, he said.

Texas financial agencies were required to divest from BlackRock Inc. when it was added to the comptroller’s list in 2022. The Texas Permanent School Fund pulled a $8.5 billion investment in BlackRock to comply with the list, according to a 2024 statement by Aaron Kinsey, chairman of the State Board of Education. However, because of BlackRock’s changes in policy, these agencies can now resume their investments.

BlackRock Inc. transferred its participation in the Climate Action 100+ to a subsidiary under the name of BlackRock International in February 2024, according to a letter to the Climate Action 100+ Steering Committee. This made the firm no longer a full member of the initiative, which holds the largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters responsible for their actions against the environment.

BlackRock Inc. later withdrew entirely from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative in January 2025, which supported the goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to a BlackRock Inc. announcement. BlackRock also changed its policies to limit support for activists calling for reduced fossil fuel investments, according to a Hegar statement.

“Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” NZAM wrote in an update.

BlackRock wrote in a statement that its participation in various climate finance organizations over the last few years has caused confusion regarding the company’s practices and subjected the firm to legal inquiries from various public officials.

Hegar wrote that BlackRock is engaging in a “more intellectually honest conversation” by acknowledging the real social and economic costs that come from limiting investment in the oil and gas industry in Texas and across the globe.

“My team worked tirelessly to create a transparent process that gave companies a clear understanding of how they got on our list and a definitive path to removal,” Hegar said. “We never set out to punish any of these firms, and the hope was always that any firm we included on the list would eventually take steps to ensure they were removed.”

The utility-scale energy storage market added 1,558 MW of capacity in Q1 2025, a 57% year-over-year (YoY) increase. Deployments rose 33% to 4,078 MWh from 3,056 MWh in the same period of the previous year.

California led with 457 MW of installed capacity, followed by Indiana with 256 MW. Arizona and Texas added 255 MW each, and Nevada 200 MW. Texas led this quarter in terms of project count with eight projects installed, followed by California, where the biggest project, with 240 MW of capacity, was brought online.

Residential energy storage posted the highest relative growth across all segments. Installed power capacity rose 82% to 458 MWh in Q1 2025 from 252 MWh in Q1 2024. Energy capacity grew to 893 MWh from 516 MWh, a 73% YoY increase. The residential segment continued to grow with expansion in the California and Puerto Rico markets. These two markets contributed 74% to the overall growth.

Illinois emerged as a new market with net billing, although attachment rates have not yet reached the anticipated levels. Like with other segments, there are continued efforts across the country to take advantage of existing tax credits this year while they remain available.

The commercial, community, and industrial (CCI) segment also recorded gains. Power capacity additions increased to 26 MW in Q1 2025, up from 19 MW in Q1 2024, representing a 33% jump. Energy capacity additions increased by 6%, rising to 63 MWh from 59 MWh over the same period.

The California CCI sector is struggling as the state faces challenges from the slow adoption of NEM 3.0 projects. Additionally, the limited number of new community storage projects this quarter hindered growth in the segment.

A key growth driver in this quarter was the decline in system costs. The average price of utility-scale battery systems fell to $874/kW in Q1 2025, down from $1,165/kW in Q1 2024. This represents a 25% reduction, which has helped improve the economics of storage projects and broadened deployment across market segments.

The pipeline for future utility-scale projects also expanded. By the end of Q1 2025, the total utility-scale segment pipeline stood at 603 GW. This pipeline includes 127 GW of projects in Wood Mackenzie’s database and 476 GW in interconnection queues. The total represents a 12% increase from Q1 2024, which had a pipeline of 538 GW.

Outlook

Across all segments, 15.2 GW/48.7 GWh of capacity will be added in 2025. In the near term, all segments of the energy storage market are expected to face policy-related challenges. Despite this issue, cumulative installations are projected to reach 79.8 GW and 289.4 GWh.

This year is on track to set new records for utility-scale storage, with a 22% YoY anticipated growth rate. However, political uncertainty is likely to dampen progress in 2026, with the utility-scale segment expected to decline by 29% compared to 2025.

Throughout Q1 and Q2, fluctuating tariff rates have restricted battery procurement from China. Unless there are changes to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) or Section 45X, the market is forecast to rebound in 2028 and 2029.

Over the next five years, cumulative installations are expected to match earlier projections despite short-term volatility. Long-term demand is driven by strong interest in renewables from hyperscalers, capacity constraints in independent system operators, and state-level targets.

The residential storage market is set to expand by 45% in 2025. This growth will be supported by stabilized tariffs, continued price declines, and program expansions. The net billing transition in select regions will also contribute to higher adoption rates.

Growth in the CCI segment remains limited. Lower-than-expected uptake in California, along with ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs and policy measures, has slowed momentum. The segment continues to face difficulties due to the complexity of applications and weak project economics. Any further reduction in tax credit availability could place additional pressure on its growth trajectory.

House Reconciliation Bill Impact

Provisions in the House reconciliation bill are expected to impact the energy storage sector. The projected range of possible outcomes over the next five years spans a 29.5 GW difference between the high and low scenarios.

In the high case, an additional 8 GW of storage capacity would be deployed over the next five years. This outlook assumes that federal clean energy tax credits remain in place, no new tariffs are introduced under the Trump administration, and that renewables paired with storage are actively used to meet growing electricity demand. The high case also assumes improvements in financing conditions and fewer interconnection delays.

The low-case forecast predicts a 27% decline in total installations from 2025 through 2029. This scenario assumes that the reconciliation bill passes in its final form in the House of Representatives. Under these conditions, projects would be required to begin construction within sixty days of the bill’s passage and be operational by the end of 2028.

The sudden end of the ITC would lead to widespread cancellations as developers struggle to qualify and financial institutions grow increasingly risk-averse. The low case also expects continued trade friction between the U.S. and China, with tariffs remaining volatile through 2026. These conditions would likely drive up system prices and create further procurement delays. For the residential sector, the assumption is that the tax credit under Section 25D would expire after 2025, including for leased systems.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Standard-Mercom-17.jpg,N,,2025-06-27 04:02:05.933750

The Japanese automaker's 50.6% electrified vehicle mix in North America and 78% in Europe underscore a strategic pivot that isn't just about keeping up with trends—it's about owning them.

The Electrification Tipping Point

Toyota's Q1 results are a masterclass in market adaptation. In North America, electrified vehicles surged 39.6% in volume, with hybrids like the Camry and Corolla leading the charge. The bZ4X saw a staggering 195.7% sales jump, while the RAV4 PHEV targets a 20% slice of U.S. sales by 2030. Even Lexus, traditionally a luxury holdout, now derives 95% of European sales from hybrids/PHEVs, with the RX PHEV up 88.3%.

This isn't just growth—it's a multi-pathway strategy that avoids overcommitting to battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), which remain niche due to cost, range anxiety, and charging infrastructure gaps. While Tesla dominates BEV headlines, Toyota's hybrid dominance taps into 40% of global electrified vehicle sales, a category that includes hybrids, PHEVs, and BEVs.

Toyota's (TM) steady rise contrasts with Tesla's (TSLA) volatility, while Ford's (F) hybrid/PHEV push lags behind Toyota's scale.

Supply Chain Resilience as a Competitive Moat

Toyota's ability to deliver amid global disruptions is equally critical. In Europe, where the market shrank 2%, Toyota's sales rose 0.4%, thanks to inventory management and a diversified supply chain. Key models like the Yaris Cross and Lexus NX stayed in stock when competitors faced shortages. This resilience isn't luck—it's the result of decades of just-in-time manufacturing expertise and regionalized production hubs.

Competitors like GM and Volkswagen still grapple with semiconductor shortages and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, Toyota's 32 electrified models—the most in the industry—allow it to pivot smoothly between regions and regulatory demands. In the U.S., hybrids now account for 21.2% of sales, a figure Toyota aims to push higher with PHEV-focused models.

The Structural Tailwinds

Consumer Demand for Pragmatism: Hybrids offer lower upfront costs, better resale value, and no range anxiety. Toyota's “multi-pathway” approach caters to this reality, avoiding the all-or-nothing BEV bet.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Governments from California to Europe push electrification without mandating BEVs exclusively. Toyota's hybrid portfolio meets these standards while minimizing battery-metal dependency.

Scalability: With $17 billion allocated to electrification R&D by 2025, Toyota is doubling down on both battery tech and hydrogen fuel cells. Its new $3.4 billion battery plant in North Carolina ensures cost control.

Risks on the Horizon

PHEV Cost Pressures: Lithium and cobalt prices could squeeze margins unless vertically integrated.

BEV Market Share Wars: Tesla's 43.5% U.S. EV market share and China's BYD (with 2.5M global hybrids in 2024) pose threats.

Trade Barriers: U.S. subsidies favoring local BEV producers could tilt the playing field.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dominance

Toyota's Q1 results are a buy signal for long-term investors. Its hybrid-led strategy mitigates BEV risks while capitalizing on the $580 billion global hybrid market's growth trajectory. Even in BEVs, Toyota's gradual rollout (e.g., bZ4X) avoids overexposure to volatile battery markets.

Recommendation:

- Hold Toyota for 3-5 years as hybrids/PHEVs remain mainstream.

- Watch for U.S. PHEV adoption: A 20% sales target by 2030 could be conservative if oil prices spike.

- Beware near-term volatility: Short squeezes on BEV stocks may temporarily overshadow Toyota's fundamentals.

In a sector where many automakers are all-in on BEVs, Toyota's hybrid dominance is a low-risk, high-reward bet. The company isn't just keeping up—it's setting the pace for the next decade of automotive innovation.",,N,,2025-06-27 10:08:38.692376
